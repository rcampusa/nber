The Catastrophic Effects of Natural Disasters on Insurance Markets

                                             ABSTRACT

Natural catastrophes often have catastrophic risks on insurance companies as well as on the insured.
Using a very large dataset on homeowners’ insurance coverage by state, by firm, and by year for the
1984 to 2004 period, this paper documents the positive effect on losses and loss ratios of both
unexpected catastrophes as well as large events that the authors term “blockbuster catastrophes.”
Insurers adapt to these catastrophic risks by raising insurance rates, leading to lower loss ratios after
the catastrophic event. There is a widespread event of unexpected catastrophes and blockbuster
catastrophes that reduces total premiums earned in the state, reduces the total number writing
insurance coverage in the state, and leads to the exit of firms from the state. Firms with low levels
of homeowners’ premiums are most adversely affected by the catastrophes.

         In conventional insurance markets, such as for automobile insurance, the insurer faces a

large number of independent risks that tend to follow a fairly predictable pattern across time. By

charging premiums that the firm can invest and earn a return on before paying off the losses, the

firm will be able to run a profitable insurance business.

         Catastrophic losses caused by natural disasters are much more problematic from an

insurance standpoint. Rather than a large number of risks that on average follow a quite

predictable year-to-year pattern, catastrophic losses tend to be lumpy. In fact, the situation

parallels that in an automobile insurance case in which there is not a large number of

independent trials but rather a single draw for highly correlated risks so that either every auto or

no autos are involved in an accident that year.

         Catastrophic risks consequently pose a variety of problems for insurers. First, because

the losses arise from a small number of lumpy events, the insurer may not have sufficient

resources to cover the losses. Less dramatically, the firm may suffer losses well in excess of the

value of the premiums that it charged for the coverage. In the absence of adequate reinsurance,

the firm may go bankrupt or may choose to exit a state in which there is a substantial exposure to

such catastrophic risks. In response to losses incurred following Hurricane Katrina, which

accounted for over $38 billion in insured losses last year, one major insurer, Allstate, has exited

several coastal states while another, State Farm, has chosen not to renew some policies in these

areas.1 The fourth-largest personal insurer in Florida, Poe Financial, went bankrupt.2

         The second ramification of catastrophic losses is that they will influence the rate structure

even for firms that remain quite viable in the presence of natural disasters. Suppose that an

insurer is writing coverage in a very high-risk state that experiences a major disaster once every

 Ibid. More specifically, the article concluded: “In April Poe Financial, Florida’s fourth-largest personal insurer,
collapsed, leaving 316,000 policyholders in need of coverage.”

decade. In that disaster year, the firm will suffer losses well in excess of premiums. For it to be

profitable for the insurer to write coverage in the state, it will consequently have to charge more

for insurance in the other years in which there are no catastrophes than it would if there were not

the threat of catastrophic risks. Thus, one would expect to observe very high loss ratios in the

catastrophic risk states in years in which a catastrophe has occurred and expect especially low

loss ratios in the non-catastrophe years as compared to the loss ratios in states not subject to such

catastrophic risks.

         A third phenomenon linked to natural disasters is that of learning about the risks over

time. The distribution of losses due to catastrophes may change over time for a variety of

reasons. Locational patterns may have shifted over time, as reflected in increased construction in

high-risk beach front locales. There also may be shifts in weather patterns, as evidenced in the

recent speculation that catastrophic losses from Hurricane Katrina are likely to increase in the

presence of global warming. The hurricane season in the period 1995-2005 averaged 15 named

storms per year, up from an average of 8.5 named storms from 1971-1994.3 To the extent that

insurers are rational Bayesian decision makers, one would expect them to update their risk

beliefs over time when writing insurance coverage.

         Somewhat surprisingly, there is no econometric analysis whatsoever that addresses these

and other fundamental aspects of how catastrophic risks affect insurance markets. There have, of

course, been extensive discussions of a conceptual nature as well as analyses of the potential role

of reinsurance, but there has been no empirical examination of how catastrophic risks affect

insurance company behavior.4

        This paper will provide a detailed empirical examination of how catastrophic risks affect

the performance of the market for homeowners’ insurance. The dataset that we use is

unprecedented in the homeowners’ insurance literature in terms of its level of detail. In

particular, we use information on losses and premiums by firm and by state over a 21-year period

from 1984 to 2004. This quite-comprehensive dataset enables us to analyze the effect of

catastrophic events of differing magnitude and to explore the effects over time in how these

catastrophic events affected insurance company behavior in subsequent years.

        Section 1 provides some background information regarding catastrophic events arising

from natural disasters. That there might be hurricanes in Florida and tornadoes in the Midwest

should not take insurance companies entirely by surprise. Thus, we calculate the average

number of catastrophic events by state, where the number of such events is typically not great,

but they are not extremely rare events either. That section also explores what we term

“blockbuster” catastrophes, which are the twenty most costly natural catastrophes that occurred

from 1984 to 2004. These blockbuster events may have particularly dire consequences for

insurance companies to the extent that these very large losses were not anticipated.

        After reviewing the data sources and the variables used in our analysis in Section 2, in

Section 3 we estimate the effect of catastrophic risks on loss ratios, the losses incurred by the

insurer, and the premiums earned by the insurer. This analysis will indicate that insurers do in

fact suffer catastrophic losses in response to catastrophic events, but that they also respond by

altering their premium structure in the non-catastrophe years.

        In Section 4 of the article, we examine the effects of these catastrophic risks on the size

of the market in any given state. Do natural disasters lead firms to exit the market, and what is

their effect on the total number of firms writing insurance coverage in the state? Are some firms

particularly vulnerable to the risks of catastrophes, and what are the characteristics of these firms

that are most at risk? Section 5 concludes the paper.



1. Catastrophic Events

       The focus of our empirical analysis is on a series of measures of catastrophic events. We

analyze the period from 1984 to 2004, which is the 21-year span covered by our dataset on

homeowners’ insurance that will be the reference point for our empirical analysis. The

catastrophic events were compiled from Swiss Re Sigma Reports dating from 1985 to 2005.

These Swiss Re figures were in turn based on data from the Property Claims Service (PCS),

which is a division of the Insurance Services Office (ISO). The PCS currently defines

catastrophes as “events that cause $25 million or more in direct insured losses to property that

affect a significant number of policy holders and insurers.”

       We restrict the definition of catastrophes to natural catastrophes; that is, events which are

caused by natural forces. Thus, for example, the consequences of terrorism attacks are not

included. Because our concern is with homeowners’ exposure, we exclude those natural

catastrophes which are more likely to have an impact on commercial lines. Specifically, we

account for floods, storms, fires, and earthquakes, but we do not include drought and cold waves.

We also do not include man-made disasters, such as aviation accidents and explosions, because

most of these disasters involve commercial exposures or affect only a very limited space. These

events also likely involve only a small number of insurance policies as well.

       Our accounting for catastrophic events consequently relies on the selection criteria used

by Swiss Re. The threshold for losses included in the Sigma Reports is adjusted annually to




                                                  5
account for inflation in the United States so that our annual tally of catastrophic events over the

two-decade period is in comparable inflation-adjusted terms.

         Figure 1 summarizes the number of catastrophic events by year for the 1984 to 2004

period. Although catastrophes are not as frequent as, for example, automobile accidents, they are

not extremely rare events. In 1996, there were over 200 state-level catastrophic events that met

the damages threshold.5 Moreover, in just over half of the years shown in the figure, there were

more than 100 catastrophic events throughout the country. Note that there was also an upward

trend in the number of catastrophic events over time. This trend suggests that either there is

increased vulnerability to catastrophic events, or that the underlying climatic conditions

generating these events now pose a greater risk than they did two decades ago.

         The frequency of these catastrophic events varies considerably across different states.

Table 1 summarizes the average number of catastrophic events per year for each of these states.

The 21-year period for the analysis provides a reliable long-term perspective on the frequency of

these risks and is much more informative than, for example, focusing on the results of a single

year. Even comparatively safe states, such as Alaska and Hawaii, experience 0.14 catastrophic

events per year. Put somewhat differently, these states experienced three catastrophic events

over the 21-year period shown in the table.

         At the high end of the spectrum is the state of Texas, which averages 7.43 catastrophic

events annually. This figure translates into a total of 156 natural disasters over the 21-year

period, as Texas is very vulnerable to tropical storms as well as tornadoes.

         Insurance companies should have a general sense of the average frequency of

catastrophic events by state, such as these statistics in Table 1. Thus, the main concern for


5
 Since we focus on insurers’ state-level performance, we account for catastrophes at the state level. Thus, a
hurricane affecting three states is counted as three catastrophic events, once in each of the three states affected.


                                                            6
insurers as well as for subsequent empirical analysis will be the extent to which there is a

departure in the experience of a particular state from this longer-term average. If, for example,

Texas continued to have seven or eight catastrophic events every year and there was no variation

in this amount, then insurance pricing would be much more stable than if there was a pronounced

upward trend in the number of catastrophic events.

       The twenty most devastating of these natural catastrophes are those that we term

blockbuster catastrophes. Table 2 lists the twenty most costly natural catastrophes over the

1984-2004 period. Although the losses associated with Hurricane Katrina dwarf those for the

catastrophic events shown in Table 2, these disasters also were quite costly. The most costly of

the catastrophes was the 1992 Hurricane Andrew, which led to an insured loss of $21.5 billion.

The 1994 Northridge earthquake was not far behind, with a loss of $17.8 billion. Every one of

the twenty blockbuster catastrophes shown in Table 2 created a loss of $1.7 billion or more.

While these losses were often spread across several states, it is noteworthy that some states have

a prominent role in many of these events. Florida, for example, is represented in eleven of the

twenty blockbuster catastrophes.

       Our empirical conjecture is that the incidence of these blockbuster catastrophes will not

be fully anticipated by the insurers. As a consequence, we expect there to be a major effect of

blockbuster effects on insurance pricing as well as exit of insurance companies from the state.

Blockbuster events by their very nature should be unexpected in terms of their severity. There

consequently should be a twofold effect resulting from both a one-time major financial shock as

well as a longer-term effect as insurance companies revise their risk assessments for the coverage

that they are writing in these states that are susceptible to blockbuster catastrophes.




                                                  7
2. Data Sources

       The core database that we use for our empirical analysis consists of the state-level

homeowners’ insurance operations for all U.S. insurers from 1984 to 2004. We obtained the

direct premiums earned and losses incurred statistics from the State Pages of insurer’s annual

filings with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners for all insurers with positive

premiums in the homeowners’ line. This dataset is also the source of our information on total

premiums earned in a state, organizational form, and the number of states in which the insurer

writes homeowners’ coverage.

       The number of firm-state units in the dataset declines steadily through the time period

analyzed. Whereas there were 9,644 observations in 1984, by 2004 there were only 6,596 firm-

state units in the dataset. The number of unique firms in the sample ranges from a high of 1,103

in 1990 to a low of 961 in 2004. These figures suggest that firms offering homeowners’

coverage have consolidated their operations, electing to provide coverage in fewer and fewer

states over time, but not exiting the U.S. market.

       Our analysis links an insurer’s state-level homeowners’ experience to catastrophic events

in the state. The compilation of catastrophic events at the state level revealed that some states

are affected by catastrophes on a regular basis. Anticipated catastrophic events would be

reflected in premiums if insurers are rational. Likewise, insurer underwriting performance

should not be adversely affected by catastrophic events that are anticipated, but would be

adversely affected by a greater-than-anticipated number of events, and enhanced by a lower-

than-anticipated number of events. To capture this relationship, we create a variable by year and

by state called Unexpected Catastrophes. This variable is defined as the difference between the




                                                 8
number of actual catastrophic events in a given year and the average number of catastrophic

events in that state over the 1984-2004 period.

        The second set of catastrophic variables used are what we call Blockbuster Catastrophes.

This variable is the number of blockbuster catastrophe events from Table 2 that occurred in that

state in that particular year. While all catastrophic events were counted equally in the creation of

the Unexpected Catastrophes variable, we expect that these blockbuster catastrophes may have a

differential effect. Because these events have a more profound effect on insurers’ performance,

this variable equals the number of blockbuster catastrophic events in the state in which the

insurer operates for a given year.

        The next set of variables pertains to organizational form. We have separate variables to

distinguish whether the firm had a Mutual insurance structure, a Lloyds insurance structure, or

was a Reciprocal firm. The omitted category is that of stock firms.6

        We also included four variables that reflect the overall size of the insurance companies’

operations. The three national measures are the Number of States in which the insurer operates,

the Total Homeowners’ Premiums written by the insurance company throughout the country, and

the Total National Premiums written by the insurance company in all lines of insurance. We

also include Total Premiums in State as a measure of the scale of the firm’s operations within the

state. One would expect smaller firms to be more susceptible to shocks than larger firms.

Moreover, one would expect firms with a substantial presence in the state to be more reluctant to

leave the state after a catastrophic event because of the losses associated with other lines.

        The final variable we include is a 0-1 variable for Restrictive Rate Regulation. In these

states, the firm must obtain prior approval before changing its homeowners’ insurance rates. We

                                                         9
expect that a more restrictive state regulatory regime would hinder insurer’s ability to recover

financially following a catastrophic event.7

           A major concern in the literature on insurance is how premiums are adjusted over time in

response to fluctuations in interest rates. This phenomenon, which is known in the literature as

the underwriting cycle, is often captured in empirical analyses of insurance markets by including

some type of interest rate variable. Our subsequent regression analysis will be more general, in

that we include time-specific indicator variables for each year in the sample, thus sweeping out

all time-dependent influences such as interest rate fluctuations and temporal trends in the number

of firms writing homeowners insurance, as well as any other temporal effects.



3. Insurance Market Consequences of Catastrophes: Loss Ratios, Premiums, and Losses

           To explore the effects of catastrophic risks, we present a series of regression analyses of

the effect of these various variables on loss ratios, premiums, and losses. The loss ratio is the

first measure that we consider, which is the ratio of losses incurred divided by premiums earned.

The inverse of the loss ratio is the most widely accepted measure of insurance company

profitability.

           Figure 2 presents the loss ratio pattern for all homeowners’ insurers over the 1984-2004

period as well as the pattern for states that are particularly vulnerable to catastrophic risks:

Florida, California, and Texas. As one might expect, in these high-risk states, there are often

spikes in loss ratios that greatly exceed the loss ratios in the homeowners’ lines more generally.

However, in the years in which there are no big spikes, it is also noteworthy that in these high-

risk states, the loss ratios are very low. Indeed, for the states of Florida, California, and Texas, in

most years of the last decade, shown in Figure 2, the loss ratios in these states are substantially

below the average loss ratios for homeowners’ insurance generally. Our hypothesis is that

insurers that experience these catastrophic losses and blockbuster events will adjust their pricing

practices so that the insurance they write in the years in which catastrophic events do not occur

will be more profitable than insurance written in states not subject to a large number of

catastrophes. This additional profitability is needed to compensate for the increased losses that

these firms experience during the years in which major catastrophes occur.

        Table 3 presents the regression of the natural logarithm of loss ratio on the series of

explanatory variables. Specifically, we estimate:

LossRatio ist = α 1 + β 1 UnexpCat ist + β 2 UnexpCat is ,t −1 + β 3 UnexpCat is ,t −2               (1)
                 + β 4 Blockbusterist + β 5 Blockbusteris ,t −1 + β 6 Blockbusteris ,t − 2

                                       20
                + β 14 RateReg ist +          Yi + ε 1 t .
                                       j =1



for firm i in state s at time t, and where Yj is a dummy variable for each year j=1985-2004. The

main hypotheses are that unexpected catastrophes and blockbuster catastrophes should

substantially boost the loss ratios that firms experience in the catastrophe years and lower loss

ratios in the non-catastrophe years.

        This basic set of predictions is in fact borne out in the results in Table 3. There is the

expected positive effect of the current value of the catastrophe variable as well as the value

lagged one year. Notably, two years after the unexpected catastrophe, there is a negative effect

that is roughly the same size as the estimated standard error. Thus, the Unexpected Catastrophe

variable lagged two years is consistent with our pricing hypothesis, but there is no statistically

significant evidence of such an effect.




                                                             11
       The subsequent loss ratio offset is more pronounced for blockbuster catastrophes. The

effect of blockbuster catastrophes is to boost the loss ratio during the year of the blockbuster

catastrophe, but there is an opposite and almost offsetting effect two years later. This result is

consistent with our hypothesis that after a blockbuster event, firms will raise their insurance

premiums in order to provide sufficient coverage in case of future blockbuster catastrophes.

These premium adjustments lead to lower future loss ratios during the years in which a

blockbuster catastrophe does not strike. The evidence for such adjustments is much stronger for

blockbuster catastrophes than for catastrophes more generally.

       Table 4 presents the regression of the log of premiums earned against our set of

explanatory variables. Specifically,

LnHOPrems ist =         1    +     1   LnHOPrems is,t −1 +            2   Un exp Cat ist +          3   Un exp Cat is,t −1                 (2)
                +       4   Un exp Cat is,t − 2 +          5   Blockbusterist +            6   Blockbusteris,t −1
                    +       7   Blockbusteris,t − 2 +          8   Mutual i +        9   Lloyds i +         10   Re ciprocal i
                    +       11   LnNumsts it +        12   RateReg st +         13   LnStatePrems ist +               14   LnNatPrems it

                    +           δ jY j +    ist   .
                        j =1




       Premiums reflect both the price of insurance as well as the quantity of insurance, so in

many respects are a less instructive measure than the loss ratio, which serves as an ex-post

measure of insurer profitability. We include a measure of the one-period-lagged homeowners’

premiums in the analysis as well to capture the fact that there is a strong autoregressive character

to insurance underwriting, as firms that write a large number of premiums in the state in a given

year will tend to continue to do so in subsequent years. Indeed, the elasticity of premiums

earned to homeowners’ premiums earned in the previous year is 0.973.




                                                                       12
       Catastrophic events have a mixed effect on insurance premiums. One would expect these

unexpected catastrophes or blockbuster events to raise the rate that firms charge for insurance.

Thus, for any given number of policies written, the total premiums will rise. However, these

major catastrophes also may reduce the quantity of insurance written, both because of the higher

rates and insurance rationing, as well as exiting of firms from the state.

       The regression results in Table 4 indicate that the negative quantity effect is dominant.

Unexpected catastrophes have a negative effect on premiums earned, both in the year of the

catastrophe as well as in the subsequent year. Similarly, the blockbuster catastrophes are

influential as well with a significant negative effect both in the current year as well as two years

after the catastrophic event.

       The most easily predictable results are those pertaining to losses incurred. These major

catastrophes should clearly boost the losses incurred by the insurance company, controlling for

the scale of the company’s operations, which we do by including the lagged value of the

homeowners’ premiums written by the company in that state. We estimate:



LnHOLosses ist =        1    +     1   LnHOPrems is,t −1 +         2   UnexpCat ist +        3   UnexpCat is,t −1                   (3)

The results, shown in Table 5, suggest that unexpected catastrophes raise the value of losses

incurred, both in the year of the catastrophe as well as in the subsequent year. About three-




                                                                   13
fourths of the influence occurs in the current year, with the remainder occurring with a one-

period lag.

       Blockbuster catastrophes raise the value of losses in the year of the catastrophe, but two

years later reduce the value of losses. This effect of reducing losses two years after a catastrophe

would be expected, to the extent that the blockbuster event leads to either a reduced quantity of

insurance written or the exit of the firm from the state insurance market altogether.



4. Effect of Catastrophes on Insurance Firms’ Exit from the State

       The negative effect of catastrophic events on premiums suggests that firms have adapted

to catastrophic events either by reducing the amount of coverage they write or by exiting the

state altogether. In this section we will explore the effect of catastrophes on exit in two ways.

First, we will examine the effect of catastrophes on the number of firms writing homeowners’

insurance coverage in the state. Second, we will explore what determines a firm’s exit from the

state and how catastrophes affect these exit decisions.

       If catastrophes were fully anticipated by companies, then we would not expect there to be

a substantial effect on the exit of firms. Catastrophes would not lead firms to revise their

assessments of the risks of writing future homeowners’ insurance coverage in the state. The

catastrophic event would function as a fixed cost, so that if it was optimal to write insurance

coverage previously in the state then it will continue to be profitable to do so. Because the risks

were fully anticipated, the premiums will have been set in a manner so that in the long run, the

insurer will earn sufficient profits to make writing coverage desirable. If, however, the risks

were not fully anticipated and catastrophic events lead firms to revise their assessments of the




                                                 14
future hazards, then the expectation is that firms will choose either to raise their rates or to exit

the state.8

         In addition to the effect of catastrophic events on insurance firms’ expectations of future

losses, there is the additional problem that major catastrophes may generate losses that either

bankrupt the firm or lead it to exit the state if the firm did not have adequate reinsurance to cover

these risks. In terms of an empirical prediction, these effects of catastrophic losses should be

greatest for firms with the fewest available resources.

         We estimate two equations to assess the effects of catastrophes on the number of firms in

the state, where the dependent variable in the number of firms in the state. First, we estimate:

NumFirms st =        1   +   1   StateLR s,t −1 +     2   StateLR s ,t − 2 +      3   UnexpCat s,t −1               (4)
                +    4   UnexpCat s,t − 2 +     5   Blockbuster s,t −1 +          6   Blockbusters,t − 2
                                                                    20
                +    7 RateReg st + β 8 HOPrems st +                       δ j Y jt +    st   .
                                                                    j =1




         The results of estimating equation 4 are presented in the first column of Table 6. The

first set of variables is the state homeowners’ loss ratio lagged one year and lagged two years.

Neither measure is found to have a significant effect on a number of firms in the state. The

profitability of insurance per se consequently is not influential.

         The next sets of variables pertained to the influence of unexpected catastrophes and

blockbuster catastrophes in the state, in the previous year and two years earlier. Unexpected

catastrophes did not have a significant effect on the number of firms writing homeowners’

insurance in the state; however, blockbuster catastrophes do have an influence. The significant

effect occurs with a one-period lag, as the occurrence of a blockbuster catastrophe event reduces
8
  While insurers may voluntarily leave a state, a catastrophe could also force them to exit the market if they have
become insolvent. We did not investigate the reason for exit, but note the collapse of at least one large personal lines
insurer in Florida following hurricane Katrina. (“The Price of Sunshine,” The Economist, June 8, 2006, p. 79).


                                                                  15
the number of firms writing homeowners’ insurance coverage by 11. Thus, much of the

reduction in premiums following blockbuster catastrophes stems from a net decrease in the

number of firms writing insurance in that state.

       Two state characteristic variables included in the first column in Table 6 are for

restrictive rate regulation, which reduces the number of firms writing coverage, and the total

level of state homeowners’ premiums, which, as one might expect, is positively correlated to the

number of homes in the state.

       The second column in Table 6 explores the influence of possible interactive effects of the

regulatory regime with the effect of the blockbuster catastrophe variables. We estimate equation

4 again, this time including two interaction terms. We find that there is a negative effect on

market size of blockbuster catastrophes with both a one-period lag and a two-period lag. Thus,

the combined effect is to reduce the number of firms writing homeowners’ insurance by 22

firms, where this result pertains to states that do not have restrictive regulation. If, however,

there is a restrictive regulatory regime, as is modeled by the two interactions of Restrictive

Regulation with the two lagged Blockbuster Catastrophe variables, then this effect is

substantially reduced. The statistically significant interaction for the two-period lag of

blockbuster catastrophes with the restrictive rate regulation variable increases the number of

firms writing insurance by 19, which offsets most of the influence of the two statistically

significant blockbuster catastrophe variables. Although the mechanism for this influence is not

clear, what may be at work is that in states with restrictive rate regulation, firms are reluctant to

exit the homeowners’ insurance market in the state because doing so may jeopardize a firm’s

ability to write coverage in other insurance lines.




                                                   16
        Whereas the estimates in Table 6 focused on the net effect of exit and entry into the

homeowners’ insurance market, in Table 7 we will restrict the focus to the probability of exit. In

particular, we estimate using a probit analysis:

Pr( Exit )ist = α 1 + β 1 UnexpCat ist + β 2 UnexpCat is ,t −1 + β 3 UnexpCat is ,t −2                (5)
                + β 4 Blockbusterist + β 5 Blockbusteris ,t −1 + β 6 Blockbusteris ,t − 2
                + β 7 Mutual i + β 8 Lloyds i + β 9 Reciprocal i
                + β 10 LnNumsts it + + β 11 RateReg ist + β 7 LnNatPrems it +β 8 LnStatePrems ist
                    20
                +          Yi + ε 1 t .
                    j =1




As with the earlier results, the first column in Table 7 includes a parsimonious set of explanatory

variables, and we include a variety of interactive effects in the second column.

        The three unexpected catastrophe variables each have a positive and statistically

significant effect on the probability of exit. The combined influence of these variables is that an

increase in the number of unexpected catastrophes by 1 increases the probability of exit for the

average firm in the state by 0.125.

        Whether the catastrophe is a blockbuster catastrophe does not appear to be as influential.

The negative effect of the contemporaneous blockbuster catastrophe variable is offset by the

positive effect after a two-year lag, so that on balance, there is no net effect of the blockbuster

catastrophes above and beyond the influence of the unexpected catastrophe variable.

        The next three variables all pertain to different measures of the scale of the firm’s

operations. The first of the scale variables is the total national homeowners’ premiums earned.

One might expect that large firms would have greater resources, which would diminish their

incentive to exit. An effect in the opposite direction is that with substantial homeowners’

insurance sales in other states, such large firms can redirect their efforts to more profitable



                                                      17
markets. The net effect is positive, as firms with total national homeowners’ premiums earned

that are larger are more likely to exit the state.

        If, however, the firm has a substantial stake in writing insurance in the state, the level of

the state homeowners’ insurance premiums earned will be high and the firm will be more

reluctant to give up that market, as is indicated by the negative effect of that state total

homeowners’ premiums earned variable. The number of states in which the insurer operates has

a negative effect on exit, so that while writing a large level of homeowners’ premiums increases

the probability of exit, when these premiums are spread across a large number of markets the

incentive to exit is reduced.

        The final variables indicate that firms with a mutual, reciprocal, or Lloyd’s structure each

have a lower probability of exit. Restrictive state rate regulation increases the probability of exit.

        Many of these variables are of interest with respect to how they interact with the presence

of the catastrophe. Thus, the level of state homeowners’ premiums earned or the level of

national premiums earned will affect the nature of the firm’s response to a catastrophic event.

        The second column of Table 7 includes a large number of these interactions. Even in the

presence of these interactive effects, both the contemporaneous and the two-period lag

unexpected catastrophes variable have a positive and statistically significant effect on the

probability of exit.

        The final variables included in this equation are a series of six interactions of unexpected

catastrophes. Consider first the interactions with total national homeowners’ premiums earned.

That interaction has a significant negative effect in the year of the catastrophe, a significant

positive effect with a one-period lag, and a significant positive effect with a two-period lag. The

net effect of these influences is positive. Firms with a high level of total national homeowners’




                                                     18
premiums earned will be more likely to exit the state following a catastrophe. These are the

firms with larger potential markets outside the state to which they could direct their efforts.

       Consider next the three interactions with the state local homeowners’ premiums earned.

This interaction is negative in the year of the catastrophe, statistically insignificant with a one-

period lag, and negative and significant with a two-period lag. Firms with a large level of state

homeowners’ premiums earned are less likely to leave the state following a catastrophe. These

are the firms that have a substantial investment in insurance operations in the state so that the

opportunity cost of leaving is greater.



5. Conclusion

       Following natural disasters, there are typically very large losses suffered by individual

homeowners. These victims of catastrophes, as well as consumer advocates, frequently assume

that the challenge that insurers face in dealing with catastrophes should not be great. That, after

all, is the purpose of insurance—to provide coverage after such adverse events. Moreover, if the

risks involved are quite large, then one would expect these firms to obtain reinsurance coverage

to address these hazards.

       The analysis here indicates that catastrophic risks pose considerable problems for the

insurance industry, just as they do for individual homeowners. To analyze the effect of

catastrophes, we used an extremely large dataset that consisted of every firm by state by year

writing homeowners’ insurance coverage in the United States from 1984 to 2004. Because this

is the first such examination of the effect of catastrophes using micro data on any major

insurance market, it provides a unique perspective on how firms respond to these major natural

catastrophes.




                                                  19
         The evidence is consistent with insurers not fully anticipating catastrophes and being hit

particularly hard by the major catastrophes that we term blockbuster catastrophes. Almost every

phase of insurance operations is affected by the catastrophic risk. It is not surprising that both

the losses incurred and loss ratios each rise in response to catastrophic events. What is

interesting is that these natural disasters lead firms to alter their subsequent insurance rates, so

that the loss ratios in the non-catastrophe years following a catastrophe are lower than they were

before. In effect, the firms have updated the assessed risks of a catastrophe and addressed the

rates that they charge to make writing insurance profitable in the presence of increased assessed

risks.

         The perhaps more troubling effects pertain to the effect on insurance activities more

generally. Catastrophic risks reduce the total premiums earned in the state, which is not a

reflection of lower rates, but rather a reflection of reduced amounts of insurance coverage that

people purchase. One would expect the quantity of coverage to decline as the price of insurance

rises, but the results indicate that more than this influence is at work. Catastrophes lead to a

reduction in the net number of firms writing insurance coverage in the state as well as an

increase in the probability of exit from the state. As one would expect, these effects are greatest

for the firms that are least able to withstand the major financial shock of a catastrophic event.

Particularly for these firms, the natural disaster is a catastrophic event for the insurer as well as

for the homeowner who has suffered the catastrophe.9

  The result that catastrophic events pose problems to the insurance industry is well known to the industry as well.
Many of the concerns have focused on the effect of catastrophic risks on the affordability and availability of
insurance in the homeowners’ market. See Insurance Services Office (1996). More recently, see the commentary
by the Insurance Information Institute (2006), which gives an update of the insurance industry concerns relating to
Hurricane Katrina.
