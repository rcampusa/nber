              INTERACTIONS BETWEEN DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN INVESTMENT

                                    ABSTRACT


        This paper examines the domestic and foreign fixed investment expenditures

of a sample of U.S. multinational firms to explain empirically each type of

investment and to determine whether there are significant interactions between

them.

        Models exhibiting two types of interactions, one, financial and the other,

production-based, are explored theoretically and empirically. The financial

interaction is the result of a model which assumes a risk of bankruptcy and its

associated costs; under these circumstances, the firm faces an increasing cost

of capital as a function of its debt/equity ratio. Domestic and foreign invest-

ment are interdependent, since, in competing for finance, each affects the cost

of capital in the other location. Production interactions can arise when, because

of start-up costs or other factors that produce nonlinear cost functions, it

may become profitable to shift production from the home to the foreign     location.

        The hypotheses are tested on data covering the domestic and foreign opera-

tions of seven multinational firms for a period of 16 to 20 years. The firm-

level investment functions fit reasonably well for both domestic and foreign

expenditures; an interdependence between domestic and foreign investment was

confirmed frequently through the finance side, but only once via production.

                            I. Introductthn

        Rarely do studies or discussions of U.S. investment spending

consider the fact that many U.S. firms are multinationals --   doing
business in a number of countries simultaneously. This is so despite the

fact that fixed investment expenditures abroad by U.S. multinationals

reached over 35 percent of their domestic expenditures in 1977, and more

than 20 percent of total domestic nonresidential private fixed capital

formation.2

         The purpose of this paper is to study both the domestic and

foreign fixed investment expnditures of a sample of U.S. multinationals.

In addition to explaining empirically each typeof expenditure, we are

particularly interested in determining whether there are significant

interactions between investment expenditures in the different locations.

         Earlier work in this area by Stevens (1969) and Severn (1972)

found significant evidence of interactions between domestic and foreign

investment. However, both studies were hampered by short time series and

data limitations. The first problem necessitated reliance on cross-

section regressions and the second frequently required the calculation of

important variables as residuals (domestic investment, for example).

         The present study attempts to augment and improve upon its

predecessors by making theoretical improvements in the investment

functions to be fitted, and by utilizing a unique sample of more current

data. Permission to use data on the foreign and domestic operations of a

sample of manufacturing firms gathered by the McGraw-Hill Company, under

conditions that preserved the confidentiality of the data, allowed us to

construct time-series for seven firms that spanned from sixteen to more

than twenty years. Thus, for the first time, regressions are available

for individual firms, covering a time-period starting in 1960 and

continuing to the late 1970s.



            II. Types of Interaction and the Evidence to Date

         The degree and type of interaction one expects between domestic

and foreign investment depends on the multinational firm's objective

function and the constraints imposed upon it by financial markets and its

production process. Concerning the former, it is possible to conceive of

firms that so segregate and isolate their foreign operations that there

can be no effect whatsoever of foreign operations on domestic. Statements

or hypotheses such as "every tub on its own bottom" imply that foreign
                                  -3-

operations interact minimally with domestic. On the other hand, a more

contemporary view of the multinational firm   as   an integrated, worldwide

profit maximizing entity allows much more scope for interdependence. The

important implication of interdependence or interaction is that variables

related to one location will affect decisions in the others. Thus, for

example, with interdependence a wholly new set of variables will appear

in domestic investment functions, variables related to the firm's foreign

operations.

         Even if the multinational firm maximizes worldwide profits,

certain further conditions must be fulfilled before interdependence, as

defined above, occurs. Consider, for example, the case of a multinational

facing a perfect market for finance and producing in two plants, one at

home and one abroad, each of which is totally independent of the other in

terms of inputs and outputs. In such a case, by definition there can be

no interaction through the production side; moreover, the perfect

financial market implies that the firm can raise unlimited amounts of

capital at a constant rate of interest. Under such conditions it is

intuitively clear, and can be easily proved [Stevens (1969)], that

worldwide profit maximization implies no interdependence between domestic

and foreign investment.

         Relax any of the above stringent assumptions, however, and

interdependence will occur. Suppose, for example, that because of the

possibility of bankruptcy and the existence of costs associated with this

state, the firm faces an increasing cost of capital - -   say   as a function

of its debt/equity ratio. In this case, an increase in investment in

either location will, ceteris paribus, raise the cost of capital for

investment in the other location; thus the two decisions will be
                                   -4-

interdependent. Since our data are particularly useful for testing for

this sort of interaction, the relevant theory and empirical tests are

developed at some length in succeeding sections. Severn and Stevens based

their tests for interdependence on similar financial interactions,

finding for their sample periods cons..derable evidence of domestic

variables (domestic output and cash flow) affecting foreign investment,

and some evidence of foreign variables affecting domestic investment.

         While interactions through the financial side are the ones we

will emphasize, there are others that can operate through the production

side. A number of quite different possibilities exist. If the domestic

location produces components that are used as inputs to the foreign

subsidiary's production operation, an increase in foreign demand will

also increase demand for the domestically-produced component, thereby

inducing domestic investment. On the other hand, if the increase in

foreign demand is so large that it permits, or makes economical, a shift

from assembly to complete production abroad, it could lead to a decline

in the production of components at home and therefore to lower domestic

investment. We attempt to test for these types of interaction, although

our data are not well suited for the task; despite the availability of

foreign and domestic sales, we have no data on an individual firm's

production or costs in different locations, nor on exports from one

location to another.



                       III. Theoretical Develotinents

         In this section we attempt to develop theoretically two types of

model that lead to interdependence between domestic and foreign

investment. The most effort will go toward deducing the implications of a
                                     -5-

worldwide profit maximization model where the firm is subject to an

increasing cost of debt as a function of the debt/equity ratio. A second

model, that can be combined with the first, looks at the factors that are

related to the switch-over of production from domestic plants to foreign

subsidiaries.

         Stevens (1969) developed a rudimentary model of investment

interaction caused by a financial constraint. Because of the theoretical

difficulties, the model excluded the possibility of debt finance,

assuming that total investment was limited to the multinational firm's

internally generated funds - -   retained   earnings plus depreciation.

Moreover, the dividend decision was not integrated into the analysis, so

the model never handled the intemporal aspects of profit maximization. In

a recent paper, Stevens (1986) developed, in the context of a single

location firm, a model that eliminated the drawbacks of the earlier

model. In this section this latter model will be generalized to a

multilocation firm which maximizes an appropriately discounted sum of

worldwide profits, solving for the optimal paths of investment in each

location and for overall debt and dividends. Because of the increasing

cost of debt, to be motivated below, the model exhibits interdependence

between domestic and foreign investment.

         In Stevens (1986) the increasing cost of debt is based on the

premise that lenders (as opposed to the firm's owners) foresee that

increases in the firm's debt/equity ratio raise the risk of

bankruptcy, and thus require a progressively higher interest rate as the

debt/equity ratio rises. In that article, where the firm operates in only

a single location, the firm's objective is to maximize the discounted

stream of dividends (DIV) paid to shareholders. That objective, when
                                    -6-

appropriate substitutions and linearizations are made using the firm's

cash flow identity, leads to the function appearing on the right hand

side of equation (1):




 5 etDIV(t)dt — 5 et{(lr)[aK -$K2-(p+D/qK)D -q6K] -qK +D)dt.             (1)




where: p — the firm's discount rate and the initial cost of debt
        r — the tax rate on corporate profits
        q — the price of capital goods
        6 — the depreciation rate of the capital stock
        K — the level of the real capital stock (the firm's only asset)
        D — the nominal value of the firm's debt
 a, fi,   — parameters related to the firm's demand curve
            and production function
     K, D — the rate of change of K and D respectively.


The quadratic function of K is a reduced form for the firm's total

revenues, assuming a downward sloping linear demand curve and linear

homogenous production function. The interest rate the firm pays on its

debt is (p+D/qK), an increasing function of the debt to total assets

ratio (directly related to the debt/equity ratio). Hereafter D/qK will

often be denoted by the symbol •.

         The firm's problem is to choose optimal paths of capital and

debt so as to maximize (I). New equity in excess of profits is excluded;

fixed investment must be financed by either debt or retained earnings.3

Using optimal control methods to maximize equation (1), two necessary

conditions must be satisfied -   - two   differential equations in the two

unknowns, K and D. The first equation is just a form of the firm's

none of the firms discussed below made stock flotations during the sample
period.

sources and uses of funds identity:


     qK    -   0 — (1    -
                             i-)[aK   -
                                          2
                                              - (p   +   )D    -
                                                                   q6K)   -   DIV.   (2)




The second necessary condition equates the marginal revenue product of

capital to the marginal cost of finance. For that form of the model

depicted in equation (1), the condition becomes:


                                                     2
     a -       2K   -
                        q8 —   q(p + 24'      -          or,   more familiarly,


                                                     2
     a    -
               2K       —q(p+6+2-4),                                                 (3)




where the term q(p+6) is the traditional neoclassical cost of capital.

               In Stevens (1986) it is shown that the two necessary conditions

lead to a particular type of investment function. For that part of the

optimal path of capital where there are no jumps in the exogenous

variables or parameters, the firm's investment can be represented as a

 stock adjustment process, with the rate of adjustment a variable function

 of the firm's internally generated cash flow. In this paper, however, we

 shall not rely on this derived investment function, which holds for only

 part of the optimal path, but on the identity (2) and the marginal

 conditions (3). Two types of empirical tests will be performed. First,

 we will test directly equation (3) and its variant for a multinational




  4. See Stevens (1986), pp. 7-11. In our simplified system, the left hand
 side of equation (2) is an expression for profits after taxes minus
 dividends, i.e. retained earnings. Since we assume that there are no
 flotations of equity, and no assets other than fixed capital, equation
 (2) states the identity that the value of asset changes equals the
 change in the value of debt plus retained earnings. This identity holds
 exclusive of capital gains.

firm. Since this equation contains two endogenous variables, simultaneous

equation methods must be used. Alternatively, we will use both equations

(2) and (3) and solve, at least approximately, for the optimal capital

stock and investment in each location as a function of strictly exogenous

variables.



Optimality Conditions for a Multinational Firm

            A multinational firm is distinguished from the firm described

above simply by the fact that it operates in more than one location.5 To

generalize the previous model in the simplest way, we assume that the

firm operates in two locations, one domestic (d) and one foreign (f),

with no production interdependencies.

            In this simplest of generalizations, operating profits in the

domestic location are as described above, with the addition of the

subscript, d:


                     2
                         -
        adKd -   dKd                                                        (4)


Foreign operating profits are written similarly, except that an exchange

rate (x) is needed to translate profits originally expressed in foreign

currency into dollars:



   X(clfKf -     flfKf]      -
                                 qSKf.                                  (5)




 5. Technically this definition does not distinguish a multinational
firm, which operates in more than one country, from a multi-locational
firm in a single country. One way to do this is to make at least one
location deal in a foreign currency. However, the major theoretical
distinction, for this article at least, is between a single and multi-
locational firm.
                                           -9.


In the above formulation the assumption is made, for expository

convenience, that capital goods are priced in dollars, independent of

exchange rate changes, at dollar price q. Similarly, without any

information to the contrary, we assume that the rate of depreciation, 6,

is the same for domestic and foreign operations.

          In addition to the above net revenues, the firm must pay

interest on its debt. Here we assume that firm has exactly the same

borrowing opportunities as in the original model; debt is raised for the

multinational firm       as   a whole at the same total cost as before: (p+4)D.

           The multinational firm's objective is to maximize an integral

similar to equation (1) -        - with   the addition of foreign operating

profits. An optimal path is chosen for debt and both domestic and foreign

capital. Three necessary conditions can be derived, a sources and uses of

funds identity that is a slight generalization of equation (2), and two

marginal conditions similar to equation (3):



       ad - 2fidKd    — q(p + 5 + 20 - $,2)                                         (6)
                                                 2
       X(Of -   2fKf)    —
                              q(p + 5 + 20 -                                        (7)




           The interdependence of domestic and foreign investment is

revealed by noting that the marginal revenue products in both locations

are equated to the same quantity on the right hand side of equations (6)

and (7) --      the   marginal cost of capital for the firm    as   a whole - -   and

that   this marginal cost of capital is an endogenous variable, a function

of the debt/assets ratio (i),         which, in turn, is affected by each change
in Kd or Kf. Equations (6) and (7), along with the associated

differential equation similar to (2), form a nonlinear system, since
                                   - 10   -




     and Kd appear in th denominator of •; hence it cannot be solved
Kf
directly. In testing empirically for interactions, we can try to solve a

linearized version of the system and test it directly, or we can test the

marginal conditions (6) and (7).



Foreign Investment Related to Extort DisDiacement

          The preceding theory deals exclusively with interdependence

through the firm's financial constraint. Another form of interdependence

that must at least be addressed in a study which hopes to explain the

behavior of foreign investment over time is investment that comes about

because a firm can produce goods in one location for sale in another.

During recent years this has usually meant that increasing shares of U.S.

firms' worldwide sales are produced in foreign subsidiaries. Such

investment reflects differences between markets in costs of production

and rates of growth of demand.

           In Appendix A we develop a model that lays out in a rough way

the major considerations that determine the amount of investment that is

caused by the shift of production facilities from one location to

another. Ideally, this part of the model should be integrated with the

preceding theory of financial interdependence. At present, because of the

nonlinearities involved, this is infeasible. Instead, as a first

approximation, the investment demand resulting from production shifts

will be added to the investment demand derived above.

           The two major considerations in a model explaining shifts in the

location of production are: (1) the determination of the optimal output

level at which it becomes cheaper to produce in a new location and the

change of this level through time; and (2) the determination through time
                                   - 11   -




of   the number of locations where it becomes profitable to shift from

exports from the United States to local production, and the quantity of

foreign sales associated with each such location.

           In the literature on the multinational firm it is typical to

describe a scenario where a parent firm first supplies a location via

exports and then, as the market size increases, gradually shifts over to

local production. Reasons to produce in the local area are the avoidance

of tariffs and nontariff barriers, transportation costs, the reduction of

labor costs, and the advantages of producing close to the market; reasons

against producing abroad are the possible loss of economies of scale, the

fixed Costs of setting up a new production facility in an unfamiliar

location, and the risks of dealing with foreign currencies and foreign

governments and institutions. In the appendix we describe a rudimentary

model that illustrates the determination of the optimal point of switch-

over given fixed set-up costs, differences in the price of labor, and the

existence of tariffs and transportation costs.

           Empirically, little can be done to estimate such switch-over

points accurately for a given firm; we have no information on the

distribution of the firm's output among different foreign locations and,

therefore, on the foreign costs and tariffs it faces; moreover, when we

go beyond the determination of the switch-over point, we have no

information on the distribution of sales among the firm's different

subsidiaries, and thus no knowledge concerning the magnitude of the

firm's foreign sales that are greater than or near the switch-over point.

Despite these extensive limitations, a rough measure of the foreign

investment caused by switch-overs is developed in Appendix A and then

tested. The variable is a function of the firm's aggregate foreign sales,
                                  - 12


their growth, and an estimate of the difference in the cost of production

between U.S. and foreign locations. It proves to be significantly related

to foreign investment for one of the seven firms.



                     IV. The SamDle and Sources of Data

         The key to testing hypotheses on interdependence is of course a

source of data that breaks down a multinational's activities into

domestic and foreign operations. Equations (6) and (7) alone show that

data are required for domestic and foreign capital stocks, demand side

variables (related to the a's) and, naturally, investment expenditures.

The equations also show the need for firmwide variables such as the

overall debt/assets ratio, •.   Later   the need for a number of other

variables such as prices, wage rates, and overall firm cash flow will be

noted.

         Through the cooperation of the McGraw-Hill Company we were able

to gain access, under conditions that protected confidentiality, to a

unique body of data that provided the breakdown we needed between foreign

and domestic sales, investment, and fixed assets. Since the 1950s, the

McGraw-Hill Company has gathered data on the domestic and foreign

 investment and operations of a large number of U.S. corporations.

Previously, Eisner (1978) studied extensively the domestic investment of

 this sample.

          For this paper we have chosen a sub-sample of seven of these

 firms that provided unbroken data series, or for which we could estimate

 such series from related ones, for a    period   of at least 15 years; for a

 nuaber of the firms the relevant series run for 20 years or more. We have

 confined our empirical work to such a small number of firms for several
                                     - 13   -




reasons. One   is   that since the McGraw-Hill survey was voluntary, the

responses were irregular for many firms. Quite a few were therefore

•liminated by our requirement that the time series be unbroken for a

minimum of 15 years. Second, a number of firms had to be excluded from

the sample because of mergers or large acquisitions. Finally, we looked

on the empirical aspect of the study as more of an experimental testing

of the model than .a definitive exploration of the subject.

          With such a small sample it is of course impossible to claim

that any of the findings presented below necessarily hold for the economy

as a whole. However, there is at least some basis for believing that the

results are more important than a sample size of seven would indicate.

Among the firms in the sample are some of the largest American

multinationals; in a typical year, 1977, the sample accounted for over

$15 billion in foreign sales, 6 1/2 percent of the total as reported by

the Department of Commerce. The firms are important in the following

industries: motor vehicles, chemicals, food products, heavy machinery,

and textiles.

         In Appendix B we discuss a number of technical issues concerning

the data: the issue of deflation for price changes, particularly for the

foreign data; and the construction of real capital stock measures,

alternative cost-of-capital variables, and the firm's debt to total

assets ratio.



       V. Enmirical Results (I): Tests of the MarEinal Conditions

         The marginal conditions (6) and (7), which are functions of the

endogenous variables, K and D, can be solved as follows for the optimal

capital stock, K*:

         —          - q(p   + 6 +   2i4   -
                                              2)}/2xjj                             (8)




where subscripted variables pertain to the particular location, domestic

or foreign, and where unsubscripted variables are coon to all

locations; the latter are either firm-wide parameters, such as q, p, and

5, or the overall firm debt/assets ratio, •.             Multiplication   by the

exchange rate, x, changes a variable expressed in foreign currency units

into U.S. dollars; in the case of the United States, the exchange rate is

understood to be 1.

             Equation (8) has a family resemblance to equations for a

neoclassical firm's desired capital stock, e.g. as in Jorgenson (1963) or

Bischoff (1971). This will be seen especially below, when output

variables are substituted for the parameter a.



Distributed Lags

             In principle the above form could be estimated directly. In such

a case, two stage least squares or some other simultaneous equation

technique would have to be employed because of the endogeneity of both K

and •.   In   practice, however, it is likely that some adjustment to

equation (8) will be required in order to allow for the likelihood of

lagged adjustment and for the replacement of aj by more fundamental

determinants.

             Since equation (8) is a function for the optimal or desired

stock of capital, K*(t), if no further adjustments were made, the

equation would imply an investment function of the form: 1(t) —               K*(t)   -


K(t-l)   +    SK(t-1),   where the last term is replacement investment.

Combining the last two terms leads to a coefficient on the lagged capital
                                       - 15     -




stock   of 8-1, which must be less than zero. We test for lagged adjustment

in two ways. A simple Koyck lag distribution leads to the estimating

equation: 1(t) —   )(K*(t)   -
                                 K(t-l)]   +   6K(t-l),   with a composite

coefficient on K(t-l) of (6-A); this coefficient is likely to be, but is

not required to be less than zero. Alternatively, as pioneered by

Jorgenson (1963), one may postulate a series of building lags, where

equation (8) is interpreted as determining the desired capital stock and

changes in the desired capital stock are added to the backlog of ongoing

investment projects:



        1(t) — E A[K*(t) -   K*(tl)]       +   6K(t-l).                         (9)




This formulation leads to an estimating equation that is a distributed

lag in the changes of the variables determining the level of the desired

capital stock.



Expectations

             Expectations may enter the model in a number of ways, despite

the fact that the underlying theory developed in Stevens (1986) is

couched in terms of perfect foresight. Even if the lags between the

approval of a project and the completion of its construction are short,

the firm must still look somewhat ahead in projecting the demand for the

project's output; thus a and, to some extent,               must be forecast.

Moreover, because the capital stock cannot readily be traded on a rental

market, the investment decision really must take account of forecasts of

demand for a number of years, covering the anticipated life of the

project. Such considerations are important, but very difficult to handle
                                     - 16   -




analytically    in the type of model we are discussing here. However, we

feel it is better to handle them in an ad hoc manner than to ignore them

completely.

            Because it is not our goal to investigate expectation formation,

we have attempted to be eclectic in considering alternative approaches.

We have tested some formulations where the expected value for a given

variable is assumed to be a distributed lag of past values of the

variable or, in some cases, its determinants. We have also tested for

rational expectations formulations, where we use the property of rational

expectations that the expected value for a future variable differs from

the realized value by a random error. However, within this class, we have

chosen not to use certain estimation methods, such as those proposed by

Hansen and Singleton (1982); not only do such methods require the

assumption of rational expectations, but they have also been shown to

require quite stringent assumptions about the error terms in the

equations and the instruments used for the estimation. (See Garber and

King (1983)).

            Proxies for ExDected Demand Conditions As shown in Stevens

(1986), the intercept a in equations (6)-(8) is a composite of demand

function and production function parameters. The fundamental quantity to

which a is related is the firm's total revenues, PQ. For output, Q, we

assume for simplicity a linear relationship between Q and the capital

stock - -   either   because of fixed proportions in production or because the

relative prices of labor and capital are not expected to change. Thus on

the production side the assumption is Q — cK. The firm is assumed to

possess some market power in both domestic and foreign markets; hence the

firm's price (divided by a relevant index of competitive prices, P) 1s

related   to Q through a linear demand curve: P/Ps — a           -
                                                                     bQ. S.ibstituting
                                                    2
for Q in terms of K implies         — acK     -   bcK   •   a quadratic in K as shown

in equations (1) and (2) above. The term a in the marginal conditions (6)

through (8) equals the product of the demand curve parameter, a, the

production function parameter c, and the competitive price. We expect

that the demand curve parameter will change much more over time than c;

this latter, for convenience, will be assumed to remain constant. Thus we

shall assume that the variation in a will come exclusively from the

intercept in the demand curve, a, and

           In a steadily growing market, the firm should be able to sell a

steadily increasing level of output, Q, at a constant price; this

phenomenon would be reflected by a steadily increasing level for the

demand-curve intercept, a, now a function of time, a(t). If the market

grew in a truly steady fashion, a(t) could be adequately represented by a

time trend. Other variables that might enter into the determination of

a(t) would include GNP and GNP per capita in the relevant market.

Estimates of future values for a(t) would be related to forecasts for GNP

and population.

           In fact, however, the use of such economy-wide variables works

poorly for firms at the micro level. We conjecture this is because there

are many firm-specific elements in a given micro demand curve. And we

argue below that some of these elements can be captured by using lagged

values for the firm's output and price --         firm variables       which can be

constructed for our sample.

           The key here is that for the demand curve, /— bQ+ Ut,
no matter how a.or u bounces around, in every period the observable

quantity (P/P0+bQ) can be used as an estimate of the unobservable
                                   - 18   -




(a+u).6   Suppose, for example, that the intercept a(t) is really a linear

function of a number of variables, Xj. many of which cannot be measured.

Using matrix notation:



              —
                  AX bQ
                     -
                            + u,                                             (10)




where A is the vector of coefficients for the vector of independent

variables, x1. Suppose further, for simplicity, that we know that the

                                                              and that the
Xj'S follow an autoregressive process, x —     x11+
expected value of u and all w's is zero. Then the expected value of

          + bQ, which can be used as a forecast of a(t), would be equal to:



     E(Pt/PCt) + bE(Q) —    Alt_i +   AE(v) + E(u) —   AXi.                  (11)




            We have no direct empirical measures of the exogenous vector, I,

but, using equation (10), we can make a substitution for it in terms of

prior observations for P and Q. Thus, we also have:



     E(P/P) + bE(Q) —         P-i1-i + bEQ1 - ut_i.                          (12)



Thus, in this simplified example the introduction of lagged output and

prices can give us a fix on the unobservable vector of x's -     - at   the cost

of introducing serial correlation in the u's.




  6. See the data appendix for the construction of our empirical
 estimates for prices and quantities. Of course we recognize that ThU is
 an unknown parameter; however, it will be shown below that it can be
 estimated along with other parameters.

           The right hand side of equation (12) will be our empirically

observable estimate for the demand curve intercept a(t); it should be

recalled that the variable a figuring prominently in the marginal

conditions (8) equals a(t) times the product of the production function

constant c and the competitive price P It should also be noted from the

previous discussion that the variable fi         in   equation (8) equals the

product of the parameters bc and P.

            Making the above substitutions for a and               in the marginal

conditions (8), leads to a revised version of the optimal or desired

stock of capital in terms of empirically observable variables:

                           ct-l                                 i ct


            It should be recalled that we interpret equation (13) as a

desired capital stock equation, and that, because of building and

expectational lags, the estimated equations may include lagged values or

first differences of the variables appearing in it.



Ewoirical Results (I)

            The best equations for each firm, in the sense of maintaining

the form determined by equation (13), but allowing the data to affect the

degree of lagged adjustment, appear in Appendix C. Tables I and II in

this section summarize these results for the tests of the marginal

conditions as represented by equation (13). For each firm the following

statistics are reported in each table: the sample period, the regression

 type -   - whether   the lag distribution is of the Koyck variety (KL), an
                                        - 20   -




unconstrained        distributed lag (DL), or a polynomial distributed lag

(PDL), and whether an instrumental variables estimation method was used

(IV) --     key regression statistics, and a suary of the signs and levels
of significance of the coefficients of the variables. In the few cases in

these two tables where a variable appears as a distributed lag, the level

of significance refers to that for an F test for the significance of the

lag as a whole; moreover, a series of pluses and minuses indicates the

sign of each component of the distributed lag. For the most part, the

variables in the tables correspond to those in equation (13); the

hypothesized sign is noted below the heading of the column. The output

variable is domestic output for the domestic investment equation, and

foreign output for the foreign one. The lagged capital stock (K) appears

in both adjustment equations: in the Koyck, the coefficient may be either

positive or negative, as explained above, although a negative coefficient

seems more likely; in DL or PDL regressions the coefficient should be

positive, equal to the depreciation rate, 6. The variable CCAP refers to

the general class of neoclassical cost-of-capital measures, variations,

as explained in the data appendix, on the simplest form: q(p+6)/p. The

debt/assets ratio, •,        the key in this series of tests for determining
whether there was any interaction between domestic and foreign

investment, can be entered into the equation in a number of alternative

ways   -.   all of                                                 2
                     which appear in the tables. The terms I and I can be

entered individually (or in some cases separately) or, alternatively, the

hypothesis that the coefficient on the term in I is two times the

negative of the squared term can be imposed simply by entering the

composite expression: 144(1-si). The particular form of the I term entered

in the tables is for the best fitting equation.

          The variables that appear in the column headed by "other"

include, among others, various dummy variables that, for domestic

equations, take care of isolated large residuals. These dummy variables

did not change the character of the equation, but did allow the

estimation of a reasonable autocorrelation coefficient and Durbin-Watson

statistic. The variable, 1(, refers to the use of the alternative capital

stock variable and time trend, as described in the data appendix. The

output price relative, expressed as          in equation (13), was rarely

significant and did not affect the significance of the other key

variables; frequently it was dropped in estimating individual equations

and no equation using it appears in the tables. Finally, all tests for

the effect of a switch-over from exports to foreign production proved

negative in this set of regressions. (However, the switch-over variable

proved significant in one case in the reduced-form regressions presented

below.)

          The key empirical result for this set of regressions is that the

variable indicating an interdependence in investment spending, the

debt/assets ratio, is significant in some form at the 5 percent level

(for a one-tailed test) in 13 of the 14 regressions reported in tables I

and II. Only in the foreign investment regression for firm /6 is

the t value slightly below that required for significance (1.753). The

other part of the firm's cost of capital was hypothesized to be the CCAP

term, equal to some function of the sum of the nominal interest rate and

the depreciation rate. This was significant with the correct sign in only

five of the fourteen regressions; and a number of the coefficients were

significantly positive. No improvements for these variable could be
                                 - 22   -




generated by using a measure of the real interest rate or by correcting
for changes in the U.S. tax rates and depreciation guidelines.7

        The relevant output terms were uniformly of the correct sign and

significant in 4 of the 7 domestic regressions (with some significant

positive terms in the distributed lags of two others), and 5 (almost

six) of the foreign regressions. The coefficients on the lagged capital

stock were also usually of the predicted sign (except for two cases);

however, only 4 of the 14 coefficients were significant.



VI. Emoirical Results (Ifl: Tests of a Reduced Form Investment Function

         The marginal or Euler equations, (6) and (7), that formed the

basis of the empirical tests in the previous section exhibit the

interaction between domestic and foreign investment only indirectly. All

interactions are mediated through the effect of investment on the

debt/assets ratio, which in turn affects the coon interest rate

appearing in each investment's cost of capital. If one can solve the

equation system, (6), (7) and (2), the interactions between domestic and

foreign investment can be tested more directly. Parameters and variables

pertaining to one location will directly affect investment levels in the

other. It is the purpose of this section to test such a model.

         Basically we want to eliminate the endogenou.s debt/assets ratio

in equations (6) and (7) by expressing it as a function of exogenous

variables. Unfortunately this cannot be done directly because the

equations are all nonlinear; further complications occur because equation

(2), the sources and uses of funds   constraint,   is a differential




 7. Revised estimates of the cost of capital calculated in Hall (1986)
were used without increased success.

equation.    The nonlinearity in the marginal conditions is caused by the

debt/assets ratio, Z', equal to D/qK. The differential equation contains

the nonlinearities introduced by • and the quadratic term K.

            We linearize the marginal equations by expanding them in a first

order Taylor series around the firm's average value for its debt/assets

ratio, ,      its   capital stock, K0, and debt, D0. The linearized version of

marginal condition (6) or (7) becomes:


                                                                  2

where   the locational subscript, i, equals d or f (domestic or foreign);

and the subscript T refers to the sum of the domestic and foreign levels

(in this case the real capital stock). The constant, c, is the sum of the

various constants resulting from the Taylor series expansion. Note that

all the coefficients on the right hand side of the equation are

independent of location. It should also be noted that the coefficient of

the total capital stock, KT, equals           times the coefficient of the debt

term; this, of course, is because the two variables appear in the

marginal conditions in the ratio, D/qK. Finally, it is worth observing

that all coefficients in the equation are in nominal units, in the sense

that a proportional change in all prices will change the coefficients in

the same proportion. The ratio of any two coefficients will, therefore,

be in real units; we have discussed in the previous section why a1 and

change when prices change.

            The third equation in the system, the differential equation (2),

can be linearized in at least two ways. For both alternatives, we will
                                              - 24       -




turn   the differential equation into a difference equation, with D

replaced by D(t)-D(t-l) and so on. An important question, not unrelated

to expectations, is how to treat the terms on the right hand side of

equation (2) --retained earnings:



       (l-r)[aK - flK2- (p + 4)D - q6K]              -       DIV.                           (15)



If one assunes that the firm looks to the immediate past, either to

forecast profits during period t or as the sole source of investment to

be undertaken during period t, then expression (15) becomes predetermined

during period t, equaling retained earnings (RE) during t-l or a

distributed lag on the retained earnings of even earlier periods. In such

a case, this highly nonlinear function can be replaced by RE(t-l) or a

suitable distributed lag.

                Alternatively, the terms in K and D, equal to gross profits, can

be treated endogenously - -         corresponding              to the case where the firm

depends on contemporaneous profits, an endogenous variable, for the

financing of investment during period t. Dividends, although clearly

endogenous for the firm,           will   in both cases be assumed exogenous to the

investment decision.

                In the first case, no linearizations are needed and the sources

and    uses     of funds constraint becomes:



        D   —
                D(t-l) +   q[K -   K.(t-l)]    -
                                                   RE(t-l).                                 (16)



                In the   second, where profits are assumed endogenous. a Taylor
series expansion similar to those used in equation (14) leads to:

This form of the constraint leads to further nonlinearicies, as is

discussed below.

     We use equation (16) or, alternatively, (17) to eliminate the firm's

debt variable in the two marginal equations (14). Concentrating on the

substitution using equation (16) for the moment, one arrives at the

following system of two equations in the two remaining endogenous

variables, Kf and Kd:



              + Kf[2qA] —
                               d -q(p+6) +[2qA/(l-I0)](K. -D/q +RE/q)(t-1)
                                                                                    (18)

  K[2qA] + Kf[2Pf+2qAI —       a -q(p+6) +[2qA/(l-0)](K. -D/q +RE/q)(t-l),

whereA—            /     >0.
               o q0

         Under usual circumstances this system can be solved for the

optimal capital stock in each location, Kd and Kf. And both variables

will be functions of d' Qf p+S, and the lagged values of retained

earnings, debt, and the capital stock for the firm as a whole.

         The determinant, t, of the matrix of coefficients of Kd and Kf

                          —
                                                               22
is always positive:                 +2qA)(2flf +2qA) -       4q A . Solving the system
for the optimal capital stocks in the domestic and foreign locations, we

obtain the following:



 Kd — cd + ad(2?2qA)/A -        af(2qA)/        -
                                                     q(p+6)(2flf)/A + Xtl(2f)/ (19)

where X1 is a proxy for the last term in both equations (18).

           The signs of the independent variables make sense. Factors

increasing the demand curve in the domestic market (ad) raise the level

of desired capital in the domestic market and lower it in the foreign

market; the appearance of foreign demand variables (af and its

determinants) in the domestic capital function, and vice versa for the

foreign function, is the direct evidence of interdependence between

domestic and foreign investment that was only indicated indirectly in the

marginal equations tested above. To reiterate, the reason for the

interdependence in this model is the competition of each unit of

investment for cheap sources of finance. As long as debt is positive,

the cost of capital for an incremental unit of investment is equal in the

foreign and domestic markets, and in magnitude is greater than the

minimum, risk-free rate, p+S; moreover, an incremental unit    of   investment

in one area affects investment in the other, either by raising the

debt/assets ratio or by preventing retained earnings from being used to

reduce it. In both cases the incremental unit of investment raises the

common cost of capital above what it otherwise would have been.

            The equations show, in addition, that there are within- and

cross-equation constraints among the coefficients that can be, in

principle, exploited in estimation. However, because many of the

coefficients will be changed by the substitution of more basic

determinants for variable such as         and a, and because of the

 imposition of distributed lags in the investment functions, no cross-

 equation constraints have been imposed or tested for in this study.
                                - 27    -




        When using the second Taylor series expansion of the sources and

uses of funds constraint, equation (17), a somewhat different estimating

equation results. First, since (17) includes a product of endogenous

variables, Kdad, this term must also be approximated linearly. The

resulting system is quite similar to the previous one [equation-set(18)]

with respect to the independent variables, except that lagged retained

earnings is now eliminated. Otherwise the variables and the signs of the

coefficients are identical.



Results (IF)

         As the significance of the debt/assets term in the first set of

regressions was the key indicator of interdependence, so in the reduced

form regressions the key indicators are the significance of the internal

funds term and of the output term in the competing market. Tables III and

IV summarize the results of the individual firm    regressions   that appear

in Appendix C.

          The internal funds term performs the best: the FUND variable is

significant in six of the seven domestic regressions; for the foreign

regressions, the variable is likewise significant in six of seven

regressions and nearly significant in all seven.

         The results for the competing output term are less conclusive

than those for internal funds or (earlier) for the debt/assets ratio.

Exactly one half of the 14 possible investment functions exhibit a

statistically significant negative impact of the output variable in the

competing market: four for domestic investment and three for foreign. In

addition, for one of the domestic cases the sign of the foreign output

term was significantly positive (firm   #4),   a finding we choose to

tentatively    interpret as evidence for a production interdependency

outweighing the effect through the competition for internal funds.

         For the other variables in the investment functions, results are

reasonably similar to the debt/assets ratio regressions. The output terms

in the own market are generally very important and significant: 7 of 7

for domestic investment and 6 of 7 for foreign. The cost of capital

variable, CCAP, was significant with the correct sign in 5 of 7 foreign

regressions, but in only 3 of 7 for the domestic market; these results

improve a bit on those from the previous set of regressions, but it is

surprising to find such a variable doing so poorly in domestic

regressions. The capital stock does fairly well, significant in 9 of 14

regressions.



                        VII. Summary and Conclusions

         The primary goal of this paper has been to examine whether the

fact that a firm is a multinational affects key decisions such as the

level of its domestic fixed investment. Theoretically, this led to an

exploration of models that imply an interaction between a multinational's

domestic and foreign decisions. We focused on two such possible

interactions: through the finance side, where, under certain

circumstances, investments in different locations compete for scarce

funds; and through the production side, where foreign investment may

either displace exports of finished goods or increase exports of

components. Empirically, investment functions testing for these

interactions were fitted for the domestic and foreign operations of seven

large multinational firms.
                                   - 29   -




         We   found little evidence to support interactions through the

production side, although the data were clearly limited in this area. In

only one case, the reduced-form foreign investment function for firm #3,

was our switch-over variable significantly related to the level of

investment. Thus, as several other studies have found in more direct

tests of this question, in our sample, foreign investment does not seem

to be related to export displacement.8

         The evidence for an interaction through the financial side was

much stronger. For one set of tests, involving the marginal conditions

from the world-wide value maximization model, the significance of the

debt/assets ratio was the key in assessing the existence of an

interdependence between domestic and foreign investment. The ratio was

significant in 13 of 14 cases. A second set of tests involved solving the

(nonlinear) marginal conditions for an approximate reduced-form

investment equation. An interaction between domestic and foreign

investment was indicated by a significant effect of foreign output in the

domestic investment function (or vice versa) and/or the significance of

the measure for consolidated internal funds. The internal funds variable,

the measure corresponding to the debt/assets ratio in the marginal

conditions, was significant in 12 of the 14 possible regressions, six

domestic and six foreign. The evidence from the competing output

variables was less compelling. Foreign output was significant in the

domestic regressions with a negative sign in four out of seven possible

cases,9 while domestic output was significant in foreign regressions in

(1984), and Swedenborg (1979), (1982).
 9. This does not count the case, noted above, where foreign sales were
significant with a positive sign, a case that suggests an interaction
through the production side. (See Table III.)

three   cases. Although the evidence from the two types of test is not

completely consistent, it does seem to indicate strongly some sort of

interaction through the financial side.

           Thus, while there is little evidence that production abroad

displaces exports and existing domestic capacity, fixed investment abroad

does seem to compete with investment at home for most of the firms in our

sample. because of the increasing cost of external finance, a decision to

invest and produce more abroad is a decision to invest and produce less

at home. This displacement takes place even if there is no exporting or

importing between the home and foreign location.
                  APPENDIX A: THE SHIFT TO LOCAL PRODUCTION


           This appendix provides the derivation for the switch-over

variable (denoted "SWITCH") that appears in Table IV and is described at

the end of section III. The variable attempts to test the hypothesis that

part of foreign fixed investment was caused by the shift from serving the

foreign market by exports to production abroad.



                        I. The Optimal Switch-Over Point

           The essence of the theoretical problem of th...ermining the

optimal point e.c which to switch production from the home to the foreign

location is the minimization over time of the cost of producing a given

coinniodity. Since certain fixed costs (F) occur in setting up production

in a new location, and since these are incurred only once, one must

compare them to cost savings that may result over the whole life of the

firm. Costs at different points of time will be compared by discounting

them back to the present.

           Total cost of a given real sales level in the foreign country

(Q) equals the sum of the costs of the amount produced in the foreign

location C2(Qf) and the home location, Cl(Qh). Put in somewhat

oversimplified terms, the multinational firm's problem is, for any given

path of total sales over time, to minimize discounted costs of production

(DC):




        Mm DC[Q(t)] —   f e'   {Cl[Qh(t)] +   C2[Qf(t)]'.   dt           (Al)




    subject to: Q(t) —     Qh(t) +   Qf(t).   h' Qf   0.
                                    -2-

          Because of the above constraints and the fixed set-up cost that

is a part of the foreign cost function, the solution of the geral form

of   this problem is a difficult nonlinear programming problem.1 However,

solving the particular problem that seems to best represent the

multinational firm's decision is considerably easier. In this case we

make the further assumptions that there are set-up costs for the foreign

production operation, but none for home production -•   since home set-up
costs have already been incurred. We will assume that such costs are a

fixed in real terms at F; nominal set-up costs will for convenience be

assumed to be equal to FPh, where Ph is a dollar output price for the

home market. Moreover, as was customary for the sample period, we assume

that the marginal costs of producing abroad (in dollars) are lower than

those at home for each level of production, and that they are constant in

both locations, independ.nt of the l.vel of output. Over time, as long as

foreign marginal costs are kept lover than domestic, the basic result

will be independent of any particular rate of inflation or exchange rate

change. In the theoretical derivations below, we will assume, for

simplicity, that wages, capital costs and exchange rates are constant.

Finally, we will assume that there is no dependence of foreign sales on

whether production is at home or abroad.

          Given the above assumptions, the solution to the problem of

finding th. optimal time, if any, to switch production from the home to

the foreign location is simplified considerably. Since foreign marginal

coats are always lover than domestic, once the svitch-over is made, there

can be no switch in the reverse direction. Second, if the level of

switch-over costs were zero, the switch would occur ediately, at time




 1. See, e.g., Eadley (1964), p. 136 and pp. 256 ff.
                                        -3-


zero. However, with positive switch-over costs, it may pay to postpone

the switch-over, balancing the increased costs of continuing to produce

at home for a certain time against the saving of pushing the payment of

switch-over costs further into the future.

         Given the above simplifying assumptions, we can formulate the

firm's problem as one of choosing the optimal time, 1', of shifting from

the home cost function to the foreign one. Below we will add a number of

elements to each function, but for now we shall ignore price changes and

other complications and assume that, exce't for switch-over costs, total

costs are a (real) constant times output produced in each location. Thus

the home cost function, Cl(Qh), becomes chQh, where Ch is the constant

home marginal cost. zt   sij.i.1ar   function holds for the cost of foreign

production. As noted above, when costs are minimized the firm will not be

producing in both locations simultaneously. The optimal time to switch to

foreign production can be derived by minimizing the following discounted

cost integral with respect to the switch-over time, T. This is a special

case of the general function (Al):



Mm DC[Q(t),T —    5 e [chQ(t))dt + T$ et 4[cfQ(t)]dt + eT F. (A2)
                  1'




         If an interior minimum exists at T*, the first derivative of

function DC with respect to T must equal zero, that is:



                             — 0, or, Q(T*) — pF/(%-
     e0T*1Q(T*)(ch Cf) - pF}                         Cf).
                                                                              (A3)




Equation (A3) shows, of course, that the optimal T depends on the

(exogenous) path of output, Q. Assume for simplicity that Q        is   expected
                                    -4-

to increase exponentially over time, Q(t) —     Q(0)t   Then, if Q(O) is

large enough such that the left hand side of (A3) is positive at time 0,

it will also be positive at every subsequent time; postponing the switch-

over only increases the discounted cost integral. In such a case, the

optimal strategy is to switch to foreign production immediately. If, on

the other hand, Q(O) is small enough such that the marginal condition is

negative at time 0, as long as Q(t) increases without bound, there will

be a unique T* such that the first order condition will be satisfied.

Examination of the second derivative of the integral function DC shows

that T* is indeed the cost-minimization time to switch all production to

the foreign location. For the case of exponential growth of Q(t) at rate

g, the optimal switch-over time is g!ven by:



        —    hg   ln(pF) -lrtQ(O) •ln(% Cf)).                              (A1+)




            Let us now specify the components of the marginal costs, Ch and

    more precisely, and, as well, introduce price and .xchange rate

variability. We will assume Cobb-Douglas production functions in each

location, with common elasticities, r, and a common rental cost of

capital, c; however, wage rates in dollars are assumed to differ (wh and

XWf. where x is the exchange rate), as are the overall efficiency

coefficients, Ah and Af. Moreover, as noted above, we assume that there

are real costs of starting up production abroad, F, that are measured in

units of output, hence priced at       In addition, in order to export from

the home location to the foreign market, the firm must incur fixed

transportation costs (Trans) per unit of output and must pay an g
                                          -5-

velorum tariff (Tar) per unit of value. Using these elements of cost, the

expression %   -C   appearing itt equations (A3) and (A4) becomes:



                                + Trans + Tar.Ph -
    Q(ch Cf) — Q.AhWhC                               Af(XWf)'C'.           (AS)



         Substituting into equation (A3), the optimal level of foreign
real sales at which the firm switches to foreign production is:



                                 pF• Ph
     Q*_        1                                                          (A6)
             Ahc ' [w     -
                              Ah/Af(xwf)"]   + Trans + PhTarI



         Rough empirical measures of Q* were construc.ed using the U.S.

and foreign data described at length in the Data Appendix. Our previously

constructed measures for domestic prices            and the cost of capital (c)

were used for these particular variables. Data collected by the Bureau

of Labor Statistics were used for both the U.S. and foreign wage

variables; in the latter case, a weighted avtrage was constructed of

countries in which U.S. foreign investment is concentrated. No data were

available on transportation costs, tariffs, or the level of the fixed

costs of setting up production facilities abroad; if, however, these last

costs are relatively constant in rsal terms over time, the term F will be

estimated as part of the coefficient of the Q* variable.



 II. Determining the Firm's Fixed Investment Resulting from Switch-Overs

         For a particular subsidiary one can apply the standard approach

of the investment theory developed in the text to determine the

investment resulting from the decision to switch from exports to foreign
                                      -6-


production. As suggested in the text we would not expect instantaneous

adjustment to the new optimal level of the capital stock, expecting some

sort of lagged adjustment because of building or other lags.

         A major problem, however, is estimating for the fir. as a whole

the magnitude of switch-over-generated investment. If one had sales

broken down by each individual market abroad, then in principle one could

calculate Q* for each market, determine those for which Q* was less or

equal to the existing sales, and then calculate the investment implied

for each separate switch-over. Our data, however, did not allow such a

disaggregation. It was necessary, therefore, to make a rough estimate of

switch-over investment using only data for aggregate foreign sales and

the separate calculation of the switch-over point.

         Two major factors are responsible for shifts from exports to

foreign production: changes in the switch-over point (assumed here to be

reductions), and growth in the foreign markets. Since we have no

disaggregated information, we must assume that all markets are affected

identically by changes in these two factors.

         Let us assume that we have arranged the sales of the individual

foreign subsidiaries in ascending order, so that total foreign sales can

be expressed as either the sum   or   the integral of the sales of each

separate subsidiary. Letting n be the index for a given subsidiary and

     the index for the subsidiary with the largest sales, total foreign

sales equals:



                                        nmax
                '1max
     Qf(t) —    nO Qn(t) or Qf(t) —     f   Q(n)dn.                       (A7)
                                          -7-

 The switch-over point, as calculated from equation (A6), occurs at some

output level Q* which corresponds to aubsidary n*. Using the integral
form above, at time t,       the   integral from n* to       is that part of total

foreign sales that is either already completly switched to foreign

production or is in the process of so doing.

         In symbolic terms, total sales switched from home to foreign

production at time t,    SS(t),     equals:



                max
     SS(t) —   5              dn.                                                (A8)
               n* (Q*)


Assuming that real sales in the foreign markets are expected to increase

at the rate of "g" percent per unit of time, equation (A8) simplifies to

the following

         Assuming     also   that the variables in (A6), determining the

switch-over point are continuous, then Q* is a continuous function of

time. We can then differentiate SS(t) to calculate the switch-over of
                                                                 2

      SWITCH(t) —      gt Q(n*)    dn*/dt.                                    (AlO)



Q(n*t), the value of the subsidiary's or market's output at the switch-

over point, is simply Q*t. The time derivative, dn*/dt, the change in the

location experiencing a switch-over, or the number of subsidiaries

switching during a given time period, depends on the rate of growth of

sales (g), the change in Q*,       and   the slope of the original sales curve,

dQ0/dn, at n*. This derivative is evaluated as follows. y definition:



      Q*   —
               Q(n*)   —   gt Q0(n*).                                         (All)




Thus, using the inverse function, Q, n* —            Ql[tQ*()]         After some

manipulation, it turns out that:



      dn*/dt —    et[dQ*/dt      gQ*]/(dQ0/dn(n*)] .                         (A12)


Since dQ*/dt was assumed to be negative during the sample period, dn*/dt

is also negative, i.e. more subsidiaries switch to foreign production

during the period.

obtain the final expression for the magnitude of sales switched-over from

In our regressions we have made the assumption that the term in the

denominator is roughly constant over the sample period --        the   slope of

the firm's sales curve calculated at successive switch-over points.

Allowing this, we have estimates of all the terms in the numerator of

equation (Al3). Various forms of equation (A13) were used in the

regressions as rough measures of the independent effect of switch-oven

on foreign fixed investment. Only for firm     3   did such an effect prove to

be statistically significant. (See the variable SWITCH      in   Table IV.)
                           APPDIX J: DATA


         Section IV in the body of the paper describes the sample and the

variables in the data set. All variables provided by McGraw-Hill were

expressed in current dollars. This was the case for the firms' foreign,

as well as domestic data, thus indicating that the firms had used an

exchange rate to transform data in foreign currency units into dollars.



                   I. Deflators for Domestic Variables

         The major domestic variables needing deflation were sales,

purchases of plant and equipment, and various measures of consolidated

cash flow. The construction of real capital stock measures using deflated

purchases of plant and equipment is discussed in a separate section

below.

         Sales, originally expressed in current dollars, were deflated by

the Bureau of Labor Statistics' producer price index for the major

industry of domestic operations.

         Domestic plant and equipment expenditures were deflated by a

weighted average of the implicit price deflators from the national income

accounts for producers' durable equipment and for nonresidential

structures. Information was sometimes available as to the composition of

the firm's plant and equipment (P&E) expenditures and, in such cases, the

deflators were weighted accordingly. The deflator constructed for

investment expenditures was also used to deflate the various cash flow

variables used in section VI. The use of such a deflator is justified

theoretica!ly by the appearance in equation (18) of terms such as RE/q
                                       -2-

and D/q; in these expressions, the nominal value of retained earnings

(RE) or corporate debt (D) is divided by the price of capital goods, q.



                      II. Deflators for Foreign Variables

          The problem of deflating variables relating to foreign

operations is a formidable one. As noted, all foreign variables, such as

aggregate foreign sales, were reported to McGraw-Hill in current dollars.

Since most foreign sales were originally denominated in foreign

currencies, this meant that the firms translated sales denominated in

each foreign currency into dollars by using the current exchange rate and

then aggregated across currencies. The description of the procedure

underlines the major problem in developing an accurate deflator: many

currencies and countries may be represented in the foreign total, and it

is impossible to determine the identities of the countries and their

relative weights in the total.

          Two   procedures   were used to deflate the foreign data, one rough-

and-ready, relying on purchasing power parity (PPP), and the other, more

theoretically satisfying, but far mors time-consuming and subject to its

own sourcu of error. Fortunately, in th. cases        of   the two firms for

which we used both methods, the results were       very   similar. Eased on this

evidence, we felt justified in using      the   easier purchasing-power-parity

method.

          If purchasing    power parity holds, the ratio of the     prices   of two

identical,   or closely related coodities will equal the exchange rate:
      —   E($/f),   where the latter is measured in dollars p.r unit of

foreign currency ($/f). This of course means        that we   have a good proxy

for the foreign price in the corresponding domestic price divided by the
                                      -3-

exchange rate. We do not argue that PPP holds in any exact way --         one   of

us has argued strongly against it in print (Kravis and Lipsey (1978) --

but   the assumption that it does seems safer than the only other feasible

alternative, which is that exchange-rate movements convey no information

about relative price changes. Assuming for the moment that PPP is a

reasonable approximation, how do we deflate to the appropriate real

measure? Consider the example of foreign sales. We want the real value

Sf/Pf; we have the current dollar figure S1F. To transform this latter

value into the proper real tetas, one needs to divide by the value EPf.

But from the assumption of PPP, EPf equals d• Hence, under PPP, one

deflates the dollar-denominated foreign data by the U.S. do.estic price

deflator.

            The alternative is to estimate the geographical distribution of

the sales and capital expenditures for each firm and each year in the

sample, and to collect price indices and bilateral exchange rates against

the dollar for. each country. The was done for two       firms in   order to

attempt to determine the effects of the alternative methods of deflation.

The first step in this procedure was to estimate g rough distribution of

each   firm's foreIgn   assets. Naturally the use   of   such a distribution

introduces a 'new   source   of error: a new series could not be constructed

for óachyear, and a distributionfor assets generally will not be the

same as the needed distribution for sales or fixed investment. Using this

available distribution, a fira-ipeèific foreign sales aid investment

deflator was calculated as a weighted average of the individual foreign

price levels. For prices we used a consistently defined set of

international price statistics from Summers and Heston (1984), covering

virtually all the countries and years represented in our sample. Using
                                        -4-

these data, the required deflator, EPf can be constructed directly; in

this case Pf is the Summers-Heston foreign price of a consumption bundle.

These data show frequent and substantial deviations from PPP.

         Fortunately a choice between the methods for deflation was not

critical. The results from the alternative methods were quite similar. As

it turns out this was probably because the alternative series were very

highly correlated; the foreign sales measures had correlation

coefficients of 0.97 and 0.88 for firms 1 and 2 respectively; similarly,

for foreign plant and equipment expenditures the correlations were 0.98

for both firms.



                           III. Cavital Stock Measures

         Two   versions   of the so-called perpetual inventory method were

used to calculate a measure of the real stock of plant and equipment used

in the firm's domestic and foreign operations. The methods differed only

in the treatment of the initial capital stock which serves as a starting

point for the series.

         A.s is well known, the perpetual inventory method derives a value

for the real capital stock at a given time t, K(t), by adding deflated

gross investment expenditures, 1(t), and subtracting the (real) value of

depreciation from the value for the capital stock in time t-l. The

depreciation rate, 6, is invariably assumed to be a constant, so

depreciation equals 6 times the value of the capital stock in t-l, 6K(t-

1). Thus the usual difference equation links succesive values of the

capital stock and investment expenditures:



                          K(t) —   K(t-1)   + 1(t) -   6K(t-l).
                                      -5-

           One decision is the choice of depreciation rate. We tried a

number of alternatives and found little effect of the choice on the

significance of the coefficient of the capital stock or other variables.

We settled on the figure of 13 percent, following recent investigators

such as Hall (1986) and Jorgenson and Sullivan (1981), who both used 12.7

percent.

           Once having chosen a depreciation rate, the only problem - -     and
a major one -   - is   choosing a starting value and year for the capital

stock. The problem is that it is very difficult, if not impossible, to

obtain or derive a value for the real capital stock for any year

independent of the perpetual inventory method. This holds especially for

the firm data used here. Various alternatives have been tried by previous

researchers: real capital stock benchmarks derived independently

(Jorgenson and Siebert (1968)); the starting of the perpetual inventory

calculation far enough before the sample period so that ignoring the

starting cital value causes only a small error (Hall (1986), Jorgenson

(1963)); avoiding completely the use of a capital stock series by using

an equation that deals in first and higher differences (Coen (1971)).

Given our data and the rather short sample period, all three of these

alternatives were of questionable value.

           We had two ways to face this problem. In most, but not all cases

the two solutions led to very similar results --     probably   because the

capital stock variable made a relatively modest contribution to an

equation's explanatory ability. The first solution was to start the

perpetual inventory calculation with a recent value of the nominal

capital stock in each location, usually gross fixed assets in 1959 for

foreign operations and somewhat earlier for domestic. This, of course,
                                  -6-

led to a biased calculation as depreciation from this initial value was

subtracted from gross investment for all successive years (until the

initial value was totally depreciated). An alternative solution, that le

to an unbiased estimate, was based on the fact that the inital capital

stock is a constant; therefore, if care is taken, this constant can be

estimated directly as a coefficient in the regression. To elaborate, let

us express a few terms of a typical capital stock calculation starting

from an initial value of K(O):



                            K(l) —   1(1)   +(l-6)K(O),
                                                         2
          K(2) — 1(2) +(l-6)K(l) — 1(2) +(l-6)I(l) +(l-6) K(O),
             and generally, K(t) — E   I(l&)t +K(O)(l-8)


In looking at these expressions, it becomes clear that the real capital

stock for any period can be broken up into two parts, the second of whici

always contains the same unknown: the initial real capital stock K(O).

Assuming a value for 6, which we always do in calculating the capital

stock, we can substitute for the variable K(t) the weighted average of

past real investment levels (weighted by powers of the depreciation rate

and a second variable, (16)t This second variable should always be

multiplied by the same unknown constant, K(O), but this can be estimated

as a coefficient in a least squares regression. Thus a by-product of a

regression using these two variables will be an estimate of the unknown

initial capital stock, appearing as the estimated coefficient of the

variable, (1..6)t
               IV. Measures of the Cost of Capital (CCAP)

        The variable CCAP (followed by some number, e.g. CCAP3) refers

to our empirical measure of the cost of capital for a debt-free firm. In

terms of the model developed in section III, CCAP would measure the term

q(p+6)/p, where q is the capital goods deflator, p the firm's output

price, p the riskiess rate of interest, and 6 the depreciation rate. The

only new variable introduced in this expression is the riskless rate of

interest; this was proxied by the yield on a U S. government ten-year

bond. This basic form of the cost of capital was denoted by CCAP3.

          An alternative form, following one of the options used by

Jorgenson (1963), added a speculative element, the negative of the rate

of change of capital goods prices. We used the rate of change of a U.S.

capital goods deflator, constructed by weighting equally the structures

deflator and the equipment deflator. This variable was denoted by CCAP4.

In one case, for firm #3, an undeflated variant of CCAP4 proved superior

to CCAP4 itself; this variable was denoted by CCAP2 and differed from

CCAP4 only insofar as the ratio of prices, q/p, was set to 1.

         None of the above measures takes any account of changes in the

tax system over time. In order to test for the impact of variations in

such things as the investment tax credit, allowable depreciation rates,

and, of course, the corporate tax rate, a variable constructed by Hall

(1986) was also tested. It added nothing and, in fact, produced somewhat

inferior results to CCAP4.



   V. Measures of Internal Funds Available for Fixed Investment (FUND)

         Variables measuring internal funds available for fixed

investment are an integral part of the so-called reduced form
                                   -8-

regressions. See equation (18) and the preceeding discussion for the

justifcation of this variable. The idea was to get a measure of that part

of the capital stock (or its change) that could be financed by internal

funds; any financing over and above this figure would of course

necessitate the flotation of additional debt. This divison of the

financing of the capital stock between internal and external sources is,

of course, equivalent to determining the firm's debt/assets ratio.

          A number of alternative measures could be constructed depending

on what alternative uses of internal funds were assumed to be determined

prior to the decision to finance fixed investment; the best fitting

variable, FUND4, assumed that both dividends and changes in current

assets were predetermined as far as fixed investment was concerned.

          Since the variable refers to the financing of a stock of

capital, the theoretical variable starts with a measure of the portion 0;

the   lagged capital stock not financed by debt: the value of the firm's

gross capital stock (both domestic and foreign) minus its outstanding

long-term debt. Added to this is the flow of potential internal finance

for a4ditions to the capital stock; this equals a measure of cash flow

(profits after tax plus depreciation) minus dividends minus the change ii

current assets. As noted above, the latter two variables were subtracted

from cash flow on the assumption that they are predetermined with respec

to fixed investment. The relaxation of this assumption would require two

more equations in the model in order to determine all four variables

simultaneously.
                                  -9-

         VI. Alternative Measures of the Debt/Assets Ratio ()

        The debt to total assets measure allowed various possibilities

for defining the relevant numerator. Two alternatives were attempted:

long-term debt and the sum of long-term debt, notes payable, and debt due

within a year. The ratio using the latter definition produced results

that were slightly superior in all regressions except those for firm #5.
