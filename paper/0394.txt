             Specific Information, General Information,
              and Employment Matches under Uncertainty


                              ABSTRACT


       Employment matches under uncertainty are typically accompanied by

opportunities for information acquisition. Workers can acquire specific

information about productivity lotteries at the firm   or   general informa-

tion affecting their probabilistic beliefs about work elsewhere, Enter—

arises can acquire specific information concerning the productivity of a

particular worker or general information about different groups of work-

ers in a production process. In all cases, the market equilibrium with

flexible wages is efficient. Moreover, there is no opportunity for

strategic behavior that would alter this result. Both forms     of   informa-

tion are associated with rising earnings profiles over time, hut the

steepness is greater in the general case. The negative turnover—wage

relation is attributable in part to the lower match termination rate

of workers with productive lob histories, who earn higher wages than

their less productive counterparts. General information is associated

with more termination of employment matches by employers and employees

than is specific information. The implications of specific/general

information for matching processes in many respects aralle1 the role

of that distinction in human capital theory, strengthening the link

between matching theories and earlier human canital analyses,

                         I. INTRODUCTION

    The major post—school investment in individuals' productivity is

through worker training. Specific training affects the worker's firm—specific

skills, while general training also alters his productivity elsewhere.

As the human capital literature of the past two decades has shown,

many important employment patterns are consistent with the theory's

predictions

    Both forms of training are associated with higher post—training

wages, but the extent of the wage increase is greater for general

training since these workers are paid their post—training marginal

product. The age—earnings profile for generally trained workers is

also steepened by the foregone earnings during the initial training

period. Training also influences worker turnover, as a larger specific

training component will diminish such job changing.

    Although this theory has been largely developed in terms of

explicit training programs involving direct training costs, the pos-

sibility of learning—by—doing as part of a general production process is

not ruled out.2 What Is essential is that worker productivity actually

increase as a result of some activity at the firm.



    he rather voluminous literature dealing with these patterns
includes: Becker (1964), Ben—Porath (1970) Lazear (1976), Mincer (1974),
Mincer and Jovanovic (1979), 01 (1962), Parsons (1972), Pencavel (1972),
Reder (1962), and Rosen (1972a,b).
    2The notion of learning—by—doing, which was first analyzed by Arrow
(1962), is considered for the training case by Rosen (1972a,b).
                                 —2—

     A considerable, more recent literature has addressed the properties

 of marriage and other economic matches in general3, employment matches

 with worlar search4, and employment matches with joint learning by firms

 and workers.5 The focus here will be on those economic matches formed

 with imperfect information, about the attractiveness of the match, but

 in which there is the opportunity for resolving this
                                                        uncertainty through
 one's experiences. Matches that turn out to be successful have a higher

 total value, where the rent associated with the relationship may be

referred to as the specific capital of the match.

    Despite the similarity in terminology., quite different economic

processes may be at work in the specific training and general matching

problems. Specific human capital Investment involves a change in

worker productivity that typically takes place in a known environment.

In the stochastic matching problem, one can view the worker's pro-

ductivity at the firm as a lottery on n states of the world, each of

which has an associated productivity.6 The matching process consists

of forming judgments about the true state of the world and continuing

only employment relationships that are believed to be productive. The

worker's state—specific productivity remains unaltered.



    3See, particularly, Becker (1974) and Becker, Landes, and Michael
(1977).

    4Analyses by Mortensen (1978,1979),. Jovanovic (1979a), and Viscusi
(1979c) are primarily of this type.
    5Studies in this vein include those by Jovanovic (1979b) and
Viscusi (1979a,b and forthcoming a,b).
    6Although I focus on the pure matching model, the mixed case in
which better matched workers receive more training is also quite important.

      The focus of this paper will be on pure matching models
                                                              under
  uncertainty. Within the context of this
                                               framework, I will introduce
  the Possibility of specific
                                information and general information that
  may alter the probabilistic beliefs of
                                             firms and workers. Despite
  the differences in the
                           substantive aspects of human capital investments
  and pure learning
                      processes, there are striking parallels in the theories.
  Specific and general information
                                     acquisition. implications for worker
 wages and turnover that are in
                                   many respects quite similar to the role
 of specific and general training. These findings
                                                  suggest that the most
 fundamental,. generalizabl aspect of the human capital training
                                                                     theory
 involves the specific/general
                                  distinction rather than the actual nature
 of the Productivity_enhancing
                                  process.

     The analysis presented here will consider specific information

 acquisition by firms and workers in
                                        Section II, general learning by
 workers with specific information
                                     acquisition firms in Section III, and
 general learning by firms with
                                   specific and general worker Information
 In Section IV.   The role of general information
                                                    acquisition by firms is
perhaps most novel, since it has
                                   no counterpart In traditional human
capital theory. and has not been
                                   considered by analysts of employment
matches under uncertainty.7 For each of these types of
                                                        employment
relationships, I will assess the
                                 efficiency of competitive outcomes,
the wage structures that will result, and the turnover properties

associated with the match. Section
                                       V outlines the broader ramifications
of the theory.

              II. SPECIFIC INFORMATION ACQUISITION

A. Wage Determination

    Consider the following two—period situation.8 In each period,

there is a lottery on whether the worker will be productive, with out-

put of y, or unproductive, with output y — x.   The employer's prior

probability that the worker will be productive in the first period is

q. Firms and workers do not begin with perfect information but instead

learn about the properties of the match based on the initial period out-

comes. I will assume that the productivity lotteries can be viewed as

independent Bernoulli trials where these probabilities are updated in

Bayesian fashion. The firm's posterior probabilities of successful
                         *
outcomes (output y) are q following a success in period 1, and
                                                               q

following an unsuccessful outcome, where

               *        —   9
              q >q>q

    8lssues explicitly related to models with more than two periods,
such as the tenure—turnover relation, are excluded. I consider those
issues using models akin to those presented here in Viscusi, (1979a,b,c).
Also see Jovanovic (l979b) and Mincer and Jovanovic (1979) for analysis
along these lines.
    9Thus, prior probability distributions with one—point measure are
ruled out as uninteresting. Workers may acquire either partial or perfect
information in period 1. The updating process is considered with
illustrative examples in Sections lID and IVA. Botb firms and workers
are engaged in a two—armed bandit problem. See Ber.y (1972) for an
extensive treatment of the underlying mathematics.
                                 —5—
 The judgments of a representative worker are defined analogously and
                  *
 indicated by p, p , and p , where

          *
         p    >p>p
Although p and q values will often be assumed to be equal so as to

abstract from complications arising from worker misperceptions, many

of the findings are unaffected by differences in probabilistic beliefs

so no restrictions will be imposed at the outset.

    Workers also have an interest in the job lottery outcome since

they suffer a wage loss (or foregone bonus) of c, where

              O<c<x.
Nonzero values of c are utilized to promote some worker sorting, but c

cannot exceed x or the company could potentially profit from unproductive

job outcomes, creating an adverse incentives problem. Alternatively, the

analysis below could be developed assuming fixed output (x = 0) but dif-

ferences in productive effort (c > 0) when the unproductive state

occurs. Such an analysis could also include nonpecuniary rewards in

general. The broad implications of the theory would be unaffected by

this modification.

    The representative worker has a reservation wage rate w0. The

interest rate r leads to a discount factor b for firms and workers given

by l/(l+r). Let w1 be the wage required if the firm does not terminate

the employment relationship after a successful period 1 outcome. Then

  must satisfy
                                    —6—


      w0(l+b) = w1—(l—p)c + bp Max[w1_(l_p*)c,w0]

                 + b(l—p) Max[w1—(l—p)c,w0j

For this class of job choice problems, it can be shown (see Viscusi

(].979a)) that the lowest reservation wage is associated with the

employment strategy of staying with the job after a successful out-

come and leaving after an unsuccessful outcome since the job is less

attractive in the latter instance. An offer by the firm to let the

worker remain after an unfavorable period 1 outcome consequently does

not affect w1.

      The discounted reservation wage is now equal to

      w0 + bw0 = w1-(l—p)c + bp[w1_(l_p*)c] ÷ b(l—p)w0,



(1)       w =   w    + [(lP)+   bp(l_p*)j
            1    0

      Let w2 indicate the wage the company must pay if it fires the worker

after a successful period 1 outcome.1° Then the employment choice is

analogous to a single period decision where


(2)       w2 = w0 + c(l—p)

The expected wage net of incentive pay is w0. Since     p > p,   the firm

benefits by offering workers the opportunity to continue successful

matches since


(3)
          w1<w2,
as one can verify. For the remainder of Section II, equation 3



    10The enterprise's policy after an unfavorable outcome is irrelevant
in analyzing the reservation wage since the worker will never wish to
remain on the job in this instance.
                                 —7—


summarizes most of what we need to know about the wage structure.

B. Worker Preferences

    Once a match is formed, each party has four possible choices at the

start of period 2:

    1. Continue the match regardless,

    2. Terminate the match regardless,

    3. Continue the match only if the period 1 outcome is

        successful, and

    4. Continue the match only if the period 1 outcome is unsuccessful.

The worker views the wage rate as independent of his own actions. For

enterprise employment policies 1 and 3 above, the wage is w1 from

equation 1, while employment policies 2 and 4 are associated with w2

from equation 2. Using these wage rates and the other characteristics

of the employment problem, the worker calculates the value u.of

different choices by himself and the firm, where i indexes the worker's

decision, j indexes the firm's decision, and i and j range from 1 to 4, as above.

   For enterprise employment possibilities 1 and 3, there are four

possible outcomes. First, the worker could remain at the firm for both

periods, yielding

        u11 =   (l+b)[w1—(l—p)cj.11


    111t is well known that the mean value of the prior is all that
is of consequence if there is no change in the lottery in which the
individual is engaged. Only if there Is some job changing are
and p consequential.
                                                     —8—


 Second, the worker could leave the job after period 1, regardless of

 the job outcome. This behavior characterizes
                                                                           u21, U23, and U43, which
 consequently have identical values, where

              u21 = w1 — (1—p)c + bw0

 Third, the worker could remain on the job only following a productive

 period 1 outcome as with u31, u33, and u13. Each of these values equal


              u31 w1 — (l—p)c + bp[w1 — (l_p*)c] + b(l-p)w0

Finally, the worker could remain                     on    the job only after an unfavorable

period 1 outcome, yielding

          =        —   (l-p)c ÷
              w1                       b(1—p)[w1
                                                      —    (i-p)c]       + bpw0

Upon substituting for the value of w from equation 1, one can determine

that


           U31 > U21 > U11 > U41

The relative rank of these outcomes will be indicated by 1,2,3, and 4,

where lower—numbered values are preferred. The optimal behavior involves

continuation after the job only after a successful period 1 outcome.

      Let u'. Indicate the value associated with u.. except that w is
                                                                 1
replaced by w2. Then the utility values associated with employment

policies 2 and 4 are analogous to earlier values, where

(4)                =         =         =         =         =         =
                       u12       u22       u32       u42       u24       u34
and


(5)       ul = u14           =
                                 u44
                                              —9—


Since         > u1, the relative ranking of the values given in equation 4

will be indicated by 2', while those in equation 5 will be 4'. The

utility values ranked 2' and 4' are preferred to those ranked 2 and 4,

respectively, since in each case the primed terms are associated with

the same employment path and a higher wage rate. There will be no need

in the subsequent analysis, however, to compare the primed and unprimed

rankings.

C. Profit Values

    The discounted expected profits ii.. associated with action i by

the worker and policy j for the firm can be determined similarly. For

simplicity, ij will be calculated per discounted expected employee at

the firm, facilitating comparison of the profit values.12 Enterprise

policies 1 and 3 can have three possible values. If the employment

match always continues in period 2 or always terminates after the initial

period, then the profit/worker is given by

            11J•j• =   y   —   (l—q)x — [w1 — (l—q)cj

where           2l p23' and 43 are identical. Matches that continue

following a successful period 1 outcome (ir31,ir33, and ir13) have a value

                  =        —       —   (1—q)(x—c) + bq(1_q*)(xc)
             31                1                l+bq



    Ca1culation of two—period profit levels is somewhat sensitive
to the assumption made about the wage paid to new workers in period 2
(w1 or w2), but the equilibrium outcome is not. The procedure followed
here seemed best suited to putting the alternative 71.             values on a
comparable basis.
                                             —10—



Continuation of only matches with an unfavorable outcome have a value

4l given by

                 =        —        —   (x—c)(1—g)[l+b(l—qy
           4l Y w1                          l+b(l—q)

      The relative ranking of the profit levels depends only on the

expected output levels since the wage costs are identical, so that one

obtains


           3l > ll > 4l
which will be indicated by the rank 1,2, and 3, respectively. The

highest profit level is associated with retention of workers with

successful period 1 outcomes.

      Employment policies 2 and 4 impose wage costs w2 but otherwise

are analogous to earlier profit values since they share the same turn-

over properties. Following the same notational convention as with

utility functions, one has that


            11
                     ir
                       12
                              ir
                                22
                                       =w 32=ir42   =ir
                                                       24
                                                            =ir
                                                                  34

and

                 =
                     l4       7144


Since 'n1 >               the relative value of the 711j terms in equation 6 will

be indicated by 2', while those in equation 7 will be designated 4', since

      > ira. Since the w. values are associated with the same output and

a higher wage rate than their 71.. counterparts, the values ranked 2'

and 4' rank below 2 and 4, respectively. No further. description of the

rankings is required for the analysis below.

 D. Market Outcomes

        Both the firm and the worker have 4 possible turnover strategies

 to choose from, generating 16 possible market outcomes. The payoffs

 to the parties are summarized in the game matrix in Figure I, where

 payoffs to the worker are in the upper left corners and those to the

 firm are in the lower right corners.

       Consider first the choice by the worker. The relative ranking of

 the
       Ujj versus Uj terms is not consequential since it affects comparisons

 across different columns, not the choice of the row by the worker. Row 3

 is the dominant strategy for the worker since it offers the highest pay-

off for each possible strategy by the firm.     Similarly, column 3 is the
dominant strategy for the firm, producing a stable, cooperative equilibrium

at (3,3), where each party continues the match only if the worker is pro-

ductive in period 1.

       This outcome is considerably stronger than a Nash equilibrium. Each

party receives its highest valued reward. There is no incentive to behave

otherwise, nor would either party alter its behavior in response to such

strategic efforts. The sequence of moves is irrelevant, as is the pos-

sibility to pre—commit oneself to a strategy as, for example, the enter-

prise might do by adopting a predetermined
                                             employment policy.
    The turnover characteristics of the equilibrium associated with

specific information are that successfully matched workers continue the

relationship while those with a low productivity lottery outcome terminate

the relationship. Specific information promotes the stability of success-

ful. matches. Section III will address the issue of whether specific or
                                  —12—


general information is more conducive to worker turnover.

      In assessing the economic efficiency of the outcome, the level of

the wage payments is irrelevant since they involve transfers between

the parties that net out in the social welfare calculation. The equilibrium

behavior will lead to maximization of discounted expected output so that

the specific information competitive equilibrium will be efficient.'3

      The magnitude of the gain associated with the policy of terminating

unsuccessfully matched workers increases with the extent of the updating
                      *     *
of   the probability (q or p )    after   a favorable outcome. Loose prior

probability assessments are preferred, for any mean value of the prior,

since they are updated more.

      Consider, for example, the beta distribution (y,q) of priors para—

meterized so that q is the mean value of the prior and y is a measure of
                 14
its tightness.        Then after m successess and n failures in a sequence

of independent Bernoulli trials, the posterior probability of a success

is(yq+m)/(y-I-ni+n). The value of q* consequently is (yq+l)/(y-I-1), while q

is (yq)/(y+l), so     that
             *
           ---<Oand-—>O.

     13Efficiency is judged based on the expectations using the employer's
probabilistic beliefs. Clearly, if these perceptions are systematically
wrong, the outcome may not be efficient. Expected output levels with
imperfect information never exceed those with perfect information when
evaluated using the true probabilities.
          Raiffa and Schlaifer (1961) emphasize, the beta distribution
is ideally suited to analysis of Bernoulli—type trials and has properties
superior to the normal distribution in such instances.

Low y's are preferred since the employment relationship is terminated

after an unfavorable outcome, making the greater downward revision for

loose priors irrelevant and the greater upward revision after favorable

outcomes the prime matter of interest. The employment relationship is

continued on an asymmetric basis ——     the   worker remains after a success

but leaves after a failure —— so that only the upper right tail, is of

consequence after period 1. This preference for uncertainty does not

hinge on the risk neutrality of workers.

       Consirthe expected wage levels of workers during their tenure at

the firm. In period 1, the expected wage is


               — (l—p)c =    + c [bPP—P)J
                          w0

while in period 2 the expected wage assuming the worker remains at the

firm   is

            w1 'i
               'p.          0    1+bp

The workerb wage rises over time as he receives an expected wage below

   in period land above w0 in period 2. The period 2 wage gain following

a success is greater than the period 1 loss both because of the role of

discounting and the belief that there will only be a probability p that

the wage gain will occur.

       The company has no incentive to renege on the offered wage contract.

If this possibility were perceived, company profits would be 32' which

forthcoming—a).

 is below 1133• If the termination policy were not perceived by workers,

 the firm's profits would be the same as rr21, which is also below ri33.

 In short, the turnover properties and incentives to alter behavior over

 time have been included as endogenous elements of the model and involve

no additional behavioral stipulations.

     These findings also suggest that the observed negative wage—turnover relation

may not be simply due to the compensating differential situation in which

members of a homogeneous group of workersquit if the wage is insufficient.

The negative relation between the observed period 1 wage and turnover

reflects the fact that poorly matched workers earn lower wages and are

more likely to quit than are successfully matched workers. This property

holds for all models considered in subsequent sections as well. The negative

turnover—wage relation is an endogenously determined aspect of matching

processes with imperfect information.

     Although the particular wage level does not affect the specific

information equilibrium16, the competitive firm will set the wage level

for the marginal worker using equation 1, appropriating all of the surplus

associated with training.17 The worker has no incentive to take retaliatory

action such as quitting, nor will he have any effective means of doing so.

Market competition is assumed to drive any profits reaped by the company

to zero, although this property Is not required for any of the results here.



            assumes of course that some worker does not earn such a great
rent from the job that he remains after an unfavorable period 1 experience.
            statement pertains to the marginal worker. Infra—marginal
workers may, of course, reap a surplus.

     III. GENERAL WORKER INFORMATION AND SPECIFIC INFORMATION

              -              FOR   ENTEPSES

A. Outcomes with No Wage Policy Changes

     Suppose that the worker's experiences at the firm alter his prob-

abilistic beliefs regarding his expected performance at some other job.

In much the same fashion as general training alters the worker's productivity

elsewhere, general information affects the worker's expected productivity

at another firm as well as his firm—specific productivity.18 This generality

is of no direct consequence to the firm, which continues to engage in specific

information acquisition.

     Following an unfavorable job outcome, the worker can still pursue his

null alternative w0. Following a successful job outcome he can switch to

a related job at another enterprise for which his probabilistic perceptions

have been altered by the period 1 success. This job offers an expected

wage w >            Since the possibility of remaining on the uncertain job
            w0.19
after an unfavorable outcome remains a dominated alternative, general

Information introduces a fifth worker strategy —— choosing the null alterna-

tive (w0) after an unfavorable outcome and switching to the independent

uncertain job offering w after a success.

If    the Inequality Is reversed, the two highest ranked outcomes by the

worker are u1, indicated by rank 0', and u51, Indicated by rank 0,

       General information acquisition by the worker that leads to certain

worker turnover simply transforms the situation into a dominated case

considered earlier, where

                           =1111.
       Figure II presents the expanded payoff matrix for this game. The

worker will adopt his dominant strategy 5, which is the only turnover

path that offers the possibility ofeither of his two most highly valued

rewards. Strategy 3 remains dominant for the firm. As before, the order

of moves and strategic behavior is irrelevant, as the stable equilibrium

is necessarily (5,3).
                                  —17—


      An important issue Is whether this equilibrium is efficient. Since

the wage payments remain simply transfers, the problem is whether the

expected product has been maximized. A competitive market will, set w
                                                                     S
equal to the worker's expected general output so that the decision to

switch firms after a successful outcome will be efficient If the profit to the

firm if the worker did not quit plus the opportunity cost of a replacement (w0)

is below w plus the expected product of a replacement. This condition

reduces to
                        *
          wS >w0+x(q—q)
or
                        *
(8)       w8 —w 0>x(q—q)..
                             *           *
If one sets p equal to q and p equal to q to abstract from problems

of differing probabilistic beliefs, the worker will choose to quit

following a period 1 success if
                         *
          wS —w 0 >   c(g —g)
(9)
                        i+iq

Even if c is set at its maximum   value   (c=x) that fully reflects the worker's

productivity, the right—hand term in equation 9 will be smaller than in

equation 8. There will be too much turnover and a bias toward opportunities

elsewhere if the wage structure remains the same as in the specific informa-

tion case.   The difficulty lies in the denominator of equation 9, or the

fact that the base wage rate is the same In each period and is not manip-

ulated to reflect the worker's changing opportunities. The next two

sections will explore alternative wage mechanisms.
                                         —18—

B. Contract Termination Fees

       If workers acquire general information and their period 2 productivity

is always greater elsewhere after a success, a simple solution would be to

hire workers for a single period only and lower the initial wage rate to

keep the workers at their reservation wage level in view of their improved

opportunities. While efficient, if the worker's productivity is greater

elsewhere, this situation is not particularly interesting, since it provides

no mechanism that assures that job allocations will be efficient for dif-

ferent relative productivity levels.

       The first possible mechanism that will take such ramifications into

account Is to charge all workers a contract termination fee f. Workers

with a period 1 successful outcome will stay If

           w —       f<w—      (i_p*)c
or


(10)       f > w      — [w —    (l_p*)c]
while those with unfavorable outcomes will quit if

                 —   f>w—      (l—p)c    ,




or

(11)       f <        — [w — (i—p )c]
                 w0

I will assume equation 11 is satisfied and that equation 10 is potentially

satisfied or else the highest attainable profit will be       which is
                                           —19—

below ri33. Workers with low period 1 productivity consequently leave the
       20
firm

       The firm sets its reservation wage w such that


(12)        w0 + bw0 = w — (l—p)c +bp Max[w —              f,   w —   (l_p*)cJ

                                  + b(l—p)(w0—f)

Two situations must be considered: a) the worker switches to w following

a successful period 1 outcome and b) the worker remains at the firm

following a successful outcome. The firm can select either of these

situations by manipulating f.

       Using equation 12, one can solve for the respective wage rates in

each of these situations, yielding

            W   =
                    w0
                         ÷   bf   + (l—p)c —
                                               bp(w8—w0)
and


            b
                =
                    0
                         +   b(l—p)f
                                  i+bp
                                         + c[ l+bp
                                               + bp(1_p*)ej


The worker is unaffected by increases in f because his wages increase

accordingly.


     20
       Alternatively, the firm could avoid these complications by imposing
f only if a worker terminates a match with a successful outcome. This
modification would alter the wage level but leave the equilibrium outcome
and its properties unaffected. The change would, however, raise the
practical issue of whether the worker and employer could agree on the
period 1 outcome if the worker were to be penalized on the basis of that
judgment.
                                         —20—


      The profits over two periods21 for each policy are given by

              =   y — (l—q)x + (l—q)c — w + bf ÷ b[y — (l—q)x —

and

              =     — (l—q)x + (l—q)c —              + bq[y   —   (l_q*)x
                                                Wb

                   + (l_q*)c -
                                      wb] + b(l—q)[y- (l-q)x — w0           f]


Substituting for Wa and Wb and ignoring possible differences in the

probabilistic beliefs of the worker and firm (i.e., setting p =                  q, p =q*),
one finds that it
                  a exceeds      it
                                    b

              —
                  w0
                       > x[q*   —   q]

and conversely. The choice of whether to retain the worker or not using f

coincides with the efficiency criterion outlins. above in equation 8.

The particular level of f is irrelevant, provided that equation 11 is

satisfied and the f value yields the desired turnover properties for

and itb as determined using equationlO. The use of the f mechanisms

raises period 1 wages and lowers expected period 2 rewards for workers.

      Although efficient, fees for contract termination are difficult to

enforce since the worker has no incentive to reimburse the firm after he

1eaves. Imperfectly portable or not fully vested pension plans can serve



     21Unlike the specific information case, it is not appropriate to
look at profits on a discounted worker basis for employment paths. That
approach would be biased in favor of general information, whose gains
would appear to be reaped in every period through lower wages, whereas
specific information only offers deferred rewards. In reality, the time
lags for each are identical.
                                   —21—


this function to the extent that the worker loses his benefit rights

when he leaves the firm. Recent pension regulations (ERISA) limit the

use of pensions as a mobility—reducing instrument by imposing minimal

standards on pension benefit transferability.


C. The Optimal Wage Structure

       A more viable alternative to contract termination fees is a temporal

variation in the wage structure. Suppose that the worker would quit in

period 2 if w1 were offered or else the problem is not particularly

interesting.22 The minimal period 2 wage that will keep the worker fol-

lowing a favorable period 1 outcome is w8, where


(13)          w   w8 —   (l_p*)c
or
                         *
             w = w + (i—p )c
              8   s

As before, the worker finds it optimal to quit following an unfavorable

outcome, as does the company.

       The worker's expected post—success wage Is thus w whether he

switches to the alternative job or is offered a sufficient wage to keep

him   at   the firm since equation 13 will be satisfied. The lowest first—

period wage w that will attract the worker to the firm consequently

satisfies

           + by0 = w   — (i—p)c + bpw + b(l—p)w0


or

       w     w0 + bp(w0—w) + (i—p)c


       22The problem then Is the same as that in Section II.
                                           —22—

       The issue for the firm is whether it should let the worker quit in

period 2 or whether it should raise the period 2wage to w following a

success.23 These two options have the same output and wage costs in

period 1 and in period 2 following an unsuccessful outcome. The only

matter of interest is which is preferable following a success. The pro-

fits      associated with continuing the match are

               =   y   —   x(l_q*) —   w


wherew is the net expected wage from equation 13 (w —           (l_p*)c),   assum-

ing p and q coincide. The value of discontinuing the match and hiring

a new worker for one period is d' where

               =   y — x(l—q) — w2 + (l—p)c = y — x(l—q) — w0

assuming p equals q. The firm will continue the match (it        > lid) provided
that

            x(q*_q) >      v   —


This   criterion coincides with the efficiency criterion in equation 8.

Employment matches are continued only if the expected productivity at the

firm is greater than the worker's productivity elsewhere.

       The wage schedule that achieves this outcome always lowers the

worker's period 1 wage as the worker in effect pays for information

acquisition in much the same manner as he would for general training.

The expected period 2 wage following a success is always w whether the

   23
     In either case, workers are assumed to know this wage structure
in advance.
                                  —23—

firm adopts      or d The period 2 wage after an unfavorable outcome is

w0, as before.


D. Implications of General Information

      General information acquisition steepens the age—earnings profile

more than would the specific information component of the process. When-

ever the temporal wage structure is adopted, as is optimal when workers

quit successful matches when w1 is offered, there is a reduction in the

period 1 wage and an increase in the expected period 2 reward. The

resulting equilibrium is efficient if the wage structure is varied in this

manner. Contract termination fees, if feasible, also would be efficient.

      As with specific iearning/ the experimentation process offers greater

expected gains the more one's prior beliefs are updated after a successful

outcome. Both types of information lead to termination of.the employment

relationship after an unfavorable outcome, producing a negative wage—

turnover relationship. A productive work experience, however, will always

lead to continued employment with specific information, but will only

result in a continued relationship in the general case If the worker Is

more productive at the firm than he is elsewhere. The turnover rate

associated with general information acquisition will exceed that for specific

information. Both the wage structure and turnover properties of general

information are similar in many respects to those for general training.

                 IV. GENERAL INFORMATION FOR THE FIRM

A. Specific Information for Workers

     Thus far, workers have been viewed as acquiring information about
                                 —24—


 their productivity at the firm and elsewhere, while firms are only concerned

 with the worker's firm—specific productivity and any change in the worker's

 reservation wage that results from general information.    However, the firm

 may. also be engaged in a form of general information acquisition in which

 itlearns not simply about the productivity of a particular worker or class

 of workers, but he also updates his judgments regarding the productivity

 of other groups of workers in that employment situation.   The enterprise

may, for example, be resolving uncertainty about a production process. If

high school educated workers always. meet a production quota, one might infer

that the expected productivity of less educated workers might be sufficient

to warrant some lowering of the educational standard.

      Suppose that there are two types of workers, types 1 and 2, each of

which have the same reservation wage rates w0. Within each group, the

workers are identical. The firm assesses the prior probability that a

member of group I will be productive as q... Experiences of each class of

worker influence the posterior probability assessment for each group since

the probabilistic beliefs are assumed to be Interdependent. The firm

must choose which class of worker to hire in each period, where one worker

is hired in each period.23 The expected output in a period using typei

worker after observing c1 successful outcomes for type 1 workers, c2 unsuc-

cessful outcomes for type 1 workers, c3 successful outcomes for type 2 workers,

of the model are equally applicable to hiring N workers consisting of a
mix of type 1 and 2 workers in each period.

and a4 unsuccessful outcomes for type 2 workers will be indicated by

E(c1,c2,c3c4). The optimal turnover policy for the firm is assumed to

be known to workers and their probabilistic beliefs are assumed to be

accurate (i.e., p = q1,        p =   q)   so that expected net wage payments in

each period are w0 in this situation of specific worker information.

      The firm's decision problem Is to choose which type of worker to

hire in each period, or to optimize

             ii   = Max{[E1(O,O,O,O) + bq1Max[E1(l,O,O,O), E2(l,O,O,O)J

                     + b(l—q)Max[E1(O,l,O,O), E2(O,l,O,O)],

                     E2(OO,O,O) + bq2Max[E1(O,O,l,O), E2(O,O,lO)]
                     ÷                                            —
                         b(l—q2)Max[E1(O,O,O,l), E2(O,O,O,l)] — w0 by0

Since the wage costs are predetermined and reflect the worker's general

productivity, the maximization of it       simply   maximizes discounted expected

output. Profit maximization and social welfare maximization coincide.

As in the case of general information for workers, general learning by

firms may lead to termination of an employment relationship that was

successful in period 1.

      This possibility and the underlying motivation for the above model

can be illustrated further with the following example. Since wage costs

are identical for all possible options, they will be ignored. Moreover,

the interest rate r will be set equal to zero, resulting in a b value of 1.

Output y for a productive match is 1 and for an unproductive match is 0

(i.e., x =   1).
     Table I summarizes the probabilistic structure of the problem.
                                           —26—

Suppose there are two possible states of the world,                and 02• There
is a .1 probability that 01 pertains and a .9 probability that 02 is

the actual state. In e1 type 1 workers have a .8 probability of being

productive while type 2 workers always produce y equal to 1. In state
                                                                                          02
type 2 workers are always unproductive and type 1 workers have a .1 chance

of being productive. The issue is to select the optimal employment sequence.

        Before doing so, one needs two additional sets of Information. The

expected probabilities of each group being productive in period 1 can be

readily calculated from the data in Table I, implying that q1 is .17 and

     Is .1. The posterior probabilities of being productive hinge on the

first period outcome. Since there is only one trial, there will be no

ambiquity in letting 3P(Ojc.               1) denote the conditional probability

that O is the state after observing c. value of 1 where all of the other

ck ternis (k#j) equal 0. Using Bayes' Theorem, one can calculate

as
                            P(c 3.Pe 3.)P(e 1)
        P(0 c ) = —
           11                                            =        .8(.l)         =   47
                      P(c101)'(e1) + P(c1102)p(02)           .8(.l) +   .l(.9)

In   similar fashion, one finds the P(011c2)         equal.   .02, PC81e3) equals 1, and
P(011c4)   equals   zero.
       The value of ,r given the numerical values above and ignoring V0 is
            IT   Max(.l7 +      Max[.43, .47] + .83 Naxf.1l4,, .02],

                 .1   + .1 Max[.8, 1.0] + .9 Max[.l, 0J} = .34
The optimal sequence of decisions is to hire a type 1 worker in period 1,
switch to a type 2 worker after a favorable period 1 outcome (c1), and
continue to hire type 1 workers if the period 1 outcome is unfavorable
                                                                                          Cc2).

 Initial experimentation with type 1 workers is preferred because they

 offer sufficiently greater expected initial productivity. However, a

 successful outcome raises the conditional
                                                   probability of 01 sufficiently
 so that type 2 workers become more attractive. As was indicated above,

 general information by the firm may lead to termination of employment

 matches after successful productive efforts, whereas specific information

 never has this effect.


 B. General Information for Both Parties

        Suppose that the firm is engaged in the acquisition of information

 that affects its general probabilistic beliefs regarding both classes of

workers, while the workers are also engaged in a general information

acquisition process. Following a period 1 success, type 1 workers •can earn

an expected wage w1 elsewhere while type 2 workers can earn w2. The firm

has no incentive to keep any particular worker or to fire unproductive

workers since its learning is about classes of worker types not specific

Individuals. Assuming the worker and employer probabilistic beliefs

coincide, the expected net period 2 wage rate will be w0. In period 1, the

job offers workers the chance for general information and a higher period

2 wage elsewhere, producing a net wage rate of w0 —                      and
                                                            bq1(w1—w0)
   —               —
       bq2(w   2       w0) for type 1 and 2 workers, respectively.
       The wage structure will attract workers, and the turnover properties

are irrelevant. What remains an issue is whether the competitive firm's

employment policies will be efficient. Using the same notation as in

Section IVA, one finds the discounted expected profits are given, by
                                         —28—


                   =                     —        ÷ bq1(w51—w0) +
                       Max{E1(O,O,O,O)       w0

                       bq1Max[E1(l,O,O,O) — w0, E2(l,O,O,O) —w0] +


                       1(l—q1)Max[E1(O,l,O,O) —w0, E2(O,l,O,O) —w0]

                                         +
                       E2(O,O,O,O) —         bq2(w52w0) + bq2Max

                       (E1(O,O,l,O) —w0, E2(O,O,l,O) —wo] +


                        d(l—q2)Max[E1(O,O,O,l) —w0, E2(O,O,O,l) —w0]}

This expression can be rewritten as

              ii   = Max{E1(O,O,O,O) +bq1Max[E1(i,O,O,O) + w1 — w0

                       E2(l,O,O,O) + w1—w0] + b(l—q1)Max[E1(O,l,O,O),

                       E2(O,l,O,O)], E2(O,O,O,O) + bq2Max[E1(O,O,l,O) +

                           —                              +
                               w0, E2(O,O,l,O) + w2 — w0]

                       b(l—q2)Max[E1(O,O,O,l), E2(O,O,O,l)] —w0 —   bw
     This reformulation highlights the efficiency of the firm's objective.

The enterprise maximizes the expected initial product plus the discounted

expected period 2 output at the firm and any gain In the worker's productivity

(e.g., w1—w0), less the opportunity cost of labor. As in all of the cases

considered thus far, market outcomes will be efficient. The general information

situation has the high turnover and steep wage structure that one would expect

from a combination of the two general information models.


                                    V. CONCLUSION

     For employment matches undertaken with Initial uncertainty, one can draw

a distinction between general and specific information in much the same manner

as the traditional human capital treats specific and general training. For
                                   —29—


the worker, specific information only affects his probabilistic beliefs about

his productivity at his current place of employment, while general information

alters his probabilistic beliefs about work elsewhere. Specific information

for the firm influences only its assessment of a particular worker's pro-

ductivity, whereas with general Information the firm in effect learns about

the nature of the production process and the productivity of different types

of workers.

     With wage rates that can vary over time, the competitive equilibrium

contracts will result in efficient job allocations and levels of turnover.

There is no potential for strategic behavior that would alter this equilibrium

outcome. Both general and specific information steepen workers' earnings

profiles, though the extent of the increase is greater in the general case.

General information also leads to more termination of employment relationships

than does specific information. In both types of learning there will be an

observed negative relationship between turnover and wages. This relation

would hold apart from any compensating differential argument because workers

who are unproductive in the initial period earn lower wages and are more likely

to switch to an alternative job in the subsequent period.

     Throughout the analysis, no explicit training costs were incurred and no

changes in productivity took place. What did occur is that information generated

by work experiences enabled employers and workers to better identify the true

state of the world and to select the optimal match for that state, where all

state—specific productivity levels were assumed fixed. The diverse parallels

of the specific/general distinction in both the human capital training theory

and the employment matching analysis suggest that it is the specific/general
                                    —30—


nature of the productivity—enhancing activity which is more important than the

features of the process itself. This analysis of general and specific information

acquisition also strengthens the conceptual linkage between traditional human

capital theory and the more recent theory of marriage and other matching problems.
