The Term Structure of Interest Rates in India

                                           ABSTRACT

We examine the term structure of interest rates in India to see if the yield curve can be rationalized
based on the ‘expectations hypothesis’. Although we find evidence of predictability for holding
period returns, we reject the null hypothesis that the expectations hypothesis holds for the period
under consideration. Contrary to the finding in the US, the volatility of Indian bond returns is
consistent with the expectations hypothesis. Returns on long-term bonds are less volatile than
those of short-term bonds. The volatility puzzle documented by Shiller on US data is not observed
in Indian bond returns.

    1. Introduction:
        The financial sector plays a crucial dual role in any economy. It enables
households to smooth consumption over their life cycle by insuring against
idiosyncratic income shocks and channels savings to productive investments. As a
consequence, its role in economic development has received considerable attention
in the literature on emerging markets. The consensus is that an efficient and
transparent financial sector is a crucial concomitant of sustained economic
growth.1
        The growth and development of the financial sector in India has been
uneven. Indian equity markets have a long and colorful history.2 They grew
exponentially following economic reforms precipitated by the balance of payments
crisis in 1991, and the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) is currently a “top ten”
exchange in terms of market capitalization. Indian equity markets have also been
the subject of considerable academic research: almost every study conducted on a
major stock exchange has been replicated using Indian data sets.
        In marked contrast, debt markets in India have languished. Prior to 1991
the corporate bond market was virtually non-existent. The government debt
market was illiquid, as a large part of the outstanding debt was held as mandated
reserves by the banking sector. As a consequence, there has been little academic
work using Indian debt market data sets.
Figures 1 and 2 show the post 1990 evolution of these markets in both India and
the US.

  While there is a considerable literature documenting the correlation between economic growth
and financial development, Rajan and Zingales (1998) provide convincing evidence on causality.

  Indian equity markets had their inception in the early 1830s. The first organized exchange -- the
Native Share and Stock Brokers’ Association (the forerunner of the Bombay Stock Exchange) was
established in 1887 making it the oldest in Asia. The market experienced its first crash in 1865.
The run up in stock prices prior to the crash was a consequence of the increased demand for Indian
cotton precipitated by the disruption of cotton supplies due to the American Civil War.

       This chapter focuses on Indian debt markets for both government and
corporate debt and, in particular, on the term structure of interest rates of
government securities. We investigate whether the yield curve can be rationalized
based on the ‘expectations hypothesis’. To the best of our knowledge, the
expectations hypothesis not been tested in the Indian context. We also explore the
information content in the term structure and its implications for monetary policy.
       The chapter consists of 6 sections. Section 2 documents the evolution of
Indian debt markets. Section 3 presents an overview of the literature on the term
structure. In section 4 we report and interpret results on tests of the expectations
hypothesis and in section 5 we discuss some possible reasons for our findings.
Section 6 concludes the paper.

2.    The Evolution of Debt Markets in India
      The history of public debt in India dates back to the East India Company.
After its inception in 1935, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) was instrumental in
managing public debt, issuing debt as needed to finance both fiscal deficits and
infrastructure projects. By and large, Sovereign (GoI) debt was held by banks and
life insurance companies to maturity and until 1990, there was essentially no
secondary market where it was traded.
      Corporate investment was almost exclusively financed by equity issues,
private placement of bonds or by bank loans, a trend that continues to date.


The Government Securities Market

      Until 1990, the Government securities (G-Secs) market in India was
notably underdeveloped due to a variety of factors, including high statutory
liquidity ratios (SLRs) governing commercial banks, and administered interest
rates. Starting in 1992, a series of reforms were undertaken by the Reserve Bank
of India (RBI) and the government to develop and deepen the market: the setting
up of a system of Primary Dealers, a Treasury auction system, the introduction of
91-day Treasury bills and zero-coupon bonds, the introduction of repos in G-Secs
and other OTC instruments like Interest Rate Swaps. The Government Securities
Act of 2006 modernized the legal infrastructure for this market. For a
comprehensive summary of the reforms undertaken, the reader is referred to
Annex 1 of Mohan and Ray (2009). Table 1 presents some statistics documenting
the evolution of the market.

  Figures in columns 2, 3 and 4 are expressed as a percentage of GDP at market prices.



      The outstanding stock of internal government debt as a percentage of GDP
increased from 26.3% to almost 37% between 1990 and 2013. The percentage of
Gross Fiscal Deficit financed by market borrowings increased from 18% to over
90% over the same period. As summarized in Table 2, the ownership pattern of
these securities has also substantially changed. The fraction of Government of
India securities owned by commercial banks and insurance companies declined
from 67.7% to 53%, while the holdings of the RBI rose from less than 7% to 17%.
      Another notable development is the declining role of the RBI in the
primary G-Secs market, with the percentage of gross market auctions with
devolvement on the RBI declining to almost zero by 2006-7 compared to more
than 13% in 1996-97.

     Figures in the columns are a fraction of the total.




      Two other notable trends are (i) the progressive lengthening of the
maturity of outstanding debt, with average maturity increasing from 5.7 years in
1995-96 to 13.8 in 2005-06 and (ii) a deepening of the secondary market for
securities, as evidenced by a 50% increase in the share of repos in the market
transactions of G-Secs.


The Corporate Bond Market

      Post the 1990 reformative overhaul, the Government securities market has
expanded to an extent that its size is on par with trends in other emerging
economies (Table 3). The corporate debt market, however, is an outlier,
languishing in the bottom third of its cohort.

          This anomalous development has been extensively commented upon3 and
has been the subject of two ‘high powered’ government commissions.4 We do not
revisit their conclusions or review the discussion on the reasons postulated for the
under development of the corporate debt market. Suffice to say, they are largely
regulatory and include:


              a. Onerous and time consuming disclosure regulations relative to those
                   required for private placement.
              b. ‘Prudent Investment’ regulations that bias institutions towards
                   holding G-Secs and AAA corporates.
              c. Out dated bankruptcy laws and ineffective judicial enforcement.

                 As result of a heightened awareness that a well functioning corporate bond
market is a concomitant for continued capital formation and effective corporate
control, and the implementation of policy initiatives to this end, the last decade
has seen an uptick in this market (Figure 3).

             A major research initiative in finance focuses on the determinants of the
cross-sectional and time series properties of asset returns.
             An asset-pricing model is characterized by an operator that maps the
sequence of future random payoffs of an asset to a scalar, the current price of the
asset.5 If the law of one price6 holds in a securities market where trading occurs at
discrete points in time, this operator Ψ(.) can be represented as7
                                                                        ∞

 A securities market is arbitrage free if no security is a ‘free lottery’ and any portfolio of securities
with a zero payoff has zero price.

     If markets are incomplete, there will, in general, be multiple processes {ms +t ,t }s =1 such that (1)
holds. Not all of them need have a strictly positive support.


                                                                                                              10
       No arbitrage is a necessary condition for the existence of security market
equilibrium in an economy where all agents have access to the same information
set. If, however, there is an agent in the economy with preferences that can be
represented by a strictly increasing, continuous utility function defined over
security payoffs, then the no arbitrage condition is both necessary and sufficient
for the existence of a security market equilibrium11 (Dybvig and Ross (2008)). In
an economy characterized by such an agent and no arbitrage, all equilibrium
asset-pricing models are simply versions of equation (1) for different stochastic
                   ∞
processes {ms+t,t }s=1 , often referred to as stochastic discount factors or pricing

kernels.
       An important subclass of asset pricing models focuses on the pricing of
default free zero coupon bonds of varying maturities at a point in time. Since
these bonds make only one deterministic payoff they are easy to price, as equation
(1) simplifies to



                          Ps,t = Ψ({1s+t }) = E [ms+t,t | Φt ]                        (2)




where Ps,t is the price of an s period bond at time t. This bond has a unit payoff,

1s+t at time s+t. Security prices in this setting are simply the expected value of

the stochastic discount factors. For a one period bond, maturing at time t+1


                                P1,t = E [mt+1,t | Φt ]


                                Ps,t = E [mt+1,t Ps−1,t+1 | Φt ]                     (3)



11
  Households maximize utility given their endowments and security prices and supply equals
demand at these security prices.


                                                                                             11
           Hence if the process on mt+1,t is known, in principle a bond of any maturity

can be priced by chaining together the period discount factors (see footnote 8).

We next define some terms to be used later in this section and the following
sections.12


           The yield to maturity Ys,t of an s-period bond is defined by


                               Ps,t = (1 +Ys,t )−s                                   (4)


In the bond pricing literature it is common to use continuously compounded yields

( ys,t )


                               ys,t = ln(1 +Ys,t )


Hence


                               ys,t = −s −1ps,t                                      (5)




where ps,t = ln Ps,t . Henceforth, we will use lower case letters to denote log-

transformed variables.


           The (log) yield spread δs,t is the difference in yield between an s-period bond

and a 1-period bond.


                                   δs,t = ys,t −y1,t                               (6)


           The (log) holding period return, hs,t+1 , at time t, on an s-period bond is the


12
     Our definitions below draw on Campbell et al. (1997).


                                                                                           12
return on holding the bond from time t till t+1. It is a random variable at time t.


                             hs,t+1 = ps−1,t+1 − ps,t                         (7)


or using (5)


                     hs,t+1 = sys,t −(s −1)ys−1,t+1                           (8)


       The (log) s-period ahead forward rate at time t is the rate on an investment

in a one period bond from time s+t to s+t+1 that is implicit in current bond

prices. This future rate can be guaranteed at time t.


                     fs,t = ps,t − ps+1,t                                     (9)


       The term structure of interest rates at a point in time t refers to the (log)

yields to maturity ys,t for a set of default free zero coupon bonds. The yield curve

is a plot of these yields versus the time to maturity s. A time series plot of the
yields on government bonds of different maturities for India and the US is shown
in Figures 4 and 5. Figures 6 and 7 plot the term structure on February 29, 2012
and June 1 2015, for the two countries.

        The discussion so far has focused on a real economy, with payoffs and
prices denominated in the numeraire consumption good and ‘real’ returns. In
contrast, much of the term structure literature deals with the nominal term
structure of interest rates, primarily because government bonds in most countries
have nominal payoffs.13 One approach to pricing nominal bonds is to deflate
nominal prices by the price index and then use equation (3).


        If I t is the price index and Ptn the nominal price of the bond at time t, we

can rewrite (3) as


                          Ps,tn / I t = E [mt+1,t Ps−1,t+1
                                                    n
                                                           / I t+1 | Φt ]

or                       Ps,tn = E [mt+1,t Ps−1,t+1
                                             n
                                                    / Πt+1 | Φt ]                           (10)

or                       Ps,tn = E [mt+1,t
                                     *       n
                                           Ps−1,t+1 | Φt ]                                  (11)

                                                                                 *
where Πt+1 = I t+1 / I t is the gross inflation rate between time t and t+1 and mt+1,t

is the nominal stochastic discount factor.
        The various term structure models in the literature are different

specifications of the process on mt+1,t and Πt or the process mt+1,t may be modeled

directly.14 The process may be chosen in an ad hoc manner so as to match the
empirically observed yield curve15 or it may be endogenously determined in an

equilibrium model. In consumption-based asset pricing models, ms+1,t is usually

expressed as a function of the marginal rate of substitution of consumption
between time s and t of the agents who trade securities. For example Donaldson et

13
   In the US, Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) debuted in 1997 and research on the
real term structure is still in its infancy. See Pflueger, and Viceira (2013). India briefly issued
inflation indexed bonds in 1997 and again starting in 2013.
14
   This is what is commonly done in practice.
15
   Backus et al. (1998) provide an excellent introduction to this literature.


                                                                                                   16
al. (1992) and Backus et al (1989) model ms+t,t as β su ′(cs+t ) / u ′(ct ) . Here ct is the

aggregate per capita consumption at time t, u ′(ct ) is the marginal utility of

consumption at time t and β is the rate of time preference. In the case of constant

relative risk aversion (CRRA) preferences this specializes to β s (cs+t /ct )−α , where

α is the coefficient of relative risk aversion and simultaneously, the reciprocal of
the elasticity of intertemporal substitution.
           What is the information content in the yield curve? Do current short-term
rates predict future short-term rates? If the current yield spread is high does it
imply that future long rates will increase? i.e. is there a mapping from short-term
rates to long-term rates? Is this relationship stable over time? If it is stable, what
fraction of the change in long rates will be a change in ‘real rates’ as opposed to a
compensation for changes in the price level? These questions are not of mere
academic interest; they are of first order importance for policy makers. Monetary
policy acts on the short end of the yield curve but it is the real long-term rate
that is relevant for the investment decisions of firms that translate into economic
growth. A stable mapping from short term to real long term rates is necessary if
monetary policy is to be an effective tool for influencing real output. In fact, much
of the debate on the effectiveness of monetary policy can be recast in terms of the
stability of this mapping.

          We plan to examine some of these questions through the lens of the
expectations hypothesis. There are a number of versions of the expectations
hypothesis, some of them mutually inconsistent. (Ross et al. (1981)). However, the
difference in their implications is not quantitatively16 significant. In this study, we


16
     If bond returns are log normally distributed, it can be shown that the maximum ‘error’
                                                                           −1   2
introduced by using one version instead of the other is bounded by 2 ×(2 σ ) ; since the standard
deviation σ of bond returns is typically a few percentage points, the quantitative effect is small.
Technically, the error arises due to Jensen’s inequality ( E ln(x) ≠ ln E(x) and


                                                                                                  17
use the version used by Campbell and Shiller (1991), as we use their methodology.
Their interpretation emphasizes that the expected holding period returns on zero
coupon bonds of different maturities differ, at most, by a constant. This constant
may depend on the time to maturity but it is time invariant. Equivalently, the
hypothesis implies that the expected excess holding period returns of long bonds
over short bonds - the term premium - is a constant. Any model where the
                                                           *       n
product of the stochastic discount factor and bond price, mt+1,t Ps−1,t+1 in equation 11

is log normally distributed implies a constant term premium and is consistent with
the expectations hypothesis as we have defined it. This condition is satisfied by
numerous term structure models, including Vasicek (1977).

Using the notation developed earlier, this implies17


                         E(hs,t+1 −h1,t+1 ) = E(hs,t+1 )−y1,t = θs               (12)


or equivalently, using (8)


                              E(sys,t −(s −1)ys−1,t+1 )−y1,t = θs


which can be rewritten as


                 E(ys−1,t+1 )−ys,t = θs / (s −1) + (ys,t −y1,t ) / (s −1)        (13)


where θs is a time invariant constant.


        An implication of the expectations hypothesis that follows from (13) is that

if the current yield spread δs,t is high, the future long yield is expected to be

E(1 / x) ≠ 1 / E(x) ).
17
 Campbell et al. (1997) introduce yet another variation on the expectations hypothesis, the ‘pure
expectations hypothesis’. This is simply equation (12) with θs = 0 . We do not use this
interpretation here.


                                                                                               18
higher than the current long bond yield. Intuitively, if the s-period bond has a
higher yield than the one-period bond, the expected yield on the s-period bond
should rise over the next period to induce a capital loss if the expected holding
period returns are to be the same for the s-period and 1-period bonds.

       Another implication of the expectations hypothesis is that the long rate is
an average of expected future returns per period over the life of the bond. Using
(5) and (7) we see that


                                     1   s−1
                            ys,t =
                                     s
                                         ∑h
                                         i=0
                                               s−i,t+1+i




This has implications for the relative volatility of short and long rates: long-term
bonds should be less volatile than short-term bonds.

In the next section, we explore the implications of the expectations hypothesis
using data sets on Indian government securities.




                                                                                    19
4.           Tests of the Expectations Hypothesis

             In order to examine the nominal yield curve, we need the zero-coupon yield
     curve of government securities. Although most traded government bonds, especially
     those with long maturities are not pure discount bonds, they can be used to
     construct the zero-coupon yield curve. A widely used technique to do this is based

where β0 approximates the level of the yield curve, β1 approximates its slope, β2 the

curvature and β3 the convexity of the curve. The convexity captures the hump in

the yield curve at longer maturities (20 years or more). The specification in (14) is
the Svensson (1994) extension18 of the Nelson-Siegel (1987) formulation, which is a

special case of (14) with β3 = 0 .

             This technique of constructing nominal and real yield curves has been
extensively used. Giirkaynak, Sack and Wright (2007), for example, construct the
zero-coupon nominal (and real) yield curve for the United States using this

methodology. 19 The parameters β0 , β1 , β2 , β3 , τ1 and τ 2 are estimated using

maximum likelihood by minimizing the sum of squared deviations between actual
18
 This extension makes the fitted yield curve more flexible.
19
  The estimates for this nominal curve are updated daily, and are available from January 1972 on
 the Federal Reserve Board website.



                                                                                                                                        20
Treasury security prices and predicted prices.20 Other techniques for fitting the zero-
coupon curve include McCulloch (1990), using cubic splines and the Fama and Bliss
(1987) forward rate curve.21
        The National Stock Exchange (NSE) uses the Nelson-Siegel (1987)
methodology to estimate the zero-coupon yield curve for Indian government
securities22 using data on secondary market trades for government securities reported
on the Wholesale Debt Market. This market constitutes approximately 70% of the
secondary market volume in the traded GoI securities. The methodology used is
detailed in Darbha, Dutta Roy and Pawaskar (2000). A notable feature of the NSE
methodology is that it uses prices for each individual trade, for each bond traded on a
specific date, in contrast to the practice of using volume-weighted prices in deeper
and more liquid markets.
        In this study, we use the NSE data on the zero-coupon yields. Figure 4,
shows a time series plot of this data for the period January 2005-April 2015. For
purposes of comparison, the zero-coupon yields for the US, over the same time
period are shown in Figure 5.
         For the Indian case, nominal yields across the maturity structure move in
tandem for most of the sample period, except between 2008-10: even though the 1-
year yield had fallen to approximately 5% on average, 5- and 10-year yields remained
significantly higher. It is interesting to note that a similar (albeit, opposite)
discrepancy between the short- and long-term yields was observed in the United
States in 2004: as 1-year yields rose, longer term yields remained flat and briefly
declined. A similar disconnect between short and long rates was observed in the
Indian data in 2011 and 2013.

20
   The prices are weighted by the inverse of the duration of the securities. Underlying Treasury
security prices in the Giirkaynak, Sack and Wright estimation are obtained from CRSP (for prices
from 1961 - 1987), and from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York after 1987.
21
   For an application of this methodology to other countries see, for example, Jondeau and Ricart
(1999).
22
   The yield curve is updated daily.


                                                                                                    21
           A major difference between the US and Indian yields emerged in the in the
aftermath of the financial crisis and the subsequent ‘Quantitative Easing’ in the
US. While U.S. long-term yields declined, Indian long yields have remained steady
(and risen), except for the period between mid 2011-13. Finally, compared to the
near zero yields seen in the US, the short-term rates in India have been relatively
high.



 4.1 Tests of the Expectations Hypothesis

           There is a large extant literature on testing the expectations hypothesis. A
popular approach is to test if the condition in equation (13) holds using the
regression methodology in Campbell-Shiller (1991). The difference between the (s-1)-

period yield expected next period, and the current s - period yield ys,t is regressed

on the spread between the s and one-period yields:23

                                                      ⎛ y −y ⎞⎟
                                                      ⎜      1,t ⎟
                            ys−1,t+1 −ys,t = αs + γs ⎜⎜ s,t      ⎟ + εt .                     (15)
                                                      ⎜⎝ s −1 ⎟⎟⎠


 The expectations hypothesis implies that the slope coefficient γs in the Campbell-

 Shiller regression24 (15) should not be statistically different from one.25
           While the Campbell-Shiller regression tests movements in long-term yields
relative to the yield spread over short horizons, another strand of the literature
tests long-term movements in short yields as predicted by the yield spread. Fama


23
  Campbell and Shiller (1991) refer to the spread between the current s- and one-period yields as
the "perfect foresight" spread.
24
     One of the concerns with the Campbell-Shiller regression is that the long yield y s ,t appears on
both sides of the regression. Thus, the negative sign may be a result of measurement error. To
deal with this, Campbell and Shiller (1991) test the robustness of their results using instrument
variables for the long yields.
25
     In addition, under the pure expectations hypothesis the intercept term should be zero.




                                                                                                     22
and Bliss (1987) construct a forward rate spread and test if this spread can predict
the future spot rate. The authors find that the forecasting power of the term structure
improves as the time horizon increases. In this chapter, we restrict our attention to
the original Campbell-Shiller (1991) formulation.



 4.2 Campbell-Shiller Regression for U.S. Data

               The main finding for the U.S. datasets is that the Campbell-Shiller slope
 coefficient is smaller than one, and becomes negative at longer maturities. This
 implies that when the yield spread in the regression in (15) is high, the yield on the
 long-term bond falls over the life of the short-term bond, instead of rising, as
 predicted by the hypothesis. The robustness of these findings on the slope
 coefficient, across sample periods and combinations of yield maturities has been
 interpreted as a rejection of the expectations hypothesis in the data. Table 4
 presents a summary of the results from two prominent analyses.

 4.3 Campbell-Shiller Regression using Indian data sets

       “Does the slope of the term structure-the yield spread between longer-term
and shorter-term interest rates-predict future changes in interest rates? And if so,
is the predictive power of the yield spread in accordance with the expectations
theory of the term structure? These questions are important, both for forecasting
interest rates and for interpreting shifts in the yield curve”.

                                           Campbell and Shiller (1991)

       Given the central role of the expectations hypothesis in the term structure
 literature, we analyze this construct for the Indian case. To the best of our
 knowledge, the expectations hypothesis has not been tested in the Indian
 context.
    We look at four specific time periods: January 2002 - December 2007, January
 2006 - June 2009 and July 2009 - April 2015 in addition to a complete data set
 from January 2002 to April 2015. The first sample data subset is the period
 marking the beginning of the worldwide financial crisis; the second period
 corresponds to a period of financial turmoil in the United States and the third
 period to the aftermath of the crisis. In our regressions, we use the one-month
 Treasury bill rate as a proxy for the short rate.
    The slope coefficients of the Campbell-Shiller regression for the Indian
 nominal yield curve are reported in Tables 5A-D.

   Another implication of the expectations hypothesis is that when the yield
spread is positive, short yields tend to rise to equate returns over the life of the
long bond. To test this, we use the following regression, discussed in Campbell
(1995):

   This equation tests the relation between long-run changes in the short-term
interest rate and the yield spread for the 2002-2015 period. As before, if the
expectations hypothesis holds, the slope coefficient should not be statistically
different from one. The results are presented in Table 6; we find that for yield
maturities up to four years, slope coefficients are statistically larger than one. We
interpret this to imply that the yield spread has significant predictive power for
long-run changes in the short rates only up to the four-year maturity. Campbell
(1995) finds that in the U.S., the yield spread has predictive power for both the
short and long end of the maturity structure, but not at the medium term.
However, as in the U.S. data, the results in table 6 appear to contradict those of
table 5A. Campbell (1995) suggests that this may not be the case. In accordance
with his analysis, the size of the slope coefficients at the five- and seven-year
maturities in table 6 suggests that Indian investors are better informed about
future movements in short-term interest rates at medium-term horizons, rather
than at the shorter end of the maturity structure.

 4.4 Results

         For the period 2002-15 and the sub periods of interest our results provide

strong support for the predictability of nominal yields and for the predictability of

their difference in Indian bond data. As Table 5A (which spans the entire sample

period) documents, the estimated slope coefficients γ are significantly different

from zero for all bonds with duration 3 or more years, a pattern broadly repeated

in Tables 5B-D. However, these coefficients are also significantly different from 1,

which implies a rejection of the null hypothesis that the expectations hypothesis

holds.

         Our results for the entire sample period (Table 5A) are surprisingly similar
 to those for the US documented in Table 4. As the yield to maturity rises,
 patterns seen in the Campbell-Shiller coefficients for US data are replicated: the
 slope coefficients are smaller than 1, and negative. This implies that as the short
 yields rise, the expected long yields fall, instead of rising as predicted. The sub-
 sample analyses are also informative: other than at the very short end of the term
 structure,28 the slope coefficients for Indian data are quantitatively similar to those
 of the U.S. Notably, in the second and third subsamples, the deviations from the
 expectations hypothesis at the long end of the yield curve are almost double the
 coefficients observed for the U.S. and, in the most recent sample, the size of the
 slope coefficients are significantly smaller.
         A naïve strategy of buying high yielding long term bonds would have paid

off handsomely over the last 15 years, contrary to the predictions of the

expectations hypothesis. The negative slope coefficients (notably large in Tables

5B and C) imply that in addition to high yields, investors in these bonds would

28
  For bonds with duration less than 2 years, in many instances we cannot reject the expectations
hypothesis. This is in contrast to the observations in the US.




                                                                                               30
have realized a substantial capital gain. However, investors holding high yielding

bonds with maturity less than one year would have realized capital losses.

       Our results on the term structure of variances for the Indian nominal yield

curve are consistent with the implications of the expectations hypothesis: the

variance of the yields on longer duration bonds is smaller than the variance of bonds

with a shorter duration. Over most time periods the variance of the 10-year yield is

less than half of the variance of the 1-year yield.

    Our observations are in contrast to those in the U.S. As Table 7B shows, in the
 most recent period, the long end of the curve is more volatile than the short end.
 During the Great Moderation period (1984-2007), the variance of the 10-year yield
 is approximately 80% of the 1-year yield implying that long bonds were excessively
 volatile. This ‘volatility puzzle’ is not observed in the Indian data.




                                                                                      31
5.     Rationalizing the Rejections of the Expectations Hypothesis

       The consistent rejections of the expectations hypothesis and the implied

predictable variation in excess returns for long bonds29 has been a ‘puzzle’ as it

suggests a trading strategy30 with higher expected returns than implied by the

constant term premium model. A number of explanations have been offered for this

‘predictability’ in bond returns. These explanations can be broadly classified into three

categories:

              a. Failure to account for a time-varying risk premium

              b. Bounded rationality and policy credibility of the central bank

              c.   The small sample properties of the test itself.



       In the following discussion, we analyze these explanations in some detail.

Time Varying Risk Premium: There is a strand of literature that argues that the

‘term premium’ regression in (15) is time varying and the failure to account for this

leads to a bias in the slope coefficient. A number of models that allow for a time-

varying term premium can rationalize the deviation of the slope coefficients from one

as a ‘risk premium’.

       Wachter (2006) introduces external habits in a consumption-based asset pricing

model with a short interest rate that varies with surplus consumption. This

endowment economy is successful in generating the negative Campbell-Shiller

coefficients as a risk premium that is positive and varies in a counter-cyclical manner.


 29
  As evidenced by the slope coefficients of the Campbell-Shiller regression being different from 1.
 30
  As noted by Campbell (1995), going long in bond holdings during periods in which the yield
curve is steep, and shorting in periods of a flat yield curve is an investment strategy that has,
historically, produced higher-than-average returns.




                                                                                                 32
Bansal and Shaliastovich (2012) show that the predictability in bond returns can arise

due to a time varying risk premia that increases with uncertainty about expected

inflation and falls with uncertainty about expected growth.

        While the literature has focused primarily on using the covariation or risk

premia term to explain predictability in expected excess returns, there is increasing

evidence to suggest that subjective expectations, which are different from those

implied by the true probability distribution of the underlying process of returns, may

be important.

Bounded Rationality and Credibility of Central Bank Policy: This explanation

proposes that investors in financial market have irrational expectations. The regression

in (15) is a joint test of the expectations hypothesis and the belief that investors have

rational expectations. If the latter is not true, the regression error will no longer be

orthogonal to the regressor and the slope coefficient will be biased. Kozicki and Tinsley

(2001) and Fuhrer (1996) use shifts in agents' expectations about monetary policy to

explain the rejection of the hypothesis in U.S. data. In the first paper, the authors link

changes in long-run forecasts of short yields to shifts in perceptions about the inflation

target. Adaptive learning is used to model agents' behavior as they update their

estimates of the long-run inflation target. These shifting endpoints in the short rates

are incorporated into the determination of longer yields, and the expectations

hypothesis is no longer rejected. Fuhrer (1996) models the short rate as being

determined by the Federal Reserve, in response to output gap and inflation. He finds

that the changes in the Federal Reserve's inflation target and response coefficients (to

output gap and inflation) lead to variations in the long nominal rates of the magnitude




                                                                                           33
that are observed in the data.31 He (1996) concludes that if shifts in the expectation

formation process of future short rates is accounted for, the hypothesis fares well

relative to the data.

             A rich literature has attempted to explain the findings on the Campbell-Shiller

coefficients by allowing for a time-varying term premia and subjective expectations. It

is also useful to interpret the negative bias with respect to 1 as the under-reaction of

expected future yields of maturity (s-1) to changes in the current short yield. In

Froot's (1989) analysis, the test of the expectations hypothesis in (15) is decomposed

into two slope coefficients, one corresponding to the error in expectations and the

other a term premium. The first is found to be negative, that is, a portion of the

deviation of γ from one can be attributed to errors in expectations. It is also found

that at longer maturities, the slope coefficient corresponding to the term premium

becomes quantitatively less important.

             Mankiw and Summers (1984) also reject the hypothesis that expected future

yields are excessively sensitive to changes in the contemporaneous short yield, along

with the expectations hypothesis. They test if myopic expectations can justify the

rejections of the expectations hypothesis, but the latter is rejected as well - that is,

financial markets are 'hyperopic', giving lesser weight to contemporaneous

fundamentals than to future fundamentals.32

             Piazzesi, Salomao and Schneider (2015) and Sinha (2015) highlight the

importance of subjective expectations. In the first paper, using survey data for

professional forecasters in the U.S., the authors show that prior to 1980, when the


      31
           The long rates are derived using the expectations hypothesis.

32
     The authors use the term premia to explain the rejections of the expectations hypothesis


                                                                                                34
level of yields was rising and the yield spread was small, survey forecasters predicted

lower long yields than those that would be predicted by a statistical model. Since the

forecasters update their information about high long yields slowly, they predict lower

excess returns than were observed in the data. Thus, when the yield spread was low,

and yield levels were high, survey forecasters predicted that long rates would fall, as

seen in the empirical data. In Sinha (2015), the fact that optimizing agents

misperceive the current increase in the short yield (due to a monetary policy shock) as

an increase in yields for decisions they face over the infinite horizon results in a fall in

the actual expected future yields. Therefore, in an endowment economy framework,

the fact that the adaptive learners update their beliefs about yield processes slowly

leads them to predict different paths of yields than under the true model. Nimark

(2012) uses a model of trading to show that when traders have differential

information, the non-nested information sets imply that individual traders can

systematically exploit excess returns. They are able to take advantage of the

forecasting errors of other traders in the model, even when no trader is better informed

than the other. In Nimark's analysis, traders are rational, and the dispersion in their

expectations about bond returns are caused by observing different signals. Under

perfect information, the expectations hypothesis holds. However, when information

sets are non-nested, and long bonds are traded frequently (and not necessarily held to

maturity), the hypothesis no longer holds and excess returns are predictable.

       Kozicki and Tinsley (2005) explore bounded rationality of agents and relate it

to the credibility of monetary policy. Long term yields have long horizon inflation

expectations built into them. When the gap between long horizon inflation

expectations and current inflation is large, the difference between long and short rates



                                                                                          35
will also be large (this is the spread that appears in (15)). This may also be

interpreted as low perceived credibility of policy. As policy credibility rises, long rates

will fall. Thus, a large spread (reflecting low policy credibility) will precede falling long

rates, as credibility improves.



Properties of the Campbell - Shiller Test: Finally, the expectations hypothesis may be

rejected in the data because of the poor properties of the test itself, for finite sample

data. This may be due to high persistence in variables or learning. Bekaert and

Hodrick (2001) consider the Expectations Hypothesis in a vector auto-regressive

(VAR) framework. The VAR is estimated subject to the constraints of the

expectations hypothesis, and the authors use this system to generate data and

investigate the small sample properties of a variety of tests, such as the Wald test.

They find that the rejections of the hypothesis may be explained, in part, by the poor

properties of the Wald test in finite samples.

The rejections of the expectations hypothesis in the Indian context may arise due to a

combination of the diverse factors detailed above. Additional research is required to

disentangle and decompose the concomitants of predictability in expected returns.

6.      Information in the Term Structure, Policy Implications and Concluding

Comments

        The joint term structures of real33 and nominal interest rates encode critical

information about risk free discount factors and expectations of future inflation.

Both are crucial inputs for financing and investment decisions. Discount factors

are a benchmark for the pricing of financial assets in the economy and for

determining the cost of capital for capital budgeting, while expectations about

future inflation impact the formulation and implementation of monetary policy.

        Policymakers use the nominal term structure to infer expectations of

inflation and real interest rates. As Haubrich, Pennacchi and Ritchken (2012)

note, “Inflation expectations can gauge the credibility of a government’s fiscal and

monetary policies, whereas real rates measure the economic cost of financing

investments and the tightness of monetary policy”.

        Changes in the level of nominal yields can be attributed to changes in the

real interest rate, expected inflation or the inflation risk premium. Furthermore,

the term structure of nominal expected returns can be decomposed into the real

interest rate, the premium for holding a real long-term bond (the excess returns of

holding nominal long-term bonds over real bonds), expected inflation and the

inflation risk premium. An empirical identification of these different components,

and their response to different inflation regimes, has been a rapidly expanding area

of research for developed economies. Bansal and Shaliastovich (2012) use survey

data on GDP growth and inflation for the U.S. between 1969-2010 to identify the

33
  In the Indian context, however, the real term structure of interest rates is not available as
inflation indexed bonds have only been recently introduced. Hence expectations about future
inflation cannot be inferred from the term structure.



                                                                                                  37
link between nominal bond premia and volatilities in expected growth and

expected inflation. Uncertainty in real growth and inflation are found to have

significant predictive power for excess bond returns. The authors also find that the

nominal term premia decreases when real uncertainty declines, and increases with

rising inflation uncertainty. Similar results are obtained for U.K. data. Ang,

Bekaert and Wei (2008) use a model with regime switches, inflation and time-

varying prices of risk to identify whether changes in the nominal yields can be

attributed to real interest rates, expected inflation or inflation risk premia. The

authors document a negative correlation between the real short rate and expected

as well as unexpected inflation.

       Identifying the effects of expected inflation and inflation surprises on the

real interest rates for the Indian case has been relatively unexplored so far. There

is evidence to suggest, however, that there may be different inflation regimes in

the Indian data. Hutchison, Sengupta and Singh (2013) use a regime switching

model to investigate the monetary policy rule in the Indian context. The authors

find that the Reserve Bank of India did not adopt inflation targeting; empirical

estimates suggest that the RBI switched between two regimes, which are

distinguished by their relative emphasis on output and price stability. This

suggests that investigating the link between varying inflation volatility, nominal

excess returns and the real interest rate is an important avenue for future research

in the Indian context, which we intend to explore in subsequent work.



       While monetary policy clearly affects the short end of the yield curve it is
the real long-term rate that is relevant for the investment decisions of firms that



                                                                                      38
translate into economic growth. Much of the debate about the effectiveness of
monetary policy can be recast in terms of the mapping from short term to real
long term rates. There is, however, considerable disagreement in the literature
about the effectiveness of monetary policy in affecting real economic activity.
          Starting in May 2011 the RBI has used the repo rate as an instrument to
                                   34
implement monetary policy.              Lacking data on the real term structure, we explore
whether nominal long-term zero-coupon yields at different maturities respond to
changes in this policy rate. We consider the following regression:



                                  ∆ys,t = α + β (∆repot ) + εt                            (17)

          Table 8 presents the response of the one-, five- and ten-year yields to the
change in the repo rate35.

   Since we are using monthly data, there are several qualifications to our exercise. As noted by
Gurkaynak, Sack and Swanson (2005), this regression may be subject to the simultaneous equation
or omitted variables bias. For example, the change in the RBI’s policy rate may be a response of
the rate to the change in asset prices that took place in the previous month. That is, the change in
the policy rate is not a surprise. Analysis of the change in daily yields in response to surprise
changes in the repo rate is a promising topic for future research.

Note: This table reports the slope coefficients (β) from the regression in equation (17). The
numbers in brackets are the heteroscedasticity adjusted standard errors. The starred coefficients
are statistically different from zero.



        While there is clear evidence of predictability in the data, we find that the
mapping from short term to nominal long term rates over the period 2002 -15 is
not stable.36 Our results imply that implementing monetary policy in India would
prove to be a challenging exercise.




36
  It is possible that the mapping from real short term to real long term rates is stable but the risk
premium for inflation is time varying.
