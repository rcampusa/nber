Marketization of Production and the US-Europe Employment Gap
Richard B. Freeman and Ronald Schettkat
NBER Working Paper No. 8797
February 2002



                                              ABSTRACT

        Women work much more in the US than in Germany and most other EU economies. We find
that the US-German employment gap is not strongly related to cross-country differences in the level of
pay or social benefits. The difference in employment is due to the different marketization of activities
between the two economies: German women work as many hours as US women when we consider time
spent in household production as well as in market production.
        For instance, German women spend more time preparing meals while US women use take-out
and restaurants more intensely. The organization of some social activities, such as schooling, and the
dispersion of skills, as well as pay differences, affect the degree of marketization.

Marketization of Production and the US-Europe
Employment gap

       The US and major EU countries such as Germany1 had very different employment records in
the 1980s and 1990s. In the early 1970s the employment population rate was similar in the US and
in major EU countries while unemployment rates were lower in the EU. But in the 1980s and in the
1990s, the employment rate rose in the US to exceed that in the EU while the US unemployment rate
fell to roughly half the EU level.
       The two most popular explanations for the employment gap are that on the demand side the
EU lost jobs because its wage-setting institutions compressed wage differentials below market
levels; while on the supply side EU welfare state provisions led many to remain jobless longer than
would otherwise be the case. Our analysis and that of others shows that these hypotheses cannot
explain the bulk of US-EU employment differences. If the most popular explanations do not work,
what does economics have to say about the causes of the differences?
       This paper argues that the low employment rate results from the greater marketization of
work in the US than in the EU -- the marketization hypothesis. It presents evidence that the EU
produces relatively more goods and services through household production and less through the
market than the US and analyzes how this difference directly reduces employment in low-skilled
service sectors and indirectly reduces the employment of highly educated women.
       Empirically, we use time budget data, consumer expenditure data, and measures of attitudes
toward work along with wages and employment by sector to demonstrate the differing levels of
marketization in the US and EU and assess the contribution of differences in marketization to the
employment gap. We argue that an advanced economy can achieve a low employment-population
rate/high share of home production equilibrium per the EU; or a high employment-population
rate/high share of market production equilibrium per the US. While our data deal with Germany and
the US, our findings reflect the difference between EU and American models of capitalism more
broadly.

1. Conventional Wisdom and the Employment gap


        In the1980s and 1990s the US had a 10 percentage point higher rate of employment to adult
population than Germany. The difference is due to a higher employment population rate in service
sectors (see table 1).        Throughout the period Germany had more employees per adult in
manufacturing and agriculture than the US but fewer employees per adult in services than the US.
From 1970 to 1995 manufacturing and agricultural employment per adult fell by 0.15 points in
Germany compared to 0.05 points in the US while service sector employment per adult grew in
Germany by 0.10 points compared to 0.15 points in the US. Service employment per adult and
industry and agriculture employment per adult in Germany in 1995 were comparable to US levels in
1970. If we view the increase in service sector employment as the “natural” path for advanced
capitalist systems, Germany is roughly 25 years behind the United States. The fact that the US-
German jobs gap occurs in the service sector raises the fundamental issue from the 1960s
structuralist-aggregate demand debates over whether the composition of employment can affect the
aggregate level of joblessness.
        The smaller number of service jobs per adult in Germany than in the US shows up in both the
least skilled service sectors and in high-tech and high skilled service sectors. The conventional
explanation of the US-EU employment gap focuses on the relative dearth of low skilled service
sector jobs in the EU because of the consequences on joblessness and social exclusion. It links the
employment gap in those sectors to low demand for low skill service work due to excessively high
EU wages for low skilled workers and to low supply of low skill service workers due to high social
benefits. This supply-demand story fits with the aggregate differences between the US and EU. But
it does not fit with disaggregated data on sectoral wages and employment or estimates of the
elasticity of demand and supply for workers with differing skills. The implication is that the
conventional analysis can only tell a small part of the employment gap story.
        One other feature of the US-German employment gap deserves attention. This is the
concentration of the gap among women. In 1995 the ratio of female employment to the female
population was 55.3% in Germany vs. 65.8% in the US, producing a 10.5 percentage point gap;


1 If not stated otherwise, Germany refers to West-Germany in this paper.
                                                                                           4
while the ratio for men was 73.9% in Germany vs. 79.5% in the US, producing a 5.6 percentage
point gap. Table 2 shows that the lower employment of women in Germany than in the US occurs for
women with and without children; for women in all skill categories. In addition, it shows that a
substantial and rising proportion of American women are in the top earnings categories. For
example, among those who earn over 1.66 times the mean earnings the share of women is 19.5% (up
from 8.4% in 1970). By contrast, the share of German women among those who earn 1.66 times
mean earnings is just 0.3% (up from 0.0% in 1970). There are some differences in the magnitude of
the employment gaps – they are highest for women without children and for those in the lowest skill
categories, but what is striking is that there are large gaps for all groups. Since women who do not
work in the market sector usually work in the household sector, this difference reflects differences in
the marketization of the economies. It is an important clue as to why the US and Germany differ so
much in service sector employment.


the labor demand side story
       The demand side of the conventional story is that among low skilled workers employment
rose in the US because real or relative earnings fell along a given demand curve while in the EU
employment fell along a given demand curve due to institutionally determined real wage increases.
       Many studies have tried to find the posited inverse relation between wages and employment
growth at the sectoral level in the EU [Card/ Kramarz/ Lemieux (1994); Katz/Loveman/
Blanchflower (1995); Krueger/ Pischke (1999); Freeman/ Schettkat (1999)] and could not find such
in the data. Noting that that unemployment rates were higher for all groups in the EU than in the US
Nickell and Bell (1996) also rejected the demand side story.
       The problem that industry level data poses for the conventional story can be seen in Figures 1
and 2. Figure 1 compares differences in employment-population rates and in relative wages by
industry between Germany and the US. If the conventional story were correct, we would expect that
the Germany-US employment-population rate gap would be larger when the German-US relative
wage ratio was larger. The figure shows no such pattern. Figure 2 links the difference in changes of
the national employment-population rates per industry to the difference in changes of industry-
specific wage in a difference in difference analysis. Again, if the conventional story was correct, the
change in the employment gaps by industry would be related to the change in wage gaps by industry.
                                                                                             5
But the scatter plot shows little relationship between the change in relative wages across the
countries and the change in relative employment.
         Furthermore, in Freeman/Schettkat (2001a) we find that despite the well-known differences
in wage-setting institutions relative industry mean wages (the mean wage of an industry divided by
the overall mean wage) are very similar in the US and in Germany. The correlation of the relative
industry mean wage between the countries is 0.78. But behind the similar relative industry mean
wages are very different intra-industry wage distributions, which are generally much wider in the US.
         Freeman/Schettkat (1999) made several estimates of the elasticity of demand for skilled vs.
unskilled workers for Germany and the US and came up with a modestly-sized elasticity for the US
and a negligible one for Germany that could explain little of the differential employment experience
between the two countries. Estimates of the elasticity of demand for US minimum wage workers
hover around -0.10. If we apply this estimate to aggregate less skilled worker employment, at most 5
percent of the German-US employment-population gap can be attributed to the 20-25% differences
in real wage growth between the US and Germany over the 1970-1995.2
         Some may argue that the data for industry-occupation comparisons across countries is too
weak to weigh heavily in rejecting the standard demand story. But evidence from the US also
contradicts the story: employment and hours grew among workers whose wages went up the most,
not among the less skilled whose wages fell relative to the average (Freeman, 1995). The huge rise
in female employment was accompanied by a rise in the female/male earnings gap, not by a fall in
that ratio. The positive association of changes in relative wages and relative employment are not
readily consistent with a story of employment that makes movement along a demand curve the major
factor in job creation. And in both Germany and the US, employment grew more in high wage
industries than in low wage industries.3



2
  Assume as a rough approximation that 20% of the German work force is low skilled. Then a 25% wage reduction
would increase employment by 2.5%. This would increase the total employment population ratio by 0.5 points (=.20 x
2.5).
3
   We regressed the difference in country-specific changes in employment-population rates on the difference in relative
industry wages in 1970 and obtained positive coefficients on the difference in relative wages. High paying industries
were growing more than the low-paying industries. That low-wage industries are growing faster than high wage industries
is a myth, both in the US and in Germany.

the labor supply story
          The supply side story that social benefits reduced the supply of workers to low wage service
sector jobs in the EU runs into serious problems when we examine the German benefit structure.(see
table 3). In 1995 the German social assistance program offered a monthly benefit of 1105 marks to
single jobless persons, to which they could add 200 marks through earnings before they lost benefits.
Given average monthly working hours of 169 this translates into 7.7 marks per hour. Workers
should thus reject any jobs that offer less than 7.7 marks per hour. As workers receive paid vacation
time as well as hourly pay, however, the minimal reservation wage should be somewhat lower –
about 12% lower by our estimate, or 6.9 marks. Adding the workers’ social security contributions of
20% in 1995 produces a social minimum determined reservation wage of 8.24 marks, which is about
29 percent of the average wage. Even ignoring the impact of paid vacation time, the social minimum
determined reservation wage is 9.3 marks or 32% of the mean wage. In the US social benefits are
virtually non-existent for single men, but the US has a minimum wage that effectively rules out most
very low-paying jobs. In 1995 the minimum was 34% of the average wage. These calculations make
it hard to argue that Germany has fewer low wage workers than the US because of the social
minimum. In neither country are many workers paid a third or less of the average wage. The largest
group of minimum wage workers in the US are teenagers, who in Germany would be in
apprenticeship programs and thus out of the job market.4




2 The Marketization Hypothesis


         If the demand and supply parts of the conventional story cannot explain the US-EU
employment rate gap, what else could account for the divergence in employment rates?
         We hypothesize that the missing factor is the different marketization of the US and EU

4
  Social assistance could still affect the employment structure through the demand side. Tax charges for social assistance
on employers of low wage workers are considerably higher in Germany than in the US. German employers pay 20
percent social security charges (compared to 7.5 percent for US employers) and about 12 percent higher wages because
of legally required vacation time (compared to about 4 percent higher wages due to vacation in the US). These
differences could reduce employment among low wage workers in Germany compared to the US. But the lack of any
relation between changes in employment and wages by sector suggests that this will be a difficult proposition to establish
empirically.

economies. The marketization hypothesis explains the US-German difference in employment in
terms of the way the differing locus of production between the market and household impacts the
market demand for labor. By producing goods in the market, the US creates demand for low skill
labor; whereas by producing goods at home, Germany does not create such demands. Firms combine
high skilled workers and lower skilled workers to produce commodities and services; whereas
households rely on the skills of their members. As long as some skilled and educated persons
produce in the household, rather than buying in the market, the demand for low skill labor will be
less in the economy with greater household production. At the same time, market alternatives to
household production the US makes it easy for educated women to work in the market, whereas in
Germany the lack of such alternatives makes full-time employment of women difficult. Differences
in work time fit well with the marketization story.      By working long hours and taking short
vacations, Americans earn money to buy goods in the market. By working fewer hours and taking
long vacations, Germans have more time to produce goods at home.
       To the extent that the US economy offers greater opportunities to substitute market
production for household production, we also expect greater responsiveness of Americans than
Germans to factors that increase the incentive to work and conversely smaller responsiveness of
Americans than Germans to factors that decrease the incentive to work.
       To what extent does data support the claimed greater marketization of the US than Germany?


consumption
       If Americans buy goods in the market that Germans produce at home, we would expect
Americans to spend a larger proportion of their incomes on private consumption than do Germans.
That Americans consume more and save less than Germans is well-established, though there are
other explanations for this pattern. The marketization hypothesis also predicts, however, differences
in the way Americans and Germans combine market goods and time to produce final consumption
and in the pattern of consumption items. Americans should spend more on market-produced final
goods while Germans spend more on intermediate goods to produce final commodities in the
household.
                                                                                                  8
           Table 4 contrasts the distribution of non-medical consumption expenditures in the US and
Germany in current prices as recorded in national income accounts.5 We exclude medical
expenditures because of the drastically different way the US and Germany provide medical services.
The US uses private spending paid by private insurance to a relatively greater extent than public
medical expenditures, while Germany like most EU countries relies largely on public spending.
           Consider first expenditures on the broad food, beverages, tobacco, and miscellaneous
category. In 1994 both American and German households spent about 30% of their incomes on food
and beverages. But they spent this money in different ways. In the US more than half of spending in
this area (16.7 points out of 30.3 points) went to restaurants and miscellaneous goods and services. In
Germany only 25% of the spending (7.3 points out of 30.2 points) went to restaurants and related
goods. By contrast, in 1994 Americans spent 12.3 percent of non-medical consumption expenditures
on food & beverages compared to 20.7 percent in Germany. The 9.4 percentage point difference
(16.7-7.3) in spending on restaurants and related services implies that at comparable levels of income
the US demands considerably more production in that sector, and thus has greater derived demand
for labor there.6
           The pattern of change in expenditures on restaurants also fits with this interpretation.
Between 1970 and 1994, the restaurant and miscellaneous share of US consumption increased by 4.2
percentage points, whereas the restaurant and miscellaneous share of German consumption increased
by 2.8 percentage points.
           The proportion of consumer spending on the broad furniture, furnishing, and household
equipment is also higher in Germany than in the US, but this does not reflect differences in the stock
of durable household consumption items, which are similar in American and German households.
But the Americans have larger refrigerators and, presumably, other appliances as well. These
differences imply that Americans substitute household capital equipment for time in taking care of

5
    The distribution of expenditures in constant (1990) prices tells a comparable story.
6
  It is often argued that Germans and other Europeans spend their vacation in other countries and thus create service
demand outside the domestic economy, i.e. in National Accounting terms they import services. German households spend
4.9% of their overall expenditures abroad compared to only 1.4% of American households. At the same, however, on
residents purchase goods and services amounting to 3.3% of overall final consumption expenditure in Germany, the
comparable US figure is 1.9%. Thus the net effect of 'consumption trading' (for all products not only services) is -1.6
percentage in Germany but 0.5 in the US.
                                                                                            9
their homes. Finally, expenditures on personal care show that Americans spend proportionately
more on this item, 3.5 percent of consumption versus 1.9 percent spending by Germans.7
         Overall, Americans buy more services in the market than do Germans, who buy more goods
used in household production.


time use
         The marketization hypothesis links differences in the allocation of time between Germans
and Americans to the observed differences in market spending. Germans should spend more time
preparing food at home and in other forms of household production than Americans, who should
spend more time working in the market. To examine the differences in time use in the two countries,
we turn to time budget studies. The German data are derived from the scientific use file
(Statistisches Bundesamt 1999) 'Wo bleibt die Zeit?' It was collected by means of diaries and
personal interviews as described in the Appendix.                The US data was collected by the Survey
Research Center at the University of Maryland. It was collected by telephone interviews, based on a
24-hour diary, again as described in the Appendix.
         Table 5 shows the hours per week spent on meal activities in Germany and the US. Germans
spend 1.8 hours more time eating than Americans and 2.2 hours more time preparing meals, for a
total of 4 hours of extra time per week eating and preparing meals. Among women the difference is
especially great -- 2.1 hours more time eating and 4.1 hours more time preparing meals, for a
differential of 6.2 hours per work. Hours of shopping time, by contrast, differ only modestly between
the countries. Germans spend a bit more time shopping than Americans even though stores are open
for fewer hours in Germany than in the US. But Americans spend more time travelling for personal
need than Germans. If we sum all of these activities on the notion that they are all household
production, we find that Americans spend less time than Germans in total.
         Table 6 displays time-use pattern in an average week for Americans and Germans in total and
by gender. The table differentiates between hours worked in the market, hours worked in household
production, including childcare, cleaning, preparation of meals, and repairs, and hours spent on


7
 This result confirms our conclusion that the US-German service employment differences is not caused by
differential rates of outsourcing of intermediate business services (see Freeman/ Schettkat 1998, Russo/ Schettkat
2001).
                                                                                           10
personal time. Americans spend 5.3 hours more in market work than do Germans and spend 6 hours
less in household production than Germans. If we sum market time and household time and reported
time spent on voluntary work, however, we get nearly same total hours worked, 53.6 hours in the US
and 54.6 hours in Germany. The difference is that 59% of American work time is in the market
compared to 48% of German work time.
       The allocation of time between the market and household differs most among women.
American women spent 7.7 (44%) more hours in market work than German women, while German
women spent one third more hours in household production. The higher average market-work time
of American women reflects the higher female labor force participation in the US and the greater
hours worked by employed women in the US than in Germany. Because the joblessness rate in
Germany is higher than in the US, comparisons of time budgets that include the unemployment will
overstate the time spent in home activities by employed Germans. However, this effect appears to be
modest. Time use budgets limited to employed persons give results similar to those in table 6.
       Table 6 divides leisure time into TV use and other activities. Americans watch 5.5 hours
more TV per week than Germans. From one perspective, watching TV is a home activity. It takes
place in the household rather than in a market setting. But from another perspective, it is
consumption of a market-produced item. Employment per adult in the entertainment sector is, in
fact, larger in the US than in Germany (see table 1).


family composition and child care
       The presence of children is a key determinant of the allocation of time between the market
and the household. Women with young children spend more time in household production than
other women. Men with young children, by contrast, work more hours in the market. In the US in
the 1950s women with children left the job market to be full-time at home. This pattern disappeared
in the latter half of the 20th century, so that many women with young children worked. German
behaviour has changed less.
       Table 7 compares the allocation of time by women with and without children. German
women in families with at least one child under 6 years spend over 20 hours a week taking care of
their child. American women in families with at least one child under 6 years just 11 hours a week
taking care of their child -- a 9 hour per week difference. The difference in time spent taking care of
                                                                                                11
children diminishes when we shift to women with children under 18 but there still remains a sizable
4.5 hours. Since Americans have more children than Germans these huge differences diminish when
we look at the entire adult population. But the fact that with fewer children, German women average
more hours in child-rearing than Americans is striking. Even men in Germany report spending more
time in child care than American men.


attitudes toward market work
       The greater American than German attachment to market work shows up in responses to a
variety of questions on attitudes toward work. Table 8 summarizes data on work attitudes from the
International Social Science Program (ISSP) surveys for the US and Germany. The ISSP is a cross-
country survey of attitudes toward issues of social import. All countries are responsible for their own
surveys but they ask the same questions on agreed-upon issues of social import and seek to maintain
comparability in wording and design. In 1989 and 1997 the ISSP focused on work and attitudes
toward work.
       The ISSP asked workers about whether or not they worked so hard (in the market) as to
interfere with their lives. In 1989 many more Americans than Germans said that they worked
sufficiently hard so as to interfere with their lives. But in 1997 the proportions are similar. The ISSP
also asked workers in both countries their preferences between working more or less hours. In 1989
Americans were far more likely to say that they wanted to work more hours than Germans. In 1997,
the pattern was similar but the difference between the countries was less. Another question that casts
light on the differential attachment of workers to the market is whether or not workers viewed their
job as „just a way to earn money“. In 1989 and in 1977 Germans and Americans answered quite
differently. In 1989 39% of German men agreed that their job was „just a way to make money“
while 46% disagreed with this statement -- a 7 point difference. Twenty-six percent of German
women agreed while 58 percent disagreed -- a 32 point difference. By contrast, just 24% of
American men agreed with the statement while 59% disagreed -- a 35 point difference; and just 20%
of American women agreed while 62 percent disagreed -- a 42 point difference. Between 1989 and
1997 the difference in responses between Germans and Americans declined, but still Americans were
more likely to view their job as more than a way of earning money than Germans. In 1989 the
percent disagreeing minus the percent agreeing was 7 points for German men and 32 points for
                                                                                       12
German women compared to 35 points for American men and 42 points for American women. The
ISSP also asked workers if (assuming they had income to live on) they would continue at their job
even without pay. In 1989 proportionately more Americans were likely to respond positively than
Germans, but in 1997 Germans were more likely to respond positively.
        In short, the attitudinal questions indicate that Americans are more attached to market work
than Germans in 1980, but that the differences diminished from 1989 to 1997.



3 Does Marketization Explain the Employment Gap?

        The data examined thus far support the claim that the US has marketized more production
than has Germany. To estimate the extent to which marketization of activities contributes to the US-
German employment gap, we undertake a two part analysis. First, we estimate how many extra jobs
Germany would have in the low skill service sector if Germans produced goods and services in the
market to the same extent as Americans do. Then, we contrast the impact of education and children
on the allocation of time of German and American women in order to assess the possible “knock-on”
effects that increased market production of low skill goods and services might have on the labor
supply of more educated German women.


Household production and less skilled market work
        If Germany reduced goods and services in the household to US levels and shifted production
of those goods and services to the market, it would create additional demand for low skill workers.
Absent a full model of the routes by which such a shift occurs – through lower savings; spending
shifts from less labor intensive to more labor intensive activities; increases in incomes created by
increased marketization – we make “back of the envelope” estimates of the order of magnitudes that
might be involved.
        Our rough estimates suggest a large impact of marketization on the employment gap. We
assume that labor input coefficients in the sectors are constant so that a percentage increase in market
spending produces a comparable increase in employment.8 With our data, we can undertake such an

 With a fixed coefficient b, d E = Eo (dS)/So, where dE is the change in employment, Eo is employment before the
change, dS is the change in sales, and So is sales before the change.

analysis for restaurants and related businesses. Table 4 shows that US consumers spent twice as
much on food in the market sector as Germans. Table 5 shows that US adults spent 2.2 hours less
preparing food in the household than Germans. If Germany doubled its spending on restaurants to
US levels and reduced household production of food, it would increase employment per adult in the
restaurant sector by 3.5 employees per adult – 35% of the 10.0 employment gap (see table 9).
Assuming that employees in the sector worked 30 hours per week, the marketization would increase
weekly employee hours per adult by 105. In turn, the reduction of 2.2 hours in household time
implies a drop of 220 hours of household work. Since the same amount of food would be consumed
in either case, this suggests that the market is approximately twice as productive as the household in
producing meals.9        This number seems plausible given that Germany has a sizeable “wedge”
between producing something at home and paying no taxes on household production and buying a
product in the market and paying income taxes and various charges on labor. We estimate that the
market would have to be at least 50% much more productive to compete with the household.10 If
we take this analysis a step further and assume that Germans reduced all of their household
production time to US levels, and that productivity in the market was twice that in the household, the
switch from household to market would close the entire employment gap.
         In short, as far as we can tell from a rough and ready calculation, increased marketization in
Germany would effectively resolve the employment gap with the US. From one perspective, this is
not surprising. Table 5 showed that total work time of Germans and Americans was essentially the
same. It was the division between household and market that differentiated the economies. Thus,
changing that division should bring German employment in the market closer to that of the United
States. Our restaurant and food example shows that marketization would directly raise employment
in an affected less skilled service sector by a considerable amount. But it is not only the less skilled



9
  Since the substitution is one from time spent in home cooking to time spent in restaurant cooking, this change should
have only minimal consequences for employment in the rest of economy. There may be some reduction in employment
in retail food stores but there will be potential increase in employment in wholesale food stores due to the increased
purchase by restaurants.
10
   Because workers pay a tax on their incomes and pay taxes on goods bought in the market, for the market to provide
goods and services, it must have a productivity advantage on average. Highly paid workers may buy goods and services
in the market even if they are more productive in household production than the market, because of the difference
between the own wage and the wage for a professional provider. This is a story of comparative not absolute advantage.
                                                                                                  14
service sectors that are likely to expand were Germany to marketize activities currently performed in
the household.


Market production and female workers
        Increased marketization of household production would “free up” the time of women to
engage more fully in market activities. Highly educated women and women with children, would
likely be the biggest beneficiaries of such a change. The highly educated would benefit because they
could increase working time and investment in their careers by reducing household production.
Women with children would benefit by being able to enter the job market more easily with market-
provided alternatives to home production, notably childcare facilities.
        To obtain some insight into the likely impact of increased marketization on the work done by
German women, we have estimated equations relating work time to the demographic characteristics
of women in Germany, where market alternatives are limited, and in the US, where market
alternatives to household production abound. With market alternatives available, educated women
should work disproportionately more in the US and women with children should be less deterred
from work in the US. In statistical terms, the positive coefficient on education in a work equation
should be greater in the US than in Germany while the negative coefficient on presence of children
should be smaller in the US than in Germany.
        Table 10 presents two sets of calculations designed to test this implication of the greater
availability of substitutes for household production. The top calculation gives the coefficients in a
logit analysis of whether or not someone works. It shows that education raises the employment of
US women more than of German women, with a coefficient (0.109) in the US equation that is
substantially and significantly higher than that (0.068) in the German equation. When we look
separately at university graduates (not shown in the table), the differential effect of education is even
stronger. In addition, we obtain a modestly smaller coefficient on the presence of children in the US
than in Germany for women with children 6-18 but effectively no difference among women with
children aged 6 or less. The difference among women with 6-18 year olds may reflect the greater
provision of after-school programs in the US,
    The bottom calculation in table 10 gives the coefficients on the ln of the percentage of work time
in the market from an analysis limited to women who are in the job market. It also shows that
                                                                                               15
education has a greater impact in increasing market work relative to household time in the US and
that presence of children less than six years of age is less of a deterrent to work in the US than in
Germany. The calculations do not demonstrate that the reason for the differences in the impact of
education and presence of children are the greater availability of market alternatives in the US. They
are, however, what we would expect in that situation.


4. Conclusion
    The primary implication of our analysis is that changes in market employment in Germany are
intrinsically tied to the marketization of household activities. As long as Germany maintains a more
extensive household production sector than the US, it is unlikely to reach US levels of employment
per adult. This, in turn, directs attention at the features of the German economy that have led to less
marketization of production in Germany than in the US.
    One such factor is the greater size of the tax wedge between working and producing at home in
Germany than the US due to higher rates of taxation and higher non-wage labor charges in Germany.
Our estimates in Table 3 suggest that the loss of income from working and buying products in the
market as opposed to producing at home is 0.30 ln points in Germany compared to .07 ln points in
the US, for a sizable 0.23 ln points difference. Another factor is the smaller dispersion of earnings in
Germany than in the US, which reduces the benefit of working in the market for higher paid workers.
The more narrow distribution of skills in Germany than in the US shown in scores on adult literacy
and numeracy (Freeman and Schettkat, 2001b) also helps explain the lesser marketization of
household activities. Just as there is less gain from international trade when countries have similar
factor endowments, there is less gain to be had from market transactions when persons have similar
skills.
    Another important potential cause of the employment gap among women is the greater
proportion of US than of German women with bachelor’s or higher degrees. About 22% of the
American women in working age had a bachelors or higher degree compared to only 11% of German
women.
    In addition, differences in life style – in how people want to spend their time and money – which
may reflect more than economic incentives may also play a part. Although Germans show a higher
preference for shorter working hours, the differences in attitudes toward work have diminished
                                                                                              16
between the US and Germany suggesting that the 'hard variables' gained importance. The tax-wedge,
the lower share of women among high-wage workers, and smaller share of highly educated women
are key concomitants for the high share of German household production.
   Assuming that we are correct and increased marketization is necessary for any increase in
employment-population rates, what micro-economic policies might raise employment in Germany?
One policy would be to reduce the wedge between market and non-market activity, through some
alteration in tax rates and social charges on low skill workers. Another would be to develop
additional after-school programs to allow mothers of school-age children to work or to work longer.
For university graduate women, yet additional policies might be needed that our study does not
address: affirmative action and flexibility in working hours. The bottom line is that increasing the
employment-population rate to US levels requires substantive changes in the way people allocate
their time and lives, which goes beyond the conventional wisdom on how to create more jobs.

Appendix I: The data

        The data used in this study is based on time budget surveys. The German data are derived
from the scientific use file (Statistisches Bundesamt 1999) 'Wo bleibt die Zeit?'. The data used
covers the former West Germany because the special situation in East Germany (in 1991/ 1992) may
be not representative for time-use. The data is representative of German households only; i.e.
households of non-Germans living in Germany were not included. The data was collected by means
of diaries and personal interviews between autumn 1991 and summer 1992 and covers about 32,0000
diaries, representing about 16,000 individuals (each person kept diaries for 2 consecutive days). In
the present study, only the adult population (18 to 64 years) is included. This left 17,998 diaries.

The US data (for details, see Triplett 1995) was collected by the Survey Research Center at the
University of Maryland and covers the period from September 1992 to October 1994. The data was
collected by means of telephone interviews. Each quarter of data collection was an independent
random sample but multiple chances of selection across quarters were avoided. Weekend and
weekdays were distinguished. The interviewees had to list all their activities for the day before the
interview in a 24-hour diary with detailed activity and location coding together with information on
demographic background. In households with more than one adult, the interviewee was selected at
random. A total of 9,386 interviews were conducted, 6,316 representing weekdays and 3,070
representing weekends. The present study has used only the time of adults (18 years to 64 years),
leaving us with a sample size of 6,062. The Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin kindly did the
computations because we did not have direct access to the individual data.

The two data sets have been made compatible with respect both to the time-use categories and the
period covered (in both countries, the whole year). The US data did not provide information on
wages and the German data provided only data on net household income in the preceding month. For
this reason, we estimated the wages used in this analysis from wage information available in the
CGAS (Comparable German American Structural Database, see Freeman/ Schettkat 2000). Although
wages are only estimated, the advantage of this procedure is that potential wages are assigned to
those persons who are not actually in employment. The correlation between the estimated wage and
the net household income for those households with a single income was .64 (significant at 1%).
