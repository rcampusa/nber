                               Inflation and the EMS

                                     Abstract

     Since the European Monetary System was instituted in March 1979, there

has been a dramatic reduction in the inflation rates of member countries.

This development    is widely attributed to the EMS      itself.   The purpose of this

                                                     basis for such a claim
paper is to argue that the theoretical and empirical

is far from conclusive.

     On the theoretical side, the paper develops a model which highlights two

issues.    First, changes in the 'rules" of the exchange rate system need not

coincide with changes in expectations about Central Bank behavior.           In fact,

expectations   in France do not seem to have changed until policy makers "got

tough" in 1982-83.     Second, different researchers have made quite different

assumptions    about exactly what "rules"   the    EMS imposes.    The paper shows that

how the system works matters in terms of the effect joining will have on

inflation.

     On the empirical side, the paper shows that effects which have been

attributed to the EMS    are   in large part due to the global deflation since

1979 and to the fact that EMS members had relatively          low inflation before

1979.     However, even these estimates   should be interpretedwith caution.

They are very sensitive to time period and to which nonEMS countries are
included in the sample.

I.   Introduction

      In 1978, the year before the European Monetary Syatem (EMS) waa

inatituted,    (GFI) inflation averaged 7.2% among the soon-to-be          membera.     The

ratea ranged from 2.7% in Germany to 12.0% in Italy.           Inflation    rates roae

even further during 1979-80, aa a tesult of the aecond oil shock.              By the end

of 1986, average EMS inflation had fallen to 2.4%, and the range had narrowed

considerably:    -0.2% in Germany and 5.9% in Italy.        The timing of these

developments suggests what I will call the "EMS-Inflation          Hypothesis"
                                                                                    .   that
the EMS itself may have been responsible for the inflation reduction and

convergence which member countries have experienced.

        There seems to be growing consensus        that the EMS-Inflation Hypothesis is

true.     To give two examples, the )&j1 Street Journal recently ststed without

qualification    that "the EMS has had its successes, such as helping to bring

inflation in the other countries      down toward the low level prevailing in West

Germany" (September     8, 1987)    Giavazzi and Pegano (1987) assert that "the

central issue is not whether the EMS is an effective disciplinary device for

inflation-prone countries....       It is obvious that their inflation will be

:ower    Ls:o   :.an   -:ce   tEe   1MG"

        In contrast, early studies of the EMS found little evidence supporting

the Hypothesis.     Rogoff (1985) analyses data through March, 1984.           He

:onciudea tnat:

      "the formation of the EMS did nor produce a rapid convergence of
      infletion rates. . . there is no evidence whatsoever of any convergence
      between France's, Germany's and Italy's inflation rates . .. any
      convergence that took place was between the inflation rates of Germany,
      Japan and the United Kingdom.   . . Even if French, German and Italian
                                           .



      inflation do ultimately converge at a low level, one should be cautious
      in sttributing this success to the existence of the EMS." (p. 96)




                                               1
Padoa Schioppa (1985) and lingerer et. al. (1983) are more optimistic, but also

find little evidenoe fot the Hypothesis.

       The putpose of this papet is to ask whether existing theoretioal and

empirical evidence supports the ourrent oonsensus that the EMS-Inflation

Hypothesis      is true.    It is difficult to test the proposition oonolusively,

because to do so would require comparison of the actual inflation experiences

of member countries to a counterfactual-           the inflation that these countries

would have experienced if they had not joined the EMS,            A simple comparison

of pre and post EMS experiences is inadequate for a number of reasons, in

psrticular, because external shocks were quite different            in the two periods.

Similarly, a simple comparison of member and nonmember            country experiences    is

inadequate because the economic structures of the two groups of countries               is

likely cc be quite different.         None-the-less,    it would seem sensible to

believe the Hypothesis only if the evidence (both theoretical and empirical)

consistently      supports an affitmative conclusion.

       Why should the EMS help to reduce inflation?          The usual argument is that

membership      in the EMS provides additional "discipline" to Monetary

Authorities      in inflation-prone countries.      The key channels of this

"oisoirlir.e"     are perhaps best Lllusrratsd      in. the :hsorsrmca. modeL ,ievsloped

by   Giavszzi   and Pagano (198?).        In their framework, joining the EMS

forces policy makers to accept a higher cost to
                                                expansionary policy through

Central Bank credibility when austerity            ia announced.    A familiar theme in

theoretical racroeconomic        literature   ia precisely     that the costs nf

disinflation will be smaller when domestic residents believe that the prcgram

will actually be followed.2

       However,    the paper can   gg   tell us whether joining the EMS is likely to

reduce inflation, because the theoretical framework begins with this as an

assumption.       Taking the EMS-Inflation Hypothesis as a given, the suthors'

interest is when inflation-prone         countries would gain from tying their hands.




    An alternative would have been to sssume that rsalignments not only

      In fact, there are meny reasons to doubt that the simple announcement

of joining the EMS has been viewed by either Monetary Authorities or domestir

residents as tying the hands of the Central Bank.          I have already mentioned

that virtually     no evidenoe of monetary or inflation convergenoe emerged

during 1979-82.     Sachs and Wyplosz    (1988) show that "stork prices, capital

outflows and the forward discount"       during parts of 1981, 1982 and early 1983

"all point to a significant worsening       in confidence"   (p. 294)      in French

macroeconomic    and exchange rate policy,      Expectations of disinflation

emerged,   not when France joined the EMS in 1979, but after domestic policies

turned sharply restrictive in 1982-83.         Many authors have discussed also the
role of capital controls in enabling France (and Italy) to conduct

independent monerary policies.3         It is not at all clear what role the            EM'S


played in the reversal.     In particular, if France had opted for austerity,

and had stuck to a consistent program of restraints, the disinflation may

well have occurred even if France had still belonged to the Snake.

     This paper applies work on international policy coordination to the EMS

to ask whether joining the EMS should have helped to reduce inflation rates

after the second oil shock.4      Other papers which study policy coordination                 in

 (1987) and are discussed further in Section II.

      This approach does allow us to ask whether, ceteris parabus, joining the

EMS is likely to reduce inflation.      Ic is also useful because it focuaea on

how the rules defining the interaction between countries affect the outcoaea.

     Three interrelated issues are involved: the impact on expectationa and

on wage setting behavior, the affect on Central Bank resolve and/cr

objectives and the implications of     changing the rules of the game".                Jhile

it is possible to eubaurne all three undec "changing the culea of the game"

and to derive the implications theoretically,       I   believe that the issues are

separate in the real world, and that it is useful to distinguish among them.

As discussed above, joining the EMS need not have tied the hands of the

French Central Bank, and need not have influenced expectations about future

prcea and exchange rates.      However, the EMS is an unusual multilatecal

exchange arrangement with different    'rules' than alternative exchange

arrangements.

     Section II of this paper applies the international policy coordination

approach to the EMS under alternative interaction rules.              It has two

objectives.     The first is to examine the implications of alternate exchange

      To anticipate one of the punchlines from the theoretical analysis, how

inflation within the EMS differa from inflation in a nonEMS regime depende

critically on how the EMS exchange tegime is specified.         Thie point is also

stressed by Canzoneri and Henderson (1987), however, they use a different

framework, and do not attempt to separate the effects of different        rules from

the effects of a change in credibility.

     In fact, there is widespread disagreement about how to model the System.

(The various approaches are discussed       in Section II.)   The paper shows that,

depending on one's view, one could expect that the EMS regime would either

raise or lower the mean and variance of inflation among members.         Thus,

theoretical analysis alone can not support or refute the EMS-Inflation

Mypothesis.     Many of the questions are empirical ones.
     There is relatively    little empirical analysis of the impact of the EMS

on inflation.     While a detailed empirical analysis is not the focus of this

paper, it is informative to explore some of the evidence.        Proponents   of the

Hypothesis often point to empirical findings in Ungerer et. ml. (1986).
Their paper estimates inflation equations across a large sample of industrial

countries   from 1974 to lpg4, and finds that the coefficient on an EMS "dummy"

variable    is consistently negative ano significant.    Mcwevec,   in addition   to

some econometric problems, there are alternative explanations for their

findings.     In particular, many nonEMS countries also underwent deflarions

after 1979.

     The paper is composed of three remaining sections.        Section II develops
a theoretical model, and identifies a number of ways to
                                                        specify the EMS

exchange regime.    It then examines the inflationary implications of various

regimes.    Section III reviews and extends the empirical evidence.      The final

section provides a summary and discussion of the EMS-Inflation                      Hypothesis

in light of the theoretical and empirical findings.



II.    A Theoretical Framework

        This section theoretically examines         the implications       of different

exchange regimes for the mean and the variance of intra-EMS                  inflation.         To

highlight     the view that the announcement of a change in government                   policy is
not enough to change perceptions about the future, I choose a version of the

two country Mundell Flemming model in which expectations                  are backward

-looking.      Oudiz (1985) uses a similar framework         to simulate the welfare

gains under alternative regimes for EMS countries.

        It   is important   to note that the framework considers deflation from an

initial inflationary position        -   a   realistic depiction of the post 1979              oil.


shock situation.       It does not analyse inflation arising from a game played by

labor unions and policy makers           which is the approach taken by Giavazzi and

Giovannini (1986b) and Canzoneri and Henderson (1987) among others.

Substituting       from   (5)      into (7)       it is clear that authorities in each country

simplify the notation, output ia taken as the instrument of the monetary

that is quadratic in inflation and output.7 As already mentioned it is not

necessary to consider the entire interremporal                       problem, because utility is

separable over time periods. The remainder of the section will drop the time

subscripts,         except where it is confusing to do so.

          To solve the model, each country's inflation must be solved for in terms

of outputs. This is easily done in two steps.                        First, equations (I) and (4)

give the following expressions for real exchange rates and real interest

rates:

                           1l+h)
          (9j         s             (y   -         +         U

                                {

As usual, the real exchange rate depends on differences in the policies of

the two countries, while the real interest rates depend on combined policies.

          The second step is to solve for inflation using equations (5), (6) and

(9)   .    Notice   that changes in expectations formation (u) are equivalent to

shifts in the predetermined portion of inflation (lr).                       France is assumed to




  Oudiz (1985) estimates a higher weight on inflation in Germany's objective

function than for any of the other EMS countries.                       Incorporating this

asymmetry would provide an additional channel for inflationary bias in

France.

first assymmetry between the two countries.

Our primary interest is in the average inflation rate and in the divergence

between the two countries inflation rates,                                     These are simple functions of

average outputs and of the divergence between outputs respectively.

      We also solve for French output as a function of the nominal exchange

rates, which will be useful for examining policy regimes in which the

exchange rate, not the money supply, is the policy instruosent, Using

equations    (1), (5) and (10), we get;

                                                                  hi
assume that the nominal exchange rate is set equal to a.




B.   The EMS: Alternativee

        The next step is to specify alternative exchange regiaes.    Ideally, we

would like to compare the EMS to the most likely nonEMS regime.       However, not

only is it is difficult to identify the latter, there is also considerable

disagreement    over how to best model the EMS itself.    The many views can be

grouped accotding to whethet policies ace chosen cooperatively or

non-cooperatively      and whether Germany and other members are treated

syr.metrically or asymetrically.

        Many authors assume both non-cooperative behavior and assymetry by

depicting Germany aa the "leader". For example, Fischer (1987, p. 41) says

that "the EMS can be viewed as an agreement by France and Italy to accept

German leadership in monetary policy, imposing constraints on domestic

monetary and fiscal policies."

       There are two different formulations of German leadership.     The first

assumes that Germany sets monetary policy while the other members subordinate

their monetary (and fiscal) policies to maintain fixed exchange rates.8           This

regime has been used to model the EMS by Ganzoneri       and Gray (983) and by

Roubini    (1987), while Oudiz (1985) uses it to model the Snake.    An

alternative assumption, adopted by Giavazzi and Giovannini (1986) ,        is   that




8
     For simplicity,   I model the EMS as establishing fixed exchange rates among

members between realignments.      This is potentiallyprob1n'eric for Italy,

which maintains bands of +/- 5.0%.


                                          12
Germany sets its monetary policy while the other members set their exchange

rates relative to the deutschemark.          One obvious problem with the first

approach is that it rules out the possibility of exchange rate adjustments

through real.igninent.    On the other hand, the second probably goes too far in

allowing exchange rate adjustment each "period'.               (The appropriateness    of the

alternative approaches is discussed further below.)

     Canroneri   and Henderson (1987) discuss both cases,             They point out that

it makes a difference which approach is taken.            The first is a game in which

both countries select quantities (of money)        ,   while   the second is a game in

which one player (Germany) selects a quantity while the other selects a price

(the exchange rate).      It is a well known result from game theory that, in

most cases, the outcome of a game depends on whether the instruments are

prices or quantities.

     Melitz (1985) takes the opposite tack,            He assumes that EMS policy

making is cooperative and treats the members symmetrically.              Roubini   (1987)

and Oudiz (1985) both condsider cooperation as one of many alternative views

of the EMS.

     Finally, countries may act symmetrically, but noncooperatively.                  If both

coL.c'r makats   sa   .'nonetarv poLicy as   an instrnment, and set chair own poLc;

under the assumption that the other country's           instrument is given, this

scenario   is the familiar   Cournot-Nash game which is often used as a benchmark

against which to compars the '1S.

     Thus, a total of five alternatives will be considered,              Three are

noncooperative   and assume that each policy maker sets its own ins rrnent to

minimize domestic loss, taking the other country's policy as gi.                   In the

remaining two, policies are set cooperatively based on an eqts1ly weighted



                                             13
function of losses in the two countties.                                   In each case, policy makers are

assumed to expect that real exchange rate expectations are static (u=O)

      To facilitate the comparisons, outcomes under each regime are depicted

grsphically,          From Equation (12), it is clear that, given                                          it    and    it, ya   and

inflation race, persues the more restrictive policy: ycy and yd<o (Table 1).

The French real exchange rate appreciates (see equation 9)                                             ,        and as shown in

Graphically,        Germany chooses the point along y—y which gives highest German

utility.        This is denoted by point C in Figure 1.

         Because Germany knows that France will follow its policy lead, there is

no competitive deflation.                          Policies are less restrictive in both countries

that in the Cournot Nash equilibrium discussed above.                          Average inflation La

The outcome (denoted by F in Figure 1) is more deflationary than the

into account France's higher base inflation (Table 2).                                        German welfare is

  Roubini (1987) points out that whether or not countries sterilize

intervention in foreign exchange markets determines whether a cooperative

system in name operates symmetrically in practive.


                                                                 17
      In the solution (Tables 1 and               2),   avatage inflation is tha same in tha

 two cooperative      regimes.       The only difference is that when realignment is

allowed,     the high inflation country (France) will follow more deflationary

policy, and will experience              a real appreciation.     Table I also shows that

output divergence, yd is larger under the cooperative regime with realignment

then it was in the noncooperativeNash.                   Therefore,    there is greater

convergence    of inflation rates.

     Graphicelly,         the outcome is denoted by R in Figure 1.                It is along the

constant average inflation line that passes through G.                     The larger output

divergence    relative to Cournot-Nash implies that the rey from R to the

origin is flatter than the ray from C to the origin, as drawn.



5..Money-Exchsnze-Rste Qj)            The finsl regime is the most complex.            Germany
sets output (monersry policy) taking the nominal exchange rate as
                                                                  given while
France controls the exchange rate, taking German output as
                                                           given.

To simplify notstion, we take xr(e+s) as the French policy instrument.                          As
shown in (23a)   ,   the   first order condition          for France parallels      the one from

the Nash game.       Even though the policy instrument hss changed, France would

like the same change in domestic output in
                                           response to changes in foreign

output as in the Nash game.

Equation 23a' gives the French reaction function.             An appreciation partially

offsets the German expansion so that France responds to a German expansion

with a smaller domestic expansion.

     Solving the German first order conditions, we get Germany's                  reaction

function in (26),       Notice that, given the nominal exchange rate, Germany

expects French output to move one-for-one with its own.             Not surprisingly,

the German reaction here parallels            the German Leadership game.

     To facilitate comparison of the outcome under this regime with the

outcomes under the other four regimes, we focus on the equilibrium values of

y and y   -   As before, the averages and divergences of output and inflation

are given in Tables 1 and        2.

     It is also useful to depict the outcomes graphically.                Figure 2 shows

 It also passes through the point GL.                        The equilibrium for the money exohange

        Although leae deflationary than the Nash, thia regime ia more

 deflationary than any of the other formulations of the EMS.                                        This ran be
 shown by noting from Table 2 that average output under the N,                                               F and   R

intuition is that France engages in the same

the Nash game.      But because Germany expeors

     Canzoneri   and Henderson           (1987) provide additional                  discussion of the choioe

        Figure 2 alao shows clearly that the tvo types of "Cerman-Leedership ate

very different.       If leadership means that high inflation EMS members must use

their policies      ro peg the exchange rate (C)   ,   the   outcome is less deflationary

than a cooperative policy would be.       The opposite is true if Cermmn leadership

means    that Cermany sets monetary policy independently,         and the other members

select the exchange rete (H)

        A   final issue is the extent of policy divergence.         While it is clear

that there is more output divergence      (and therefore inflation convergence)         in

the H than in the C regime, the comparison between the H and R regimes is

ambiguous.      Manipulating the expressions for         in Table   2,   it is possible to

show that policies diverge more in the R than in the H regime as long as a              is

not too small relative to      711   The smaller a, the less sensitive domestic

inflation rates are to foreign output, and the smaller the scope for EMS

members to manage polity differentials      cooperatively       so as to foster

inflation convergence.




11
     The algebraic condition is quite complex.         A sufficient (but not necessary

condition)     for greater inflation convergence with cooperative resHsnment

than with the money-exchange     regime is that a >      /2.

As discussed shove, the rsnklng of he money-exchange regime in terms of
inflation divergence is ambiguous. There Is clearly less divergence than in a
Mash game,   but there      msy be     either more or less than in the cooperative            regime

with   realignment.

       At the beginning of the EMS, all members had relatively high inflation

as a result cf the 1979 oil price increases.                Inflation rates would have

fallen under sny of the five regimes, however, they would have fallen less

under any of the four approaches to modeling the EMS than under a Cournot

Nash game.     Of course this very deflationary regime also produces the lowest

welfare.     ,anii he:anier is not so schein'eo'et            e     he proud Cf hers.

       The second point is that inflationary behavior in the EMS depends on how

the system is formuated,               The snsivsis above shows that the EMS will be

deflationary    if exchange rates are fixed, especially when Germany acts as the

leader.    The EMS is moat oeflarionary ef the high inflatirn countries use

exchenge rates as instruments while the low inflation ones set monetary

policy.

       Third, reductions In average inflation need not coincide with convergence




                                                   25
of inflation rates.     The most convergence is likely to occut when members

cooperatively    set both the exchange rate and monetary policies.     In general,

there is no convergence when the exchange rate is fixed between member

countries.

       Which of these regimes most accurately describes the EMS?      A complete

answer is beyond the scope of this paper.     Instead, I make two observations.

First, some evidence does suggest an assymaetric role for Germany.           Giavazri

and Giovannini (198?) and Roubini (1987) argue that Germany has conrir,ued to

sterilize the impact of foreign exchange interventions on the domestic mousy

supply.    As they point out, assymmetric sterilization can turn a systam with

symmetric rules for intervention into an assymmetric system.

       The second is that none of these regimes is likely to do a good job over

the entire 1979-198? period because none of these approaches accurately

captures the exchange rate management issue.      Exchange rates have ramainad

fixed over long periods of time.     Adjustments have come at irregular

intervals, and have been of various magnitudes.      With only a few adjustments,

it is difficult to tell whether or not the timing and magnitude has been a

cooperative decision.12

      Ins possibility is thac Germany acts as the .eader hecveen realignments




12
     Some recent papers apply models with fixed   o sts   to exchange rats

adjustment to examine the timing and isegnirude of exchange rate adjustments

in the EMS.     Giavazzi and Fagano (1985) assume that France is a small
                                                                         country

which can select the exchange rate.    Collins (l98?b) assumes that France and

Germany acr cooperatively.



                                        26
by setting monetary policy.                The extent to which other EMS members muac follow

dependa on the width of their exchange rate band and the importance of capital

controls.        However,     thia                 consistent with cooperation

D. Changes       in Exper tatcor's

       One     of the aos fraquer.tlv oitied teasoo                  fr who    the EMS should heLp

bring   down inflati n is that it might altar expootarions                            Our analysis so    far
has   ruled out thia (,anrel,              in fact, there is little avidence of shifts whan

the   EMS was rirst inatituted.              For example. Sachs and i'vplosz             (1985   argue

that expectations did not change until 1982-3.

      We now suppose tnat after a secies of restrictive measures, residents in

the high inflation country there is a decline in the inertial part of

inflation (a falls).            In the current formulation, the shift cornea about

through an expected real appreciation                     (a fall in u).     Alternatively,      the shift

could be introduced through the domestic pricing equation (5).

      The      impact on the average and the divergence of inflation rates can oe

found by differentiating the expressions in Table 2 with respect to a.

Since ouc oromar';        Interest Is on         the     relative sizas of the efracrs, the

     Although the Cournot-Nash regime was the most deflationsry, a fall in
the inettisl French inflation has the smallest effect on average inflation of

EMS members because both will engsge in less competitive deflation,           In fact,

the largest payoffs, in terms of lower aversge inflation, come in the Cermmn

leadership regime.    Since policy depends only on inertial inflation in

Germany, there is no offaeccing change in equilibrium policiea.

     Similarly,   che fall in   ir   has the largeac effect on inflacion

differentials under the two fixed exchange rare regimes.        Aa   diacuaaed above.

the ranking of the Cooperative-Realignment       and the Money-Exchange    regimes is

ambiguous.   In both of these regimes, a reduction in the initial inflation

differential will result in an offsetting reduction in the extent to which

polioies contribute   towards inflation convergence.

     This discussion provides one explanation for the original doubts but

reoent popularity of the EMS-Inflation Mypothesis.        During the first few years

of the EMS, there was little empirical evidenoe supporting the view that

joining had fostered convergence.        It was not until perceptions of government

policies changed some years later that observers noted the rapid deflation and

attributed it to the EMS.

III.   Empirical Evidence

       This section assesses some empirical evidence for the inflation

convergence hypothesis.       The results are not conclusive,          They should be
viewed as a first step to a detailed analysis of the data, which is beyond

the scope of this paper         It is useful to begin with an overview of the

inflation experiences for EMS and non-EMS countries.            I   consider seven EMS

countries and fifteen non-EMS countries from 1974 to           l986.


A.   Overview of the Infletion Experier.ce

       Table   3   shows the mean and standard deviation inflation rates for the

two country groups over different time periods.            As shown, the group of

non-EMS countries had larger average and more variable inflation rates than

the EMS countries both before the EMS l974-78" and after the EMS (1979-86)

was instituted.       The table aiso shows that, while the average inflation rates

declined in both country groups between 1974-78 and 1979-86, the decline was

larger within the EMS       22%) than outside the EMS (14%).          Furthermore, the

standard deviation of inflation rates increased only marginally within the EMS

but increased      bsantia11v    outside of the   Svs:erri.   These    facts provide some

support for          4.S-nflaton Hypothesis.




13
     The EMS countries are Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy and

the Netherlands.       The nonEMS countries are Australia, Austria, Canada,

Finland, Greece, Iceland, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain,

Sweden, Switzerland the United KinBdom and the United States.

      However, the Table shows no evidence of any average reduction or

convergence of inflation among EMS members during the first three years

(1979-82).   These indicators rose in the years following the second oil shock

for both country groups.

      It is also important to point out that the comparisons are sensitive

to which countries are included in the nonEMS group.         The broad sample

intluded in Table   3   provides the 'best case' for the Hypothesis.      EMS members

would more closely ressemble a comparator group which excluded Portugal,

Spain and espetially Iceland.        (Inflation in Iceland ranged from 22% to 86%

during 1974-86.)



B. Results   From Panel Data

      A second approach is to econometrically examine the differences between

the   tvo country groups using pooled cross-section.       cime caries daca.     Tdis

the approach followed by Ungerer et al. (1986).       They conclude that the EMS
did help to reduce inflation because they find a significant and negative

coefficient on an EMS dummy variable.       Their conclusions are explored below.

      For each country, real money demand is assumed to be an increasing

function of real income, and a decreaaing function of expected inflation.                 As

shown in Equation (27),        a simple log linear structure is assumed.

Expressing    the relationship in terms of growth rates and solving for

inflation gives Equation (28).

       A variety of options are available at this point               Following Ungeret et.

sl. we assume that the slope coefficients are identical across countries and

estimate equations using the pooled data set.                They substitute the actual

change in inflation for the difference in expected inflation rates, and

include a dummy variable (EMS) which is one for EMS members after 1979 and

zero otherwise.    We begin with this approach, and then include additional

dummy variables, and consider an alternative proxy for expected inflation.

       The first column from Table 4 reports the results following the approach

in Ungerer et. sI 14        As shoum, the EMS shift term is negative, although not

significant.    The magnitude implies that, other things equal, inflation in

EMS members was 0.9% smaller during the EMS period than either before 1979 oc

for noniMS ae.rie:s.




14
     The results in Table 7 diffac from those reported in Ungeret because of

differences in the time period and in the group of nonEMS countries.

Ungerer reports statistically significant EMS shift parameters.               The study

also presents estimates using alternative measures of inflation and money

growth.

     However,    there are many poasible explanations    for this finding.      In

particular, all countries may have experienced shifts in the behavior of

inflation after 1979.     Alternatively,    the EMS countries   could have had lower

average inflation before the EMS was instituted,

     The second column of Table    2   presents the results of a regression which

includes two additional shift parameters        One allows the EMS period (poet

1979) to diffec from the pta-EMS period for all runtries in the sample.

The other allows a separate constant terra for the EMS tether corntries in the

pre-EMS period.

     As shown in column 2     the additional vsrlahles have Iftale affect on the

estimated    relstionships between money and income groath and inflation.          But

the original EMS shift parameter decreases       in magnitude snd in significance.

The post-1979 durmsy end the earlier EMS dummy both have larger negative

coefficients.     The latter Is significantly different from zero.      These

results provide no support for the EMS-Inflation Hypothesis,

     In fact, if Iceland is axcluded from the country list, the point comes

through even more strongly.     These estimates are reported in column 3.

First, the fit of this simple regression equation deteriorates significantly.

Moat of tne i-:ar:oretLon can oe ettrbuted to tue dectsssao importance ot

money growth.     Second, the post 1979 dummy variable is now strongly

significant, while both ENS dummies decline in magnitude end in significance.

Whatever shift occurred after 1979, occurred among both EMS end nonEMS

countries,

     Table 4 does not support the inflation convergence hypothesis.          But

neither does it refute the hypothesis because the equations are seriously

misspecified.     Perhspa the most important problem is the usage of the actual



                                           33
inflation differential     as a proxy for expected      inflaoion.   Since this

variable includes the current inflaticn rate, it is clearly endogenous.              The

fourth and fifth columns of Table 4 addreea this problem by using lagged

inflation differentials     as a proxy for expectations.      Columns 4 and    5   report

regressions which include and which exclude Iceland respectively.             In both

cases, the explanatory power of the estimated equation declines,         and the

post-1979 dummy becomes less significant.

       Thus, there is evidence of a shift in inflation behavior after 1979

among industrialized    countries as a whole.     There is little or no evidence of

any special shifts among EMS members.        However,   these results should he

viewed as suggestive only.     They are very sensitive to whiob oountries are
included in the sample.      (They are also to the period of estimation.)

Furthermore,    the equations explain only a fraction of the
                                                             inflationary
behavior of these countries.     A conclusive analysis will require more

carefully specified    structures which allow for differences among countries.

This is an interesting area for future research,

IV    ConcIudtn Remarks
        Between 1979 and 1986          there   was   an impressive reduction and convergence
of inflation rates        among EMS members.              However coincidence alone is         not
enough    to determine caasality.             The fact      that   little   convergence occurred
during    the first half of the Systems existence makes the claims especially

suspect

        This paper has argued that changing                 be polic'r rfiime     can   affect   the
inflationary otcome in at              lest wo ways. Firc, it                can cnange market

perceptions and        increase credibility          in a   dlsinflatiorery      program.    Secord
it    alters the ru.es        of   the game     the instrments        vafiabe      to pclicy     maaer
and    the tradec,ffs they perceive from changing instruments.                     In the real

world, these two need not occur simultaneously.                      Evidence suggests      that
they did not, at least for France.                Vhfie joining the EMS may have altered

the rules of the game, it had Little initial impact of expectations                          or on        -
credibility, of the      high      inflation governments.           Changes in credibility,

price setting behavior and expectations came a few years later.

       The paper developed a          theoretical model        in which changes in the rules of

the game could be distinguIshed               from changes in       expecation    formation.     There
are    tnree tea La    to nts       first     rf caper tafions are backward- lancrng             an

is    likely   to be   less   deflationary than a noncooperative Cournot.Nash

alternative,      However, more deflation is not               necessarily      a good thing.        In

fact, welfare      is higher under less          deflationary       EMS regimes than ander         th
most   deflationary      noncooperatIve        regime,

       Second, it makes a difference             how the EMS works,           If Germany leads with

the other members maintaining               fixed exchange rates, then a move to more

cooperation would tend to            be deflationary.         However,      if German leadership




                                                     35
implies that the followers   select the exchange rate, a mote cooperative

regime would be more expansionary.

     Third, if a change in expectations comes about, perhaps because of

persistent and consistent policy makers, average inflation rates will fall

more under EMS regimes than under the Cournot-Nash alternative.     Again, the

particular   outcome depends critioally on how the EMS functions.   This result

may help to explain why many observers are now convinced that the EMS itsel.f

helped to reduce inflation even though there were few believers until

recently.

     Finally, simple cross-section   time-series analysis does not show

evidence of any shift in EMS inflation behavior after 1979.    Instead, there

is some evidence that all countries underwent a shift after 1979 and that

inflation rates were lower and less divergent within EMS countries even

before they joined the System.
