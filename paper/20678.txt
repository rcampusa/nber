                                              ABSTRACT

An economy in which investors know the true model and its parameters and filter the regime probability
from aggregate consumption history has been empirically rejected. Hypothesizing that prices partly
reflect investors belief about the regime, we infer beliefs from prices. The model fits well the moments
of the market return, risk free rate, and price-dividend ratio. Consistent with the data, it implies higher
mean and lower volatility of consumption and dividend growth rates, lower mean and volatility of
the market return and equity premium, and higher mean of the price-dividend ratio in the first regime
compared with the second one. The probability of recession in a year is 62:5% (23:7%) if the probability
of being in the first regime at the beginning of the year is lower (higher) than 50%. The results support
the hypothesis that investors employ a broader information set than just aggregate consumption history
in forming their beliefs.

1    Introduction

An overload of worldwide economic, business, and political news inundates investors.
Little is known as to how investors cope with this vast amount of information, which
subset of information they pay attention to, which heuristics they apply, and to what
extent they process information rationally. It is unlikely that investors, or even an
enlightened subset of them, formally quantify this vast array of information as a com-
pact vector, specify its dynamics, and formally lter their beliefs about the economic
regime. Researchers typically model investors as focusing on the histories of a limited
number of economic variables, for example, aggregate consumption, and applying a
  lter to rationally extract relevant information about the economy.
     We x ideas in a parsimonious Lucas (1978) economy with two regimes. The regime
is a Markov process with xed transition probabilities. The aggregate consumption and
dividend growth processes have conditional means and volatilities that depend on the
regime. Investors have Epstein-Zin recursive preferences. The investors know the true
model and its parameters but do not observe the regime. Each period investors receive
new information and revise their probability that the economy is in the rst regime.
     Johannes, Lochstoer, and Mou (2014, Table 4) considered such a model in the case
where the investorsÂ’ information set consists of the history of past consumption and
strongly rejected the model. The model does a poor job in generating the observed
unconditional moments of the risk free rate, equity premium, Sharpe ratio, and the
price-dividend ratio. They then proceeded to study the important problem of model
and parameter uncertainty, in addition to uncertainty about the regime. They showed
that considerations of model and parameter uncertainty substantially improve the abil-
ity of the model to match these moments, with the exception of the mean risk free rate
and the volatility of the price-dividend ratio.
     In our paper, we maintain the assumption that investors know the true model and
its parameters but relax the assumption that the investorsÂ’ information set consists
of the history of past consumption. We refrain from ascribing to investors super-
rationality or the ability and willingness to process vast amounts of information. We,
therefore, do not take a stand on the content of the information set that investors use
or the lter that they apply to form their beliefs. Instead, we recognize that, to some
extent, prices reÂ‡ect investorsÂ’ beliefs about the economic regime and use asset prices
to infer these beliefs. In particular, we demonstrate that investors employ a broader
information set than just the aggregate consumption history in forming their beliefs.
     We estimate the model, test it, and do not reject it. The model provides a good t
to the historically observed average levels of the market return and the risk free rate,
thereby oÂ¤ering an explanation of the equity premium and risk free rate puzzles. It
also matches well the volatility of the market return and market-wide price-dividend
ratio, thereby explaining the excess volatility puzzle.
     Using the point estimates of the model parameters and the time series of the price-
dividend ratio and interest rate, we extract the time series of the investorsÂ’ probability
that the economy is in the rst regime. The model implies higher mean and lower
volatility of the consumption and dividend growth rates in the rst regime compared


                                            2
to the second one, higher mean and volatility of the market return and the equity
premium in the second regime, and higher mean of the market-wide price-dividend
ratio in the rst regime. These features are consistent with the data. Finally, the
regimes are related to the business cycle: the probability of a recession in a year is
62:5% if the probability of being in the rst regime at the beginning of the year is
lower than 50%; and 23:7% if the probability of being in the rst regime exceeds 50%.
    The paper draws on several strands of the literature. It draws on the literature of
regime-switching models, for example, Bekaert and Engstrom (2010), Bonomo and Gar-
cia (1994), Cecchetti, Lam, and Mark (1990), Johannes, Lochstoer, and Mou (2014),
Kandel and Stambaugh (1990), Mehra and Prescott (1985), Rietz (1988), and Whitelaw
(2000), to mention only a few. It also draws on the literature of models where the agent
learns about the regime (or state) from observables. This literature is reviewed in Pas-
tor and Veronesi (2009).
    Our model incorporates recursive preferences introduced by Epstein and Zin (1989),
Kreps and Porteus (1978), and Weil (1989) which address investorsÂ’ attitudes toward
the timing of resolution of uncertainty of future consumption and cash Â‡ows and which
break the link between risk aversion and the intertemporal elasticity of substitution.
Bansal, Dittmar, and Lundblad (2005), Bansal and Yaron (2004), Hansen, Heaton,
and Li (2008), amongst others, incorporated long-run risks Â– low frequency properties
of the time series of dividends and aggregate consumption Â– in asset pricing models,
in conjunction with recursive preferences. Speci cally, Bansal and Yaron (2004) cali-
brated the preference parameters such that the model focuses on long-run risks of very
low frequency, whereas our estimates of the preference parameters are such that the
model focuses on intermediate-run risks at the business cycle frequency.
    The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present the regime shifts model.
We express the price-dividend ratio, risk free rate, expected equity premium, and
expected consumption and dividend growth rates as functions of the state variable,
the probability that the economy is in the rst regime. In Section 3, we discuss the
data. In Section 4, we estimate the model parameters with GM M . Using the point
estimates of the model parameters, we invert the expressions for the price-dividend
ratio and risk free rate as functions of the state variable and express the state variable
as a function of the price-dividend ratio and risk free rate. Armed with the time series
of the state variable, we address the questions raised in this paper. In Section 5, we
discuss the economic interpretation of the two regimes. Section 6 provides robustness
tests and Section 7 concludes. The Appendix contains the derivation of the main
results.




                                            3
2     Model

We model the aggregate consumption and dividend growth rates as having diÂ¤erent
mean and volatility across two latent regimes:

                             ct+1 = c;st+1 +  st+1 "c;t+1 ,                            (1)
                             dt+1 = d;st+1 +  st+1 "d;t+1 ,                           (2)

where ct+1 is the logarithm of aggregate consumption; dt+1 is the logarithm of the
aggregate stock market dividends; and st = 1; 2 is a variable that denotes the economic
regime. The means of consumption and dividend growth, c;st and d;st , and the level
of their volatilities,  st and  st , are generally diÂ¤erent in the two regimes. The shocks,
"c;t+1 and "d;t+1 , are assumed to be normally distributed with mean 0 and variance 1
and independent of each other as well as of the past.
    We assume that st follows a Markov process with the following transition probability
matrix:
                                                           
                                               1     1 2
                                     =                       ,                            (3)
                                             1 1       2
where 0 <  i < 1 for i = 1; 2. Therefore, the unconditional probability of st = 1 is
  1 2
2 1  2
           .
    The investor does not observe the regime st . Given his information set, z(t), he
calculates the probability, pt , at time t of being in regime st = 1:

                                  pt  P rob (st = 1jz(t))                                (4)
We do not take a stand on the content of the information set, z(t). In one extreme
case, it may be limited to the history of consumption and dividends. In the other
extreme case, it may include all publicly available information. In general, investors
 lter noisy signals of the state st to infer pt . These signals include a wide variety of
publicly available information which we do not model in this paper. Any speci cation
of this publicly available information is controversial and ultimately ad hoc. Therefore,
we do not take a stand on the nature of these signals. Furthermore, we do not take a
stand on the optimality of the lter that the investor applies to form his belief, pt .
    We model the innovation in pt+1 , pt+1 f (pt ), as
                                         (
                                             1f (pt )
                                            1+e"p;t+1
                                                       , if st+1 = 1
                         pt+1 f (pt ) =       f (pt )                                 (5)
                                            1+e"p;t+1
                                                       ; if st+1 = 2

where "p;t  N (0;  p ) and i:i:d: and is independent of "c;t and "d;t ; and f (pt ) 
(1  2 ) + ( 1 +  2 1) pt . In the special case "p;t+1 ! 1, pt+1 = 1, if st+1 = 1,
and pt+1 = 0, if st+1 = 2; that is, investors observe the true state without noise. Even
though "p;t is modeled to be independent of "c;t and "d;t , the innovation in beliefs is




                                              4
correlated with the innovations in consumption and dividend growth.1
    Note that this speci cation respects the constraint 0  pt+1  1. Also, the innova-
tion pt+1 f (pt ) is consistent with the de nition of f (pt ), since
                                                                          
                                                                   1
              E [pt+1 f (pt ) jpt ] = f (pt ) (1 f (pt )) E
                                                               1 + e"p;t+1
                                                                            
                                                                     1
                                          (1 f (pt )) f (pt )E
                                                                 1 + e"p;t+1
                                    = 0.

Finally, since E (E [pt+1 f (pt ) jpt ]) = p (1  2 ) ( 1 +  2 1) p = 0, the uncon-
                                                                                    1 2
ditional expectation of pt equals the unconditional probability of st = 1, p = 2    1  2
                                                                                             .
    We assume that the consumer has the version of Kreps and Porteus (1978) prefer-
ences adopted by Epstein and Zin (1989) and Weil (1989). These preferences allow for
a separation between the coeÂ¢cient of relative risk aversion and the elasticity of in-
tertemporal substitution. Furthermore, they allow for the expression of the preference
for early versus late resolution of uncertainty. The utility function is de ned recursively
as
                                 h             1         1         1 i 1
                          Vt = (1        )Ct   
                                                    +  E Vt+1 jz(t)             ,                             (6)
where  denotes the subjective discount factor, > 0 is the coeÂ¢cient of relative risk
              1
aversion,   1 1 , and   > 0 is the elasticity of intertemporal substitution. Note
that the sign of  depends on the relative magnitudes of and . The standard
time-separable power utility is obtained as a special case when  = 1, i.e. = 1 .
    For this speci cation of preferences, Epstein and Zin (1989) and Weil (1989) showed
that, for any asset j, the rst-order conditions of the consumerÂ’s utility maximization
yield the following Euler equations,

                                     E [exp(mt+1 + rj;t+1 )jz(t)] = 1,                                         (7)

                                                        
                              mt+1 =  log                 ct+1 + (             1)rc;t+1 ,                  (8)

where mt+1 is the natural logarithm of the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution,
rj;t+1 is the continuously compounded return on asset j, and rc;t+1 is the unobservable
continuously compounded return on an asset that delivers aggregate consumption as
its dividend each period.

    We rely on log-linear approximations for the return on the consumption claim, rc;t+1 ,
and that on the market portfolio (the observable return on the aggregate dividend
claim), rm;t+1 , as in Campbell and Shiller (1988),

                       rc;t+1 = 0 + 1 zt+1 zt + ct+1 ,                              (9)
                      rm;t+1 = 0;m + 1;m zm;t+1 zm;t + dt+1 ,                      (10)

where zt is the log price-consumption ratio and zm;t is the log price-dividend ratio. In
                       ez                        z
equation (9), 1 = 1+e    z and 0 = log(1 + e )      1 z are log-linearization constants,
where z denotes the long-run mean of the log price-consumption ratio. Similarly, in
                          ez m                       zm
equation (10), 1;m = 1+e    z m and 0;m = log(1 + e   ) 1;m z m , where z m denotes the
long-run mean of the log price-dividend ratio.
    Note that the current model speci cation involves a single state variable pt . We
conjecture the following approximate expressions for the log price-consumption ratio,
log price-dividend ratio and log risk free rate and derive expressions for their parameters
in Appendices A.3, A.5, and A.4, respectively:


                                  zt = A0 + A1 pt ,                                   (11)
                                zm;t = A0;m + A1;m pt ,                               (12)
                                 rf;t = A0;f + A2;f pt .                              (13)

    Note that we do not directly observe pt and, therefore, it is latent. However, under
the model assumptions, the probability of being in the rst regime in each period can be
extracted from observable macroeconomic and nancial variables, like the market-wide
price-dividend ratio and risk free rate using equations (12) and (13).


3     Data

Throughout our investigation, we use annual and quarterly data over the entire avail-
able sample periods 1929 2013 and 1947:Q1 2013:Q4, respectively. The asset menu
consists of the market return and the risk free rate. Our market proxy is the Center for
Research in Security Prices (CRSP) value-weighted index of all stocks on the NYSE,
AMEX, and NASDAQ. The proxy for the real risk free rate is obtained as follows: the
quarterly nominal yield on three-month Treasury Bills is deÂ‡ated using the realized
growth in the Consumer Price Index to obtain the ex post real three-month Treasury-
Bill rate. The ex ante quarterly risk free rate is then obtained as the tted value from
the regression of the ex post three-month Treasury-Bill rate on the three-month nomi-
nal yield and the realized growth in the Consumer Price Index over the previous year.
The ex ante quarterly risk free rate at the beginning of the year is annualized to obtain
the ex ante annual risk free rate. The equity premium is the diÂ¤erence in average log
returns on the market and the risk free rate.
    Also used in the empirical analysis are the price-dividend ratio and dividend growth


                                            6
rate of the market portfolio. These two time series are computed using the monthly
returns with and without dividends on the market portfolio obtained from the CRSP
 les. The monthly dividend payments within a year are added to obtain the annual ag-
gregate dividend, i.e. we do not reinvest dividends either in T-Bills or in the aggregate
stock market. The annual price-dividend ratio is computed as the ratio of the price at
the end of each calendar year to the annual aggregate dividends paid out during that
year. Finally, the consumption data consists of the per capita personal consumption
expenditure on nondurable goods and services obtained from the Bureau of Economic
Analysis. All nominal quantities are converted to real, using the personal consumption
deÂ‡ator.


4     Parameter Estimation and Interpretation
The model has a total of 13 parameters, including 3 preference parameters ( ; ; )
and 10 parameters of the time-series processes of aggregate consumption and dividend
growth c;1 ; c;2 ; d;1 ; d;2 ; ;  1 ;  2 ;  1 ;  2 ;  p . We estimate the parameters using the
GMM approach to match the following sample moments: the unconditional mean, vari-
ance, and rst-order autocorrelation of consumption growth, dividend growth, market-
wide price-dividend ratio and risk free rate, the unconditional mean and variance of the
market return, and the correlation between consumption and dividend growth rates.
Therefore, we have an over-identi ed system of 15 restrictions and 13 parameters. The
weighting matrix used in the estimation is a diagonal matrix with unit entries corre-
sponding to all the moments except for the weights on the mean risk free rate and
market return that each equal 100. Similar results are obtained using the eÂ¢cient
weighting matrix and are available from the authors upon request.
    The estimation results are reported in Table 1 for annual data over the entire
available sample period 1929 2013. The point estimates of the parameters, along
with the associated standard errors (Newey-West (1987) corrected using two lags) in
parentheses, are displayed in the rst two rows. Row 2 reveals that the preference
parameters are precisely estimated. The point estimates, 1:86 and 1:99, respectively,
of the coeÂ¢cient of relative risk aversion and the elasticity of intertemporal substitution
suggest preference for early resolution of uncertainty.
    Row 1 shows that the consumption growth rate has mean c;1 = 2:7% and volatility
 1 = 1:0% in regime 1. The mean and volatility in the second regime are c;2 = 3:2%
and  2 = 3:5%, respectively. The mean and volatility of the dividend growth rate are
d;1 = 5:4% and  1 = 5:62%, respectively, in regime 1 and d;2 = 9:9% and  2 =
19:7%, respectively, in regime 2. The point estimates of the transition probabilities
imply that the rst regime has a duration longer than that of the second regime.
Also, note that the point estimates of the transition probabilities strongly suggest the
existence of at least two regimes, since  1 is very diÂ¤erent from 1  2 . Therefore, the
 rst regime is characterized by higher mean and lower volatility of the consumption
and dividend growth rates and lasts longer than the second regime.
    In Table 1, we also report the historical and model-generated moments of the con-
sumption and dividend growth rates, market return, risk free rate, and market-wide


                                                   7
price-dividend ratio. The "Data" column reports the moments computed from histor-
ical data along with standard errors in parentheses. The "Model" column presents the
model-generated moments along with the 95% con dence intervals in square brack-
ets. We calculate the model-generated moments from the analytical expressions for
these moments at the point estimates of the parameters. We calculate their 95% con -
dence intervals from 10,000 simulations of eighty-four years each, the same size as the
historical sample.
    The model does a good job matching the unconditional moments of the aggregate
consumption and dividend growth rates. The unconditional mean, volatility, and au-
tocorrelation of consumption growth are 0:019, 0:021, and 0:501, respectively, in the
historical data, while their model-implied values are 0:020, 0:025, and 0:512, respec-
tively. The corresponding numbers for the dividend growth rate are 0:013, 0:114, and
0:183, respectively in the data and 0:035, 0:100, and 0:299, respectively, in the model.
The model-implied correlation between the consumption and dividend growth rates is
0:395, smaller than its sample value of 0:584. This shows that the model does not rely
on high correlation between consumption and dividends. This is a desirable feature of
the model as this correlation is diÂ¢cult to measure precisely and is quite sensitive to
small changes in timing or time aggregation (see e.g., Campbell and Cochrane (1999)).
    The model provides a good t to the historically observed low average level and
volatility of the risk free rate. It also rationalizes the high mean market return and
the volatility of the market return observed in the data. Therefore, it oÂ¤ers an expla-
nation of the equity premium and risk free rate puzzles. It also matches well the mean
and, more importantly, the volatility of the market-wide price-dividend ratio, thereby
accounting for the excess volatility puzzle. Overall, the model ts well the moments of
consumption and dividend growth and returns, and does so without requiring implau-
sible dynamics in the consumption and dividend growth processes. The J-stat is 7:61
and the model is not rejected at the 10% level of signi cance.
    Finally, note that the point estimate of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution
parameter, , is similar to that used in the literature while the value of the risk aversion
parameter, , is smaller than is typically required in models with recursive preferences.
For example, in the Bansal and Yaron (2004) long-run risks model, the calibrated values
of these preference parameters are = 10 and = 1:5; in the Nakamura, Steinsson,
Barro, and Ursua (2013) rare disasters model, they are = 6:5 and              = 2:0. The
estimated value of in Table 1, on the other hand, is only 1:86. The speci c feature
of our model that allows risk aversion to be smaller is that it puts less weight on
extremely low frequencies, and more weight on business cycle frequencies (2-10 years).
For instance, the frequency domain calculations in Dew-Becker and Giglio (2014) reveal
that, at the Bansal and Yaron (2004) calibrated values of the preference parameters
  , , and , cycles longer than 235 years account for half of the total risk premium
of a permanent consumption shock. In other words, removing shocks above these
frequencies would reduce the risk premium on a permanent shock by half. Instead, at
our estimates of the preference parameters, the total mass of the pricing function of
such long frequencies is reduced to 35%. Another way to see this is that the Bansal and
Yaron (2004) calibration puts only 7:5% of the weight on business cycle Â‡uctuations
while our model puts a higher weight of 24% on those cycles. Thus, while the Bansal


                                            8
and Yaron (2004) model focuses on long-run risks of very low frequency, our model
focuses on intermediate-run risks at the business cycle frequency.2


5         Economic Interpretation of the Two Regimes
Note that the model implies that the market-wide price-dividend ratio is an aÂ¢ne func-
tion of the probability pt of being in the rst regime, with coeÂ¢cients that are known
functions of the underlying model parameters. Therefore, using the point estimates of
the model parameters in Table 1 and the historical time series of the price-dividend
ratio, we extract the time series of the probability pt . Figure 1 plots the extracted time
series of pt , along with the NBER-designated recession periods (grey shaded areas) and
the major stock market crashes (vertical dashed lines) identi ed in Mishkin and White
(2001).
    The gure reveals that the investorsÂ’ regime probabilities are correlated with the
business cycle. The correlation between the probability series and a dummy variable
that takes the value one in a recession year and zero otherwise is 31:4%. A year
is classi ed as a recession year if at least two of its quarters are in NBER-designated
recessions. Conditional on lower than 50% probability that the economy is in the rst
regime at the beginning of the year (pt < 0:5), the probability of a recession in that year
is 62:5%; conditional on higher than 50% probability that the economy is in the rst
regime (pt > 0:5), the probability of a recession in that year is 23:7%. The association of
the second regime with recessions is consistent with our earlier nding that the second
regime is associated with lower mean and higher volatility of consumption growth and
has a shorter duration compared to the rst regime.

                                      Â— Figure 1 about here Â—

    The investorsÂ’ regime probabilities are also correlated with major stock market
downturns. The correlation between the probability series and a dummy variable that
takes the value one in years with a stock market downturn and zero otherwise is
  23:7%. The years corresponding to stock market downturns are taken from Mishkin
and White (2001) who identify them as periods in which either the Dow Jones In-
dustrial, the S&P500, or the NASDAQ index drops by at least 20 percent in a time
window of either one day, ve days, one month, three months, or one-year. Conditional
on lower than 50% probability that the economy is in the rst regime, the probability
of a recession or a stock market downturn in that year is 75:0%; conditional on higher
than 50% probability that the economy is in the rst regime, the probability of a re-
cession or stock market downturn in that year is 36:8%. Note that the second regime
does double duty by capturing both economic recessions and periods of stock market
downturns. This rendition is necessarily imperfect because economic recessions and
stock market downturns are related but distinct economic phenomena. In fact, the
correlation between a dummy variable that takes the value one in a recession year and
zero otherwise and a dummy variable that takes the value one in years with a stock
market downturn and zero otherwise over the period 1929 2013 is only 0:22.

    In Figure 2, we plot the historical and model-implied time series of the market-wide
price-dividend ratio.3 Note that the two series are indistinguishable, except starting
with the mid nineties when asset prices rose to unprecedented levels.4

   For comparison purposes, we also lter the probability of being in the rst regime
from the consumption history as
                                                                  

where N (x; ; ) denotes the density of a normal random variable with mean  and
standard deviation , evaluated at x. We set pt in year 1929 equal to its unconditional
mean. We then lter pt for the years 1930 2013 and present the time series in
Figure 3.5 The correlation of pt and a dummy variable that takes the value of one in a
recession year and zero otherwise is 28:8%. Conditional on pt < 0:5, the probability of
a recession in that year is 46:7%; conditional on pt > 0:5, the probability of a recession
in that year is 23:2%. Given that NBER-designated recessions are de ned primarily in
terms of negative realized consumption growth, it is remarkable that the results are,
in fact, a little worse than, the results obtained earlier in the case where pt is ltered
from the market-wide price-dividend ratio.

                                    Â— Figure 3 about here Â—

    In Table 2, we report the sample mean and volatility, along with the associated
asymptotic standard errors in parentheses, of the consumption and dividend growth
rates, the price-dividend ratio, risk free rate, and market return, in the two regimes.
In Panel A, we present these summary statistics for the 76 years over the period
1930 2013 in which the probability that the economy is in the rst regime exceeds
50%. In Panel B, we present these summary statistics for the 8 years in which the
probability that the economy is in the rst regime is below 50%. Given the small
size of these subsamples, particularly the second one, the standard errors are large
and diÂ¤erences in the point estimates across the two regimes are often statistically
insigni cant. However, consistent with the interpretation of the second regime as the
    3
      Figure 1 suggests that the model fails to account for the movements in the price-dividend ratio
starting with the mid nineties. However, the corresponding gure 4 for the post war subperiod shows
that the historical and model-implied time series of the price-dividend ratio are indistinguishable over
the entire period, except in the mid nineties.

      Researchers have suggested several possible reasons for the high stock market valuations dur-
ing this period, including a decline in the equity premium (e.g., Blanchard (1993), Jagannathan,
McGrattan, and Scherbina (2000), Fama and French (2002)); reductions in the costs of stock market
participation and diversi cation (e.g., Heaton and Lucas (1999), Siegel (1999), Calvet, Gonzalez-Eiras,
and Sodini (2004)); decline in macroeconomic risk (e.g., Lettau, Ludvigson, and Wachter (2008)); and
irrational exuberance (e.g., Shiller (2000)).
    5
      Note that the rst few values of pt are probably inÂ‡uenced by the starting value and should,
therefore, be interpreted with caution.


                                                  10
regime associated with recessions, we nd that the sample mean of consumption and
dividend growth are higher in the rst regime and their volatilities are higher in the
second regime. The same pattern across regimes is reÂ‡ected in the simulated model-
implied moments. The sample mean and volatility of the market return are higher
in the second regime than in the rst one, consistent with the interpretation of the
second regime as being the regime associated with recessions. The same pattern across
regimes is reÂ‡ected in the simulated moments. The sample mean of the price-dividend
ratio is higher in the rst regime than in the second one; the simulated mean of the
price-dividend ratio is also higher in the rst regime than the second one.
    Forecasting regressions of the consumption and dividend growth rates and the mar-
ket return on the market-wide price-dividend ratio lend further support to the risk
channels highlighted in the model. These results are presented in Table 3. Panels A,
B, and C present the forecasting results at the one-year, 5 year, and 10 year horizons,
respectively. Consider rst Panel A. Row 1 shows that, in the historical sample, a
forecasting regression of the one-year ahead market return on the lagged market-wide
price-dividend ratio produces a slope coeÂ¢cient of 0:065. The model-implied slope
coeÂ¢cient, 0:107, is within one-standard error of the point estimate in the data.
Moreover, the model-implied R2 of 2:9% is very close to its sample counterpart of
2:2%. Similar results are obtained for the regression of the dividend growth on the
price-dividend ratio in Row 2. Row 3 shows, however, that the model implies higher
forecastability of the consumption growth rate by the price-dividend ratio than that
observed in the data Â– the R2 from a forecasting regression of the consumption growth
on the price-dividend ratio is 4:5% in the historical sample while the model-implied
R2 is 32:0%. Since pt is a (truncated) aÂ¢ne function of the price-dividend ratio, we
obtain similar results for the R2 if we use pt instead of the price-dividend ratio as the
forecasting variable.
    Consistent with the data, Panels B and C show that model-implied slope coeÂ¢cients
in the forecasting regressions of the 5-year and 10-year market returns on the lagged
price-dividend ratio are -0.368 and -0.527, respectively Â– similar to the corresponding
historical values of -0.380 and -0.632, respectively. The R2 of the regressions also
increase with the horizon, as in the data. The table shows that, while the R2 of
the forecasting regression of the market return on the price-dividend ratio increases
monotonically with the return horizon in the historical data, the same is not true with
the aggregate consumption and dividend growth rates. With the consumption growth
rate, the R2 falls from 4.5% to 1.3% as we go from the one-year to the ve-year horizon,
and then rises to 5.7% at the 10-year horizon. Similarly with the dividend growth rate,
the R2 falls from 10.2% to 3.1% as we go from the one-year to the ve-year horizon, and
then rises to 3.9% at the 10-year horizon. Consistent with the data, the model-implied
R2 is not monotone in the forecast horizon for the consumption and dividend growth
rates, but is generally higher than that in the data.
    Note that the results in this section are based on extracting the time series of
the regime probability pt from the market-wide price-dividend ratio. However, other
observables, like the risk free rate, are also functions of the state variable pt under
the model assumptions. Therefore, to ensure that our results are not entirely driven
by the choice of the price-dividend ratio as the sole observable from which to lter


                                           11
pt , we repeated the analysis of this section when the probability is extracted from the
price-dividend ratio and the risk free rate.6 The results remain virtually unchanged
and are omitted for the sake of brevity.


6     Robustness Tests
The period prior to 1947 was one of great economic uncertainty, including the Great
Depression and World War II. It has also been argued that pre-war macroeconomic data
has substantial measurement error. Therefore, we address the robustness of our results
to the post-war subperiod. Tables 4-6 present results analogous to those in Tables 1-3
using post-war annual data over 1947 2013. Table 4 shows that the model matches
well the unconditional mean, volatility, and autocorrelation of the consumption growth,
dividend growth, risk free rate, market return, and the market-wide price-dividend
ratio. The point estimates of the coeÂ¢cient of risk aversion and the elasticity of
intertemporal substitution are reasonable at 1:503 and 1:442, respectively. The point
estimates of the time series parameters suggest the presence of two regimes. Aggregate
consumption and dividend growth rates have higher mean and lower volatility in the
  rst regime than in the second one. The average duration of the rst regime is longer
than that of the second regime. Finally, the overidentifying restrictions test statistic
fails to reject the model at the 5% level of signi cance. As with the full sample, we
  nd that the regimes are related to the business cycle - the correlation between the
time series of the probability and a recession dummy variable is 28:4%.
    Table 5 shows that, consistent with the implications of the model, the consumption
growth, market-wide price-dividend ratio, and the risk free rate have higher mean in the
  rst regime compared to the second, while the market return has a higher mean in the
second regime compared to the rst one. Table 6 shows that the slope coeÂ¢cient and R2
from a forecasting regression of the market return on the lagged price-dividend ratio are
very similar in the data and in the model. However, the model implies greater predictive
power of the price-dividend ratio for the ahead aggregate consumption and dividend
growth rates than that observed in the data. Finally, Figure 4 shows that the historical
and model-implied time series of the price-dividend ratio are indistinguishable, except
in the mid nineties. Overall, the results obtained using post-war data are very similar
to those obtained using the entire available sample, suggesting that our results are not
driven solely by the characteristics of the pre-war period.

   Tables 7-9 present results using quarterly data over 1947:Q1 2013:Q4. Note that,

     Since this approach consists of two equations in the single unknown pt , we extract pt period-by-

a large negative rst order autocorrelation of 0:581 in the data at the quarterly fre-
quency. Since we do not incorporate the seasonality of dividends in the model, we
eliminate this moment restriction from our GMM estimation of the model parameters.
The results are, once again, very similar to those obtained in Tables 1-3. The parameter
estimates in Table 7 suggest that the rst regime is characterized by higher mean and
lower volatility of the consumption and dividend growth rates and lasts longer than
the second regime. The estimates of the risk aversion and elasticity of intertemporal
substitution parameters are economically plausible and suggest preference for early
resolution of uncertainty. Also, note that, consistent with their economic interpreta-
tion, the point estimates of these preference parameters are very similar irrespective
of the assumed decision frequency of the investors or the sample period used in the
estimation. The overidentifying restrictions test statistic has an asymptotic p-value of
3:7%. Once again, we nd that the regimes are correlated with the business cycle. The
correlation between the time series of the probability and a recession dummy variable
is 30:3%.
    Table 8 shows that, consistent with the implications of the model, the consumption
growth, market-wide price-dividend ratio, and the risk free rate have higher mean in
the rst regime compared to the second, while the market return has a higher mean
in the second regime compared to the rst one. Finally, Table 9 shows that the model
implies that the price-dividend ratio forecasts the market return with slope coeÂ¢cient
and R2 similar to that observed in the data, but implies higher forecasting ability
of the price-dividend ratio for the consumption and dividend growth rates than that
observed in the historical data. Overall, the results obtained using quarterly data are
similar to those obtained at the annual data frequency, suggesting that the results are
not sensitive to the assumed decision frequency of investors.


7    Concluding Remarks
We presented a parsimonious exchange economy with one Markovian latent state vari-
able that signi es the economic regime. We recognized that investors are inundated
with an overload of news and explored the hypothesis that they cope with this vast
amount of information by focusing on a subset of information they pay attention to,
apply heuristics, and process information in a way that may or may not be fully ra-
tional. We refrained from taking a stand on the content of the information set that
investors use or the lter that they apply to form their beliefs. Instead, we recognized
that, to some extent, prices reÂ‡ect investorsÂ’ beliefs about the economic regime and
we relied on asset prices to infer these beliefs. In particular, we demonstrated that in-
vestors employ a broader information set than just the aggregate consumption history
in forming their beliefs.
    We estimated the model, tested it, and did not reject it. The model provides a
good t to the unconditional and conditional moments of the market return, the risk
free rate, market-wide price-dividend ratio, and consumption and dividend growth. We
identi ed the second regime as the one associated with recessions and market downturns
along several criteria. The second regime has a shorter duration than the rst one. In


                                           13
the second regime, the realized consumption and dividend growth rates have lower
mean and higher volatility; the market return has higher mean and volatility; and the
mean market-wide price-dividend ratio and risk free rate are lower. High on our agenda
is the investigation of the information subset that investors actually use to infer the
economic regime and the extent to which their ltering of this information is rational.

A.3     Consumption Claim
We rely on the log-linear approximation for the continuous return on the consumption
claim, rc;t+1 ,
                           rc;t+1 = 0 + 1 zt+1 zt + ct+1 ,
where zt is the log price-consumption ratio. Note that the current model speci ca-
tion involves the single latent state variable pt . We conjecture that the log price-


                                                  17
consumption ratio at date t takes the form,

                                         zt = A0 + A1 pt .
The Euler equation for the consumption claim is,

                              E [exp (mt+1 + rc;t+1 ) jz(t)] = 1,                           (26)

                         mt+1 =  log            ct+1 + (    1)rc;t+1 .

Substituting the above expression for mt+1 into (26), we have,

                   E exp  log        ct+1 + rc;t+1 jz(t) = 1,

which implies

By Taylor series expansion up to quadratic terms, we obtain the following:

                                                     

We approximate the above expression to order pt . Therefore, we expand the term p2t as
a Taylor series to rst order around the unconditional mean, p, to obtain the following:


                                             p2t  p2 + 2p (pt   p)
                                                 =   p2 + 2ppt

Since the Euler equation holds for all observable states pt , we obtain the following 2

    Equations (27) and (28) can be solved to obtain the parameters A0 and A1 . Equa-
tion (28) is quadratic in A1 . We set A1 equal to the smaller root of the quadratic
equation as this minimizes the GMM objective function in the estimation.

A.4      Risk free Rate
The risk free rate, rf;t , is priced using the Euler equation,

                                     E [exp(mt+1 + rf;t )jz(t)] = 1.
Hence,


            exp ( rf;t ) = E [exp(mt+1 )jz(t)]
                                                                                        
                                            
                         = E exp( log        ct+1 + (              1)rc;t+1 )jz(t)

By Taylor series expansion up to quadratic terms, we obtain the following:

                                                            
                                                      
 rf;t =  log  + ( 1) (0 zt ) +      +  1 E [ct+1 jz(t)] + (                           1)1 E [zt+1 jz(t)]
                                                     

          var         +  + 1 ct+1 + ( 1)1 zt+1 jz(t) .

Therefore, we obtain

A.5       Dividend Claim
The market portfolio is de ned as the claim to the aggregate dividend stream. We rely
on the log-linear approximation for the continuous return on the aggregate dividend
claim, rm;t+1 ,
                      rm;t+1 = 0;m + 1;m zm;t+1 zm;t + dt+1 ,
where zm;t is the market-wide log price-dividend ratio. We conjecture that the log
price-dividend ratio at date t takes the form,

                                     zm;t = A0;m + A1;m pt

    Approximating p2t  p2 + 2ppt gives 2 equations that can be solved to obtain the

to the smaller root of the quadratic equation.



                                                                 22
A.6      Model-Implied Predictive Regressions
In this Appendix, we derive the slope coeÂ¢cient and the R2 from model implied fore-
casting regressions of the one-year ahead market return, consumption growth, and
dividend growth on the market-wide price dividend ratio. Consider rst the market
return. The model implies

E (rm;t+1 jpt ) = 0;m + 1;m E (zm;t+1 jpt ) zm;t + E (dt+1 jpt )
                = 0;m + 1;m [A0;m + A1;m f (pt )] A0;m A1;m pt
                  +f (pt )d;1 + (1 f (pt )) d;2
                                                                                       
                = 0;m + 1;m A0;m + 1;m A1;m (1  2 ) A0;m + (1  2 ) d;1 +  2 d;2
                                                                             
                  + 1;m A1;m ( 1 +  2 1) A1;m + ( 1 +  2 1) d;1 d;2 pt (29)

Since, pt = zm;tAA
                 1;m
                    o;m
                        , the model-implied slope coeÂ¢cient from a forecasting regressions
of the market return on the market-wide price dividend ratio is
                   "                                                   #
                                              ( 1 +  2 1) d;1 d;2
                     1;m ( 1 +  2 1) 1 +
                                                         A1;m

Therefore, the model-implied R2 is
        "                                                                 #2

Now, Var(zm;t ) = A21;m Var(pt ), where Var(pt ) was derived in Section A.1. We calculate
Var(rm;t+1 ) as follows.

                   Var (rm;t+1 ) = Var [E (rm;t+1 jpt )] + E [Var (rm;t+1 jpt )]

Note that Equation (29) implies that
                                                                                                  2

And,

Var (rm;t+1 jpt ) = 21;m A21;m Var (pt+1 jpt ) + Var (dt+1 jpt ) + 21;m A1;m Cov (pt+1 ; dt+1 jpt )

    The table reports GMM estimates (asymptotic standard errors in parentheses) of the
model parameters, obtained using annual data over the entire available sample period 1929-
2013. It also reports the model-implied moments, obtained from a single simulation of 1
million observations, and the 95% con dence interval (in square brackets), obtained through
10000 simulations of the same length as the historical data, and the corresponding sample
values (asymptotic standard errors in parentheses) of the mean, volatility, and rst-order
autocorrelation of the risk free rate, price-dividend ratio, market return, and the consump-
tion and dividend growth rates. Finally, the last row reports the J-stat for overidentifying
restrictions, along with its asymptotic p-value in parentheses.

    Panel A reports the sample mean and volatility (asymptotic standard errors in parenthe-
ses) of consumption and dividend growth rates, the log price-dividend ratio, risk free rate,
and market return in the rst regime. It also reports the model-implied values, obtained
from a single simulation of 1 million observations, and the 95% con dence interval (in square
brackets), obtained through 10000 simulations of the same length as the historical data, of
these moments. Panel B reports the corresponding moments in the second regime. Regime 1
is de ned as corresponding to those data points at which pt > 0:5 while Regime 2 corresponds
to those data points at which pt < 0:5.

    The table reports GMM estimates (asymptotic standard errors in parentheses) of the
model parameters, obtained using annual data over the post-war period 1947-2013. It also re-
ports the model-implied moments, obtained from a single simulation of 1 million observations,
and the 95% con dence interval (in square brackets), obtained through 10000 simulations
of the same length as the historical data, and the corresponding sample values (asymptotic
standard errors in parentheses) of the mean, volatility, and rst-order autocorrelation of the
risk free rate, price-dividend ratio, market return, and the consumption and dividend growth
rates. Finally, the last row reports the J-stat for overidentifying restrictions, along with its
asymptotic p-value in parentheses.

    The table reports the slope coeÂ¢cient and the R2 from forecasting regressions of the
market return, the aggregate consumption and dividend growth rates on the price dividend
ratio at the 1-year (Panel A), 5-year (Panel B), and 10-year (Panel C) frequencies, in the
model and in the historical data.
