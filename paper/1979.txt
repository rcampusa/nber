                     In the Wrong Place at the Wrong Time:
              The Extent of Frictional and Structural Unemployment




                                   ABSTRACT




     A major cause of unemployment, distinct from inadequate aggregate demand
and instability of workers, is the instability of jobs themselves. In an
average year about one in every nine jobs disappear and one in every eight is
newly created. This is based on an analysis of year to year employment
changes among the private employers of Wisconsin between 1977 and 1982. This
job loss may account for roughly 2.2 percentage points, or one quarter, of the
average unemployment rate. As much as half of the transitions of workers from
employment to non-employment may be accounted for by the destruction of jobs.
     Establishments appear to adjust their employment quickly, largely within
one year. Employment growth rates one year apart are negatively correlated,
and thereafter nearly follow a random walk. Establishments exhibit
considerable heterogeneity in employment growth rates, with some positive
cyclical variations, but little industry effect. Employment shifts across
establishments within an industry are of far greater magnitude than shifts
across industry lines.

I.   Introduction


     Structural and frictional unemployment are usually considered among the

unpleasant and exogenous facts of economic life about which little can be

done. As the composition of demand changes, employment must also shift. In

the process of adjusting to a new equilibrium, some people will endure spells

of unemployment. Usually, this is considered part of a healthy

re—equilibration process, and the resulting unemployment is seen as part of

the underlying "natural" rate of unemployment. In a recent departure from the

usual practice of taking structural unemployment as a constant, Lilien (1982)

has argued that a part of what is normally thought of as cyclical variation in

unemployment is actually caused by structural shifts. This provocative

argument, along with recent oil and trade shocks that have reduced

manufacturing employment, focus attention on how the economy adjusts to

structural changes. This paper analyzes the nature of this adjustment process

and shows the magnitude of gross flows of employment across industries and

establishments. It dissects the flow of job creation and destruction, and

seeks to develop a clearer empirical view of the dynamics of establishment

size in relation to employment and unemployment. Changes in labor demand at

the establishment level are an important but largely unexplored economic

force.

     Over time, establishments grow and contract in a fashion that is modelled

here as a stochastic process of adjustment to random shocks of varying

persistence. These are shifts in labor demand that appear to be caused by

variations in product demand, and so scale of operations, rather than by
                                     —2—


substitution away from labor in response to wage variation. As establishments

go through the continuous process of growth and decline, jobs are created and

then destroyed. If these gross flows of jobs balance, and there is perfect

and costless mobility, these need not contribute to unemployment.

     But that is not our situation. The gross flows are surprisingly large,

do not balance, and are not adjusted to without cost. Chief among these costs

is unemployment. For convenience, I shall refer to fluctuation in

establishment size uncorrelated with industry on area trends as frictional,

and to fluctuations in industry or area employment averages as structural.

Frictional changes are of far greater magnitude than are structural changes,

but the labor force appears able to adapt to tremendous frictional fluctuation

with little change in wages or total employment.

     The population of establishments analyzed here -is described in the next

section. Section III provides an overview of the economy of the state studied

here, and of the growth and decline of employment. New evidence on the

instability of jobs is presented in Section IV. The transient nature of

demand shocks at the establishment level is demonstrated in Section V.

Section VI tests for the existence of industry, area, or year effects on

establishment growth rates. Section VII presents the conclusions.



II. Population Characteristics


    The sample studied here is drawn from a complete survey of establishments

in the state of Wisconsin. The underlying data are collected as part of the

administration of the unemployment insurance (U.I.) program. This -is not a
                                      —3—


 sample. It is (in theory and by law) the population of establishments in the

state. The state Department of Industry, Labor and Human Relations prepares

annual files from the March Unemployment Compensation Contribution Reports.

These reports must by law be filed by all establishments paying at least one

employee $1,500 in any quarter of the year.l This data is the primary source

of Federal employment statistics. In the majority of cases, these

establishments are the sole operating asset of a firm, so there is not much

distinction between establishments and firms. Where possible, company-wide

reports for multi-establishment companies and for companies which acquired

other companies between 1977 and 1982 have been eliminated from the sample

studied here.

     Transfers of ownership are treated not as a continuation of a single

business, but rather as a death and a birth. This obviously is not

appropriate for some applications. In particular, job gain and loss rates,

and the variance of growth rates may be overstated. Births and deaths have

relatively little impact on job creation and destruction because they are

concentrated in the smallest establishments. It is, however, possible that

plant closings have a disproportionately large effect on unemployment. In a

1978-79 version of this data set that counts transfers as a continuation of

business rather than as a birth and death, 11 percent of all job losses and 18

percent of all job gains were accounted for by deaths and births,

respectively. (The Job Generation Process in Wisconsin, Table 2-2, p. 145)

The greater part of the gross job flows, 89 percent of losses and 82 percent

of gains, occurred through the contraction or expansion of going concerns.2

    The population studied here has 124,711 establishments with 1,198,638
                                     -4-


employees in 1978. That averages 9.6 employees per establishment, not a

great surprise to those familiar with County Business Patterns data. The

distribution is, of course, highly skewed. More than 80 percent of employment

is in establishments with ten or more employees, but at the same time, more

than 80 percent of the establishments employ fewer than ten employees. Most

of the institutional analysis of business deals with big business. Fewer than

2 percent of the establishments studied here have more than 100 employees.

The large establishment is not the typical establishment, but surprisingly

little is known about the small establishments that predominate.



III. Growth and Decline: Ratio of Cell Means


     What happens when the unemployment rate in a state doubles in three

years? Perhaps one pictures a cataclysmic event -- war, natural disaster, or

at least an oil shock -— some major disturbance causing the rapid extinction

of a large proportion of all jobs. In Wisconsin, the state unemployment rate

doubled in three years from 5.0 percent in 1979 to 10.0 percent in 1982, which

indeed is the period following the second oil shock (see Table 1). The number

of unemployed people also nearly doubled to 235,630 over these years. What

does it take to double the unemployment rate and put an extra 120,000 people

out on the street?

     It only takes an average annual decline in employment of less than 1.2

percent between 1979 and 1982 (line 7). This is a loss of 79,000 jobs. The

remaining third of the additional unemployed in these years is accounted for

by the 40,000 person increase in the labor force. During the earlier period,
                                      -5-


1977 and 1980, total employment grew. Despite this, the unemployment rate

also rose during these years, because the growth rate of employment fell more

than the growth rate of the labor force. Under such conditions, it does not

take great declines in the employment growth rate to produce an increase in

the unemployment rate.

     Between 1977 and 1980, sample employment increased by 15.6 percent. In

the next year it fell by 3.5 percent. Table 2 shows that the annual average

growth rate of total employment (equivalent to an employment weighted

establishment average) is 1.10 (1978), 1.04 (1979), 1.02 (1980), 0.97 (1981)

and 1.02 (1982). This is a 13 percentage point drop in the rate of employment

growth between 1978 and 1981.

     The net employment growth rate is usually all that can be observed. Here

it averages 2.8 percent annually among all establishments. But this turns out

to be the sum of two large numbers.4 Growing establishments average 30

percent growth in each year of growth. Shrinking establishments average 21

percent shrinkage. The employment weighted average of these two (and of the

stable) yields the observed 2.8 percent net growth.

     Distributing establishments by growth rates shows that mean growth does

not decline because the entire distribution of growth rates shifts down. The

employment growth rate declines not because all establishments are growing

slower (they are not) but rather because shrinking establishments shrink

faster and because about the middle of the distribution, establishments that

were growing start to shrink. It is primarily this shift of only 5 percent of

the establishments that lowers aggregate employment growth. The observed

aggregate fluctuations occur not because of a widely shared response by
                                       -6-


establishments to changing incentives, but rather because of a more

concentrated change by a small proportion of establishments.

     The large changes in the share of all employment in growing or shrinking

establishments are apparent5 in Table 3. As the growth rate of total

employment declined from 9.1 percent (1978) to -3.7 percent (1981), the share

of employment in growing plants declined from .59 to .31. Meanwhile, the

share of employment in shrinking plants nearly doubled from .34 (1970) to .61

(1981). These shifts can account for most of the decline in the growth rate

of employment between 1977 and 1981.


Mean of Ratios

     Carrying the process of disaggregation one step further, take as the

growth rate the mean of establishments' growth rates rather than the growth

rate of mean employment. Table 4 weights each establishment equally, whereas

Table 2 weighted each establishment's growth by its initial employment.

     Comparing Table 4 to Table 2, we observe that the average establishment

grows faster than does total (or average) employment. This occurs because the

small grow faster. Note the large standard variation (in parentheses) of

growth rates across establishments. This is particularly true in

manufacturing, where coefficients of variation greater than one are common.

While the average growth rate changes over the years by less than 10

percentage points, the standard deviation of growth in the cross-section can

exceed 180 percentage points. This reveals considerable heterogeneity in

growth rates across establishments.

     Comparing the six-year average annual growth rates with the growth rate
                                     —7—


over six years in Table 4, we see again evidence of regression to the mean;

growth is concentrated among the small. In an average year, the average

growth rate is 6 percent. But this does not take place in the same

establishments year after year. It does not compound. Each year a ne set of

small establishments accounts for much of this growth, for after six years the

average establishment has grown by only 15 percent, which is less than one

would expect from the compounding of the average 6 percent annual growth rate.

Growth and decline tend to be transient rather than chronic conditions -- a

point we shall later develop further. Over these same six years, the average

growing establishment has doubled in size, the average shrinking establishment

has been reduced to a third its original size, and only one-third of all

establishments have maintained their original employment level.



IV. Job Turnover


     Short durations of employment and high frequencies of disemployment are

typically thought of in terms of the characteristics of people. The

statistics in Table 5 (lines 7 and 10) reveal tremendous turnover of jobs

themselves. New jobs equal to 13.8 percent of the previous year's base are

created each year, while 11.0 percent are destroyed. The difference between

these two flows, 2.8 percent net employment growth, is all that is usually

observed. Of course, the gross flows analyzed here are themselves only the

tip of the iceberg. They include only job destruction and creation that

changes the net size of an establishment between one March and the next, and

ignore all other.6 But even the tip of the iceberg looks surprisingly large.
                                         -8—


About one in every nine jobs disappear each year. More than one in every

eight jobs is created every year. This is not during a great depression, nor

a great boom. These are the magnitudes of gross job flows experienced in the

average year between 1977 and 1982.

     We can now re-examine the state economy in light of gross rather than net

employment flows. Between 1977 and 1978, two and one-third jobs were created

for every one destroyed (Table 5, line 12). Three years later, between 1980

and 1981, only seven-tenths of a job was created for every one destroyed.

Both the decline in jobs created and the increase in jobs destroyed contribute

to the increase in the unemployment rate observed over these years.

     It would be of great interest to know whether similarly large gross flows

existed in earlier years and how they affected the "natural" rate of

unemployment. Apparently, in the past either gross flows were smaller or they

were accommodated with less unemployment and less inflation. The short time

period observed here cannot answer such questions. The gross turnover rate is

the sum of the job creation and the destruction rates and is used as a measure

of labor market turbulence. This rate ranges from .22 to .34 (Table 5, line

13) but shows no obvious pattern. On the basis of these statistics, one could

not say that greater churning in the labor market was associated either with

greater or less employment growth.

    These statistics from establishments can, under certain assumptions, be

used to make inferences about the distribution of job durations --    the
lifetime of the job itself. These may then be compared to data reported by

workers on job tenure --   the   lifetime of a worker-job match. Assuming

stationarity and stable distributions, the average duration of a job is the
                                     —9-


inverse of the death rate. Under these assumptions, the average job in this

sample lasts 9.1 years (completed spell). Hall (1982, p. 720) reports that

the expected median tenure of a worker in 1978 was 7.7 years (completed

spell).7 A job that dies must cause either a quit or a fire, and so truncate

job tenure. It seems likely that short job durations contribute to short

job tenure and so add to unemployment, although nothing more precise than

this can be said on the basis of the mean durations and tenures at hand.

     Stronger evidence of the relationship between job turnover and

unemployment comes from a more direct comparison of the job destruction rate

reported here with the transitions from employment to non-employment reported

by individuals in the CPS. Poterba and Summers (1985) correct this series for

reporting errors and find that between 1977 and 1982 the average monthly

probability of moving from employment to non-employment is .019. (Poterba and

Summers, 1985, Table V, Total Adjusted and Raked).   I find here that .11 of

all jobs disappear in an average year over the same period. This is a monthly

rate of about .009. If few of the incumbants in disappearing jobs manage to

find new employment without an intervening spell of non-employment, then this

comparison suggests that, depending upon the magnitude of measurement error,

roughly half of the transitions from employment to non-employment reported by

individuals could be accounted for by the disappearance of their jobs.

This may have important implications for the "natural" rate of unemployment.

To illustrate, suppose that the year to year employment changes measured here

capture only half of all job turnover during a year, and that only half of

this turnover is associated with an-y unemployment. (Both of these assumptions

are guesses.) Then in an average year, we expect about 11 percent of all jobs
                                     -10-



to be destroyed and result in unemployment. Dynarski and Sheffrin (1986)

report that an average completed spell of unemployment lasts 10.3 weeks, or

one—fifth of a year. Using this duration in a rough calculation, job loss

could account for about 2.2 percentage points, or more than a quarter of

Wisconsin's 7.6 percent average unemployment during 1978-1982. Neither

standard analyses (in terms of personal characteristics) nor standard policies

are likely to be of much use in understanding or preventing the problem of

workers who are caught in the wrong place at the wrong time.

     Non-manufacturing jobs are sometimes thought of as more stable than those

in manufacturing. Two dimensions of stability should be distinguished:

stability in a steady-state, and stability over the cycle. The first four

columns of Table 6 show the proportions of jobs created and destroyed each

year in the non-manufacturing and manufacturing sectors of the Wisconsin

sample. In nearly all years, both the job creation and the job destruction

rates are higher outside of manufacturing. By this measure, manufacturing

jobs are more stable. They are also more cyclically sensitive. The rates of

job gain and loss change more over the cycle in manufacturing than outside.

     The last two columns of Table 6 present new hire and layoff rates in

Wisconsin manufacturing derived from Employment and Earnings. These are the

sum of the reported monthly rates. The new hire and layoff rates were

selected from among other components of accessions and separations because

they were presumed to be more closely tied to job gain and loss. The rates of

job creation and destruction calculated here range between one-third and

three-quarters of the new hire and layoff rates. This suggests that a

substantial portion of new hires and layoffs are accounted for by job creation
                                                       —11—


and destruction.8



V.        The Dynamics of Establishment Size


         This section examines the nature of the time path of changes in

establishment size. The correlation of the logarithm of establishment size

for establishment I in year t 5it and of the first difference of this,

      =         -              are analyzed here.
          S,,       S1_1,
         Establishment size can be modelled as the sum of transient and cumulative

innovations.

      indicates the persistence of shocks or lags in adjustments. If the c. are

serially uncorrelated, then this model predicts that growth rates        =

more than two years apart are uncorrelated and follow a random walk. It also

                                     a



       In this model the ratio of lasting to transient errors is identified from

the correlation of the logarithm of growth rates two years apart. A test of

the fit of this model is provided by its prediction of negatively correlated

growth rates in neighboring years, and uncorrelated growth rates in years

further apart.

       Table 7 presents a correlation matrix for the logarithm of size and its

first difference, the logarithm of growth rate. Unlike the rest of the

analysis in this paper, these correlation matrices are calculated only for the

subsample of establishments with positive employment in all years. The growth

rates are smaller than in the full sample. Note also that the cross-section

standard-deviation of size hardly changes over time, and that the lowest

growth rate (in 1982) is associated with the highest cross-section

standard-deviation of growth rates.
                                     —13-


     Table 7 shows a number of pieces of evidence pointing to a regression to

the mean in size. The elements of the upper right corner of the table are all

negative. In every case larger size is associated with slower growth in each

subsequent year. By the same token, larger size is associated with faster

growth in each previous year. Large establishments have recently grown and

will soon shrink, on average. Small establishments have recently shrunk and

will soon grow, on average. The latter statistical artifact is the foundation

for the belief that small establishments are the fountainheads of employment

growth. (See Leonard, 1985, for further development.)

     The lower right hand quadrant of Table 7 shows the correlations of growth

rates with themselves over time. All but one of the correlations are

negative, and all of the significant correlations are negative. The strongest

pattern is for growth rates one year apart. These average a correlation of .24.

Above average growth in one year is likely to be followed (and proceeded)

by significantly below average growth in the next year.   If the establishment

grows, it likely shrank in the recent past and will grow in the near future.

There is certainly not complete persistence of shocks to growth rates. But

neither is there complete adjustment from a shock after one year. What

adjustment occurs is primarily in the first year. An employment growth rate

100 percent above average one year is likely to be followed by one 25 percent

below average next year, which is then followed by a random walk. This also

explains why the average changes we previously observed between 1977 and 1982

were much less than the compounding of the annual average changes.

    This correlation of first differences in size can now be interpreted in

terms of equation (3). As predicted by this process, growth rates one year
                                       -14-


apart are negatively correlated; those more than one year apart are close to

uncorrelated. That E(ct, i,t+k 0 for k            2, suggests that establishments

quickly adjust and that shocks are not persistent. The one year apart

correlation is roughly .25, which corresponds to      =         Half of the
                                                          2a.
variance in growth rates then represents real shocks, and at most half

represents a moving average process of transient errors. Since a pure

measurement error process is MA(1) in growth rates and implies

COR(D.t,Diti) =   -0.5,   this provides a bound on the role of measurement error

in the results reported here.

     There are a number of other reasons not to suspect measurement error

here. (1) For many of the small establishments, measurement error is similar

to forgetting how many brothers you have.     (2) The counts of employees come

from Unemployment Insurance forms. There are legal sanctions for

misreporting. The UI. tax system creates two incentives for employers:        (A)

to keep people off the books, and (B) once someone is on, to keep them on (or

at least keep them off the U.I. beneficiary rolls). This second incentive is

one for stability in the case of employers below the U.I. tax rate ceiling.

Under the U.I. tax system, the establishment partially pays for changes in

measurement error over time.    (3) Employment is updated quarterly by asking

for employment totals, not employment changes. After one year, employment

follows a random walk. It is hard to see why measurement error should

cumulate as in a random walk, except for the stability argument above which

yields little measurement error to start with. Empirically, the cross-section

variance of size hardly increases over time.    (4) In other work, compensating

differentials are found for similarly measured layoff and reemployment risk.
                                         —15—


 Nobody pays compensating differentials for measurement error.

         There are two remaining explanations for the half of growth rate variance

 that follows an MA(1). Despite the arguments above, this component of

variance could all be measurement error. An alternative explanation is that

target employment follows a random walk. Actual employment may differ from

the target by an error which persists less than one year. Both explanations

are consistent with an MA(1) process.



VI. The Non-Existence of Industry or Region Shocks


        Among the most basic economic models of establishment growth is one that

posits that the growth rates of establishments should depend on which industry

or region they are in. Structural change implies non-transient shifts of

employment across industry and/or regional lines. It has become commonplace

to speak of the industry or region shocks suffered by the economy since at

least 1973, and to attribute to them problems of both the level and the

variation of unemployment. Certain industries or regions are widely

recognized as being in growth or decline, and it is usually assumed that such

trends are widely shared by establishments within the particular industry or

region. This last assumption is challenged by the evidence to be presented

here.

        While there certainly are industries or regions that have experienced a

trend of growth or decline, it is mistaken to infer from this aggregate

experience that such growth or decline is widely shared by establishments

within these groups. For the most part, industry or region trends are
                                     -16-


irrelevant for the average establishment in an industry or region.

     The purely idiosyncratic components of variation in establishment growth

rates can be reduced by grouping and taking averages of growth rates within

industry, by county, by year cells. Table 8 shows two pooled time-series

cross-section regressions for the mean and variance of growth rates within

cells on a set of twenty-five industry dummies, seventy-one county dummies,

and four year dummies. The dependent variable in the first regression is the

average growth rate of employment for establishments in an industry-county-

year cell. In the second regression it is the within-cell variance of the

establishment growth rates. Cyclical effects common to all industries will be

captured by the year dummies, but otherwise the growth rate regression -is not

meant to indicate differing cyclical sensitivities across industries. Rather,

its purpose is to indicate whether establishments in different industries

have, on average, different mean growth rates between 1977 and 1982. This is

taken here as a measure of structural change.

     Judging from the    (.02) the complete set of industry and county

variables capture little of the variance of establishment growth rates.

Although the F-statistic of the first equation is marginally significant of

the 5 percent level and that of the second equation is significant at the

1 percent level, individually, most of the coefficients are not significantly

different from zero. The exceptions run contrary to expectations. The four

industries with significantly different growth rates are apparel (.28), rubber

and plastic (.21), primary metal (.15) and electrical equipment (.17). All of

these industries show higher than average growth rates, yet with the exception

of the last, total employment fell in all these industries in Wisconsin
                                     —17—


between 1977 and 1982. (BLS, Employment and Earnings, 1977 to 1982)

     The variance of growth rates within nearly all industries and counties is

greater than the variance across industries and counties. Knowing the

industry or county a establishment is in does not contribute significantly to

knowledge about its growth rate.9 For the average establishment (not the

average worker), there is neither an industry nor a county effect. The risk

(i.e., layoff risk) a worker faces is firstly establishment specific, and

secondly (i.e., reemployment probability) industry or region specific.    In

most applications, information on the average worker (or the employment

weighted average establishment -- aggregate employment) will be more

appropriate than information on the average establishment. The first method

of reconciling the nonexistence of industry or county effects observed here

with their existence taken for granted everywhere else, is to note the

difference between weighted and unweighted averages. This in turn suggests

that what are typically labeled as industry effects really tend to affect only

the largest establishments within an industry. For many purposes, this

suffices. Moreover, whatever cross-industry shifts there are, are likely to

cause more unemployment than the cross-establishment shifts within an industry

that dominate here.

     Competition provides a second explanation for the non-existence of

industry effects. Suppose product demand is fixed, markets are competitive,

and establishments gain small randomly arriving cost savings through

technological progress. This yields an expected negative correlation of

growth rates within an industry, because one establishment's gain must be

another's loss.
                                     -18-


     A third explanation is that there is, for unknown reasons, large

variation in growth rates across establishments. What show up as changes in

aggregate industry growth rates come about because a relatively small

proportion of establishments shift from growing to shrinking, or vice versa.

     There is only one significant calendar year effect in Table 8. The

average establishment may not be much influenced by its industry or region,

but it is influenced by the year. However, given the degrees of freedom here,

this is not a very powerful result. The business cycle surely exists, but it

does not greatly and similarly affect most establishments. In particular, the

declines in total employment growth rate from 9.9 (1978) to 3.6 (1979), and to

1.5 (1980) are not accompanied by significant reductions in the mean growth

rate of establishments. The exception is 1981, when mean growth rates fall

significantly by 11 percentage points. Otherwise, one would not have

significant evidence that a recession or boom had occurred by observing the

unweighted average establishment in Table 7.

     Table 8 pools across years and so averages out changes over the cycle,

but the main result can also be observed in unpooled regressions on single

years (not shown). Out of 25 industry dummies, from 1 to 4 are significantly

different from zero in a single year between 1977 and 1982. Similar results

are found for counties. While the different cyclical sensitivities of total

employment in different industries is well known, this does not generally

carry over to the average growth rates of establishments.

    The second equation in Table 8 is a regression of the variance of

establishment growth rates within industry, area, year cells on a set of

dichotomous variables, indicating industry, area and year. Again, with few
                                      -19-


exceptions, there is no general evidence of significant industry, area, or

year effects on the variance of establishment growth rates. The exceptions

may well be caused by reporting errors in the raw data.   It is interesting to

note that years of high unemployment rates or of employment decline are not

associated with significantly greater variance of growth rates across

establishments within cells.

     David Lilien (1982) has advanced the argument that cyclical increases -in

the unemployment rate are caused by structural change, measured by the

employment share weighted variance of the logarithm of industry growth rate

across one- or two-digit SIC industries. For example, he reports this

variance of log growth rates at .00081 in 1981. The logical argument made by

Lilien to tie this variation causally to unemployment carries through with at

least as great force to further disaggregated measures. What happens when we

expand his measure to include frictional unemployment by calculating the

variance of the logarithm of employment growth across individual

establishments?

     This measure takes on the following values:   .118 (1977-78), .113

(1978—79), .115 (1979—80), .114 (1980—81), .127 (1981-82). These are

unweighted. Evidently, the cross-industry measure includes only a small part

of the variation in growth rates across establishments. Here we observe a

total variance 140 times the cross-industry variance measured by Lilien.

Obviously, the within industry variance accounts for all but a negligible part

of this. By this measure, then, frictional sources are of far greater

importance than structural sources of unemployment. The total variance shows

an upward trend between 1978 and 1981. More often than not, it moves in the
                                     -20-


same d-irection as the unemployment rate, although the unemployment rate

increases most in a year (1980-81) that this variance actually declines. With

only five time-series observations, the concordance of these data with

Lilien's hypothesis cannot be precisely judged.

     A distinct hypothesis is that, because of different cyclical

sensitivities, faster mean employment growth is associated with greater

variance in establishment growth rates. This would imply that the predicted

values and residuals from the variance regression are positively correlated

with those from the mean growth regression in Table 7. The observed values

are actually strongly positively correlated (r    .9). Cells with high (or

higher than expected) mean employment growth rates also have a high variance

of growth rates across establishments within the cell. As the mean of the

distribution of growth rates shifts up, the variance tends to increase.



VII. Conclusion


     This paper has attempted to provide some new empirical evidence on the

nature and magnitude of structural and frictional shifts in employment across

industries and establishments. The main findings from this analysis of the

private employers of Wisconsin over one business cycle include:


1.   About one-ninth of all jobs are destroyed and more than one-eighth

     created each year on average between 1977 and 1982. Huge gross flows are

     hidden beneath the usual net flow data. Gross employment flows range

     from 3 to 17 times greater than net employment flows. Jobs themselves

     are more unstable than previous aggregate statistics have revealed. As
                                      —21—


     much as half of the transitions of workers from employment to

     non-employment may be accounted for by the destruction of jobs. This is

     consistent with self-reported job loss as a cause of unemployment, with

     the arguments of dual market theorists (see Dickens and Lang (1985)) and

     with previous evidence from Clark and Summers (1979). Such job loss may

     account for roughly 2.2 percentage points, or more than a quarter of

     Wisconsin's average unemployment rate during 1978-82.

2.   Establishments appear to adjust to demand shifts quickly. Whatever

     adjustment occurs is largely completed within the first year. This is

     followed by a movement in the other direction that suggests both

     measurement error and overshooting the employment target. Employment

     growth rates one year apart are negatively correlated, and thereafter

     nearly follow a random walk. Unless such adjustments within an

     establishment have large multipliers on other establishments in

     subsequent years, these inter—establishment employment shifts cannot

     easily explain positive autocorrelation of cyclical unemployment rates.

3.   Although it is difficult to judge from the short time series considered

     here, there is no obvious relationship between the cycle and the job

     creation rate. Roughly speaking, the unemployment rate has increased

     along with the job destruction rate.

4.   The across—sector variation in the logarithm of employment growth rates,

     used by Lilien (1982) to measure structural change, is just the tip of

     the iceberg. One hundred forty times greater is the total variation

     across establishments, nearly •all of which is within industry --   not
     across. By this measure, employment shifts across establishments within
                                     —22—


     an industry are of far greater magnitude than shifts across industry

     lines. Increases in this growth rate variance are at best weakly

     associated with increases in the unemployment rate. In cross-section

     analysis, industry by county cells with higher mean employment growth

     rates also have higher variances of growth rates across establishments.


     This paper has shown surprisingly large gross employment flows based on

the population of establishments in one state. Between 1977 and 1982, 11.0

percent of the previous year's employment is destroyed and 13.8 percent is

created each year. Gross job turnover ranging from one--in-three to

one—in-five jobs occurs in these years. Much of this turbulence in the labor

market appears to be accommodated without great effect on wages, but this is

not fully developed here. What is clear from this data on establishments, and

what could not be determined from data on workers, or on accessions and

separations at establishments, is that the level of employment at

establishments is characterized by substantial volatility. This volatility of

labor demand shows some positive cyclical variation but little industry

effect. Roughly one quarter of the "natural" rate of unemployment may be

accounted for by these largely idiosyncratic fluctuations in labor demand

within establishments. This substantial part of unemployment is largely

ignored and unaffected by manpower or aggregate demand policies because the

problem arises not from the instability of people nor the instability of

aggregate demand, but rather fundamentally from the instability of jobs.

1.   Establishments using only self-employment or unpaid family labor are not

required to file reports and are exempt from U.I. taxes. Therefore, one

worker establishments are likely to be underrepresented here. However, one

person establishments with an office address and a phone number are likely to

be included. Through 1977, agricultural establishments, railroads, and

non-profit organizations were exempt from U.I. coverage. Beginning in 1978,

only railroads, non-profit establishments with one to three employees, and

agricultural establishments with less than ten employees were excluded. Of

these changes, only the non-profits are of substance. To maintain a

consistent series, non-profit and government employment were excluded from the

data used here in all years. These exclusions include 25 percent of state

employment. Foreign (out of state) employment is also excluded.

2.   Where possible, large establishments reporting the greatest percentage

change in employment where checked against published County Business Patterns

data. If the published data ruled out such large changes, the observations

were dropped from the sample. This occurred in fewer than 70 cases, but other

reporting errors cannot be precluded. In particular, establishments that may

have incorrectly reported stable employment were not checked.

3.   If the results to be analyzed here are thought of as coming from a

population, there is no need nor scope for statistical inference. The results

presented here are in this case the true population parameters calculated

without sampling. In a broader sense, the establishments analyzed here may be

thought of as a sample from a larger population across states or time, or each

establishmentts employment may be thought of as including a deviation from
                                     -24—


target. In both these latter cases, the usual rules of statistical inference

apply.

4.   Since vacancies average only 1.7 to 3.7 percent of the workforce (Abraham

(1983)) and are typically filled within a few months, such turnover is assumed

to have no effect on the establishment side measures of job gain or loss. In

other words, I assume workers who quit or are fired are all quickly replaced

and so do not affect the measures of job gain or loss calculated here.

5.   Because of a regression to the mean phenomena, the shrinking

establishments tend to start larger than the growing establishments. Table 3

shows the share of the previous year's employment accounted for by

establishments that grew since the previous year. While growing establishment

account for 23 percent of all establishments, they account for an average of

45 percent of all employment -in the year prior to their growth. Similarly,

shrinking establishments account for 21 percent of all establishments, but 47

percent of all employment in the year prior to their decline. In part because

of an integer constraint in the way employment is counted here, the stable

establishments are primarily one and two person establishments. Stable

establishments then account for about two-thirds of the establishments, but on

8 percent of the jobs each year.

6.   Overcounts of job loss and gain when ownership of an establishment

changes hands appears to be a relatively minor problem with the data used

here. A version of this data which made great efforts to correct for this

still shows an average 10 percent yearly job gain and 11 percent yearly job

loss between 1978 and 1981. See The Job Generation Process in Wisconsin:

1969—1981, p. 133.
                                     -25-


7.   This lends itself to a competing risks formulation. If a worker quits or

is fired before the job is done, we know only that job duration (life of the

job, not the job—employee match) exceeded job tenure (life of the employee—job

match).

8.   It is reasonable to expect greater variations in the level of employment

where wages are more rigid. Leonard (1986) shows that annual variation in

employment is not greater in unionized plants than in their non—union

counterparts. If wage rigidity is to contribute to the explanation of

establishment level employment volatility, then it is probably a pervasive

institution not isolated to the union sector.

9.   This heterogeneity across establishments within an industry and region

may also help explain the difficulties encountered by compensating

differentials studies that utilize industry level data to measure, for

example, a worker's risk of becoming unemployed. See Murphy and Topel (1986).

Moreover, this substantial idiosyncratic part of unemployment risk should be

diversifiable. In this sample, the correlation of growth rates across

establishments is too low to be a barrier to insurance against layoff.
