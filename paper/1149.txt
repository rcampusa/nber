        Models of Arbitrator Behavior: Theory and Evidence

                                  Abstract




     This paper analyzes and compares arbitrator behavior under conventional
and final—offer arbitration. Simple models of arbitrator behavior are
developed under each of these alternative mechanisms. These models are
estimated and tested using data on the outcomes of both forms of arbitration
in New Jersey, a state in which arbitration is mandatory for unresolved pay
disputes involving police officer unions and public employers. The major
findings are (1) that the high proportion of union victories under final—offer
arbitration were generated by a set of impartial arbitrators applying the same
standards used in conventional arbitration, and (2) that union bargainers appear
to be considerably more risk averse than employer bargainers, with the wage
increases under final—offer arbitration having a lower mean and a lower variance
than under conventional arbitration.

       The arbitration of disputes by third—party neutrals has become

 a major industry in the U.S. Arbitration's use in the settlement of

 disputes arising under existing contracts ranges from the settlement

 of grievances in union—management contracts to the settlement of

 highly complex disputes between buyers and sellers in commercial

 contracts. Arbitration is also now widely used to arrive at the terms

of new contracts. The use of these provisions for contract, or

 'interest," arbitration ranges from the highly public disputes between

baseball players and club owners to the settlement of public sector

labor disputes and the fashioning of divorce settlements.

      Since arbitration mechanisms may be designed in several ways,

their increased use makes it increasingly important to understand how

the differences in arbitration systems may affect outcomes. Our pur-

pose in this paper is to open up the empirical analysis of some simple

models of arbitrator behavior under alternative mechanisms and in dif-

ferent economic environments. We do this by studying the outcomes in

the first three years of operation of a New Jersey statute that man-

dates the arbitration of unsettled pay disputes by New Jersey police

officers and the municipalities that employ them. This remarkable

statute provides for conventional arbitration of pay disputes If the

two parties can agree to this, but requires the use of final—offer

arbitration if they cannot. Consequently, the results of both mecha-

nisms may be analyzed and compared.
                                —2—




     In proceeding this way we hope to shed light on two related

issues. First, arbitration mechanisms are simply one specialized type

of legal setting for the settlement of disputes. The setting is ana—

logous to a civil suit with the arbitrator acting as judge. Indeed,

each side's "case" is often presented to the arbitrator by the

parties' attorneys, and the arbitrator produces a written decision

after hearing the case. Negotiated settlements are entirely analogous

to "out of court" settlements in civil suits, and arbitrated cases are

the ones that •'go to trial." What is unusual about arbitration

systems is that the arbitrator's decisions, and sometimes the

proposals made by the parties, are both publicly obtainable and easily

reduced to a single numerical magnitude. Consequently, we suspect

that a great deal may be learned about the general nature of legal

decision—making by quantitative studies of the simpler arbitration

prototypes .

      Second, the growing theoretIcal literature on the nature of
alternative arbitration mechanisms has raised a number of issues whose

resolution requires empirical inquiry. In conventional arbitration,

for example, the arbitrator fashions an award based on an analysis of

the relevant facts and the arbitrator's external judgment of what

would comprise a fair award. It has often been suggested that this

arbitration system generates little useful Information from the par-

ties, and causes the parties' settlement offers to diverge, because to

do otherwise might prejudice the arbitrator's judgment against the

parties' self interests. To remedy this potential difficulty, Carl
                                  —3—




 Stevens suggested a system of final—offer arbitration nearly two

 decades ago. Stevens suggested that in order to induce settlement

 each party should be required to submit to the arbitrator a single

final offer, and the arbitrator would then be required to select one

or the other of those offers without compromise.2

       In early theoretical work, Crawford observed that if the

arbitrator's (exogenously determined) notion of a fair settlement were

known to the two parties, then both arbitration mechanisms would

almost certainly lead to the same outcome in a zero—sum setting. In

conventional arbitration this would happen because whatever negotiated

settlement was proposed by one party, the other party would always

do better by holding out for the arbitrator's "fair" decision. Thus,

all outcomes would coincide with the arbitrator's preference either

through negotiation under the threat of arbitration or by arbitrator

decision. Assuming the arbitrator selects the final offer closest to

his notion of a fair settlement, this would also be the case wIth

final—offer arbitration. Again, whatever proposal was made by one

party, the other party could always do better by holding out for the

arbitrator's preferred outcome and both parties would inevitably be

led to agree on this outcome or see it imposed by the arbitrator. In

this scenario, the threat of arbitration effectively determines the

outcome of all settlements and, if the parties bear the arbitration

costs, the actual arbitration of cases would wither away.3 Although

this might appear to the outsider as the great success of the arbitra-

tion system in encouraging the parties to bargain on their own,
                                    —4—




precisely the contrary would be the case. The parties would merely be

agreeing to the outcome that is already a foregone conclusion and

saving themselves the cost of arbitration.

      The key to Crawford's conclusion is, of course, the assumption

that both parties know with certainty the arbitrator's preferred out-

come. In a series of papers Farber, and Farber and Katz (1979, 1980),

have explored the case where the parties are uncertain as to the

arbitrator's preferences. In this setting the outcomes under conven-

tional and final—offer arbitration will generally differ. Negotiated

settlements and whether these will occur will then depend, in dif-

ferent ways under the two arbitration systems, on the parties' attitu-

des toward risk, their prior views on the distribution of arbitrator

preferences, and other variables.

      Distinguishing whether it is more or less reasonable to assnme

that the parties are certain about arbitrator preferences is equiva-

lent to testing whether the arbitrator's decisions under a final—offer

statute are predictable once information on the final offers and the

environment of the bargaining unit is known. In this paper we put

these issues to an empirical test in an effort to discriminate between

the implications of these two theoretical setups. In order to do this

we set out simple models of arbitrator behavior under both final—offer

and conventional arbitration and provide a method for testing the

empirical implications of these models for observed arbitration

awards and for the "fairness" of arbitrator behavior.

 I. 1kdels of Arbitrator Behavior

       The New Jersey Fire and Police Arbitration Act was approved in

 May of 1977. The establishment of some kind of arbitration statute

 followed almost inevitably from the passage in 1968 of legislation

 that granted New Jersey's public sector employees the right to orga-

 nize and bargain collectively, but not the right to strike. The dif-

 ficulty was that In the absence of the right to strike negotiations

 often went on long after annual municipal budget cycles had been

 closed. The purpose of the arbitration statute was to ensure that

contract negotiations were final by the time of the employer's budget

submission date.

      To accomplish this purpose employees and employers covered by

the Act (mainly police and fire department workers) must begin collec-

tive bargaining at least 120 days before the employer's budget sub-

mission date. If the parties do not reach an agreement by 60 days

prior to this date they may select the conventional arbitration mecha-

nism for settlement of the unresolved issues. If the parties cannot

or prefer not to agree to conventional arbitration they are then com-

pelled to have the disputed issues resolved by final—offer arbitra-

tion, with the economic issues taken as a single package.

      Arbitrators are assigned to cases by the New Jersey Public

Employment Relations Commission (PERC), which is responsible for admi-

nistration of the Act. A list of seven members from the PERC's spe-

cial panel of arbitrators is first circulated to the parties for

comment. One of the seven Is then appointed to the case, with all
                                  —6—




arbitration fees borne jointly by the parties (subject to a fee sche-

dule approved by the PERC).


      A. Arbitrator Behavior Under Final—Offer Arbitration

      Under final—offer arbitration the arbitrator is required to

select either the union's final offer wU or the employer's final offer

   as the settlement.5 In order to do this we suppose that the

arbitrator has in mind a preferred settlement a. The value of a is

presumably based on the application of subjective principles of equity

to the objective considerations of a particular case.6 The value of

   in any particular arbitration case is, of course, unknown to out-

side observers. Moreover, in a case resolved by final—offer arbitra-

tion a will never be revealed.

      The preferred settlements of arbitrators a will presumably vary

across arbitration cases both because of unobserved variations in eco—

nomic environments and because of differences in arbitrators'

assessments of those circumstances. We shall suppose that in a given

year a may be thought of as being drawn from an as yet unspecified
distribution function. The simplest mechanism by which an arbitrator

in a particular case might select an offer is to choose that party's

offer that is closest to wa. In these circumstances the arbitrator

would select the employer's offer if

              a   e       u   a
       (1)    1w —w 1w —wI
and select the union's offer otherwise. Since we < wu or there would

be no need for arbitration, (1) implies that the employer's offer is

selected if
                                  —7--




             a      e       u
       (2) w      (w +w)/2

 Given the established values of the employer and union final offers,

 (2) implies that the employer's offer will be chosen if an arbitrator

 is selected for the case whose preferred settlement is less than the

 simple average of e and wU. It follows that the probability of an

 employer victory, P, is simply


       (3) P = Prob a (We + wU)/2]


               = F [(we +


where F(s) indicates the value of the cumulative distribution function

that describes arbitrator preferences.7 If we take the distribution

of arbitrator preferences to be normal with mean i and standard

deviation a, as we shall do in our empirical work, (3) is simply


      (4) P = N [(We + wU)/2P —    (P/yP)]

where N(s) indicates the value of the cumulative standard normal

distribution function. Expression (4) is nothing more than a simple

probit function, and its parameters are straightforward to estimate by

standard maximum likelihood methods. The constant in this probit

function is an estimate of ji/a, while the coefficient of (We + w)/2

is an estimate of l/a. It follows that although the various realized

values of a may not be observed, the parameters of the distribution

function from which the arbitrator's preferences are drawn may be

estimated from a series of observations on union and employer final

offers and arbitrator choices from those offers.
                                           —8—




      It is worth observing that the even—handed arbitrator treatment

of union and employer offers embedded in the decision rule (1) has

some immediate superficial plausibility, at least under the New Jersey

statute. After all, arbitrator fees are borne by the parties and the

parties' choices are taken into account in the selection of an

arbitrator from the panel of seven arbitrators initially proposed.

Since arbitrators derive considerable income from these fees the deci-

sion rule (1) may be the best viable strategy for maximizing an

arbitrator's income over any long—run period.8

      A major objection to the even—handed arbitrator treatment

implied by (1) is that it rules out arbitrator bias as might be indi-

cated by the asymmetric treatment of union and employer final offers.

As it turns out, the presence of this form of arbitrator bias may be

tested for empirically. Suppose, for example, that the employer's

offer is accepted if

                 a     e         u     a
      (5) a tw — w         < 1w —      w



where a > 0. In this setup arbitrators demonstrate a pro—union, pro—

employer, or no bias as a > 1, a < 1, or a = 1.             With this specifica-

tion the probability that an employer's offer is accepted is


      (6) P = N      { [ct/(1   + a)   ]   qe + [11(1 +   a) i1   wU —   P/P}

Equation   (6)   does nothing more than free up the coefficients on

   and wU in the probit function. The ratio of these coefficients is

an estimate of a, while their sum is an estimate of 1/c. We shall

test the hypothesis a = 1 in the empirical work below.
                                              —9—




        An alternative objection to the decision rule (1) is that It

 implies that arbitrator notions of fairness do not explicitly take

 account of the parties' final offers. It is not hard to see, however,

 that so long as the arbitrator weighs the employer and union offers

 symmetrically the decision rule (1) is observatlonally equivalent to

 an entire class of rules where the arbitrator does take these offers

 explicitly Into account. Suppose for example that the arbitrator's

preference a is formed as


        (7) -a
            w = ywa      + (1 —    y)
                                          e
                                        (w + w )/2
                                                    u



with 0 < y < 1. Here 1a is a weighted average of a, the arbitrator's

preference in the absence of information on the offers, and the mid-

point of the final offers. The employer's offer is accepted if
    —
        wel < twu —   a1     which will be the case if

            -a
            w    = ywa                   e          u   e   u
                         + (1 —    y)   (w + w )/2 < (w ÷ w )/2

or if

              a          e     u
        (8) yw <y(w +w)/2

The condition (8) is, of course, identical to (1). From an empirical

point of view, therefore, there is an infinite set of symmetric

arbitrator decIsion—making processes that all lead to the same obser—

vationally equivalent decisions. In this sense the decision rule (1)

may be a very robust empirical device.
                                               —10—




       It   is worth observing that the structure of the empirical

analysis varies slightly when arbitrators use decision rule (5) but

when arbitrator notions of fairness are formed according to equation

(7). In this case the probability that an employer's offer is

accepted is


        (9) P =
                            e           u pm
                                 +62w —i /c
                        N{61w

where 61 =      [ct/(l +a) — (1 _1)/2]/10P            and 62 = [11(1   +a)   —


(1 —   y)/21/ya'.         By comparison it is clear that equations (9) and (6)

are observationally equivalent and that a and y are not separately

identified in the latter formulation. Nevertheless, as with (6), the

sum of the coefficients of e and w in (9) is an estimate of

implying that             is identified, and the equality of the coefficients

   and 62 continues to provide a test of the hypothesis a = 1.

        The test of the hypothesis a = 1 is mainly a test of the deci-

sion rule (1) under the maintained hypothesis that the distribution

function characterizing the a may be taken to be normal. To this

point, however, we have not attempted to characterize this distribu-

tion in any more detail. For many observers, however, a test of the

fairness of arbitrators is really a test of whether                    is "fair," or

of whether arbitrators have the "correct" preferences. Of course, it

is difficult to specify the value for                   that would be fair, but it is

not difficult to make                 a function of some specified set of variables

whose coefficients can be estimated. For the th observation we

may write           =           to   get the probit function



        (6a)
               P1
                     = N{ [a/(l      + a) i]   w   + [11(1   + a) ci w -   P,    aP}
                                  —11—




 This merely introduces the variables x1 into the probit function. Our

 estimates of the coefficients in the vector 8 p will indicate how the

 variables in the vector x determine the mean of the distribution of

 the arbitrators' notions of what is fair. These estimates may, of

 course, be compared by the outside observer against any proposed def i—

 nitlon of what should determine an average a "fair" award. Indeed,

 the econometric analysis that follows may be interpreted as nothing

 more than a scheme for uncovering the nature of arbitrator preferences

 when only qualitative information on arbitrator awards is available.

       We consider three main candidate variables to enter the vector

 x. First, it seems likely that a measure of the wage rate in some

alternative occupation may influence an arbitrator's decision. If the

relative supply of workers to police departments were very elastic

with respect to this alternative wage, the wage structure determined

in a competitive market would, of course, guarantee one—to—one move-

ments in the wage rates of police workers and the wage rates in theIr

alternative occupations. For a variety of reasons we doubt that the

relative supply of police workers is highly elastic in the short run,

but the hypothesis that arbitrators form their notions of a fair award

as if it were true has considerable intuitive appeal and seems worth

testing. Second, it also seems possible that arbitrators may act to

narrow (or occasionally widen) the wage differentials of police

workers across municipal jurisdictions. To the extent that this

occurs we may expect that an arbitrator's notion of a fair wage

increase will be negatively (or occasionally positively) correlated
                                   —12—




with the level of the wage in the previous contract in that municipa-

lity. To test this hypothesis we include the level of the previous

contract wage as an element of the vector x1. Finally, we consider

the impact of the municipality's financial well—being on the

arbitrator's decision. We include in the vector x both the

municipality's tax rate and its per capita debt, with the presumption

that greater values of both of these variables operate to reduce the

arbitrator's notion of a fair award. We conclude by observing that,

as we have already noted, the New Jersey statute directs arbitrators

to consider all of these items in framing their decisions, but without

stipulating how or in what form.     It is an empirical question, there-

fore, as to whether any or all of these variables bear a stable rela-

tionship to arbitrator preferences.


      B. Arbitrator Behavior Under Conventional Arbitration

      Under conventional arbitration the arbitrator is free to fashion

a settlement of his own choosing.     As before, we assume that

wa represents the arbitrator's preferred award in the absence of

                                                    consider two alter-
information on the parties' proposed offers. We

native schemes by which the arbitrator may fashion and then impose a

 settlement .

       The simplest scheme would be for the arbitrator to simply impose

 his preferred award wa as the settlement. In this case observations

 on conventional arbitration awards would directly reveal arbitrator

 preferences. For the ith arbitration case we would then have
                                              —13—




        (10) w =
                         r+

where      has mean zero and standard deviation nr. If the mean of the

distribution of the arbitrator's preferred settlements varies with

some vector of variables              whose coefficient vector is   this would

lead to nothing more than the regression function

               a =
        (11)             8r   +


which is easily fit to the data on conventional arbitration awards.

        Alternatively, it may be supposed that the arbitrator attempts

to fashion a compromise based on a and the arguments presented to him

by the parties. Suppose that the last offers presented by the parties
                         e
to each other are            and wU and that these are made known to the

arbitrator. A natural compromise arbitration award would then be



        (12)        =pw + (1 —p)(w +w)/2


                    =                    —
                        P(xF)     + (1
                                             p)(w    + w)/2 +pc1


                 =                +
                        P(x1t)

           = (1 —
where
                    p)(w + w)/2          +
                                             pci,   and 0 < p < 1

        The second line of (12) might also be fit directly as a

regression function to the data if e and w" were observed. In con-

ventional arbitration proceedings, however, these offers are not
                                  —14—




generally known to outside observers, and they may never be stated

explicitly by either party in any case. If the unobserved offers

   and w" are correlated with the variables In the vector x, as may

well be the case, our regression estimates of        in (12) will suffer

from conventional omitted variable bias.

      The question naturally arises as to how the models of conven-

tional arbitrator behavior in (11) and (12) might be distinguished

empirically. It should be clear that this will not generally be

possible without observations on e and w1 when all arbitrators are

assigned to conventional arbitration cases. In New Jersey, however,

the same panel of arbitrators is used in both conventional arbitration

and final—offer arbitration cases. It follows that for this group of
                          r          r              r =
arbitrators we may assume p = p p , a = a p , and         p.   Under these

assumptions we may fit equations (6a) and (11) separately and use a

test for the equality of these parameters as evidence to favor one or

the other of the formulations of (11) or (12). If, for example, the

inverse of the standard deviation of conventionally arbitrated awards

Is equal to the slope of the probit function in (4) we have evidence

that arbitrators simply impose upon the parties their notion of a fair

award, as In (10).   If, on the other hand, this equality Is not

satisfied in the data we may have evidence that the arbitrators take

some account of the unobserved offers of the parties, as in (12).b0

II. Empirical Results

        The likelihood function for the final—offer arbitration sample

is simply


        (13) L =   ie 'i 1u (1 —
where      is given by (6) [or (6a)] and the first product iei is

taken over employer victories and the second product ,r(1 —                    is

taken over union victories. The likelihood function for the conven-

tional arbitration sample is simply the likelihood for a conventional

regression,

      A. Basic Results

      Sample statistics for the basic data are given in Table 1.

These data were collected directly from written arbitration reports.

In a few cases all the necessary data were not available in a given

report and the observation had to be deleted. Arbitration awards and

final offers are given throughout in the form of percentage increases

in total compensation.

      The sample statistics in Table 1 reveal much of what the econo-

metric analysis will confirm. First, the mean of the union and

employer final offers is quite low when compared to the mean of the

conventionally arbitrated settlements. In 1979 and 1980 the mean of

the union offers is about equal to the mean of the conventionally

arbitrated settlements, while the mean of the employer offers is more

than two percentage points lower. Although not quite so extreme in

the data for 1978, this phenomenon shows up there also. If the mean

of the conventionally arbitrated cases is taken to indicate the mean

of the distribution of arbitrators' preferred settlements, this

suggests that the union groups were behaving very conservatively

indeed. Second, consistent with this presumption is the fact that in

all three years the union offers were accepted in roughly two—thirds

to three—quarters of the cases. The result was that actual awards

under conventional and final—offer arbitration were not nearly so far

apart as the parties' final offers might indicate. Finally, the pro-

portion of cases reaching arbitration dropped considerably between

1978 and 1980. This is consistent with the notion that the use of

arbitration will decline considerably as more is learned by the par-

ties about arbitrator preferences. Between the first and second years

of the statute's operation in New Jersey the percentage of nego-

tiations that ended up in arbitration declined from nearly 49 percent

to 34 percent. The drop in the utilization of arbitration from the

second to the third year of the statute'.s life was far less dramatic,

and it Is our casual impression that further declines have been

smaller still. This suggests, although the data are not yet available

to confirm it, that at least one—quarter of negotiations may continue

to end in arbitration even after the parties are thoroughly familiar

with the statute's operation.

      Table 2 contains the empirical results obtained by maximizing

various versions of the likelihood functions (13) — (15) when the

variables x are ignored. These results are perhaps the easiest to

interpret and they display much of what the data contain. In column

(a) we present the simplest results for each year that correspond to

the probit function (4) and the regression equation (10). In these

results we impose the constraint a =    1.0.   Consider first the results

for 1980. The mean of arbitrator preferences from the final—offer

arbitration cases (1jP) is estimated at 8.3 percent, which is con-

siderably higher than the mean of the final offers of the employer

groups and only slightly lower than the mean of the final offers of

the union groups indicated In Table 1. The standard deviation of

arbitrator preferences from the final—offer arbitration cases (yP) is

estimated at 1.5 percentage points and, as (4) shows, this indicates a

strong positive correlation in the data between the final offers and

the incidence of employer victories. The remarkable result in column

(a), however, is the extraordinarily close match between the indepen-

dent estimates of the mean and standard deviation of arbitrator pre-

ferences from the conventional and final—offer arbitration cases.

This indicates that the coefficient of (We + w5/2 in the probit func—

tion(4) is nearly identical to the reciprocal of the standard

deviation of the regression errors in equation (10). As Table 1 indi-

cates, precisely the same result holds in the 1978 and 1979 data.

Although not conclusive, this strongly suggests that the settlements

in the conventionally arbitrated cases mainly reveal the underlying

distribution of arbitrator preferences. The results in the columns

labeled (b) are obtained by maximizing the likelihood function (15) in

order to test the joint hypothesis 11r pP and       =   a.   As expected,

a likelihood ratio test indicates that this hypothesis cannot be

rejected in any of the years 1978, 1979, or 1980.

      There is another simple way to state these empirical results.

Suppose that we take the mean and standard deviation of the conven-

tional arbitration awards as measures of the mean and standard

deviation of arbitrators' preferences (Wa). These assumptions imply

that we may predict the actual fraction of employer victories

from: knowledge of the final offers. Table 2 confirms that these

predictions are essentially identical to the maximum likelihood

predictions based on the final—offer data alone. Likewise, these same

assumptions imply that the correlation between the simple average of
                                     —21—




 the union and employer final offers, (We + w5/2, and the incidence of

employer victories may be predicted from the mean and standard

deviation of the conventional arbitration awards alone. We also find

this to be the case from the results in Table 2.

      In the columns labeled (c) in Table 2 we continue to maintain

the hypothesis lIp =     and     =   r    and test the hypothesis a =    1.0.
In 1980 the estimate of a is well above unity, while in 1979 the esti-

mate of a is slightly below unity, but in no case can we reject the

hypothesis a =   1.0.   In the columns labelled (d) we no longer maintain

the hypotheses      =    and    =        and again test the hypothesis
a = 1.0.   Again for 1979 and 1980 we can find no evidence for rejec-

tion of this hypothesis. This suggests that the unbiased decision

rule (1) provides a satisfactory fit to the data, at least for 1979

and 1980. The exception is for 1978, where the hypothesis a = 1.0 may

be rejected at any conventional test level. What this finding

represents in the data may be stated In a different way. In par-

ticular, the results in column (d) of Table 2 for 1978, for example,

imply a coefficient (and standard error) for e in the probit equation

(6) of .59 (.07). The estimated coefficient (and standard error) on

   in equation (6a) is —.15 (.04), however. These results indicate

that the incidence of employer victories was positively correlated

with the size of employer final offers in the 1978 data, as expected,

but that the incidence of employer victories was negatively correlated

with the size of union final offers, which was not expected. In view

of the results for 1979 and 1980 we are inclined to attribute the poor

performance of the simple arbitrator rule (1)       in   1978 to the con-

siderable confusion surrounding the initial implementation of the New

Jersey statute.12 Why and how this would have produced the anomalous

empirical results in Table 2 is an issue that requires further

research.


        B. Further Results

        Table 3 contains unrestricted estimates of the parameters               and

    under various specifications for the variables in the vector x1.

Definitions and descriptive statistics for these variables are con-

tained in Table 4. Also listed in each column are the values for the

maximized logarithmic likelihood under the constraints             =   r   and the

maximized logarithmic likelihood under the further constraint that

a = 1.0.13     Testing the hypothesis a       1.0 without   maintaining
   =   r   may be accomplished by using a straightforward normal

statistic computed from the estimate of a and its estimated standard

error in Table 3.

        The rationale for including the variables SAL, TAX and DEBT in

the analysis has already been established, but the inclusion of PCI,

the percentage change in county income per capita, requires some

explanation.     As our earlier discussion suggested, we would         like to

have measured the    percentage   change in some alternative wage rate in

the municipality to include in      the   vector of variables x.       At the
level   of the municipality to which these data refer, however, the best

measure of this    quantity   that we could obtain was the percentage

change in per capita income in the county of which the municipality is

a part. The use of this variable no doubt entails some measurement

error and may result in downward biased estimates of the effect of

this variable. A useful future research project would be to remedy

this measurement defect, if this is possible.

      As Table 3 indicates, the alternative wage variable (LPCI) has a

statistically significant and positive effect on the mean of arbitra-

tor preferences in the data for 1979 and 1980 for both the final—offer

and conventional arbitration cases. In 1979 the alternative wage

coefficient is near to unity for both types of cases, as we had specu-

lated might be the case. In 1980, however, this coefficient is signi-

ficantly less than unity, and in 1978 it is often negative and

occasionally statistically significant. Taken together these results

provide some support for the hypothesized importance of alternative

wages in the determination of arbitrator preferences, although the

results are far from conclusive.

      In 1978 and 1980 the level of the previous contract salary has a

negative effect on arbitrator preferences that is generally statisti-

cally significant. This suggests that in these years arbitrators

tended to behave as if they wished to narrow the salary differences

across municipalities. In 1979, however, the previous contract salary

tends to have a positive effect on arbitrator preferences that is

often statistically significant. Taken at face value these results

suggest that the arbitrator's perceived role in narrowing (or

widening) inter—municipality salary differences may be unstable from

year to year.
                                       —27—




         Finally, in 1978 and 1979 greater levels of taxation and per

 capita municipal debt have an unambigously negative and statistically

 significant effect on arbitrator awards. In 1980 these results are no

longer unambiguous; indeed, the (unreported) estimates that constrain
   =       generally   show no statistically significant effect of per

capita debt or taxation on arbitrator awards. These results suggest

that the arbitrator's perceived role in responding to municipal taxa-

tion or debt burdens is by no means stable from year to year.

         In sum, we have found statistically significant, but temporarily

unstable effects of alternative wage rates, prior contract wage rates,

and per capita debt and taxation variables on arbitrator awards.

There are two alternative explanations for these results, but it will

take additional research to sort out their empirical validity. First,

it may simply be the case that the main predictable variability in the

central tendency of arbitrator awards is in their movements through

time. If this is the case, then our time—series of estimates of
  = pP     11r and a =     = ar   for each year should ultimately provide

the data for a more complete explanation of the basic variability in

arbitrator preferences. Considerably more experience with the

New Jersey statute will be necessary before there is enough data to

make this feasible. Moreover, if this is the explanation for our

findings, then most of the parameter estimates in Table 3 do not

reveal much, if anything, about the more fundamental determinants of

arbitrator decision—making. Indeed, in casual conversations we have

found that much arbitrator behavior is characterized as "following the
                                —28—




herd,' or "looking up and down the street," and the results in Table 3

may simply be a description of this behavior rather than an explana—

tion of it.

      An alternative explanation is that there are stable rela-

tionships between arbitrator preferences and some set of variables xi,

but that in our analysis important variables have been omitted from

x. Only data from a better experiment than we have available can

confirm or refute this possibility.

      The remaining results in Table 3 confirm the major findings in

Table 2. In 1979 and 1980 the hypothesis a = 1.0 is clearly

accepted by the data, although for 1978 It clearly is rejected. On

the other hand, the joint constraints    =     and    =    are occa-

sionally rejected in the various specifications for x that are tested

in Table 3. We are inclined to attribute this to the very small

samples (especially for conventional arbitration) available for esti-

mating the fully unconstrained models. No doubt larger samples and a

more detailed set of variables for the vector x would increase the

power and confidence with which these hypotheses can be tested.

      Finally, and perhaps most important, the addition of the

variables x1 to the analysis reduces the estimated unpredictable

variability in arbitrator preferences (a). Nevertheless, considerable

unpredictable variability remains in all cases. In view of the

importance of this issue we have also pursued It by an attempt to

account for the individual influence of specific arbitrators. To do

this we have estimated equation (4) with separate intercepts for each
                                    —29—




 arbitrator. In the probit model these fixed effects are econometri-

 cally identified only if an individual arbitrator selected at least

 one employer offer and one union offer in a given year. Table 5 lists

 the number of final—offer arbitration cases that satisfy this cri-

 terion. There are simply too few conventional arbitration cases to

perform the analysis for that group. Depending on the year, the table

indicates that nearly one—half of the final—offer arbitration cases

are decided by four to seven arbitrators who selected at least one

union and one employer final offer.

      The results in Table 5 indicate that the introduction of the

arbitrator dummies considerably reduces the estimate of the unpredic-

table variability ()   in   arbitrator preferences in 1980 and 1978.

Nevertheless, cl never falls below one percent and is sometimes as

high as three percent. This strongly suggests that successful models

of the strategic behavior of the parties will almost certainly have to

account explicitly for the uncertainty the parties face in arbitrator

decision—making.



III. Conclusion

      The empirical models of arbitrator behavior in this paper are an

important first step in the much needed empirical studies of arbitra-

tion outcomes that remain on the agenda for further research. More

complete models should explain both the determination of the parties'

final offers, whether they choose to engage in conventional or final—

offer arbitration, and whether they choose to negotiate a settlement

without arbitration. The simple models of arbitrator behavior

presented and estimated with remarkable success here will presumably

be a key ingredient to this further research.

      We have two important substantive empirical results to report.

First, under the New Jersey statute union offers have been selected

most of the time in final—offer arbitration cases.1 This finding has

raised immediate questions about the impartiality and integrity of the

arbitrators in some quarters. In general, we should expect a fair

arbitrator to be one that considered the objective considerations in a

particular case and then settled on what, in the arbitrator's own

mind, seemed a preferred settlement. Given the arbitrator's preferred

award, it seems clear that a fair arbitrator must select whichever

final offer is closest to it. Supposing that the union and employer

also understand this process, they will use their best estimates of

the arbitrator's preference to shape their own offers with the

understanding that a higher offer by either party will increase the

probability that the employer's offer will be selected. If the

parties behave symmetrically, as most of us might have expected, we

would expect the union and employer offers to fall equally distant

from, but on opposite sides of, the parties' best estimate of the

arbitrator's preferred award. In this scenario we should naturally

expect the union offers to be selected in one—half of the cases. It

is this prediction that isstrongiy:contradicted by the facts.

     It follows that thereare two. different resons:why unIon offers

may be disproportionately accepted by the arbitrators. On the one

hand, arbitrators may not follow the decision process
If this is the case, the integrity of the arbitration system is being

seriously undermined. On the other hand, the parties may not typi-

cally position themselves equally distant from, and on opposite sides

of, the arbitrator's preferred award. This might happen either

because unions have a more conservative view of what arbitrators will
                                              of taking the risk of loss
allow or because unions may be more fearful

than are employers.

      Our econometric results provide strong evidence, however, that

the final—offer arbitration decisions were generated by a set of

impartial arbitrators who were systematically applying the same

standards used in conventional arbitration cases.    The evidence for

this is that (a) the proportion of union victories and (b) the

correlation between the incidence of union victories and the mean of

the union and employer final offers are precisely those predicted from

the data on conventional arbitration cases
                                              alone. (These are econo-

                                          restrictions.) These results
metric tests of standard cross—equation
                                                     offers no dif-
 indicate that arbitrators treat generous employer

 ferently than they treat conservative union offers. Instead, the

 union offers are most often selected because the frequency of

 conservative union offers is considerably greater than the frequency

 of generous employer offers. it follows that any critique of the

 generosity of the final—offer arbitration awards must be based on

 something other than simple win—loss records.
                                 —33—




      Our second important empirical result Is that this conservative

union behavior resulted in lower average wage increases under the

final—offer arbitration provisions than under the conventional

arbitration provisions of the New Jersey statute. Although the union

offers are accepted in a vast majority of the final—offer arbitration

cases, and so the unions appear to "win' In final—offer arbitration,

the actual wage increases in these cases are lower than in the conven-

tional arbitration cases. At the same time, we find considerably less

variability In the actual awards under the final—offer arbitration

provisions than under the conventional arbitration provisions of the

statute. What the union bargainers gave up, therefore, by way of a

decrease in the mean award under final—offer arbitration they may have

made up by a reduction in its variability. This suggests that union

bargainers may be considerably more risk averse than employer

bargainers and opens up some interesting possibilities for additional

research.

      The serious quantitative study of dispute settlement mechanisms

has only just begun. Further empirical and theoretical research on

the operation of these mechanisms may therefore have an important

impact on their future design.

     Gould.

2. Stevens' remarkable paper raises most of the important issues

     relevant to the analysis of this arbitration scheme. The use of

     his system is growing and has already been adopted for the settle-

     ment of certain public sector labor disputes in six U.S. states

     and in Chile and has also been used in settling disputes in major

     league baseball. James Meade, a prominent member of Britain's new

     Social Democratic Party, has suggested its use in Great Britain as

     the enforcement mechanism for a new wage and price monitoring

 4. We analyze only disputes in police work in this paper, as many of

    New Jersey's fire department are volunteer companies. Other

    details of the statute are discussed by Bloom (1980).

 5. Under the New Jersey statute those issues that may be reduced to a

    single numerical award are the "economic" issues, and it is these

    that we examine throughout. "Noneconomic" issues are handled as a

    separate item under the New Jersey statute, and their analysis

    raises some difficult issues. In fact, however, most disputes

    involving police officers in New Jersey have been over pay, so

    that our focus on economic issues is probably the appropriate one

   there.

6. In New Jersey, arbitrators are directed to give due weight to an

   enormously broad variety of factors that includes (1) the

   interests of the public, (2) relevant comparisons of wages and

   working conditions, (3) the overall level of compensation already

   received, (4) the f1nancal impact of the settlement on the

   municipality, (5)   the cost of living, and (6) the continuity of

   employment. Considerable discretion is obviously left to indivi-

   dual arbitrators.

7. Although his interpretation is different, equation (3) is iden-

   tical to Farber's (1980) formulation of a similar problem. Our

   procedure was to some extent inspired by his.

8. This view of the arbitrator is also suggested by Davis. As this

  discussion indicates, however, the incentive structure for

  arbitrators is an issue that deserves further research. Card has

   begun it in his study of grievance arbitration.

9. Both of these are possibilities suggested by Farber (1981).

10. There is one disturbing case where this test may    give   misleading

   results. Suppose that (12) is the correct structure for arbitra—

    tor preferences, but that the estimates of (11) are biased by the

    omission of the variables (We w)/2 so as to cause acceptance of

    the cross—equation constraints. Although this seems unlikely, the

    positive correlation that presumably exists between           and

    (We + w')f2 will tend to counteract the attenuating effect of p on

    the parameters estimated (since 0 < p < 1).

11. The likelihood function (15) is identical to that used by

    Ashenfelter for an altogether different purpose, and its maximiza-

    tion was carried out by similar methods.

12. We initially advanced this explanation for the anomalous findings

    for 1978 in an earlier draft of this paper that contained data for

    1978 and 1979 only. Our   findings    from the 1980 data obviously

    reinforced the strength of our belief in this explanation, but

    only additional data can confirm it. There Was considerable

    (perhaps unnecessary) confusion at the outset of the implemen-

    tation of the New Jersey statute because of an ambiguity in the

    CAP   law then in effect. This law sets a limit on the growth of
    municipal expenditures and there was initial uncertainty regarding

    whether this was to be applied uniformly to each budget item,

    including police salaries. Employers argued that the CAP law did

    apply to each budget item and that arbitrators were bound by it

    also. Subsequent court decisions made it clear that this was not

    the case.

13. The fitted coefficient8 for the constrained results are not

    reported to conserve space, but they are available from the

   authors in the form of a photocopied appendix.

14. This phenomenon is not restricted to New Jersey, however. There

   is evidence of similar behavior in Michigan and Massachusetts, as

   noted by Ashenfelter and Bloom.
