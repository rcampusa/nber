Does Automatic Enrollment Increase Contributions to Supplement Retirement Programs by
K-12 and University Employees?

                                         ABSTRACT

This study examines the impact of the adoption of automatic enrollment provisions by schools
and universities in the state of South Dakota for its supplemental retirement saving plan (SRP).
In South Dakota, educational personnel are also covered by a defined benefit pension plan and by
Social Security. Thus, career public employees in South Dakota can expect a life time annuity
from these two programs of around 75 percent of their final salary. Prior to the introduction of
automatic enrollment, the proportion of newly hired educators who were contributing to the SRP
was less than two percent in their first year of employment. After the introduction of automatic
enrollment, over 90 percent of newly hired workers who were auto enrolled were participating in
the plan. Thus, auto enrollment is shown to have the same powerful impact on contributions to a
retirement saving plan for educational employees even when they also can expect life annuities
from a defined benefit pension plan.

       Public education employees, at both the K-12 and university levels, tend to be covered by

Social Security, defined benefit retirement plans, and many are also covered by retiree health

plans offered by state and local government agencies. In addition, to being mandatorily covered

by these plans, education personnel are also given the opportunity to participate in supplemental

retirement plans which are retirement saving plans that receive preferential tax treatment. State

governments usually allow educational employees to contribute to 457 or 401(k) plans. Many

school districts and universities also offer employees the ability to contribute to 403(b) plans that

often are managed at the local level. In contrast to 401(k) plans in the private sector, most public

retirement saving plans do not offer employer matching contributions. An interesting policy

question is whether educational employees covered by relatively generous retirement benefits

and who are not offered employer matching contributions in the voluntary retirement savings

plan as an enticement to participate in a voluntary retirement saving plan will react in the same

manner to automatic enrollment provision as private sector employees who are not covered by

other retirement benefits and often are covered by substantial employer matching contributions.

       In general, career educational personnel earn a relatively generous lifetime annuity from

their pension to augment an inflation-indexed annuity from Social Security and they often

receive subsidized health insurance. With this base level of well-being in retirement, do

teachers, professors, and other educational employees also contribute to employer provided

retirement saving plans that do not provide the enticement of employer matching contributions?

There is very little data on participation rates in these saving plans by public employees but the

limited evidence indicates that participation rates are quite low. Two studies of North Carolina

K-12 employees indicated that only about one third of all employees contribute to any

supplemental saving plan (Clark, et al., 2016; Clark, Pathak, and Pelletier, 2018).


                                                  2
          Is the percentage of public employees who contribute to such saving plans based on

optimal lifecycle decisions? An alternative explanation could be that public employees suffer

from the effects of inertia in the same manner of employees who work for private sector firms,

i.e. newly hired workers who are not automatically enrolled in the plan are have lower

participation rates compare to those that are auto enrolled. Studies in behavioral economics

indicate that framing has a substantial effect of choices and often the default is taken to as an

implicit recommendation by the employer on whether additional saving is needed.

          Over the past two decades, a series of papers have shown the power of defaults to alter

saving decisions in employer-provided retirement saving plans. Studies have shown that

automatic enrollment policies result in a substantial increase in the proportion of employees

participating in retirement saving plans. In general, these studies have been conducted using

administrative data for a single firm or a small set of private sector firms in which the retirement

saving plan is the only employer-provided pension plan. The analysis typically focuses on the

introduction of automatic enrollment to an existing 401(k) and compares participation and

contributions rate shortly before and a few months after the adoption of the policy.

          The present study examines the impact of the adoption automatic enrollment provisions

for the 457 plan offered to educational employees by the state of South Dakota. South Dakota

K-12 school employees along with employees of the university system are covered by a defined

benefit pension plan and by Social Security. Thus, career educational employees can expect a

lifetime annuity from these two programs of around 75 percent of their final salary. 1 Prior to the

    Educational personnel in South Dakota are covered by the South Dakota Retirement System (SDRS)
and they are also covered by Social Security. SDRS is a defined benefit pension plan with a benefit
formula:
          Benefit = 1.55% times (final average salary) times (years for service after 2008)

introduction of automatic enrollment, the proportion of newly hired educational employees who

were contributing to the supplemental retirement plan (SRP) was less than two percent in their

first year of employment. After the introduction of automatic enrollment, over 90 percent of

newly hired education personnel who were auto enrolled were participating in the SRP.


    I.       Review of the Default Literature

         The recent literature examining the importance of defaults in supplemental retirement

savings plans begins with Madrian and Shea (2001) who analyze the 401(k) savings behavior of

employees in one large corporation before and after the introduction of automatic enrollment.

The employer match in the plan was 50 percent on the first 6 percent of an employee's salary

before and after the change in enrollment. The 401(k) plan was the only retirement plan offered

by the firm. Prior to the adoption of automatic enrollment, the participation rate in the 401(k)

plan was 57 percent. Auto enrollment was adopted by the firm in 1998 with a default

contribution of 3 percent of salary. The result of automatic enrollment was that participation

increased to over 80 percent and default contribution rate was a strong determinant of actual

contributions. Similar results are reported by Choi, et al (2004) and Choi, Laibson, and Madrian

(2004) who also examine employee responses to the introduction of automatic enrollment in a


         plus
         Benefit = 1.7% times (final average salary) times (years for service before 2008)

Individuals can retire with unreduced benefits at age 65 or if they meet the Rule of 85 requirements (the
sum of the retiree's age plus years of service equal 85) and are at least age 55. A variable Cost Of Living
Adjustment is provided based on the SDRS funded status and rate of inflation. The SDRS benefits
summarized above are applicable to members hired before 2017 and details are described in the member
handbook of the system which can be accessed at
http://www.sdrs.sd.gov/docs/ClassAFoundationMemberHandbook.pdf


                                                     4
variety of companies. In each case, they find that in the absence of automatic enrollment

participation rates are rather low but increase with tenure. 2

       Most of the papers examine the response to automatic enrollment in 401(k) plans offered by

private sector firms where the plan sponsor has an employer match and does not offer any other

retirement plan. Thus compared to public employees, these private sector employees have a

greater need to contribute to the saving plan and also the employer matching contribution

provide a significant inducement to participate in the plan. The present study examines whether

automatic enrollment will have similar powerful effects for public employees who are also

covered by a defined benefit plan and when the employer does not provide an employer

matching contribution.


      II.     Adoption of Automatic Enrollment in South Dakota


      In July 2009, South Dakota became one of the first state government to adopt an automatic

enrollment policy for its supplemental savings plan after the state legislature gave state and local

agencies covered by the South Dakota Retirement System (SDRS) the authority to institute

automatic enrollment policies; however, agencies were not required to adopt this policy. The

legislation required that agencies that did adopt automatic enrollment must cover all newly hired

employees. New employees in those agencies that adopted this policy are automatically enrolled



2
    An exception to the focus on private sector firms is Goda, et al (2018) which examines federal
employees and participation in the Thrift Saving Plan (TSP). In additional to being able to contribute to
the optional TSP, federal employees are also covered by a defined benefit plan and Social Security. This
study reports a participation rate over 90 percent before the adoption of automatic enrollment and a
subsequent small increase in participation after its adoption.



                                                      5
in the SRP at a default contribution of $25 per month (about one percent of the mean salary of

South Dakota public employees). 3 Each K-12 school district was treated as a separate agency

for adopting automatic enrollment. As we shall see, some districts adopted automatic enrollment

into the SRP while others did not. In contrast, all universities governed by The Board of Regents

represented a single agency. Thus, when The Board of Regents chose to adopt the automatic

enrollment policy, all employees in this system were automatically enrolled into the SRP.


      The initial contributions to the SRP are placed in a money market account, for first 90 days

after which time funds are transferred to an age appropriate target date fund. The participant can

allocate these contributions to other investment options anytime during this 90-day window as

well. Once automatically enrolled in the SRP, the participant has the option to increase

contributions up to IRS maximum limits, move current and future contributions to other

investment options, and within the first 90 days of being automatically enrolled, opt out of the

SRP and receive a refund of all contributions. Once this 90-day window has past, future

contributions can be stopped, i.e. the employee can opt out of the SRP; however, the participant

cannot receive a refund of initial contributions unless they are eligible for a one-time, in-service

distribution under IRS rules, are separated from service, or retire.


      III.    Educational Institutions and Employee Characteristics

      This analysis will consider the impact of automatic enrollment by K-12 school districts in

South Dakota and by the university system in the state. There are several major differences in

these two educational sectors in South Dakota. First, all of the public universities in the state are

provisions and the process by which this policy was adopted and introduced.


                                                       6
governed by The Board of Regents and all employees are provided the same benefits. In

contrast, each school districts is an independent employer and is able to set some of its own

employment and compensation rules including whether to adopt automatic enrollment. Second,

as Table 1 shows, employees in the two sectors differ on two important characteristics. Males

are considerably more prevalent in the university system compared to the public school system.

Men represent almost half of the employees at universities but only a quarter of employees in the

schools. In terms of annual pay, university employees average about 60 percent higher earnings

compare to the annual earnings of school employees. Because of these important differences, we

present enrollment data on participants in the SRP separately for the two educational groups. In

this section, we briefly describe the two educational sectors in South Dakota.

                                                [Table 1]

Public School Employees

         We received data on 153 school districts in South Dakota in which employees are

covered by the SDRS. The Department of Education website indicates that there are

approximately 10,000 certified instructional staff in the SD school system. 4 Teachers and other

school personnel are state employees and thus, are covered by the state retirement system SDRS.

Each employee is covered by the defined benefit retirement plan and Social Security. Each

employee may choose to make contributions to a 457 plan (referred to in this paper as the SRP)

that is managed by SDRS through a contract with Nationwide Retirement Solutions, Inc.

Beginning in July 2009, the state authorized each state agency to decide whether it wanted to

adopt automatic enrollment for new hires. Each school district is viewed as a separate

employing agency and was able to decide whether to establish an automatic enrollment policy

for the supplemental retirement plan (SRP). Only 13 of the districts decided to adopt automatic

enrollment for the SRP.

          Each district also has the ability to offer a 403(b) retirement saving plan to its employee.

Public schools in the United States have long offered 403(b) plans to their employees. Across

the country, school districts tend to manage their own 403(b) plans. A characteristic of these

plans is that they usually allow a large number of vendors to participate in the plan. It is likely

that history of 403(b) plans in K-12 schools is one of the reasons that most of the districts did not

adopt automatic enrollment into the state-managed SRP. 5 Unfortunately we do not have

information on the 403 (b) plans offered by all of the school districts nor do we have data on the

proportion of employees contributing the 403(b) plans. 6

University Employees

           Public institutions of higher education in South Dakota are governed by The South

Dakota Board of Regents. The Board determines compensation policies for the six universities

and two special schools that are governed by The Board of Regents. The following institutions

are included in the system: University of South Dakota, South Dakota State University, South

Dakota School of Mines and Technology, Northern State University, Black Hills State

University, Dakota State University, South Dakota School for the Visually Impaired, and South

    See Clark and Hanson (2013) for an overview of 403(b) plans in public schools in all 50 states.
6
    The 403(b) plans are described on the websites of some of the school districts. For example, the Souix
Falls district website describes both state-managed 457 plan and district's 403(b) plan. Souix Falls did
not adopt a policy of automatic enrollment in the 457 plan managed by the SDRS and does not have such
a policy for its own 403(b). The district's 403(b) plan is managed by TSA consulting group and the plan
has 17 vendors who are allowed to offer plans for school employees.

Dakota School for the Deaf; the Regents also set personnel for The Board of Regents Central

Office. The system employs approximately 5,100 employees. Compensation and benefits are

governed, in part, by a collective bargaining agreement between The Board of Regents and the

Council of Higher Education, an affiliate of South Dakota Education Association and the

National Education Association.

          Employees in these institutions are covered by SDRS and Social Security. In addition,

employees have the opportunity to contribute to the SDRS-managed SRP. For the purpose of

considering adopting the automatic enrollment policy, all institutions in the system were

considered a single government agency. The Board chose to institute automatic enrollment in

2009, therefore, after this date all new employees in all of the institutions were automatically

enrolled in the SRP.

          University employees can also contribute to a 403(b) plan that is managed by The Board.

There are also no matching employer contributions to this plan and the plan does not include a

Roth option for post-tax contributions. The following 10 vendors have been approved to offer

tax sheltered annuities through this plan: TIAA, American Funds, AIG, Ameriprise, Waddell and

Reed, New York Life, Fidelity, Vanguard, Horace Mann, and AXA Equitable. Employees can

make contributions to both the 457 plan and the 403(b) up to the maximum allowed by federal

legislation. 7

      IV.     Changes in Participation Rates in Response to the Adoption of
              Automatic Enrollment

    Information on the 457 and 403(b) plans is provided on the website of member institutions. An example
of the information provided by the member institutions is shown in the Appendix for the University of
South Dakota.



                                                     9
      To examine the impact of the introduction of automatic enrollment in the SRP, we obtained

administrative records from SDRS on all employees by public schools and universities in South

Dakota who were hired between 2005 and 2016. Using these data, we are able to determine

enrollment rates for all new hires in the first year of employment and the subsequent

participation rates between the hire date and 2016. The data are reported by fiscal years. In this

section, we report the changes in participation in the SRP before and after 2010 when automatic

enrollment was adopted. The analysis reported separately for K-12 schools and the universities.


Annual Participation Rates with and without Auto Enrollment: Public Schools


      The administrative records allow us to observe the year each employee was hired and

whether the new employee contributed to the SRP in their first year of employment.

Participation is measured by annual contributions at the end of the fiscal year. In Column 1,

Table 2 reports the number of new hires by year and annual hires range between 1,284 and

2,833. Columns 2 and 3 sort new hires into individuals whose school district had adopted auto

enrollment and those districts where auto enrollment was not adopted. Prior to 2010, automatic

enrollment was not allowed so no district auto enrolled any new employees. Column 4 reports

the percent of all new employees enrolled in the SRP by year of employment. The participation

rate in the SRP for educational employees hired between 2005 and 2009 was less than two

percent in each year. 8



8
    Remember that these school employees also had the opportunity to contribute to district-managed
403(b) plans so that the participation rate for contributions to any retirement saving plan will be larger
than the rate for the SRP only. Clark, et al. (2016) reported a participation rate for all North Carolina K-
12 employees of approximately 30 percent with less than half of these participants in the state-managed
401(k) or 457 plans compared to more than half contributing to the district-managed 403(b) plans.


                                                     10
                                                [Table 2]


   The introduction of automatic enrollment into the SRP produced a change in saving

outcomes. After the new law went into effect, participation rates in the SRP for all new hires

jumped from less than two percent to over 12 percent. This increase understates the impact of

the adoption of automatic enrollment by those actually covered by the new policy. As we noted

earlier, only 13 districts adopted auto enrollment so most of the new hires were by districts that

maintained the old opt-in policy. Column 5 indicates the percent of individuals hired after 2009

who were automatically enrolled in the SRP and who remained in the plan during their first year

of employment was over 90 percent. In comparison, Column 6 shows the percent of individuals

who enrolled in the SRP and were not subject to automatic enroll remained less than five percent

in every year. This comparison shows that the districts that adopted auto enrollment had

participation rates of 90 percent higher compared to the districts that did not adopt this policy.


   It is interesting to note that the participation rate of 90 percent with automatic enrollment

observed in South Dakota is very similar to the participation rate found in studies of private

sector firms that do not provide their employees with a defined benefit plan and whose 401(k)

plans offer employer matches. The low rate of opting out of the SRP supports the finding of

earlier studies that inertia plays a substantial role in the effect of automatic enrollment. In

addition, the low opt-out rate by school employees may also be influenced by the relatively low

default contribution rate of only $25 per month or about 1 percent of average salary for school

personnel which raises the question did the new employees even notice the modest reduction in

their take home pay due to the default contribution. The change in participation rates in South

Dakota indicate that even when employees have relatively high replacement rates from a defined




                                                  11
benefit pension plan and Social Security automatic enrollment in a retirement saving plan

produces participation rates of 90 percent.


Are There Lasting Effects of Automatic Enrollment for School Employees?


   In order to determine the long-range impact of automatic enrollment on participation in

retirement saving plans, one needs several years of employment data to see whether participation

rates with automatic enrollment decline over time. Similarly, one needs to determine if

participation rates rise over time without automatic enrollment. If rates decline relative to year

of hire for those automatically enrolled and rise for those without automatic enrollment, then

limiting the analysis of year of hire rates would overstate the positive impact of adopting

automatic enrollment. To examine these issues, we sort the observations by year of employment

and whether the employer adopted automatic enrollment. Next, we calculate the proportion of

individuals by hire year who are contributing to the SRP for each year between year of hire and

2016. Participation rates between hire date and 2016 for those with and without automatic

enrollment are shown in Table 3 by year of hire.


                                                [Table 3]


   The proportion of workers contributing to the SRP among those automatically enrolled

steadily declines with additional years of employment. For those hired in 2010 who were auto

enrolled, the participation rate fell from 95.2 percent in year of hire to 80.9 percent in 2016.

Similarly for those hired in 2012, the year of employment rate was 95.3 percent and this rate

declined to 87.5 percent in 2016. Thus, the proportion of school personnel contributing to the

SRP who were auto enrolled fell noticeably in the first years of employment. In contrast, the




                                                 12
participation rates for those not automatically enrolled tended to rise slightly with additional

years of service. But still the gap between the two groups remains large. The decline in the

proportion of employees contributing to the SRP who were auto enrolled might indicate that

some of these individuals were choosing to return to the 403(b) plans offered by the district.


Annual Participation Rates with and without Auto Enrollment: Universities


   We now present similar data on SRP enrollments for employees in institutions covered by

The Board of Regents. As before, the administrative records allow us to observe the year each

employee was hired and whether the new employee contributed to the SRP in that first year.

Table 4 reports the number of new employees hired each year. The annual number of university

hires range between 475 and 711. The Board of Regents adopted auto enrollment for all

institutions effective August 23, 2009. Thus, no employees were automatically enrolled in years

2005-2009 and then all were auto enrolled in subsequent years. Since our data reflect enrollment

for the fiscal year, new employees hired in 2009 between July 1 and August 22 were not

automatically enrolled while all individuals hired after that date were. Therefore, the data for

fiscal year 2010 include both individuals who were auto enrolled and some that were not. The

annual participation rate in the SRP for university employees hired before 2010 was less than 2.2

percent. With automatic enrollment, the participant rate exceeds 94 percent for persons hired in

every year.


                                               [Table 4]


   During the opt-in period, first year enrollments in the SRP were extremely low with only

around two percent of new hires enrolling in the SRP. In the first years of employment, there




                                                 13
were small annual increases in the proportion of the university employees who contributed to the

SRP. In contrast, the participation rate declines by 3 to 6 percent per year for those who were

auto enrolled. It is interesting to note that participation rates in the SRP with auto enrollment

exceed 90 percent even though these university employees also have the opportunity to

contribute to locally managed 403(b) plans. We are unable to determine whether the increased

contributions to the SRP are net new contributions or they reflect reductions in the contributions

to the educational institutions managed 403(b) plans.


                                                [Table 5]


   V.      Determinants of Participation with and without Auto Enrollment

        Using the administrative data from South Dakota, we examine factors that influence

contributions to the SRP before and after the adoption of auto enrollment. In the following

analysis, we estimate participation rates in the SRP using a single probit model for employees in

K-12 school districts and in the university system. Specifically, we estimate the probability of

new hires making contributions to the SRP in their first year of employment whether they were

automatically enrolled in the SRP or whether the new employee was not automatically enrolled.

An interesting aspect of this analysis is that in the automatic enrollment years, some school

districts adopted automatic enrollment and others did not. Thus, we are able to examine

participation decisions for individuals in different school districts some with and some without

automatic enrollment in the same year. Since all institutions covered by The Board of Regents

adopted auto enrollment at the same time, this step in our analysis can only be done for the K-12

school districts. For institutions that did adopt auto enrollment, we are able to estimate

participation decisions before and after the policy is adopted.



                                                 14
          As with other studies that use administrative data, we have limited information about the

personal characteristics of new hires. The data provided by the SDRS include the age of

employees when first employed (measured in years), whether the employee is a female or male,

the annual salary (measured in thousands of dollars), the specific state agencies that employed

the individual, whether the employee was auto-enrolled in the SRP, and when the employer

adopted auto-enrollment if it ever did. Using these data, we estimate participation decisions of

K-12 and university employees.

          Using the complete sample of all new employees hired over the years 2005-2016, we

estimate the probability that an employee participates in the SRP in the year of hire. The

analysis for employees of K-12 schools and for university employees is done jointly, while

allowing the impact of the different explanatory variables to vary between the two groups. 9 The

model includes the following explanatory variables: age at hire, a dichotomous variable equal to

one if the employee is a male and zero if not, annual salary in first year of employment

(measured in thousands of dollars), a dichotomous variable equal to one if the employee was

auto-enrolled and hired by a school district and zero if not, a dichotomous variable equal to one

if the employer is a school district that adopted auto-enrollment and zero if not, and year of

employment fixed effects. To capture the change that took place mid-year in fiscal year 2010 for

the university system, we introduce two dummies for that one year. The first dummy (2010-) is

equal to one if the individual was hired between July 1, 2009 and August 23, 2009, and equal to

zero otherwise. The second dummy variable (2010+) covers the rest of the fiscal year (August



9
    Explanatory variables are introduced twice, once multiplied by a dichotomous variable equal to one if
the individual is a school employee and zero otherwise, a second time as multiplied by a dichotomous
variable equal to one if the individual is a university employee and zero otherwise.

24, 2009 to June 30, 2010). The marginal effects derived from the probit equation are shown in

Table 6. We discuss the results in various contexts.

                                                  [Table 6]

Participation in SRP in First Year of Employment for School Employees: 2005 to 2016

       Column 1, Table 6 reports the partial effects evaluated at the mean of the sample for the

employees of the public schools. The age effect indicates that each additional 10 years of age

increases the probability of contributing to the SRP by 0.9 percentage points. The probability

that a new male hire will participate is about 1.1 percentage points lower than a corresponding

female hire but this difference is not statistically significant. A $10,000 higher initial salary

increases the probability of participation by 3 percentage points. One should remember that

during first half of the sample period, participation rates were very low so these small percentage

point increases represent substantial percentage increases in the pre-auto enroll period.

       Whether the employee was auto-enrolled into the SRP dramatically increases the

probability of making a contribution to the SRP in the first year of employment. The probability

of participation in the year of employment is 90 percentage points higher for those who were

auto enrolled compared to those who were not. Whether the employer eventually adopts auto-

enrollment also has an important impact, increasing the probability of participation by 6.3

percentage points. This finding suggests that districts where employees had a higher propensity

to contribute to the SRP were more likely to adopt auto enrollment. Holding constant whether the

individual was automatically enrolled in the SRP, the year fixed effects indicate that the overall

participation rate trends up during the years after auto enrollment was adopted.

       An alternative way to interpret the estimates from the probit model is to compute the

predicted probabilities of participating in the SRP for different scenarios. For example, let us


                                                  16
consider the estimates of the probit model and the following stylized new hire by a school

district: a 37 year old female earning $30,000. If this individual was hired in 2006 from a district

who never adopted auto-enrollment, the predicted probability of participating in the SRP is 1.22

percent, increasing to 2.74 percent if hired in 2011 instead. In 2006, if the employer is one who

will eventually adopt auto-enrollment once it becomes available, then the probability is 2.67

percent. Finally, if this individual was hired in 2011 and auto-enrolled then the probability is

96.69 percent.

Participation in SRP in First Year of Employment for University Employees: 2005 to 2016

       Next, we examine the impact of adopting auto enrollment by The Board of Regents so

that all new employees hired by the universities were enrolled in the SRP. Columns 3 and 4 of

Table 6 show the partial effects and corresponding standard errors from the probit model for

participation for newly hired university employees. For these employees, age and gender have no

significant impact, economically or statistically. The impact of salary for university hires is about

half the impact for school hires, a $10,000 higher salary raises the probability of participation by

about 1.5 percentage points.

       Since all new hires by the university system became auto-enrolled after August 23, 2009

we cannot introduce employee and employer auto-enroll dichotomous variables as well as year

fixed effects. This would create perfect multicollinearity. The impact of adopting auto-

enrollment in this case is fully and directly captured by the year fixed effects. Looking at the

results we see that by going from 2009 to 2010+ (the second part of the fiscal year, after the

adoption of auto-enrollment), the probability of participation increases by about 94.6 percentage

points, this being the difference between the two partial effects). This in a sense captures the

impact of a new hire being auto-enrolled and being in a period where new hires can be auto-



                                                 17
enrolled. We note that for university hires the magnitude of the year dummies are much larger

than for new public school hires; it's simply because they now also include the employee and

employer auto-enroll variables.

       Also of interest is the partial effect for the Year dummy 2010-. It's a much larger value

than for the years 2006 to 2009, 56.8 percent compared to 1-2 percent. Yet, it's for a period

where auto-enrollment had not yet been adopted. Looking at the raw numbers, of the 185 new

hires by the university system between July 1, 2009 and August 23, 2009, 103 participated in

SRP. This suggest that during this period new hires were made aware of this upcoming change

and more than half decided to enroll.

Adoption of auto-enrollment policy by school districts

       Finally, we examine the decision by school districts whether or not to adopt the auto-

enrollment into SRP for new hires. For 144 of the school districts we were able to collect

information about the numbers of students, the average salary and the number of instructional

personal (measured as full time equivalent, FTE). The information is for 2016. Descriptive

statistics are reported in Table 7. We see that there are large differences in all these variables

across school districts. Looking at averages over the quintiles, we see a difference of about

$9,000 in average salary comparing the 1st and 5th quintiles. There is a lot of variations in the size

of the school districts, with the difference between the average over the 1st and 5th quintiles equal

to about 3,000 students. For the number of students per instructional FTE, the difference between

the average over the 1st quintile and the 5th quintile is over 7 students per FTE, corresponding to

an almost doubling of the ratio.

                                              [Table 7]




                                                  18
       We investigate if these school districts characteristics can be associated to their decision

to adopt or not auto-enrollment in the SRP. In Table 8, we present results from a probit model

where the dependent variable is a dichotomous variable equal to one if the school district has

adopted auto-enrollment by the end of our sample, otherwise it is zero. We use as explanatory

variables dichotomous variables for the quintiles of the three variables in Table 7 (average

salary, number of students, students per instructional FTE). We include quintile dummies instead

of the variables themselves and their squares to better be able to capture nonlinearities in the

impact of these variables on the adoption of auto-enrollment by the school districts. Despite

allowing for a lot of flexibility, our results suggest that nothing clearly explains why a school

district would adopt auto-enrollment. Our estimates indicate for example that school districts in

the top three quintiles of average salary are about 13 percentage points less likely to adopt auto-

enrollment than those in the first two quintiles. But these estimates have very large standard

errors so we can't rule out that they are zero. The results are similar for the number of students.

For the number of students per instructional FTE, only school districts in the 5th quintile

statistically stand out, being about 47 percentage points more likely to adopt auto-enrollment

than those in the first quintile. But taken jointly, we cannot reject a null hypothesis that all these

partial effects are equal to zero. The value of the LR test for this hypothesis is 7.60 with a p-

value equal to 0.81 (the asymptotic distribution is chi-square with 12 degrees of freedom).

                                              [Table 8]

   VI.     Conclusions

   There is a considerable literature indicating the effectiveness of automatic enrollment

policies in increasing participation in retirement saving plans. Virtually all of these studies

examine private sector firms where a 401(k) plan is the only retirement plan offered by the



                                                  19
employer. We are not aware of any previous study examining the impact of introducing

automatic enrollment on the participation rates of K-12 and university personnel in a

supplemental retirement saving plan.

   In general, all public full-time employees are covered by a mandatory pension, usually a

defined benefit plan. As a result, career public employees that are also covered by Social

Security are likely to have a life annuity equal to 70-80 percent of their final salary. While

government employers offer their employees the opportunity to contribute to a retirement saving

plan, employees may believe that they have less of a need for additional retirement saving. In

addition, the plans offered by government employers rarely have matching employer

contributions so there is less of an incentive for employees to contribute to these plans.

   As a result, participation rates in retirement saving plans in the public sector tend to be much

lower than they are for private sector firms. In our example, only about 2 percent of newly hired

K-12 and university employees in South Dakota enrolled in the 457 plan offered to state and

local employees prior to 2010. The objective of this study is to determine whether K-12 and

university employees in South Dakota responded to the introduction of an automatic enrollment

policy at the same level as private sector employees.

   The key finding of this analysis is that participation rates in the retirement saving plan by

university personnel go from less than 2 percent to 90 percent after the introduction of automatic

enrollment. The richness of the data provided by the SDRS allows us to explore several

interesting issues. A unique component of the data is that South Dakota allowed each

government agency to adopt automatic enrollment in 2010 but the agencies were not required to

adopt this policy. Each school district made its own decision on whether to adopt auto enrollment

while the Board of Regents made the decision for all of its institutions. As a result of these



                                                 20
decisions by educational institution, we can compare the change in participation over time for the

same agencies before and after the introduction of auto-enrollment and also to compare

employees hired in agencies with and without auto-enrollment in the same year. All of the

comparisons indicate that the introduction of automatic enrollment yield increases in

participation rates of newly hired K-12 and university employees of over 80 percent.

   Another difference in the automatic enrollment policy in South Dakota is that relatively low

default contribution rate of $25 per month, or approximately one percent of the average salary of

a new employee. This low default contribution may partially explain the large response to the

auto-enrollment policy.

   This study shows that K-12 and university employees who are covered by a defined benefit

plan and Social Security tend not to contribute to a traditional opt-in retirement saving plan;

however, the adoption of automatic enrollment for new employees results in a dramatic increase

in the proportion of employees who participate in the plan. Across country, public employers are

reducing the generosity of their retirement plans. As a result, the findings from this study have

important policy implications and indicate that K-12 and universities should consider the

adoption of automatic enrollment policies to encourage participation in the supplement saving

plans to enhance the retirement security of public employees.

computed as the number of individuals hired in a given fiscal year, with positive earnings in the
designated year, and who made a positive contributions divided by the number of individuals
who were hired in this fiscal year and who had positive annual earnings in their first year.

This table reports the participation rate in the SRP in the first year of employment for different
year of hire cohorts, considering only university employees. The participation rate is computed
as the number of individuals hired in a given fiscal year, with positive earnings in the designated
year, and who made a positive contribution divided by the number of individuals who were hired
in this fiscal year and who had positive annual earnings in their first year.

Marginal effects are calculated at the mean values based on probit estimates of participation.
Statistical significance: 10% (*), 5% (**) and 1% (***). The variables Year dummy 2010- and
Year dummy 2010+ are dichotomous variables equal to 1 if the observation is during the period
July 1, 2009-August 22, 2009 or August 23, 200-June 30, 2010 respectively. The LR test (p-
value) for the hypothesis that all interaction terms are zero is 99.14 (0.000). The Wald test (p-
value) for the hypothesis that the interaction terms cancel out the regressors in the auto-enroll era
is 102.21 (0.000). The number of observations is 22550. The fraction of individuals who
participate in the SRP is 10.73%. The standard errors of the partial effects are calculated with the
Delta method. The variable I2010 represents a dummy variable equal to one if the observation is in
year 2010 or later, otherwise it's equal to zero.

This table reports partial effects evaluated at the mean for a probit model where the dependent
variable is the decision of a school district to adopt auto-enrollment. The explanatory variables
are dichotomous variables corresponding to quintiles of average salary, number of students and
number of students per instructional FTE. The number of observations is 144 and 11 school
districts adopted auto-enrollment. We left out the 1st quintile so the interpretation of the partial
effects are deviations from the 1st quintile. The value of the Likelihood ratio test for the null
hypothesis that all parameters are equal to zero except for the intercept is equal to 7.60 with a
corresponding p-value equal to 0.81. Statistical significance: 10% (*), 5% (**) and 1% (***).

Statement on University of South Dakota website concerning the SRP managed by SDRS.

https://www.usd.edu/-/media/files/human-resources/retirementtranscript.ashx?la=en

"The Supplemental Retirement Plan is another retirement option that you are automatically

enrolled in. You are initially set up to have a $25 deduction from your paycheck, and that

deduction will be invested in conservative investment options selected by the SD Investment

Council. This contribution is not matched by USD. The deduction amount and the investment

option for this plan can be changed at any time. You also have the option to Opt-Out within 90

days and receive a refund of those contributions. However, if you do make any changes during

the opt-out period, you void your right to opt-out and will not receive a refund. You will need to

contact Supplemental Retirement at the number listed to request the Opt-Out form or to make

changes to your contribution... Along with the Supplemental Retirement contribution, you also

have the option to contribute on a Post-Tax basis to a Roth (457B) plan through Supplemental

Retirement. Subject to restrictions, the distribution of earnings may be taken out tax-free."



Statement on University of South Dakota website concerning the Tax Sheltered Annuities

offered by the Board of Regents.

Another option for retirement saving "is a Tax Sheltered Annuity or 403B plan. As an eligible

employee, you are able to participate in the 403B Plan through Retirement Manager. There are

different plan vendors including Fidelity, New York Life, TIAA CREF, and Vanguard. The 403b

contributions are not matched by USD. You may set up your 403b at any time through the

Retirement Manager."
