Abstract

Bank failures are generally liquidity as well as solvency events. Whether it is households
running on banks or banks running on banks, defunding episodes are full of drama. This
theater has, arguably, lured economists into placing liquidity at the epicenter of financial
collapse. But loss of liquidity describes how banks fail. Bad news about banks explains why
they fail. This paper models banking crises as triggered by news that the degree (share) of
banking malfeasance is likely to be particularly high. The malfeasance share follows a state-
dependent Markov process. When this period’s share is high, agents rationally raise their
probability that next period’s share will be high as well. Whether or not this proves true,
agents invest less in banks, reducing intermediation and output. Deposit insurance prevents
such defunding and stabilizes the economy. But it sustains bad banking, lowering welfare.
Private monitoring helps, but is no panacea. It partially limits banking malfeasance. But
it does so inefficiently as households needlessly replicate each others’ costly information
acquisition. Moreover, if private audits become public, private monitoring breaks down
due to free-riding. Government real-time disclosure of banking malfeasant mitigates, if not
eliminates, this public goods problem leading to potentially large gains in both non-stolen
output and welfare.

 1   1. Introduction

 2   Banks (our name for financial institutions, broadly defined) have traditionally been modeled
 3   as honest entities satisfying liquidity needs via issuance of demand deposits and other short-
 4   term liabilities (Gorton and Pennacchi (1990)). Banking crises have been viewed as runs
 5   motivated by the fear that others will appropriate one’s money (Diamond and Dybvig
 6   (1983) and Goldstein and Pauzner (2005)). But deposit insurance has largely eliminated
 7   concern about transaction balances. Indeed, the financial crisis of 2007-2008 saw essentially
 8   no traditional commercial bank runs (Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (2011)) by non-
 9   institutional investors.1 Instead, as Covitz et al. (2013) and others document, banks stopped
10   funding one another based on perceptions, some true, some false, that financial institutions
11   had gone bad. The serial collapse of large, highly opaque banks raised concern about the
12   defunding of surviving, but equally opaque, banks. Attempts to pay creditors led to fire sales
13   of “troubled” assets. This fed the defunding panic, producing more implicit and explicit
14   failures. Overnight, bank secret-keeping, which left potential refunders in the dark about
15   each-other’s true solvency, went from a sign of collective trust to one of financial distress, if
16   not financial fraud.
17          Bankruptcies, financial or not, are typically liquidity as well as solvency events.2 The
18   29 global financial institutions that failed, either explicitly or implicitly, during the Great
19   Recession, all lost or were about to lose external funding in the run up to their demises. The
20   drama of financial firms running short of cash – J.P. Morgan’s dramatic 2007 rescue of Wall
21   Street, the serial collapse of 9,000 commercial-banks in the Great Depression, California’s
22   shocking seizure of Executive Life, the panicked resolution of Long Term Capital Manage-
23   ment, the Fed’s emergency weekend meetings that “saved” Bear Sterns and let Lehman
24   Brothers collapse, the remarkable nationalizations of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and AIG,
25   the last minute passage of the Trouble Asset Relief Program, the urgent IMF-ECB bailout
26   of Cypriot banks, etc. – naturally focuses attention on banks’ death throes. Yet, how
27   banks fail does not tell us why banks fail. Short of pure coordination failure (switching

          Illiquidity can, if sufficiently severe, trigger insolvency.

28   spontaneously to a bad equilibrium), bank failures are triggered by bad news. Historically,
29   this has been bad news about bad banking, where “bad” includes fraudulent, irresponsible,
30   negligent, and incompetent behavior.
31         Actual or suspected malfeasance has instigated many, perhaps most financial crises. In
32   1720, insider trading and fraudulent misrepresentation led to collapses of both the South Sea
33   and Mississippi bubbles. The attempted cornering of the U.S. bond market kindled the Panic
34   of 1792. The sale of investments in the imaginary Latin American country of Poyais led to
35   the Panic of 1825. “Wildcat banking” helped produce the Panic of 1837. The embezzlement
36   of assets from the Ohio Life and Trust Co. instigated the Railroad Crisis of 1857 (Gibbons
37   (1907)). Jay Gould and James Fisk’s cornering of the gold market precipitated the 1869
38   Gold Panic. Cooke and Company’s failure to disclose losses on Northern Pacific Railroad
39   stock sparked the Panic of 1873. A failed cornering of United Cooper’s stocks instigated the
40   Panic of 1907. The Hatry Group’s use of fraudulent collateral to buy United Steel, the sale
41   of Florida swamp land, the Match King Hoax, the Samuel Insull fraud and the disclosure
42   of other swindles ushered in the Great Depression.3 Insider trading and stock manipulation
43   brought down Drexel Burnham Lambert, precipitating the largest insurance failure in U.S.
44   history. And revelation of liar loans, no-doc loans, and NINJA loans laid the groundwork
45   for the demise of major U.S. and foreign financial firms and the Great Recession.4
46         This paper focuses on why banks fail. The reason considered is malfeasance. We treat
47   intermediation, not liquidity provision via maturity transformation, as the raison d’être
48   for banks, and the loss of intermediation services, not the loss of liquidity or maturity
49   transformation, as the economic essence of a financial crisis. Our demurral on liquidity
50   and maturity transformation seems justified by theory and fact. As shown by Jacklin
51   (1983, 1986, 1989) and Jacklin and Bhattacharya (1988), bank’s heralded role as maturity
52   transformers can be either fully or largely replicated by financial markets alone.5 But unlike
53   banks, when financial markets transform maturity, they do so without risk of financial panic,

         We include mutual funds, which Jacklin calls “equity deposits”, as a financial-market instrument.

54   which destroys the very liquidity banks are said to provide.6 There is also scant evidence
55   that banks are e↵ective in transforming maturities.
56          Our framework is simple – a two-period OLG model with two sectors – farming and
57   banking. Both sectors produce an identical good, corn. Farming is small scale and done by
58   sole proprietors. The banking sector gathers resources from multiple investors and engages
59   in large-scale and more efficient farming. Production in farming is certain. Production in
60   banking is uncertain due to banker malfeasance. Specifically, each period every bank has
61   an identical but random share of dishonest, negligent or incompetent bankers, labeled bad
62   bankers, in their employ. These bankers steal or lose all output arising from investments
63   placed with them.7 Consequently, if 20 percent of bankers are bad, the banking industry
64   will produce 20 percent less output. An equivalent interpretation of our model is that a
65   share of banks is fully malfeasant. I.e. these bank steal or lose all output from investments
66   and arise in the same proportion as our posited share of bad bankers. In what follows, we
67   reference “the share of bad bankers.” But one can substitute these words, “the share of
68   bank output lost due to bad banks.”
69          The share of bad bankers obeys a state-dependent Markov process. On average, the share
70   is low enough and banking is productive enough for banking to generate a higher expected
71   return than farming and, thereby, attract considerable investment. But when a larger than
72   expected number of bad bankers surfaces, the projected future share of bad bankers rises.
73   This causes investors to shift out of banking, potentially abruptly, until sufficient time has
74   passed to lower the expected share of malfeasant bankers. This process produces not just
75   periodic and, potentially, extended banking crises, but also a highly inefficient economy.
76          Introducing deposit insurance eliminates one problem and introduces another. It ends
77   banking crises but at the price of keeping bad bankers (equivalently, bad banks) in business.
78   This moral hazard is raised in multiple studies including Gertler et al. (2012); Demirgüç-
79   Kunt and Detragiache (1997, 1999, 2002); Calomiris and Haber (2014) and Calomiris et al.

        6
          Ironically, banks are heralded for providing liquidity, yet have, historically, precipitated its loss precisely
     at times when it is of most value.
        7
          There are lots of legal ways to “steal,” including charging hidden fees, churning portfolios to generate
     higher fees, cream-skimming the purchase of assets, buying assets at above-market price from reciprocating
     bankers, and taking on excessive risk.


                                                              4
 80   (2016). The result is higher total output, but more stolen output. Since the government
 81   levies taxes to fund its insurance of purloined or lost output, the insurance does nothing to
 82   reduce bad-banker risk. Nor does it insure anything real. It simply induces households to
 83   invest with banks regardless of the risk. Like a compensated tax, deposit insurance distorts
 84   behavior, producing an excess burden.8
 85          Monitoring banking practices is another option. But information, once released, becomes
 86   a public good. Since households have no incentive to keep the results of their monitoring
 87   private, they will likely share what they know. In this case, each household will free-ride
 88   on the monitoring of others. This reduces, if not eliminates, monitoring. The first-best
 89   policy – disclosure – addresses the opacity problem directly by shutting down malfeasant
 90   bankers’ modus vivendi, namely operating in the dark. Turning on the lights requires
 91   government provision of the missing public good, namely pubic revelation, either in full
 92   or in part (depending on cost), of the malfeasance. This weeds out bad banking, raising
 93   non-stolen output and welfare. The practical counterpart of this policy prescription is real-
 94   time, government disclosure and verification of all bank assets and liabilities to ensure that
 95   the net capital invested in banks is actually being used to produce output that’s paid to
 96   investors and workers.9


 97   2. Literature Review

 98   The seminal Bryant (1980) and Diamond and Dybvig (1983) articles modeled bank deposits
 99   as insurance against unexpected liquidity needs and bank runs as a switch from a good to a
100   bad equilibrium. These papers sparked a major literature connecting banking to liquidity.
101   Examples include Jacklin (1983), Jacklin and Bhattacharya (1988), Holmström and Tirole
102   (1998), Rochet and Vives (2004), Goldstein and Pauzner (2005), He and Xiong (2012) and
103   Acharya et al. (2011).
104          Liquidity is a key element of the financial system. But is it really at the heart of banking?

         8
           In our model, bad bankers extract resources from the economy, which cannot be reclaimed by the
      government. Their theft represents aggregate risk against which the government cannot insure. Hence,
      insurance payments made to households are exactly o↵set by taxes to cover those payments.
         9
           As noted by Kotliko↵ (2010), this work can be performed by private firms working exclusively for the
      government.


                                                         5
105   And is maturity transformation as important as its prevalence in the literature suggests?
106   The Bryant and Diamond-Dybvig liquidity-insurance/maturity-transformation models pre-
107   dict investment-like returns on demand and other short-term deposits. Yet real returns on
108   transaction accounts have historically been very small, if not negative. Moreover, mod-
109   ern economies are replete with health, accident, auto, homeowners, malpractice, longevity,
110   property and casualty, disability, long-term care insurance, credit cards, and equity lines of
111   credit – all of which provide liquidity in times of personal economic crisis. Then there are
112   financial markets, whose securities can be sold as needed to provide liquidity and transform
113   maturities. Indeed, Jacklin (1989) argues that equity markets can provide as much liquidity
114   insurance as bank deposits and transform maturities just as well. Moreover, they can do so
115   with no danger of bank runs or any other type of financial crisis.10
116          Still, liquidity risk continues to stimulate research. Dang et al. (2017) add a new wrinkle
117   to Diamond and Dybvig (1983), namely the staggered arrival of participants to the liquidity
118   insurance market. They show that banking opacity permits late arrivals to participate in the
119   market since opacity leaves them with no more information than early arrivals. The work
120   by Dang et al. (2017) echoes Hirshleifer (1971), who points out that disclosure is detrimen-
121   tal to those holding claims on overvalued assets. Other researchers, including Holmström
122   and Tirole (1998), Andolfatto (2010), Gorton (2009) and Gorton and Ordonez (2014) warn
123   that public audits, while providing a public good, namely public information, comes at the
124   price of market crashes. Whether policymakers are deliberately limiting audits to protect
125   malfeasant banks is an open question. Either way, today’s limited, quasi-voluntary disclo-
126   sure is of limited value. As Johnson and Kwak (2010) state, “Lehman Brothers ... was
127   more than adequately capitalized on paper, with Tier 1 capital of 11.6 percent, shortly
128   before it went bankrupt in September 2008. Thanks to the literally voluminous report by
129   the Lehman bankruptcy examiner, we now know this was in part due to aggressive and
130   misleading accounting.”

        10
          Jacklin’s proviso is that information between investors and banks not be asymmetric in the context of
      aggregate risk. We suggest that the asymmetry of information can be eliminated, either fully or largely in
      the presence or absence of aggregate risk, by real-time government-orchestrated or supervised verification
      and disclosure of bank assets and liabilities.




                                                          6
131         Like Stiglitz and Weiss (1981); Diamond (1984); Brealey et al. (1977), we treat the
132   problems incumbent in providing intermediation as arising from asymmetric information –
133   bad bankers know they are bad, household investors do not. However, those studies stress
134   di↵erential knowledge between bankers and borrowers whereas our focus is on di↵erential
135   knowledge between bankers and savers (equivalently, investors). In the former studies, the
136   unobservable was the trustworthiness of borrowers. In our study, the unobservable is the
137   trustworthiness of bankers.
138         Gertler and Karadi (2011) and Gertler and Kiyotaki (2010) also model financial malfea-
139   sance. However, bankers do not steal or otherwise misappropriate output in equilibrium.
140   Borrowing thresholds and the exposure of equity holders to losses keep such behavior from
141   happening. In our model, bad bankers expropriate or lose output in equilibrium unless they
142   are disclosed ex-ante. Disclosure is a natural remedy in our model, but faces real-world
143   objection from a surprising source, namely regulators. Regulators worry that too much
144   disclosure in the midst of a financial meltdown can fuel asset fire sales.11 But this concern
145   is about ex-post disclosure. Our focus is on ex-ante disclosure, i.e., preventing malfeasance
146   in advance via, in part, initial and ongoing, real-time asset verification.
147         Our paper extends Chamley et al. (2012), which sets aside the liquidity-insurance/maturity-
148   transformation rationale for banking. Instead it justifies banks based on their principal
149   economic role – financial intermediation. And it models bank runs as arising from actual
150   or perceived malfeasance in the provision of intermediation services. The Chamley et al.
151   (2012) model has a quite di↵erent structure and is static. Ours is dynamic. We consider how
152   current malfeasance undermines future financial intermediation, productivity and welfare
153   since current malfeasance generates lingering doubts about the trustworthiness of bankers.
154   The banking “runs” considered here are simply decisions to invest less, at least in the short
155   run, in banks. The associated contraction of the banking sector can be labeled a liquidity
156   crisis. But the crisis is triggered by news of a larger than expected share of bad bankers,
157   not the sudden need for money by of a large segment of the public.
158         Banks have generally been modeled as honest institutions, which, in their e↵orts to pro-

159   vide a full, if risky, return to investors, are occasionally stymied by panicked or misinformed
160   creditors. Moreover, bad news about banks is about poor investment returns, not the theft,
161   scams, swindles, Ponzi schemes, excess fees, etc., recorded in, for example, the Security and
162   Exchange Commission’s Division of Enforcement’s annual reports. The SEC’s enforcement
163   actions now total over two per week.12 Of course, the SEC only reports frauds the agency
164   detects.13 It is impossible to say how much financial fraud goes undetected. Moreover,
165   there are other federal and state government agencies and branches, such as Massachusetts’
166   Financial Investigations Division, which investigate and prosecute financial crime, but do
167   not provide annual listings of their enforcement actions. And explicit fraud, such as the
168   Mado↵ or the Stanford Ponzi schemes, is not the only type of fraud at play. Much financial
169   fraud takes subtle forms that is rarely viewed, even by economists, as such. An example is a
170   bank that legally operates based on proprietary information to the detriment of the public.
171   Townsend (1979) models this behavior, albeit without the pejorative connotation. He posits
172   informed agents that force uninformed agents to enter a debt contract to limit the extent
173   to which they must pay to investigate cheating. He applies this to borrowers’ incentives to
174   renege on loans but it could equally be applied to banks’ incentives to cheat investors.
175          The obvious policy solution is exposing malfeasant bankers and banking. Such disclosure,
176   as proposed by Kotliko↵ (2010) and to a lesser extent by Pagano and Volpin (2012) and
177   Hanson and Sunderam (2013), would go far beyond current practices. It would largely entail
178   real-time verification of bank assets. Take, for example, mortgage verification. Verifying
179   a mortgage application requires determining the employment status, earnings, outstanding
180   debts, and credit record of the mortgagee and appraising the value of the house being
181   purchased. Now, as before the Great Recession, U.S. mortgage verification is in the hands
182   of private lenders, such as the former Country Wide Financial, a company heavily fined for
183   originating and selling fraudulent mortgages.14 But such verification could readily be done
184   by the government or private companies working solely for the government. Indeed, thanks

           A separate metric for financial fraud is provided by www.ponzitracker.com, which suggests the dis-
      covery of one new Ponzi scheme per week in recent years.

185   to its tax records, the government can better verify income on mortgage applications than
186   the private sector. Had such government mortgage verification been in place prior to 2007,
187   there would, arguably, have been few, if any, liar, no-doc, and NINJA loans – all of which
188   appear to have produced a major rise in the perceived and actual share of bad banks.

      Table 1 reports our calibration. The time-preference factor,                             , is set to 0.5 and capital’s
      share, ✓, is set to 0.3. Our assumed mean malfeasance shares are m̄H = .50 and m̄L = .22.
      The two assumed TFP levels are Zf = 10 and Zb = 16. In combination, these parameters
      satisfy


                                         (1         m̄H )Zb < Zf < (1            m̄L )Zb .


      calibrate the model such that ↵s,t 2 (0, 1).




                                                               12
235   This restriction ensures interior solutions to the share of assets invested in banks. We allow
236   the shock, ✏t+1 , to raise or lower the malfeasance share by .1, i.e., {a, b} = { 0.1, 0.1}.
237   Finally, we set the probabilities of a high mean malfeasance share at t + 1 to be 0.6 when
238   the mean malfeasance share is high at time t and 0.4 when the mean malfeasance share is
239   low at time t. I.e., qH = .6 and qL = .4.


240   5. Base Model Results

241   The model’s average values in its stochastic steady state are reported in table 2. Table 3 and
242   table 4 report averages for low and high mean malfeasance states, respectively. The values
243   in these tables are based on a 10,020-period transition. We simulated our model for 10, 020
244   periods, but consider only data after the first 20 periods in tables 2 to 4. This removes the
245   e↵ect of initial conditions. Assets at t = 0 in this simulation were set at the mean level of
246   assets arising in periods 21 through 10,020. m̄0 = m̄L . We iterated to ensure that mean
247   assets used for A0 equal mean assets over the 10,000 periods since the path of assets depends
248   on A0 . In simulating alternative banking policies as well as private monitoring over 10,020
249   periods, we use the same period-by-period draws of mean malfeasance and ✏t .
250      Given our calibration, banking malfeasance has a major economic cost. Across all states,
251   21.8 percent of output is stolen. In low mean malfeasance states, 17.2 percent is stolen. In
252   high mean malfeasance states, 27.2 percent is stolen. Moreover, average non-stolen output
253   when mean malfeasance is high is 24.7 percent lower than when mean malfeasance is low.
254   Since wages are proportional to output and consumption when young is proportion to wages,
255   both variables are also, on average, 24.7 percent lower in high compared to low states.
256   Consumption when old is only 15.5 percent lower across the two types of states. The reason
257   is that consumption when old includes not just the income on assets, but the principal as
258   well. And the principal is not impacted by banker malfeasance.
259      Agents respond to bad times in banking by moving their assets into farming. When
260   malfeasance is high, only 28 percent of assets are allocated to banking. When low, the
261   figure is 86 percent. We refer here to the value of ↵, which determines capital’s allocation
262   in the subsequent period. The share of capital in the high state is larger – 54.9 percent,
263   while the share in the low state is smaller – 67.3 percent than suggested by these values

                                                   13
264   for ↵. This reflects the fact that the high (low) state emerges, in part, from states that are
265   low (high) in the prior period. But when agents see higher prospects for bad (good) times,
266   they take cover (leave their shelter) by setting their values of ↵ appropriately. The fact that
267   agents cannot tell for sure what is coming when it comes to the state of mean malfeasance
268   means that capital is perpetually mis-allocated. This is another economic cost arising from
269   bad bankers in addition to their direct theft of output and their general negative influence
270   on investment in banking. The misallocation of capital is partially o↵set by the reallocation
271   of labor. On average, banking accounts for 56 percent of total employment. In periods of
272   high mean malfeasance, this figure is 38 percent. It is 74 percent when there is low mean
273   malfeasance.
274         The average annualized return to investing in banking is 2.04 percent compared with
275   2.01 percent in farming.16 Although their mean returns are similar, as the table’s standard
276   deviation of returns shows, investing in banking is far riskier than investing in farming. This
277   explains why farming always attracts a goodly share of investment.

279   the time-t+1 malfeasance state assuming At equals its average value. The dotted red line
280   shows returns, for di↵erent values of ✏t+1 , if the malfeasance state at t + 1 is high. The solid
281   black line shows returns, for di↵erent values of ✏t+1 , if the malfeasance state at t + 1 is low.
282   The top panels shows annualized returns if the malfeasance state is high at time t. The
283   bottom panels shows returns if the malfeasance state is low at time t.
284         The right-hand side panels show that higher malfeasance, whether caused by a) moving
285   to or staying in a high malfeasance state at t + 1 or b) a high draw on ✏t+1 , implies lower
286   returns to banking at t + 1; i.e., the dotted red curves lie below the solid black curves and
287   both slope downward.
288         The left-hand side panels show the opposite in the case of the returns to farming. This
289   reflects a greater allocation of labor to farming the greater the share of malfeasance in
290   banking. More labor in farming means a higher marginal product of capital and, thus, a
291   higher return. This e↵ect of labor moving into farming is stronger the smaller the degree of

       16
            In forming annualized returns, we assume each period corresponds to 30 years.

292   malfeasance at time t — the case when relatively little capital will be invested in farming
293   in t + 1. This explains the larger gap between the red and black curves in the bottom left
294   panel than in the top left panel. Figure 2 plots the distribution of realized returns in period
295   t + 1 simulated in the 10,000-periods referenced above. This figure, while organized like
296   Figure 1, incorporates changes in At from from period to period. The panels on the right
297   consider bank returns. Those on the left consider farm returns. The top (bottom) panels
298   consider returns at t + 1 when the malfeasance state is high (low) in period t. Finally, the
299   red (black) histogram references high (low) malfeasant states arising at time t + 1. The
300   vertical bar shows mean returns in each time t + 1 state.
301      As expected, bank (farm) returns are lower (higher) at t + 1 when the t + 1 malfeasant
302   state is high (low). The position of the histograms reflects di↵erent allocations, at time
303   t, in capital between the two sectors. The variance in the histograms reflects the impact
304   of movements of labor across sectors on the return to capital in the two sectors. The
305   impact on a sector’s return from employing more labor is greater the smaller the initial
306   allocation of capital to that sector. Figure 3 shows histograms of non-stolen output, assets,
307   annualized farm and banking returns. The histograms’ results are unconditional, i.e., they
308   include both high and low malfeasance states in the prior period which explains why they
309   are multi-modal. They are also quite dispersed suggesting that banking malfeasance can
310   produce peaks and troughs in non-stolen output, wages, and assets that are very far apart.
311      As expected, a switch in the mean malfeasance state from one period to the next produces
312   much greater changes in macro conditions than no switch. Figure 4 records the transition
313   beginning with high average malfeasance, switching to low average malfeasance in period 3,
314   and then switching back to and remaining at high average malfeasance in periods 4 through
315   10. Figure 5 illustrates the opposite – i.e., a temporary switch from low to high and then back
316   to low average malfeasance. The path of the additional shock to the malfeasance share, ✏t , is
317   kept at 0 in both transitions. Consider fig. 4. In period 3, when mean banking malfeasance
318   declines, more labor is allocated to banking and there is an increase in non-stolen output.
319   But since the shock hits after capital has been allocated, there is no immediate impact
320   on the capital stock. There is a major impact in period 4 reflecting agents’ decisions to
321   invest more in banking given its higher expected return. Given that high mean malfeasance

                                                    15
322   reoccurs in period 4, this investment decision is an ex-post mistake. But once the capital
323   is allocated, it cannot be reallocated. The ex-post excessive investment in banking draws
324   additional labor into banking. Hence, there is a mis-allocation, again, on an ex-post basis,
325   of labor as well as capital.
326      Notwithstanding the additional capital and labor allocated to banking, non-stolen output
327   is smaller in period 4 than in, for example, period 2. The fact that the economy is so
328   di↵erent in period 4 from, for example, period 2 indicates the importance of beliefs about
329   mean malfeasance – whether those beliefs are correct or, as in this case, incorrect. Indeed,
330   as a comparison of the change in Yt between periods 2 and 3, on the one hand, and period
331   3 and 4, on the other, shows, the change in beliefs about the malfeasance shock produces
332   larger output fluctuations than does the shock itself. Another interesting point about the
333   two impulse-response transitions is that one is not the obverse of the other. Consider, for
334   example, the impact on wages. In fig. 4, wages rise above their initial value and then fall
335   below it following the temporary reduction in mean malfeasance. In contrast, in fig. 5
336   wages fall and gradually return to their period-2 value following a temporary rise in mean
337   malfeasance.
338      Figure 6 records a third controlled experiment, this one with a prolonged improvement
339   in mean malfeasance. Like the prior two, ✏t is set to zero. The economy starts with high
340   mean malfeasance, followed by low mean malfeasance for 6 periods, followed by high mean
341   malfeasance for 2 periods. As a comparison with fig. 5 shows, the economy’s path is highly
342   sensitive to the exact sequence of mean malfeasance shocks. This sensitivity, as we’ve
343   seen, reflects immediate impacts, but, more importantly, the formation of beliefs about the
344   economy’s future.
345      Adding ✏t shocks to the mean malfeasance share, we arrive at our baseline transition,
346   fig. 7. The path of these added shocks for the first 10 periods is reported in table 5. We
347   use the same path of shocks to mean malfeasance and ✏t in our comparisons below of the
348   baseline economy with the baseline economy augmented to include alternative government
349   banking policies or private monitoring.

353   6. Deposit Insurance

354   Deposit insurance insulates savers from losses due to bad bankers, leading to exclusive
355   investment in banking. If the mean share turns out to be low, the insurance succeeds in
356   generating more non-stolen output than would otherwise arise if savers shied away from
357   banks.17 But if the mean malfeasance share turns out to be high, savers are actually worse
358   o↵ than without deposit insurance. Yes, they are compensated for their loses, but they
359   have to pay taxes to cover the compensation. In short, since the share of malfeasance is
360   an aggregate risk, deposit insurance provides no real insurance in the aggregate. Instead,
361   it simply induces savers to invest exclusively in banking even in times when its highly
362   risky from a macro prospective. Getting savers to over invest in banking when they should
363   engenders, of course, an excess burden.
364          Under deposit insurance, households receive

368   With deposit insurance, we have,

369   Figure 8 shows the path of the economy with deposit insurance using the same path of

        17
          This may explain why deposit insurance is often introduced during crises. Another explanation is that
      voters do not internalize the need to pay taxes to cover insurance claims.

370   shocks as the baseline transition in fig. 6. Although total output is higher, non-stolen
371   output and consumption is lower in bad states. Table 6 compares deposit insurance to
372   the baseline. All assets are, as indicated, now allocated to banking in all periods. When
373   the share of bad bankers is low, non-stolen output, wages and consumption are higher.
374   But when the share is high, wages, consumption and saving are lower than would be true
375   absent deposit insurance.18 Thus, increased allocation to banking due to deposit insurance
376   increases the volatility of consumption and non-stolen assets. This accords with findings of
377   Demirgüç-Kunt and Detragiache (1997, 1999, 2002).
             We next calculate the factor, , needed to compensate both the old and the young, in all
      states, to make their expected utility in the baseline, denoted EUs,t , equal to their expected
                                                 0
      utility under deposit insurance, denoted EUs,t ,

      EUs,t    = log cy,t + (1       )               {qs,t log co,t+1 (m̄H , ✏t+1 ) + (1   qs,t ) log co,t+1 (m̄L , ✏t+1 )}               d✏t+1 ,
                                             a                                                                                b       a

378   Hence       = exp(EUs,t      EUs,t ). Expected lifetime utility in the model’s stochastic steady
379   state is measured by average realized lifetime utility over 10,000 successive generations born
380   after the 20th period of the transition. For deposit insurance, the value of                       is 1.041 implying
381   households must be compensated with 4.1 percent more consumption in all states to make
382   them as well o↵ as under the baseline case. Stated di↵erently, the excess burden of deposit
383   insurance is a sizable 4.1 percent of consumption.


384   7. Monitoring Banks

385   7.1. Private Monitoring

386   As the behavior of rating companies leading up to the 2008 crisis showed, bank-funded
387   monitoring su↵ers from the “ratings shopping” examined in Skreta and Veldkamp (2009);

        18
           With all output being produced in the banking sector, more output is lost when the share of bad bankers
      is high.


                                                                    18
388   Sangiorgi et al. (2009) and Bolton et al. (2012). Even if we assume ratings are unbiased,
389   they may be too imprecise to help (Goel and Thakor (2015); Doherty et al. (2009)).19
390   As an alternative, we consider monitoring financed by investors, that is, by households.
391   Specifically, we assume young agents can purchase a report that indicates, with probability
392   p, the realization of ✏t+1 .20 With probability (1           p) no information is gained. In this case,
393   agents make uninformed investment choices.
394          Let nt be the percentage of wage income spent on reports. We assume additional expen-
395   diture increases the likelihood of receiving information, p, with decreasing marginal e↵ect,21
396   i.e., p = p(nt ), where p(0) = 0, p(1) = 1, p0 (n) > 0 and p00 (n) < 0, which we capture via22

                                                              100nt
                                                 p(nt ) =             .                                        (29)
                                                            100nt + 1

397   Households purchase the welfare-maximizing quantity of information, nt . Returns to capital
398   depend on the aggregate allocation to banking, designated by a bar, which depends on the
399   mix of the two types of agents, informed and uninformed, per


                                     ↵
                                     ¯ s,t (✏t+1 ) = p↵I,s,t (✏t+1 ) + (1   p)↵U,s,t ,                         (30)


      where ↵I,s,t (✏t+1 ) is the asset allocation of informed agents and ↵U,s,t is the asset allocation
      of uninformed agents. With probability p(nt ), individuals receive information about ✏t+1

        19
           In our model, this is analogous to assuming households cannot determine the accuracy (or honesty) of
      a rating paid for by banks.
        20
           Thus, informed agents know the malfeasance share at t + 1 will be either m̄H + ✏t+1 or m̄L + ✏t+1 .
        21
           This can be micro-founded by assuming that nt buys many reports with each providing a noisy estimate
      of the true realization of the shock, ✏t+1 . With likelihood, p(x̄|✏t+1 ), where x̄ is the mean estimate given
      n reports, the precision of the estimate will be increasing in n, parameterized by the variance of the data-
      generating process for the reports.
        22
           The coefficient, 100, is chosen so that households can spend one percent of income on monitoring and
      receive information fifty percent of the time. This is sufficient to induce households to monitor.

      To recapitulate, with monitoring, households learn with probability p(nt ) the realization of
      ✏t+1 and choose the optimal allocation, ↵I,s,t (✏t+1 ), which solves eq. (31). With probability
      [1 p(nt )], households receive no information and and make an uninformed allocation, ↵U,s,t ,
      which is the implicit solution to eq. (32). Both solutions must be solved simultaneously.
      The solution is detailed in Appendix B. Optimal expenditure on monitoring, nt , is chosen
      to maximize expected utility

403   In eq. (33), the first two terms account for the sure cost to consumption when young and
404   old. The third and fourth terms represent the net gains from monitoring.
405      Under our calibration, if mean malfeasance is low at time t, households spend 1.13
406   percent of their income on learning ✏t+1 . This corresponds to a 53.1 percent chance of
407   learning the true potential bad-bank share. If mean malfeasance is high at time t, households
408   do not find it optimal to monitor. This is because the state of mean malfeasance a↵ects
409   returns more than the realization of ✏t+1 so learning is of less value when malfeasance is
410   likely to be high at t + 1.
411      When monitoring is optimal at time t (i.e., when the time-t mean malfeasance state
412   is low), table 7 shows that information on an impending negative shock to ✏t+1 reduces
413   investment in banking, on average, to 45 percent of savings. News of a positive shock
414   triggers a corner solution and individuals invest all their assets in banking, as opposed to
415   an average of 86 percent in the no-monitoring case. The e↵ect of informed individuals on
416   the aggregate allocation also makes this corner solution optimal even for agents for whom
417   monitoring generates no information. Figure 9 and table 8 show that monitoring makes
418   relatively little di↵erence to the economy. Consumption when young and old does tend to
419   be higher with monitoring. But the equilibrium is inefficient as agents replicate their e↵orts
420   to learn the value of ✏t+1 . Moreover, the downside to early information is more economic
421   volatility. Still, calculated as a compensating variation using eq. (28), households are 1.2 per
422   cent better o↵ in terms of lifetime expected utility than in the baseline if they can monitor.
423   Relative to deposit insurance, however, monitoring improves welfare by 5.4 per cent. This
424   is a substantial di↵erential. Unfortunately, monitoring can su↵er from free-riding.


                                                            21
425   7.2. Information as a Public Good

426   Previously, report results were assumed to be private. We now allow some households who
427   did not receive information to learn the value of ✏t+1 at zero cost with probability l. The
428   decision to purchase reports takes into account the probability of receiving information for
429   free. The probability of receiving information is now d


                                         d(nt ) = l + (1      l)p(nt )                         (36)


430      Households take l as given. The marginal increase in the probability of learning the
431   value of ✏t+1 from purchasing an additional report is now reduced based on the extent of
432   these leaks, i.e.,
                                           @d
                                               = p0 (nt )(1      l).                           (37)
                                           @nt
433   Clearly, as the fraction of leaked reports, l, increases, the marginal benefit of purchasing
434   reports decreases. This leads to fewer reports in equilibrium. Figure 10 illustrates how the
435   prospect of learning the true value for free reduces private monitoring. If households expect
436   the probability of a leak to be above 0.8, only .02 percent of wages is spent on monitoring,
437   yielding a probability of learning of just .02. Sufficiently high free-riding eliminates moni-
438   toring, i.e., the economy reverts to the baseline case where no information on the realization
439   of ✏t+1 is available. The free-riding problem of investor-funded ratings is noted in Warwick
440   Commission (2009).


441   8. Regulation Through Disclosure

      Suppose the government can pay a cost to reduce the average malfeasance share by             ,
      replacing eq. (15) with


                                         mt = (m̄t         ) + ✏t+1 .                          (38)




                                                     22
442   To pay for this, we impose a lump sum tax on the old equivalent to the average cost of
443   deposit insurance, ⌧Disc,t = ⌧¯DI = 2.93 or 12.7 percent of output.


                               co,t+1 = At+1 [1 + (1     ↵t )rf,t+1 + ↵t r̃b,t+1 ]   ⌧Disc,t .             (39)


444   Figure 11 considers the impact of this expenditure assuming the government is able to
445   reduce malfeasance by either           = 0.2 or      = 0.4 after spending ⌧Disc,t . Recall that m̄s is
446   either m̄H = 0.50 or m̄L = 0.22. The comparison economy is that with deposit insurance.
447   Disclosure raises non-stolen output, wages, capital formation and consumption. Increasing
448   the share of honest bankers encourages households to enter the banking sector in much the
449   same way as deposit insurance. However, deposit insurance does nothing to eliminate fraud.
450   As expected, the economy does far better if government disclosure is high. Average results
451   for both levels of disclosure are reported in tables 9 and 10. Figure 12 compares average
452   output, non-stolen output and lifetime consumption in the regimes discussed. Deposit
453   insurance boosts output, but not non-stolen output or consumption. Monitoring, even
454   ignoring free riding, makes little di↵erence to the equilibrium. Low disclosure references a
455   government-instigated reduction in the share of bad bankers of                   = 0.2. This reduces non-
456   stolen output and consumption considerably despite the high cost of regulation, assumed to
457   be equal to the cost of deposit insurance. High disclosure, reducing the malfeasance share
458   by     = 0.4, produces further gains.
459         The downside to a modest reduction in malfeasance is that it encourages investment in
460   banking while still permitting shocks to malfeasance to cause volatility. Volatility under
461   limited disclosure is similar to that under deposit insurance. This is illustrated in fig. 13,
462   which depicts the standard deviation of key variables compared to the baseline. Signifi-
463   cant disclosure solves this problem. Table 11 reports compensating variations. They are
464   calculated as the percentage change in consumption, in all states, needed to produce the
465   same expected utility as in the baseline, measured by averaging realized lifetime utility over
466   10,000 generations beginning after the economy has been operating for 20 periods.24 The

       24
            In making these calculations we consider the same sequence of shocks for each setting.




                                                           23
467   table shows that, compared with the baseline, deposit insurance is 4.1 percent less efficient,
468   monitoring is 1.2 percent more efficient, a low level of government disclosure is 23.3 percent
469   more efficient, and a high level of government disclosure is 37.9 percent more efficient.


470   9. Conclusion

471   Banking crisis, throughout the ages, have been precipitated by the exposure of bad/malfeasant
472   banks (bankers). This news leads the public to defund the banks, often precipitously, which
473   is termed a liquidity crisis. Under this, our paper’s view, liquidity crises are the result of,
474   not the cause of financial retrenchment with its attendant economic decline. The medium
475   for financial malfeasance in all its manifestations is financial opacity. Leading up to 2008,
476   opacity provided full cover for liar loans, no-doc loans, NINJA loans, Mado↵’s swindle,
477   originate-to-distribute abuses, CDOs-squared and other highly complex tranched deriva-
478   tives, unreported CDS positions, ratings shopping, failures (with government approval) to
479   mark assets to market25 and the list goes on. The revelation of financial fraud amidst the
480   financial fog produced the rush to liquidity that eventuated in the downfall of so many high
481   profile banks. Had there been no malfeasance there likely would have been no crisis.
482         If, as modeled here, the revelation of “good” bankers gone bad rather than of bad
483   things happening to good banks is the source of financial crisis, dramatically expanding
484   the government’s role in verification and disclosure of assets may be the answer. This
485   prescription is the polar opposite of those who tout opacity as essential for maintaining
486   liquidity of bank liabilities. The di↵erence in perspective arises in the case of counterfeit
487   currency. If no one knows that some currency is counterfeit, both bad and good currency
488   will be sources of liquidity. Disclosing the counterfeits can produce a run on, actually, a
489   run away from the currency. Is society better o↵ suppressing news of the counterfeits and
490   letting them continue to circulate? Doing so maintains liquidity, but permits ongoing theft
491   and risks financial panic if news leaks out. The answer, in practice, is no. Counterfeiters
492   are disclosed and prosecuted as a public service.
493         No one would expect private citizens to actively investigate counterfeiters. But when it

       25
            See Andolfatto and Martin (2013)


                                                     24
494   comes to banking, many have faulted investors, the vast majority of whom are quite small,
495   for failing to keep track of their banks’ behavior. Indeed, the central premise of Dodd-Frank
496   – that public funds will no longer be used to bail out private banks – appears predicated on
497   the assumption that investors, knowing they are at risk, will better monitor their financial
498   institutions. This flies in the face of the free riding problem. Just as government is needed
499   to monitor, uncover, and disclose counterfeiting, our model suggests that government is
500   needed to verify and disclose, in real time, all bank assets and liabilities.

592   A. Deriving Sectoral Returns

      Recall that returns to investment in both sectors are given by

                                                                                  ,


      and capital allocation is


                                            Kb,t+1 =↵s,t At+1 ,

                                            Kf,t+1 =(1              ↵s,t )At+1 .


      Both the malfeasance share at t + 1 and optimal allocation to banking, ↵s,t , depend on the
      malfeasance share at t, denoted by subscript s 2 {L, H}. Let superscript S 2 {L, H} denote
      the realization at t + 1 of the mean malfeasance share, m̄s 2 {m̄L , m̄H }. After substituting
      for capital, returns in each sector conditional on the state realized at t + 1 are

                           S
                          rf,t+1 =✓Zf (1      ↵s,t )✓ 1 (At+1 )✓ 1 (LSf,t+1 )1 ✓ ,                  (40)

      Labor supply in each industry, conditional on the realized state of the world, s, is

                                                         Zt+1
                                                                             1

                                                                                   .                (43)
                                                                 Zt+1

593   where we define the average productivity in the two sectors conditional on the realization
594   of state S at t+1 as

                                                       1                                      1

                                                               30
      Substituting eq. (44) into conditional returns, eqs. (40) and (41) yields

                           S

                           S
                                                  ⇥      S
                                                             ⇤✓   1                            1
                          rb,t+1 (↵s,t , ✏t+1 ) =✓ At+1 Zt+1          [(1     m̄S   ✏t+1 )Zb ] ✓ .   (46)


595   These returns depend on the malfeasance share - both its mean state m̄S and ✏t+1 - and on
596   the aggregate allocation to banking, ↵s,t .


597   B. Solving for Allocation Decision with Private Monitoring.

598   The following steps were used to solve for allocation decisions with private monitoring.

599     1. Informed individuals begin by guessing the uninformed optimal allocation, ↵U,s,t .
600     2. Use eqs. (30) and (31) to calculate optimal informed allocation, ↵I,s,t , for any realiza-
601         tion of ✏t+1 in the support [a, b]. That is, we construct ↵I,s,t (✏t+1 ).
602     3. Use this function to compute aggregate allocation ↵
                                                             ¯ s,t (✏t+1 ), given by eq. (30).
603     4. The first order condition, eq. (32), gives optimal uninformed allocation, ↵U,s,t .
604     5. Iterate until the initial guess for optimal uninformed allocation matches the solution,
605         yielding ↵U,s,t and ↵I,s,t (✏t+1 ).

606   Repeating steps 1-5 over a range of values for nt , and substituting into eq. (33) allows us to
607   find the optimal nt to maximize expected utility.
