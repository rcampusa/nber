                                             ABSTRACT

The potentially serious adverse impacts of behavior problems during adolescence on employment
outcomes in adulthood provide a key economic rationale for early intervention programs. However,
the extent to which lower educational attainment accounts for the total impact of adolescent behavior
problems on later employment remains unclear As an initial step in exploring this issue, we specify
and estimate a recursive bivariate probit model that 1) relates middle school behavior problems to
high school graduation and 2) models later employment in young adulthood as a function of these
behavior problems and of high school graduation. Our model thus allows for both a direct effect of
behavior problems on later employment as well as an indirect effect that operates via graduation from
high school. Our empirical results, based on analysis of data from the NELS, suggest that the direct
effects of externalizing behavior problems on later employment are not significant but that these problems
have important indirect effects operating through high school graduation.

1. INTRODUCTION

     The impact of children's behavioral or "noncognitive" traits on future labor market

outcomes has been of interest for economists and other social scientists (Heckman, Rubinstein,

2001; Bowles, Gintis, Osborne, 2001; Farkas, 2003; Heckman, Stixrud, Urzua, 2006). Previous

studies indicates that adolescent behavioral problems, such as persistent rule-breaking,

aggressive or antisocial behaviors, low motivation for school, alcohol and illicit substance use,

and delinquent acts, are associated with higher unemployment and lower earnings in adulthood

(Bowles, Gintis, Osborne, 2001; Cawley, Heckman, Vytlacil, 2001; Kokko, Pulkkinen, 2000;

Woodward and Fergusson, 2000). This study adds to the literature by examining the relative

importance of direct and indirect relationships between behavioral problems in adolescence and

employment status in early adulthood.

     The relative importance of the direct versus indirect impacts of behavioral problems on

adult employment has possible implications for investment in prevention programs. If negative

impacts are primarily due to lower educational attainment, interventions that improve high

school graduation rates (or delay discontinuation of education among at risk youths) may have

long-term benefits in terms of future employment and earnings. On the other hand, if behavioral

problems primarily affect distal labor market outcomes via direct impacts of noncognitive traits

and skills, interventions that focus on keeping students in school despite behavioral problems

may not substantially improve labor market outcomes. That would require programs that

ameliorate behavioral problems, or early intervention programs that prevent development of

these problems.

     We use data from a nationally representative cohort in 1988 of eighth-grade students who

were followed up in 2000, at ages 25 to 28, to model the effects of early adolescent behavior



                                                                                                    1
problems on employment status in early adulthood. Unlike prior studies (e.g., Kokko,

Pulkkinen, 2000; Woodward, Fergusson, 2000), our model allows for both direct and indirect

effects of behavioral problems in 8th grade (1988) on early adulthood employment; indirect

effects operate via the probability of graduating from high school. We estimate model

parameters via maximum likelihood estimation of a recursive bivariate probit regression with

potentially correlated errors (Greene, 2003, Cameron, Trivedi, 2005). The bivariate probit model

explicitly allows for the possibility that educational attainment is endogenous to employment

(Heckman, Stixrud, Urzua, 2006).

     We obtain coefficient estimates using the unweighted NELS data since unweighted

estimators are consistent and more efficient than their weighted counterparts when the stratifying

variables are exogenous (Wooldridge, 2002).

Behavioral problems, educational attainment, and employment

     Because maladaptive behaviors may cause lower educational attainment, they could

indirectly affect employment in adulthood via effects on educational attainment. High schools

require a minimal level of compliance with rules that some students cannot achieve or may be

unwilling to tolerate, which may explain the negative association of behavioral problems in

adolescence with high school completion and college attendance (Fergusson, Horwood,

Woodward, 2001; Woodward, Fergusson, 2000; Alexander, Entwisle, Horsey, 1997; Ensminger,

Slusarcick, 1992; Ensminger, Lamkin, Jacobson, 1996; Brooks-Gunn, 1993; French, Conrad,

2001). The literature indicates that high school graduation raises earnings and increases the

probability of employment (e.g., Geweke, Keane, 2000; Heckman, 2000; Hamburg 1974,

Steinberg, Lerner 2004). Thus, an indirect structural relationship between adolescent behavioral

problems and employment outcomes in adulthood may be important.




                                                                                                   2
     However, most previous empirical work has not examined this structural relationship (e.g.,

Kokko, Pulkkinen, 2000; Woodward, Fergusson, 2000; Vitaro, Larocque, et al. 2001; Capaldi,

Chamberlain, Patterson, 1997; Jimerson, Egeland, et al. 2000; McLeod, J.D., Kaiser, K. 2004).

Instead, measures of behavior problems and educational attainment were modeled in the same

single equation specification for employment. The resulting estimates thus only reflect direct

effects of behavioral traits on employment, with the measure of educational attainment absorbing

the indirect effect of behavioral problems on employment outcomes.

     Direct effects of behavioral problems on employment may occur because employers’ value

adherence to norms of conduct in the workplace (Bowles, Gintis and Osborne, 2001).

Employers may be less willing to employ individuals with behavioral problems, because

maladaptive behavior may interfere with performance or generate higher incidental costs to the

employer. Childhood problems are directly related to these effects, because problems adapting to

requisite norms of behavior in adulthood typically are evident during childhood (Hofstra, van der

Ende, and Verhulst, 2002). However, employers can not usually observe whether potential

employees had behavioral problems while at middle or high school. The educational screening

hypothesis suggests that employers use education to screen for exogenous ability differences.

Thus, they infer some unobservable factors, such as extent of middle-school behavioral

problems, from the observable facts of high-school graduation or number of years of completed

schooling (Riley, 1979; Weiss, 1995; Martorell, Clark, 2009).

Gender Differences

     Descriptive comparisons suggest that relationships between adolescent behavioral

problems, educational attainment, and employment outcomes in early adulthood may differ by

gender. Females have higher rates of high school graduation and lower rates of employment in




                                                                                                 3
their 20s (Swanson, 2004; Kienzl, Kena, 2006), suggesting that processes linking these outcomes

may differ by gender. Additionally, studies document the higher prevalence rates among boys

than girls of delinquency, physical aggression, and overt antisocial behaviors (Baillargeon et al.,

2007; Verhulst et al., 2003; Black, 2000; Pursell, et al. 2008). Finally, studies from the labor

economics literature (Altonji, Blank, 1999), and on labor market impacts of cognitive and

behavioral factors (Murnane, Willett, Levy, 1995; Heckman, Stixrud, Urzua, 2006; Cawley,

Heckman, Vytlacil, 2001) document significant gender differences (or restrict their analyses to

only one gender). Accordingly, we estimate separate models for males and females. (We tested

pooled vs. gender-specific models on our data and clearly rejected pooling: results are available

from the authors.)


2. METHODS

Estimation Model

     In our model, employment outcome depends on observable covariates (X1), high school

graduation, and an unobservable random error term u1. We assume high school graduation

probability depends on a set of observable covariates (X2) and an unobservable error term u2. We

assume that u1 and u2 have a bivariate normal distribution with correlation ρ. In our initial

analyses, the same covariates were included in X1 and X2. Subsequent analyses tested the

stability of our principal findings when selected covariates were deleted from X1. Note that the

recursive structure of the model provides identification for the purposes of FIML estimation;

further exclusion restrictions on the X1 vector are not required (Wilde, 2000).

     The from of the model estimated was:

Prob (HS=1| X2) = Prob [(β2X2 + u1)>0, Prob (EMP=1|HS, X1) = Prob [(β1X1 + β3HS+ u2,)>0],




                                                                                                      4
where β1 and β2 are the coefficient vectors for X1 and X2, β3 is the coefficient for HS, and u1 and

u2 are random draws from a bivariate normal distribution with corr(u1, u2)=ρ. A positive value

for the correlation between the error terms, ρ, indicates that unobservables positively (negatively)

related to the probability of high school graduation also increase (decrease) the probability of

employment; negative values for ρ imply that unobservables have oppositely-signed influences

on graduation and employment. Full-information maximum likelihood (FIML) (using Stata

Version 9) is used for estimation.

Data Source, Variables, and Sample

     Analysis is based on the data from the National Educational Longitudinal Study (NELS)

from the base year (1988) through the fifth follow-up (2000) (12,144 cases) (Curtin et al. 2002).

Employment and high-school graduation data are from the 2000 and 1994 waves, respectively.

All other data are from the 1988 baseline survey. Because of missing data from parents, teachers

and/or schools, 9,660 cases were available for analysis; deletion of cases where data were

reported, but values for specific variables used in our analysis were missing, resulted in a final

study sample of 8,405 subjects (3,927 males and 4,478 females).

     The outcome variables high school graduation and employment are binary variables. We

define high school graduation in a time window of up to 6 years after eighth grade (i.e., using the

1994 NELS data) to include those who were delayed in completing high school. For most

models, we did not include a GED as equivalent to a high school diploma because of evidence

that labor market returns to a high school diploma are significantly higher than returns to GED

certification (Cameron and Heckman, 1993), and that the post-schooling labor-market outcomes

for GED recipients more closely match those of high-school dropouts (Heckman and Rubinstein,

2001; Heckman, Stixrud and Urzua, 2006). Thus, in most specifications, we contrast




                                                                                                      5
employment for high school graduates with a reference group of GED recipients and dropouts.

(We also report results of sensitivity analyses with GED recipients coded as high school

graduates.)

     The employment outcome is an indicator of current employment for the 2000 survey year.

Those who report current employment for pay in either a full-time or part-time job are coded as

employed. (Results for models that define the employment outcome as = 1 only for full-time

workers are discussed below in our presentation of sensitivity analyses.)

     Explanatory variables pertain to behavior problems, academic performance,

demographic/socio-economic background, and school characteristics. Information on behavior

problems was obtained from teacher reports and student self-report. While this information was

not derived from psychometrically validated scales, such as the Behavior Problems Index (BPI)

(Zill, 1985), that have been used previously in economic research (e.g., Jones et al., 1999), the

NELS data items could be viewed as roughly consistent with the two major dimensions of

behavior problems (i.e., externalizing vs. internalizing) identified in the BPI. In particular, the

NELS responses include one teacher-reported measure on student passivity in class, which could

be regarded as potentially related to internalizing problems, as well as several items that are

presumably related to externalizing problems: teacher reports on whether the student is

frequently absent, and whether (s)he is disruptive class; and student-reported measures on

skipping class and on being sent to the principal’s office for misbehaving in class.

     Academic performance variables (as of eighth grade) were obtained from teacher reports or

student-self-reports. They include the student’s grade point average (GPA), teacher rating of the

student’s academic performance compared to his/her ability, and student self-report on whether

(s)he had to repeat a grade.




                                                                                                      6
     Demographic/socio-economic background variables include race, presence of both

biological parents, caregiver’s employment status and educational attainment, and family

income. The NELS school characteristics variables were obtained from school records (for

attendance rate) and geocoding (for urban location).


3. RESULTS
Descriptive Statistics

     Table 1 reports mean values for dependent and explanatory variables by gender. High

school graduation as of 1994 is reported by more than 89 percent of study subjects, while current

employment is reported by 92.1 percent of males and 82.7 percent of females. Other gender

differences are clear from the data. While males and females report similar high-school

graduation rates, females reported higher standardized grade point averages, lower rates of

repeating a year by 8th grade. Females were less likely to be rated by teachers as performing

below ability. Males were more likely to be rated as being disruptive in class, and more likely to

self-report skipping class and being sent to the office for misbehaving. While females were more

likely to be reported as being frequently absent by their teachers, there is little gender difference

in teacher-rated passive behavior in class. Males were more likely to report behavioral problems

that are closely associated with attention and focus in classroom activities.

     With regard to socio-demographic characteristics, about 71 percent of our study subjects

were white. About 70 percent of the subjects reported living with both biological parents, 90

percent reported having an employed caregiver, and the mean annual household income level

exceded $40,000. Slightly over 10 percent of respondents did not have at least one caregiver who

had completed high school; just under 20 percent reported at least one caregiver who completed

high school but no caregivers with any post-high-school education.




                                                                                                        7
Regression Results for Males

      Regression results were obtained with three similar but slightly different specifications for

the employment model. One model regressed all covariates listed in Table 1, as well as the high

school graduation outcome variable, on the employment outcome. Results indicated that the

covariate for average attendance rate in eighth grade was clearly insignificant in the employment

outcome model, so a second regression was estimated with this covariate excluded from the

employment outcome model. In this case, the remaining school characteristic variable, the urban

school dummy, was not quite significant in the employment outcome model, so a third variant

was estimated in which both school characteristics variables were excluded from the

employment outcome model. (In all three cases, both school characteristics were included in the

high school graduate outcome model and were clearly significant.) In presenting our results in

detail, we focus here on the results from the regressions with this third variant of the employment

outcome model; comparisons with results with the first two variants of the employment outcome

model are examined in our sensitivity analyses.

      Using the third variant of our employment outcome model, Table 2 presents the simple and

bivariate probit regression results for males. Simple probit estimates (in columns 1 through 4)

ignore any possible correlation between the unobservables that affect high school completion and

those that affect employment. Simple probit results for high school completion indicate highly

significant coefficients for almost all covariates. Corresponding results for employment show a

large and significant positive coefficient for high school graduation, but a significantly negative

coefficient for grade-point average. Among the behavior problem variables, the only significant

result is the negative coefficient for teacher-rated passivity in class. A joint likelihood ratio test

for all behavior problem variables (as predictors of employment) approached significance (P =




                                                                                                         8
0.0731) reflecting the importance of passivity as a negative predictor of employment; excluding

this variable from the joint test yielded a joint P-value for the remaining (externalizing) behavior

problem indicators of 0.8879. Among the remaining covariates, being white and living with both

parents were significant and positive predictors of being employed. Conversely, family income

had a significantly negative coefficient. One possible explanation for this negative relationship

is that young adults whose parents had higher income can afford to postpone employment after

high school and perhaps continue their education while continuing to rely on parental financial

support. However, males whose most highly-educated caregiver received a high school diploma

but no further education were significantly less likely to be employed relative to those with at

least one caregiver with any post-high school education.

     In the bivariate probit analysis for males, the results for high school graduation are very

similar in sign, size and significance to the results in the simple probit model. In the employment

equation, the bivariate coefficient on high school completion is substantially larger than in the

simple probit model. Other employment results, however, parallel the findings for the simple

probit model. Among the behavior problem variables, only teacher-rated passivity is significant.

While all behavior problem variables have negative coefficients, as a group they only approach

significance (P=0.0682). However, the joint P-value for the externalizing behavior problem

variables (i.e., excluding passivity from the test) becomes clearly insignificant (p=0.9372). We

again find that grade-point average is negatively related to employment and that students whose

caregivers have post-high-school education are less likely to be employed (relative to children of

caregivers with no post-high school education).

       The bivariate probit regression provides an estimate of ρ (rho), the correlation between

unobservables affecting high school graduation and those affecting employment decision. The




                                                                                                    9
estimated ρ is negative and statistically significant (p=0.013). Thus, unobserved factors that are

associated with higher probability of high school graduation are also predictive of a lower

likelihood of employment during transition to adulthood. This implies a negative bias in the

estimated effect of high school graduation on employment outcome for males, and is consistent

with our finding of a smaller coefficient of high school graduation in the simple probit model of

employment compared to the bivariate probit model.

       In comparison to these results, bivariate probit regression with both school characteristics

included in both outcome models, yielded P-values of 0.048 and 0.662 for the urban school

dummy and the attendance rate respectively in the employment outcome model. When the

attendance rate was excluded, the P-value for the urban school dummy fell to 0.051. (A variant

of the employment outcome model with the urban school dummy excluded but the attendance

rate included, yielded a P-value of 0.743 for the coefficient of the latter variable.) We tested the

restriction that both school characteristics have no direct effect on the employment outcome and

obtained an insignificant P-Value of 0.137. In all cases, the regression results for other

explanatory variables in both outcome models were virtually unchanged.

Regression Results for Females

     The specification of the regression models for females parallels that for males described

above. Since the variants that included (1) both school characteristics, or (2) just the urban

school dummy yielded clearly insignificant coefficients for school characteristics in the

employment outcome models, we present in detail the results obtained when school

characteristics are not used as predictors of employment outcomes. (See Table 3.) As in the case

of males, most coefficients in the simple probit model of high school graduation are significant

and plausibly signed. Once again the problem behavior indicators that may be viewed as




                                                                                                   10
indicative of externalizing behavior problems are significantly negative while the indicator of

passive behavior is again insignificant. However, apart from the significant positive coefficient

for family income, the influences of family background characteristics on graduation probability

appear to be slightly weaker for females than for males. An unexpected gender difference is that

the sign of the significant coefficient for the urban school dummy is positive, while it was

negative for males. This may reflect differing urban vs. rural patterns in availability of low-skill

employment for males vs. females; further exploration of this pattern is warranted.

     Simple probit results for the employment regression also show some interesting differences

with the findings for males. High school graduation is a positive and significant predictor of

employment, but the same is true of grade point average, while females who repeated a grade are

significantly less likely to have been employed. Most behavior problem variables are

insignificant, but the negative coefficients for being frequently absent and for being disruptive in

class are, respectively, significant and approaching significance. A joint likelihood ratio test on

all the behavior problem variables yielded a p-value of 0.0656. A similar p-value (0.0598) is

obtained when the passive behavior variable is excluded from this test. Family background

characteristics are also not significant predictors of employment, with the only exceptions being

the positive effect of living with both parents and the negative result for high-school educated

caregivers (relative to the reference group with some post-high-school education).

     Bivariate probit results for the high school graduation model (columns 5 and 6) closely

parallel the simple probit results. Our two school characteristics covariates have statistically

significant coefficients (p<0.05) with positive signs as expected. Educational achievement

variables are also significant and have the expected signs. Study subjects with relatively higher

GPAs in eighth grade are significantly more likely to graduate from high school. Similarly, those




                                                                                                   11
who repeated a grade (prior to 8th grade) and those reported by teachers as performing below

ability are significantly less likely to complete high school. Among the behavioral problem

indicators, being frequently absent, being disruptive in class, self-report of regularly skipping

class, and being sent to the office for misbehaving, are all significant (p<0.05) with expected

negative coefficients. Being passive in class again is clearly insignificant. Living with both

parents has a positive and significant coefficient (p=0.029). In addition, students with no

caregiver who completed high school are less likely to graduate from high school relative to

those with a caregiver with any education beyond high school (p<0.01). Subjects, whose

caregiver had only a high school diploma also appear less likely to graduate from high school

compared with study subjects whose caregivers had education beyond high school, though this

difference was not significant. Family income was a significant and positive predictor of high

school graduation (p<0.01) while the coefficient for having an employed caregiver was positive

and marginally significant.

     Bivariate probit employment results (in columns 7 and 8) show some differences from the

simple probit results. We obtain a larger positive and significant coefficient for high school

graduation (p<0.05), but other educational achievement variables are no longer significant.

Among behavioral problem indicators, being sent to office for misbehaving is marginally

significant (p=0.062) and is (unexpectedly) positive. All other behavioral problem indicators

have the expected negative coefficients but all are statistically insignificant. A joint likelihood

ratio test on inclusion of the behavior problem variables yielded a P-value of 0.1319 in the

bivariate model. (A similar p-value (0.1299) is obtained when the passive behavior variable is

excluded from this test.) Results for other covariates parallel the simple probit results.




                                                                                                      12
       The bivariate probit estimate of ρ is negative but not statistically significant. This is

consistent with the greater stability (compared to males) of the high school graduation results in

the simple and bivariate probit models for employment.

       When both school characteristics were included in both outcome models, bivariate probit

estimation yielded P-values of 0.721 and 0.178 for the urban school dummy and the attendance

rate respectively in the employment outcome model. When the attendance rate was excluded

from this model, the P-value for the urban school dummy coefficient was still clearly

insignificant (P=0.673). (When the urban school dummy was excluded but the attendance rate

included in the employment model, we obtained a P-value of 0.172 for the coefficient of the

latter variable.) We the restriction that both school characteristics have no direct effect on the

employment outcome could not be rejected (P-Value of 0.362). In all cases, the regression results

for other explanatory variables were virtually unchanged from those reported in Table 3.

       Estimated Marginal Effects of Behavior and Academic Indicators

       To examine the magnitudes of the impacts of behavior problems and academic progress

indicators on outcomes, we computed the sample mean values for changes in the probabilities of

these outcomes predicted to result from changes in our behavior and academic indicators. For

example, to compute the impact of having repeated a grade (by the time a student was in eighth

grade) on the probability of high school graduation we used our estimated coefficients for high

school graduation to predict graduation probabilities for each respondent 1) assuming they had

not repeated a grade and 2) assuming they had repeated a grade. The difference in the sample

means for these two probabilities was our measure of the direct influence of repeating a grade on

the probability of high school graduation. (For both sets of predicted probabilities, other

explanatory variables for each respondent were set at their actually observed values.) To




                                                                                                     13
compute the total (direct plus indirect) influence of repeating a grade on the probability of

employment, we computed for each respondent the change in the predicted probability of

employment resulting from two changes in the predictors of employment: 1) a change from not

having repeated a grade to having repeated a grade and 2) the change in the predicted probability

of high-school graduation for that respondent resulting from repeating a grade. Combining these

changes for each respondent with their actual values for all other predictors and with the

coefficients from our bivariate probit employment regressions, we computed that change in

employment probability for each respondent. The sample mean value of the latter change

indicates the total influence on employment probability of having to repeat a grade.

       We also computed the mean estimated indirect effect of each variable on employment.

For each individual this effect for each variable was computed in two steps. We first used the

estimated coefficient from the bivariate probit employment regression to compute the estimated

direct effect on employment, holding the high school graduation variable constant at its observed

level. We then computed the estimated indirect effect as the difference between the estimated

total employment effect for that variable and the estimated direct effect.

       The results of these calculations are in Table 4. Estimated employment impacts for each

variable are generally small in magnitude (the maximum absolute value is 0.0617). The

estimated high school graduation effects are somewhat larger but in several instances the signs of

the coefficients in the high school graduation and employment bivariate probit regressions are

opposite, tending to produce small total employment impacts. Also, a number of the estimates in

Table 4 (in columns 3 through 6) are based on coefficient point estimates that are small and

imprecise. It seems reasonable to expect that confidence intervals for these estimates (which




                                                                                                 14
could be computed by complete bootstrapping of the entire estimation process) would be fairly

wide.

Sensitivity Analysis Results

        The stability of the results reported in Tables 2 and 3 above were tested by estimating a

variety of alternative models. Three variants of the employment outcome specification were

tested: one including both school characteristics as covariates, one including only the urban

school dummy, and one excluding both (which was used for the regressions in Tables 2 and 3).

We re-estimated our regressions with each of these three variants using two other modifications.

In the first, we redefined our high school graduation outcome to include persons with a GED.

This assumes that the high school graduate and GED groups can be treated as homogeneous

while dropouts groups serve as the reference group. In the second, we excluded persons in our

study samples who reported that they were full-time students in the year 2000. This relaxes the

potentially important assumption that the impact of high school graduation on employment

probability 8 years later is invariant to the factors that induce some persons to extend their full-

time schooling to the 8-year follow-up time point. The foregoing implies a total of 9 different

specifications for testing the stability of our results.

        Tables 5 and 6 report the range of our employment outcome coefficient estimates (and the

associated P-values) across all 9 models for the high school graduation dummy, the other

educational achievement variables, and the behavior problem variables. For bivariate

regressions, we also report the range of estimates and for the random disturbance correlation

(rho). (Full results are available from the authors.)

        For the behavior problem variables, our estimates and P-values tend to be very stable for

both genders across all different specifications. While some coefficient magnitudes change, none




                                                                                                    15
show substantial changes in significance or changes in sign (except for a few cases of very small

coefficients with very high P-values).

      Coefficient estimates for other variables are generally stable though slightly more variable

across the specifications. In bivariate probit regressions, the high school graduation coefficient

falls in size and significance when full-time students are excluded from the analysis; note,

however, that these weaker results for high school graduation are obtained in models in where

the estimated rho is also at its smallest magnitude and is clearly insignificant. This suggests that

the coefficient estimates for these models are inefficient; by contrast, the corresponding simple

probit results for these same employment outcome models show highly significant high school

graduation coefficient estimates. Considering the other three educational achievement covariates,

the most notable variation in results pertained to the grade point average variable. The negative

coefficient of this variable for males fell substantially in magnitude and significance in both the

simple and bivariate probit results when full-time students were excluded from the analysis. For

females, excluding full-time students resulted in larger positive and more significant coefficient

for this variable.

      In summary, our sensitivity analyses do not indicate substantial variability in our main

findings across the 9 different specifications that we tested. This is consistent with several facts

about our study sample. First, the fraction of GED holders is relatively small, 3.9 percent for

males and 3.8 percent for females. Second, the employment rate among full-time students in the

year 2000 is relatively high (77.19 per cent) and the number of full-time students is small (14.77

per cent).

      One additional sensitivity analysis was carried out using the specifications reported in

Tables 2 and 3 but defining the employment outcome as = 1only for persons who were employed




                                                                                                     16
full-time. Results for the employment probits (available from the authors) were fairly robust to

this change in specification. For males, the estimated coefficient for repeating a grade became

positive in both simple and bivariate employment probits, and significant in the latter. For

females, in the bivariate employment results, the coefficient for grade point average became

significant. None of the qualitative results for the behavior problem variables was substantially

altered; the most notable change was a decline in size and significance of the bivariate

coefficient for females for being sent to the office for misbehaving.


4. DISCUSSION


     Results from the probit regressions (Tables 2 and 3) indicate generally significant or nearly

significant effects of behavior problems in early adolescence on the probability of high school

graduation, but much less significant effects of these problems, conditional on high school

graduation, on the probability of employment approximately 8 years later. This general

conclusion holds for both males and females, but an exception is the significant negative direct

effect of classroom passivity on future employment for males. This result accords with recent

developmental models (Rubin, Burgess, Kennedy, 2003) that indicate social withdrawal among

school age children is associated with establishment of negative peer reputations, peer rejection,

and unpopularity. Social withdrawal could consequently be associated with multiple

interpersonal and emotional difficulties in interpersonal that limit employment in adulthood.


     The significant results for behavior problems in the high school graduation regressions,

combined with insignificant results in the employment regression, supports the educational

screening/signaling hypothesis that employers make judgments about prospective employees’

productivity from readily observable indicators such as high school graduation or years of




                                                                                                    17
completed schooling (Riley, 1979; Weiss, 1995). This pattern of results may also have

implications for strategy in evaluating interventions directed at preventing or ameliorating

behavior problems. While long-term economic benefits of these programs on post-educational

labor market outcomes may be important, much of their impact on post-high school labor market

outcomes can be captured by the projected long term effects of high school graduation on labor

market outcomes. We illustrate this point quantitatively by using the results in Tables 2 and 3 to

compute the combined total and indirect impacts of our five dichotomous indicators of behavior

problems on future employment probability (in Table 4). The indirect impact estimates

correspond to estimates based on the proximal outcome (high school graduation) while the total

estimates incorporate both proximal and distal impacts. For males, the indirect and total

employment impact estimates of all behavior problems combined were respectively -0.067 and -

0.106. The corresponding estimates for all externalizing behavior problems combined (i.e.,

excluding the passive behavior dummy) were -0.046 and -0.031. Analogous figures for females

for all behavior problems combined were -0.091 and -0.133, and for all externalizing problems

combined were -0.090 and -0.108. As noted above, these impact estimates are based on point

estimates for some coefficients that are not precisely estimated, especially the coefficients of

behavior problems in the employment regressions.


     We also find some evidence that unobservable factors have opposite effects on our two

outcomes, implying endogeneity of high-school graduation in the employment regressions. This

is most clearly true for males, but a similar result emerges for females in regressions when

insignificant behavioral and academic predictors are deleted from the bivariate probit

employment models (results available on request from the authors). This influence of




                                                                                                   18
unobservables may be related to post-high-school continuation of schooling for some

respondents.

     The stronger evidence for males of unobservables that jointly affect graduation and

employment could be related to gender differences in the returns to schooling for occupations

that tend to attract males versus females. Studies report that males who drop out of high school

have higher skills in the kinds of jobs that do not require a high school diploma (Eckstein,

Wolpin, 1999). For male dropouts, an extra year of schooling could have a higher opportunity

cost of potential earnings in well paid blue-collar jobs, at least during early adulthood. Lower

expected returns to a high school diploma may encourage male low-ability students to

discontinue their education and accept employment at an earlier age.


     Several limitations of our research should also be noted. The NELS measures of behavior

problems are relatively crude compared to behavior measures based on the more extensive

questions found in widely used psychological instruments such as the BPI (Jones et al., 1999).

The limitations of the NELS measures may have contributed to the insignificant results in the

employment regressions; conversely the significance of these NELS measures in the high school

graduation regressions may be enhanced because they measure behavior problems specifically in

the school and classroom context.


     Another limitation is the fact that our labor market outcome measure is obtained in early

adulthood. It would be desirable to replicate our analysis with more precise labor market

measures (e.g., earnings) at later ages, after more respondents had completed post-high-school

schooling and had established a clearer work history and earnings trajectory. Measures of wages

or earnings may show more variation in later years because of differential returns to experience

in high-skill vs. low-skill jobs. Also, at later ages employers have more opportunity to make



                                                                                                   19
inferences about employees’ cognitive and non-cognitive skills from direct observations on

employee productivity. It is interesting to note that a recent study using British data (Fronstin,

Greenberg, Robins, 2005) did report at least mixed evidence that behavior problems for males,

observed at age 16, may impact labor market outcomes observed at age 33. Results for females,

however, were somewhat weaker. (For both genders, behavior problem effects on wages were

somewhat stronger than effects on labor-force status and employment.)


5. CONCLUSIONS


     We estimated the effects of behavioral problems during early adolescence on employment

during early adulthood. We used FIML to estimate a recursive bivariate probit model to control

for direct effects of behavioral problems on employment as well as the indirect effects through

endogenous high school graduation. Our main finding is that middle-school behavior problems

were strongly and negatively related to the probability of having a high school diploma 6 years

later, but not to the probability of employment, conditional on high school graduation, 12 years

later. Results were consistent across both genders; they indicate that effects of behavior problems

on high school graduation can account for a substantial portion of the more distal economic

impacts on employment status in young adulthood. The practical implication is that more timely

evaluations of early prevention programs, based on shorter follow-up periods, can provide useful

assessments. Timeliness is a virtue in this context for reasons of cost and for enabling more

rapid dissemination of effective programs.

     The limitations of our data and measures, however, imply that these results are tentative.

Further analyses of long-term follow-up data, including analyses linked directly to preventive

interventions in young childhood or early adolescence, are needed.
