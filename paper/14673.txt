                                                  ABSTRACT

We examine whether the Chinese exchange rate is misaligned and how Chinese trade flows respond
to the exchange rate and to economic activity. We find, first, that the Chinese currency, the renminbi
(RMB), is substantially below the value predicted by estimates based upon a cross-country sample,
when using the 2006 vintage of the World Development Indicators. The economic magnitude of the
mis-alignment is substantial -- on the order of 50 percent in log terms. However, the misalignment
is typically not statistically significant, in the sense of being more than two standard errors away from
the conditional mean. However, this finding disappears completely when using the most recent 2008
vintage of data; then the estimated undervaluation is on the order of 10 percent. Second, we find that
Chinese multilateral trade flows respond to relative prices -- as represented by a trade weighted exchange
rate -- but the relationship is not always precisely estimated. In addition, the direction of the effects
is sometimes different from what is expected a priori. For instance, Chinese ordinary imports actually
rise in response to a RMB depreciation; however, Chinese exports appear to respond to RMB depreciation
in the expected manner, as long as a supply variable is included. In that sense, Chinese trade is not
exceptional. Furthermore, Chinese trade with the United States appears to behave in a standard manner
-- especially after the expansion in the Chinese manufacturing capital stock is accounted for. Thus,
the China-US trade balance should respond to real exchange rate and relative income movements in
the anticipated manner. However, in neither the case of multilateral nor bilateral trade flows should
one expect quantitatively large effects arising from exchange rate changes. And, of course, these results
are not informative with regard to the question of how a change in the RMB/USD exchange rate would
affect the overall US trade deficit. Finally, we stress the fact that considerable uncertainty surrounds
both our estimates of RMB misalignment and the responsiveness of trade flows to movements in exchange
rates and output levels. In particular, the results for trade elasticities are sensitive to econometric specification,
accounting for supply effects, and for the inclusion of time trends.

1. Introduction

China – and Chinese economic policy – has loomed large on the global economic stage in recent

years. Yet, even as arguments over the normalcy of the Chinese trade balance and the value of

the Chinese currency continue, there is substantial debate in both academic and policy circles

surrounding what are the determinants of these variables.

       Interestingly, there are very few studies that simultaneously assess the Chinese exchange

rate and trade/current account balance. This is partly an outcome of the peculiar characteristics of

the Chinese economy. In this study, we attempt to inform the debate over the interactions

between the exchange rate and the current account by recourse to two key methodologies. First

we identify the equilibrium real exchange rate from the standpoint of cross-country studies.

Second, we attempt to obtain more precise estimates of Chinese trade elasticities, both on a

multilateral and bilateral (with the US) basis. In doing so, we hope to transcend the current

limited debate based upon rules-of-thumb.

       To anticipate our results, we obtain several interesting findings. First, the RMB is

substantially below the value predicted by our cross-country estimates. The economic magnitude

of the mis-alignment is substantial – on the order of 50% in log terms. However, we also find

that the misalignment is typically not statistically significant, in the sense of being more than one

standard error away from the conditional mean. Moreover, substantial revisions to the underlying

data provide even more reason to be circumspect about estimates of currency misalignment.

       Second, we find that Chinese multilateral trade flows do respond to relative prices – as

represented by a trade weighted exchange rate – but that that relationship is not always precisely

estimated. In addition, the direction of effects is different than expected a priori. For instance, we

find that Chinese ordinary imports rise in response to a RMB depreciation. However, Chinese




                                                  1
exports do appear to respond to RMB depreciation in the expected manner, as long as a supply

variable is included. So, in this sense, Chinese trade is not exceptional.

        Furthermore Chinese trade with the US appears to behave in a standard manner –

especially after the expansion in the Chinese manufacturing capital stock is accounted for. Thus,

the China-US trade balance should respond to real exchange rate and relative income movements

in the anticipated manner. However, in neither the case of multilateral nor bilateral trade flows

should one expect quantitatively large effects arising from exchange rate changes. And of course,

our results are not informative with regard to the question of how a change in the RMB/USD

exchange rate would affect the overall US trade deficit.

        Finally, we highlight the fact that considerable uncertainty surrounds both our estimates

of RMB misalignment and the responsiveness of trade flows to movements in exchange rates and

output levels. In particular, our results for trade elasticities are sensitive to econometric

specification, accounting for supply effects, and the inclusion of time trends.



2. Placing Matters in Perspective

A discussion of the Chinese economy, and its interaction with the global economy, is necessarily

complicated, in large part because of its recent – and incomplete – transition from a central

command economy to a market economy.1

        Take for instance the proper measure of the exchange rate in both nominal and real terms,

the central relative prices in any open macroeconomy. Figure 1 depicts the official bilateral value

of the Chinese currency over the last twenty years. Taking the standard approach in the crisis

early warning system literature, one can calculate the extent of exchange rate overvaluation as a
1
  See Cheung, Chinn and Fujii (2007a) for discussion of various issues related to the
transformation of the Chinese economy.



                                                   2
deviation from a trend. Adopting this approach in the case of China would not lead to a very

satisfactory result. Consider first what a simple examination of the bilateral real exchange rate

between the US and the RMB implies. In Figure 1, the rate is expressed so higher values

constitute a weaker Chinese currency. Over the entire sample period, the RMB has experienced a

downward trend in value.

       However, as with the case with economies experience transitions from controlled to

partially decontrolled capital accounts and from dual to unified exchange rate regimes, there is

some dispute over what exchange rate measure to use. In the Chinese case, an argument can be

made that, with a portion of transactions taking place at swap rates, the 1994 “mega-devaluation”

was actually better described as a unification of different rates of exchange. Figure 2 shows the

official rate (the solid line) at which some transactions took place, and a floating rate -- often

called the “swap-market rate” -- shown with the thick dashed line. Using a transactions-weighted

average of these two rates (called the “adjusted rate”) yields a substantially different profile for

the RMB’s path, with a substantially different (essentially flat) trend, as depicted in Figure 3.2

       The trade-weighted exchange rate is arguably more relevant. Figure 4 depicts the IMF’s

effective exchange rate index (logged), and a linear trend estimated over the available sample of

1986-2008M09. Following the methodology outlined in Chinn (2000a), Cheung et al.

(forthcoming) test for cointegration of the nominal (trade weighted) exchange rate and the

relative price level. We find that there is evidence for cointegration of these two variables, with

the posited coefficients. This means that we can use this trend line as a statistically valid

indication of the mean value which the real exchange rate series reverts to. Interestingly,

repeating this procedure for the more recent period yields a 14.2% overvaluation in 2008M09.

  See Fernald, Edison and Loungani (1999) for a discussion, in the context of whether the 1994
“devaluation” caused the 1997-98 currency crises.



                                                  3
       It is obviously an understatement to say that the Chinese current and trade accounts have

elicited substantial interest in policy and academic circles over the past few years, in part because

of the apparent break in the behavior of these flows. Figure 5 shows the current account balance

expressed in dollar terms and as a share of GDP. Clearly, the Chinese current account balance

has ballooned in recent years, sparking the debate over the “normalcy” and propriety of a large

emerging market running such a large surplus. Of course, normalcy is in the eye of the beholder.

Chinn and Ito (2007) argue that China’s current account surplus over the 2000-04 period – while

exceeding the predicted value – was within the statistical margin of error, according to a model

of the current account based upon the determinants of saving and investment.3

       The current account balance is driven largely by the trade balance.4 Figure 6 shows the

trade balance in dollar terms. Until about 2004, the Chinese trade account was in rough balance,

with deficits against other countries offsetting a trade surplus with the United States.

       This brings us to one interesting aspect of the Chinese experience – the fact that such a

large portion of the Chinese surplus is accounted for by the United States. Figure 6 also shows

the bilateral surplus with the United States, highlighting the fact that the behavior of overall

Chinese trade balances differs substantially from that of the China-US trade balance.5 This

divergence reflects in part China’s role in the global supply chain.


3
  Chinn and Ito’s analysis is based upon the Chinn and Prasad (2003) approach to estimating the
“normal” level of a current account balance, using as fundamentals the budget balance, per capita
income, demographic variables, and various other control variables.
4
  Although the gap has increased in recent years, with the current account exceeding the trade
balance as income on China’s increasing foreign exchange reserves offsets income payments to a
greater and greater extent.
5
  Note in this figure, we have used the Chinese measure of the China-US trade balance, which
differs from the US measure, due to both differences in valuation measures and treatment of re-
exports via Hong Kong.



                                                  4
         It is because of this disjuncture between some of the measures of equilibrium exchange

rates and the behavior of the external accounts that we adopt the procedure of examining first a

model of the equilibrium exchange rate, and then – taking the exchange rate as largely

exogenous – estimating the responsiveness of trade flows to the various macroeconomic

variables in a partial equilibrium framework.



3. The Chinese equilibrium exchange rate



3.1 An overview of approaches

         Several surveys have compared the estimates of the degree to which the RMB is

misaligned. GAO (2005) provides a comparison of the academic and policy literature, while

Cairns (2005b) briefly surveys recent point estimates obtained by different analysts. Here, we

review the literature to focus primarily on the economic and econometric distinctions associated

with the various analyses. We also restrict our attention to those studies conducted in recent

years.

         Many of these papers fall into familiar categories, either relying upon some form of

relative purchasing power parity (PPP) or cost competitiveness calculation, the modeling of

deviations from absolute PPP, a composite model incorporating several channels of effects

(sometimes called behavioral equilibrium exchange rate models), or flow equilibrium models.

Table 1 provides a typology of these approaches, further disaggregated by the data dimension

(cross section, time series or both).

         The relative PPP comparisons are the easiest to make, in terms of calculations. However,

relative PPP in levels requires the cointegration of the relevant price indices with the nominal




                                                 5
exchange rate (or, equivalently, the stationarity of the real exchange rate), but these conditions

do not necessarily hold, and are seldom tested for. Wang (2004) reports some IMF estimates of

unit labor cost deflated RMB. This series has appreciated in real terms since 1997; of course, this

comparison, like all other comparisons based upon indices, depends upon selecting a year that is

deemed to represent equilibrium. Selecting a year before 1992 would imply that the RMB has

depreciated over time.

       Bosworth (2004), Frankel (2006), Coudert and Couharde (2005), and Cairns (2005b)

estimate the relationship between the deviation from absolute PPP and relative per capita

income. All obtain similar results regarding the relationship between the two variables, although

Coudert and Couharde fail to detect this link for the RMB.

       Wang (2004) and Funke and Rahn (2007) implement what could broadly be described as

behavioral equilibrium exchange rate (BEER) specifications. These models incorporate a variety

of channels through which the real exchange rate is affected. Since each author selects different

variables to include, the implied misalignments will necessarily vary, as discussed in Dunaway et

al. (2006), as well as McCown et al. (2007).

       A different set of approaches eschews the price-based approaches, and views the current

account as the residual of savings and investment behavior. The equilibrium exchange rate is

derived from the implied medium term current account using import and export elasticities. In

the IMF’s “macroeconomic approach”, the norms are estimated. Coudert and Couharde (2005)

implement a closely related approach for China.

       A final set of approaches, popular in the policy arena, focuses on the persistent

components of the balance of payments (Goldstein, 2004; Bosworth, 2004). This last set of

approaches – what we will term the external accounts approach – is perhaps most useful for




                                                  6
conducting short-term analyses. But the wide dispersion in implied misalignments reflects the

difficulties in making judgments about what constitutes persistent capital flows. For instance,

Prasad and Wei (2005), examining the composition of capital inflows into and out of China,

argue that much of the reserve accumulation that has occurred in the period before the current

account surge was due to speculative inflow; hence, the degree of misalignment was small. That

assessment has been viewed as less applicable as the current account balance has surged in the

past two years.6

       Two observations regarding these various estimates are of interest. First, as noted by

Cairns (2005a), there is an interesting relationship between the particular approach adopted by a

study and the degree of misalignment found. Analyses implementing relative PPP and related

approaches indicate the least misalignment. Those adopting approaches focusing on the external

accounts yield estimates that are in the intermediate range. Finally, studies implementing an

absolute PPP methodology result in the greatest degree of estimated undervaluation.

       Given that the last approach is the most straightforward in terms of implementation, we

adopt it, cognizant of the tendency of this approach to maximize the estimated extent of

misalignment.



3.2 A Framework

The key problem with explaining the Chinese exchange rate and current account imbalance is

that China deviates substantially from cross-country norms for at least its currency value.

       Following Cheung et al. (2007b), we exploit a well-known relationship between

deviations from absolute purchasing power parity and real per capita income using panel
6
  In addition, such flow-based measures must be conditioned on the existence of capital controls,
the durability and effectiveness of which must necessarily be a matter of judgment.



                                                 7
regression methods. By placing the RMB in the context of this well-known empirical

relationship exhibited by a large number of developing and developed countries, over a long time

horizon, this approach addresses the question of where China’s real exchange rate stands relative

to the “equilibrium” level. In addition to calculating the numerical magnitude of the degree of

misalignment, we assess the estimates in the context of statistical uncertainty. In this respect, we

extend the standard practice of considering both economic and statistical significance in

coefficient estimates to the prediction aspect.

        The “price level” variable in the Penn World Tables (Summers and Heston, 1991), and

other purchasing power parity exchange rates, attempt to circumvent measurement problems

arising from heterogeneity in goods baskets across countries by using prices (not price indices)

of goods, and calculating the aggregate price level using the same weights. Assume for the

moment that this can be accomplished, but that some share of the basket (α) is nontradable

(denoted by N subscript), and the remainder is tradable (denoted by T subscript). Then:

         pt = αp N ,t + (1 − α ) pT ,t                                                                (1)

By simple manipulation, one finds that the “real exchange rate” is given by:

        qt ≡ st − pt + pt* = ( st − pT ,t + pT* ,t ) − α [ p N ,t − pT ,t ] + α [ p*N ,t − pT* ,t ]   (2)

Rewriting, and indicating the first term in (parentheses), the intercountry price of tradables, as

qT ,t and the intercountry relative price of nontradables as ωt ≡ [ pN ,t − pT ,t ] − [ p*N ,t − pT* ,t ] , leads

to the following rewriting of (2):

        qt = qT ,t − αω t                                                                             (2’)




                                                                   8
This expression indicates that the real exchange rate can appreciate as changes occur in the

relative price of traded goods between countries, or as the relative price of nontradables rises in

one country, relative to another. In principle, economic factors can affect one or both.

       Models that center on the relative price of nontradables include the well-known

approaches of Balassa (1964) and Samuelson (1964). In those instances, the relative price of

nontradables depends upon sectoral productivity differentials, as in Hsieh (1982), Canzoneri,

Cumby and Diba (1999), and Chinn (2000b.). They also include those approaches that include

demand side determinants of the relative price, such as that of DeGregorio and Wolf (1994), who

observe that if consumption preferences are not homothetic and factors are not perfectly free to

move intersectorally, changes in per capita income may result shifts in the relative price of

nontradables.

       This perspective provides the key rationale for the well-known positive cross-sectional

relationship between relative price (the inverse of q, i.e., -q) and relative per capita income

levels. We exploit this relationship to determine whether the Chinese currency is undervalued.

Obviously, this approach is not novel; it has been implemented recently by Frankel (2006) and

Coudert and Couharde (2005). However, we will expand this approach along several dimensions.

First, we augment the approach by incorporating the time series dimension.7 Second, we

explicitly characterize the uncertainty surrounding our determinations of currency misalignment.

Third, we examine the stability of the relative price and relative per capita income relationship

using a) subsamples of certain country groups and time periods, and b) control variables.




7
  Coudert and Couharde (2005) implement the absolute PPP regression on a cross-section, while
their panel estimation relies upon estimating the relationship between the relative price level to
relative tradables to nontradables price indices.



                                                  9
3.3 The Basic Bivariate Results: Using the 2007 Vintage Data

       We compile a large data set encompassing up to 160 countries over the 1975-2005

period. Most of the data are drawn from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators

(WDI). Because some data are missing, the panel is unbalanced. The Data Appendix provides

greater detail on the data used.

       Extending Frankel’s (2006) cross-section approach, we estimate the real exchange rate-

income relationship using a pooled time-series cross-section (OLS) regression, where all

variables are expressed in terms relative to the US;

        rit = β 0 + β1 yit + uit ,                                                     (5)

where r = -q is expressed in real terms relative to the US price level, y is per capita income also

relative to the US.8 The results are reported in the first two columns of Table 2, for cases in

which we measure relative per capita income in either USD exchange rates or PPP-based

exchange rates.

       One characteristic of estimating a pooled OLS regression is that it forces the intercept

term to be the same across countries, and assumes that the error term is distributed identically

over the entire sample. Because this is something that should be tested, rather than assumed, we

also estimated random effects and fixed effects regressions. The former assumes that the

individual specific error is uncorrelated with the right hand side variables, while the latter is

efficient when this correlation is non-zero.9


8
        β0 can take on currency specific values if a fixed effects specification is implemented.
Similarly, the error term is composed of a currency specific and aggregate error if the pooled
OLS specification is dropped. Note that this analysis differs from that in Cheung et al. (2007b),
in that we use an updated and revised data set, and exclude China from the regression.
9
       Since the price levels being used are comparable across countries, in principle there is no
need to incorporate country-specific constants as in fixed effects or random effects regressions.


                                                  10
       Random effects regressions do not yield substantially different results from those

obtained using pooled OLS. Interestingly, when allowing the within and between coefficients to

differ, we do find differing effects. In particular, with US$ based per capita GDP, the within

effect is much stronger than the between. This divergence is likely picking up short term effects,

where output growth is correlated with other variables pushing up currency values. This pattern,

however, is not present in results derived from the PPP-based output data.

       Interestingly, the estimated elasticity of the price level with respect to per capita income

does not appear to be particularly sensitive to measurements of per capita income. In all cases,

the elasticity estimate is always around 0.26-0.39, which compares favorably with Frankel’s

(2006) 1990 and 2000 year cross-section estimates of 0.38 and 0.32, respectively.10

       One of the key emphases of our analysis is the central role accorded the quantification of

the uncertainty surrounding the estimates. That is, in addition to estimating the economic

magnitude of the implied misalignments, we also assess whether the implied misalignments are

statistically different from zero. In Figure 7, we plot the actual and resulting predicted (inverse)

rates and standard error bands derived from the PPP-based data. The results pertaining to US$

based per capita GDP data are qualitatively similar and, thus, are not reported for brevity.

       It is interesting to consider the path that the RMB has traced out Figure 7. It begins the

sample as overvalued, and over the next three decades it moves toward the predicted equilibrium

value and then overshoots, so that by 2005-06, it is substantially undervalued by about 60% in



In addition, fixed effects estimates are biased in the presence of serial correlation, which is
documented in the subsequent analysis.
10
        Note that, in addition to differences in the sample, our estimates differ from Frankel’s in
that we measure each country’s (logged) real GDP per capita in terms relative to the US rather
than in absolute terms.



                                                 11
log terms (50% in absolute terms).11 It is indeed a puzzle that the RMB path is different from the

one predicted by the Balassa-Samuelson hypothesis. In comparing the observations at 1975 and

2004, we found that countries including Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore also experienced an

increase in their income but a decrease in their relative price level. On the other hand, Japan – a

country typically used to illustrate the Balassa-Samuelson effect, has a positive relative price

level – income relationship. We reserve further analysis for future study.

          In this context, we make two observations about these estimated misalignments. First, the

RMB has been persistently undervalued by this criterion since the mid-1980s, even in 1997 and

1998, when China was lauded for its refusal to devalue its currency despite the threat to its

competitive position.

          Second, and perhaps most importantly, in 2005, the RMB was more than one standard

error—but less than two standard errors—away from the predicted value, which in the present

context is interpreted as the “equilibrium” value. In other words, by the standard statistical

criterion that applied economists commonly appeal to, the RMB is not undervalued (as of 2005)

in a statistically significant sense. Similarly, we could not assert that the estimated degree of

undervaluation is statistically significant in 2006. The wide dispersion of observations in the

scatter plots should give pause to those who would make strong statements regarding the exact

degree of misalignment.

          In Cheung et al. (2007b), we extended this analysis to allow for heterogeneity across

country groupings (industrial versus less developed, high versus low, and regional) and time

periods. After conducting various robustness checks, we conclude that although the point

estimates indicate the RMB is undervalued in almost all samples, in almost no case is the

     The deviations in Figure 7 are somewhat smaller – 55% in log terms (42% in absolute terms).



                                                  12
deviation statistically significant, and indeed, when serial correlation is accounted for, the extent

of misalignment is not even statistically significant at the 50% level. These findings highlight the

great degree of uncertainty surrounding empirical estimates of “equilibrium real exchange rates,”

thereby underscoring the difficulty in accurately assessing the degree of RMB undervaluation.

        Notice that the deviations from the conditional mean are persistent; that is, deviations

from the real exchange rate - income relationship identified by the regression are persistent, or

exhibit serial correlation. This has an important implication for interpreting the degree of

uncertainty surrounding these measures of misalignment. Frankel (2006) makes a similar

observation, noting that half of the deviation of the RMB from the 1990 conditional mean exists

in 2000. We estimate the autoregressive coefficient in our sample at approximately 0.95 (derived

from PPP-based per capita income figures) on an annual basis. A simple, ad hoc adjustment

based upon the latter estimate suggests that the standard error of the regression should be

adjusted upward by a factor equal to [1/(1- ρ̂ 2 )]0.5 ≈ 2. After controlling for serial correlation, the

actual value of the RMB is always within one standard error prediction interval surrounding the

(predicted) equilibrium value in the last 20 plus years! Combining this result and the large data

dispersion observed in Figure 7, it is clear that the data are not sufficiently informative for

making a sharp inferences regarding misalignment – not just for the recent period but for the

entire sample period.12



3.4 The Basic Specification Updated: The 2008 Vintage Data




12
  The discussant, Jeffrey Frankel, has observed that the 5% significance level might be too high
a hurdle to jump for policy purposes. Even when reducing the significance levels to 40%, we
would not reject the no-undervalation null hypothesis, after accounting for serial correlation.



                                                   13
       Recently, the World Bank reported new estimates of China’s GDP and price level in

2005, measured in PPP terms. These estimates, based on the International Comparison Project’s

work, incorporated new benchmark data on prices. The end result was to reduce China’s

estimated GDP per capita by about 40%, and increasing the estimated price level by the same

amount. 13 Using the updated data one finds that China’s 2005 observation lying essentially on

the regression line, highlighted as “New China 2005” in Figure 7. In other words, the new

estimates erase our estimated undervaluation.

       However, taking proper account of this issue involves a slightly more involved approach.

This is because data for many countries were substantially revised as well. This means that we

need to re-estimate the regressions. We report these results in Table 3.

       Focusing on the PPP based data, one finds that the pooled OLS results indicate a smaller

impact of income on relative price levels than obtained using the earlier data. The coefficient

drops from 0.3 to 0.2. In fixed effects regressions, the between coefficient drops while the within

rises. Given the change in the sample period and the change in the estimated coefficients, one

would not be too surprised to find the estimated misalignments change. However, the magnitude

of the change in the implied misalignment for the RMB is surprising. Essentially, as of 2006,

there is no significant misalignment, in either the economic or statistical sense. The

undervaluation is on the order of 10% in log terms, and the maximal undervaluation is in 1993.14


13
  Statistics from Asian Development Bank (2007). See also Elekdag and Lall (2008) and
International Comparison Program (2007) for discussion.
14
  We also estimated (3) using the year-by-year cross-section regression method. The implied
pattern of RMB misalignment is comparable with the one discussed above. For instance, RMB is
found to be overvalued before the 1980s, display a large amount of undervaluation from the late
1980s to 2004, and be slightly overvalued in 2005. All these year-by-year cross-section estimates
of the degree of undervaluation are not statistically significant. The average of these year-by-year
undervaluation estimates from 1975 to 2005 is 15.5%. The value is similar to the undervaluation
estimate of 16% reported in Arvind Subramanian (2008), who obtains his estimate based upon


                                                 14
       This outcome is clearly illustrated in Figure 8, where we present the scatterplot of the

price level against per capita income, but utilizing the most recent data. These figures summarize

our basic finding: namely that the substantial misalignment – on the order of 40% – detected in

our previous analysis disappears in this analysis.15

       One might take this development as justification for our earlier conclusions that the

statistical evidence for undervaluation was misplaced. However, our confidence bands were

drawn based upon sampling uncertainty. The revision in China’s position reflects measurement

error, which we did not take into account in our previous analysis.

       The seemingly ephemeral nature of our undervaluation estimate reinforces the point that

we have only investigated one approach of the several laid out in Table 1. Our discussant has

observed that other indicators also inform the debate over whether the Renminbi is misaligned.

The burgeoning trade surplus and reserves accumulation, as well as the rapid growth rate

(exceeding what is widely perceived as the sustainable rate), point to an undervalued currency, at

least conditional upon the level of other policy variables.

       We would not disagree with the view that multiple approaches should be used to assess

currency misalignment. In that respect, we have somewhat more evidence for Renminbi

undervaluation than one would gain from merely looking at the Penn effect, especially as the

revised PPP data have cast into doubt our estimates of misalignment.




the methodology outlined in Johnson et al. (2007). We believe utilizing panel regression – as we
do – and focusing specifically on the most recent period provides a more accurate assessment of
the current degree of currency misalignment.
15
  We have not controlled for additional effects in these regressions. However, our basic results
do not change with the inclusion of other variables including demographics and institutional
factors. See Cheung et al. (2009).



                                                 15
         Nonetheless, to the extent that almost all such estimates indicate quantitatively substantial

undervaluation, and sustained deviation from the price line, we are willing to consider the

possibility that the real rate can be controlled for sustained periods of time. Taking the real

exchange rate as somewhat exogenous, we can then plausibly consider the effects of changes in

the renminbi’s value on Chinese trade flows.



4. A closer look at trade elasticities

4.1 Survey of trade elasticity estimates

The extant literature documenting the price of income responsiveness of Chinese trade flows is

relatively small, and given the rapid pace of structural transformation, some of the earlier studies

spanning the transition period is of limited relevance.

         With respect to Chinese multilateral trade elasticities, there are few academic studies.

One widely cited estimate from Goldman Sachs is for a Chinese export price elasticity of 0.2 and

an import price elasticity of 0.5.16 Presumably, similar estimates underlie Goldstein’s (2004)

calculations, although they are not reported.

         Kwack et al. (2007) uses a gravity model augmented with a CPI deflated real exchange

rate to estimate elasticities over the 1984 to 2003 period. Using a panel of 29 developed and

developing countries, he obtains a Chinese multilateral import price elasticity of 0.50 and an

income elasticity of 1.57.17

         Thorbecke and Smith (2007) do not directly examine the implications for both imports

and exports, but do focus on the impact of RMB appreciation on exports, taking into account the

16
     O’Neill and Wilson (2003) as cited in Morrison and Labonte (2006).
17
  Wang and Ji (2006) adopt a related approach, and find essentially zero effect of nominal
exchange rates on Chinese imports and exports.



                                                  16
integration of the production chain in the region. Using a sample of 33 countries over the 1994-

2005 period, and a trade-weighted exchange rate that measures the impact of how bilateral

exchange rates affect imported input prices, they find that a 10% RMB appreciation in the

absence of changes in other East Asian currencies would result in a 3% decline in processed

exports and an 11% decline in ordinary exports. If other East Asian currencies appreciated in line

with the RMB, then the resulting change in the processed exports would be 9%.

        Marquez and Schindler (forthcoming) argue that the absence of useful price indices for

Chinese imports and exports requires the adoption of an alternative model specification. They

treat the variable of interest as world (import or export) trade shares, broken down into

“ordinary” and “parts and components”. Using monthly Chinese imports data from 1997 to July

2006, they find ordinary trade-share income “elasticities” ranging from -0.021 to -0.001 (i.e., the

coefficients are in the wrong direction), and price “elasticities” from 0.013 to 0.021.18 The parts

and components price elasticities are in the wrong direction, and statistically significantly so.

Interestingly, the stock of FDI matters in almost all cases. Since the FDI stock is a smooth trend,

it is not clear whether to attribute the effect explicitly to the effect of FDI, or to other variables

that may be trending upward over time, including productive capacity.

        For export shares (ordinary goods), they find income elasticities ranging from 0.08 to

0.09, and price elasticities ranging from 0.08 to 0.068. For parts and components export share,

the income coefficient ranges from a 0.042 to 0.049. Their preferred specification implies that a

ten-percent real appreciation of the Chinese RMB reduces the Chinese trade balance between

$75 billion and $92 billion.


18
  Marquez and Schindler (2007) conjecture that this counterintuitive result arises from the role
of state owned enterprises. They also observe that this result can occur under certain
configurations of substitutability between imported and domestic goods.



                                                   17
        Garcia-Herrero and Koivu (2007) come closest to our approach. They examine data over

the 1995-2005 period, breaking the data into ordinary and processing/parts imports and exports.

They relate Chinese exports to the world imports and the real effective exchange rate, augmented

by a proxy measure for the value-added tax rebate on exports, and a capacity utilization variable.

In both import and export equations, the stock of FDI is included. One notable result they obtain

is that for Chinese imports, the real exchange rate coefficient has a sign opposite of anticipated in

the full sample.

        One particularly interesting result they obtain is that post-WTO entry, Chinese income

and price elasticities for exports rise considerably. On the import side, no such change is obvious

with respect to the pre- and post-WTO period.

        In the bilateral vein, Mann and Plück (2007) investigate China-US trade. Using an error

correction model specification applied to disaggregate bilateral data over the 1980-2004 period,

they find extremely high income elasticities for US imports from China: for capital and

consumer goods the estimated long run income elasticities are 10 and 4, respectively. The

consumer good price elasticity is not statistically significant, while the capital good elasticity is

implausibly high, around 10.19 On the other hand, US exports to China have a relatively low

income elasticity of 0.74 and 2.25 for capital and consumer goods, respectively. The price

elasticity estimates are not statistically significant. In general, they have difficulty obtaining

sensible coefficient estimates.

        Thorbecke (2006) examines aggregate bilateral US-China data over the 1988-2005

period. Using both the Johansen maximum likelihood method, as well as the Stock-Watson


19
  Mann and Plück (2007) use disaggregate UStrade flow and price index data from BEA. The
reported income elasticities are for matched expenditure series, e.g., investment activity as the
income variable in a regression involving capital goods.



                                                  18
(1993) dynamic OLS methodology, he finds statistically significant evidence of cointegration

between incomes, real exchange rates and CPI-deflated trade flows.

       US imports from China have a real exchange rate elasticity ranging from 0.4 to 1.28

(depending upon the number of leads and lags in the DOLS specification). The income elasticity

ranges between 0.26 to 4.98. In all instances, substitution with ASEAN trade flows is accounted

for by the inclusion of an ASEAN/Dollar real exchange rate. Interestingly, the income elasticities

are not statistically significant, even when quantitatively large. For US exports to China, he

obtains exchange rate elasticities ranging from 0.42 to 2.04, and income elasticities ranging from

1.05 to 1.21.



4.2 Multilateral trade elasticities


       First, let us consider Chinese trade flows with respect to the rest-of-the-world. We

estimate the following equations, where the designations import and export are from the Chinese

perspective,

        ext = β 0 + β 1 y t* + β 2 qt + β 3 z t + u1,t ,               (4)

and

        imt = γ 0 + γ 1 yt + γ 2 qt + γ 3 wt + u 2,t ,                 (5)


where y is an activity variable, q is a real exchange rate (defined conventionally, so that a rise is

a depreciation), and z is a supply side variable. The variable w is a shift variable accounting for

other factors that might increase import demand. The equations are estimated using the Stock-

Watson (1993) dynamic OLS regression method with two leads and lags of first differences of

the right hand side variables.



                                                           19
       For the dependent variables, we have collected data on Chinese exports and imports from

as early as 1980, to 2006, on a monthly basis. These data are in turn broken into ordinary and

processing and parts trade flows. The multilateral data is sourced from Chinese Customs via

CEIC. Import data are on a c.i.f. basis, while export data are f.o.b. We convert the monthly data

into quarterly by simple averaging. These series are depicted in figures 9 and 10.

       One particularly difficult issue involves price deflators. Until 2005, the Chinese did not

report price indices for imports and exports. This limitation explains Marquez and Schindler’s

(forthcoming) reliance on a trade share variable. We attempt to circumvent this difficulty in a

different manner, by relying on several proxy measures. Since the trade flows are reported in US

dollars, the price measures we consider include the US CPI-all, the PPI for finished goods, the

price indices reported by Gaulier, Lemoine and Ünal-Kesenci (2006, hereafter GLÜ-K), both at

the aggregate level, and by stage of production, and finally using the Hong Kong re-export

indices.

       Below we report only the results based upon the PPI, the category-specific GLÜ-K

indices, and the Hong Kong unit value indices; the remaining results are available upon request.

We select these indices (shown in Figures 11-12) mostly on the grounds of pragmatism. The PPI

appears to be a good proxy for tradable goods prices, while the GLU-K indices are carefully

constructed and documented.

       The Hong Kong unit value indices have typically been used in empirical analyses as

proxy measures for Chinese trade (see Cheung, 2005). We use the Hong Kong to China re-export

unit value indices to deflate Chinese imports and the Hong Kong to US re-export unit value

indices to deflate Chinese exports.




                                                20
       The GLU-K indices have the drawback of being available only at the annual frequency,

and then only up to 2004. We have used quadratic interpolation to translate the annual data into

quarterly.

       Our measure of the real exchange rate, q, is the IMF’s CPI deflated trade-weighted index.

For y*, we use rest-of-the-world GDP evaluated in current US dollars, deflated into real terms

using the US GDP deflator, while y is measured using real GDP (production based) expressed in

real 1990 RMB. For z, we assume that supply shifts out with the capital stock in manufacturing.

This capital stock measure was calculated by Bai et al. (2006). This series is extended by

assuming a 12% growth rate in 2005 and 2006, and interpolated to quarterly frequency using

quadratic match averaging.

       In Table 4, we present the results for Chinese exports, with Panel A for aggregate flows,

Panel B for Ordinary exports, and Panel C for Parts and Processing. For each flow, we present

coefficient estimates pertaining to real trade flows calculated using alternative deflators. The

results in column [1] pertains to PPI deflated series, while that in column [2] pertains to that

obtained when deflating with the GLU-K price series, and column [3] pertains to Hong Kong re-

export unit value index deflated series. For now, the z term is suppressed.

       There are two uniformly consistent results in all the regression results reported in Table

4. First, the income variable enters in with a very high (perhaps implausibly high) and

statistically significant coefficient. Second, the real exchange rate enters in with a strongly

negative sign – that is greater RMB depreciation induces less exports.20




20
  In these, and subsequent, estimates, the inclusion of a time trend often results in substantially
different point estimates for the income elasticity. This outcome occurs because Chinese GDP
and rest-of-the-world GDP look similar to a deterministic time trend.



                                                 21
        Since these results seem so counterintuitive, we appeal to a supply shift variable. The

standard imperfect goods model of imports and exports typically relies upon the real exchange

rate index measuring the relative price of traded goods well. However, our exchange rate

measure is the CPI-deflated exchange rate, which may or may not be a good measure of relative

traded goods prices.21 Hence, we add in a measure of the supply side. In line with the approach

adopted in Helkie and Hooper (1988), we use a measure of the Chinese capital stock in

manufacturing.

        The results using this supply variable are quite interesting. As reported in Table 5, the

supply variable coefficient is now the only one that is consistently significant. In addition, the

income and price coefficients now take on more plausible coefficients, even though they are

often not statistically significant.

        In Panel A, overall exports are examined. The only statistically significant coefficients

are on the supply variable. Of course, as suggested by Marquez and Schindler (forthcoming), the

differing behavior of ordinary and processing exports suggests that aggregation is inappropriate.

Panel B reports the results for ordinary exports. Here, one finds that the rest-of-the-world activity

is not a good predictor of exports, while the price variable is an important determinant. Using

either GUL-K or HK indices, one finds that the export elasticity of approximately 0.6. At the

same time, a one percent increase in the Chinese manufacturing capital stock induces between a

2.2 and 2.5% increase in real exports.

        Strangely, the rest-of-the-world GDP does affect positively processing output. Thorbecke

and Smith (2007) argue that Chinese processing output is fairly sophisticated in nature; if so, that

might explain the greater income sensitivity of such exports.
21
  Here we have adjusted the official rate to reflect the fact that many transactions took place
through swap centers during the period leading up to 1994. See Fernald et al. (1999).



                                                 22
        In Table 6, we turn to examining Chinese imports. We rely upon the same breakdown,

with Panel A pertaining to aggregate imports, Panel B to ordinary imports and Panel C to

processing and parts imports.

        Aggregate imports appear to respond strongly to income, and in the expected direction.

On the other hand, we replicate Marquez and Schindler’s results with regard to the price

elasticity. A weaker RMB induces greater imports, rather than less. This is true also for ordinary

imports. Only when moving to parts and processing imports does one obtain some mixed

evidence, and there the results are still toward finding a wrong-signed coefficient.

        The Marquez and Schindler results suggest including a role for foreign direct investment

as our w variable. However, inclusion of a cumulative FDI variable is insufficient to overturn

this result on a consistent basis.

        In Panel D of Table 6, we interpret w as real total exports, in the specification involving

parts and processing imports. Then we obtain a negative estimated elasticity for the real

exchange rate, although the results can hardly be considered robust.

        Given these mixed results, we have to be very careful in interpreting the estimated

elasticities until such time as we have a long time series on Chinese trade prices.




                                                 23
4.3 China-US trade elasticities

In order to examine the behavior of the bilateral China-US trade balance, it is necessary to

modify equations (4) and (5) to take into account the substitutability between Chinese goods and

goods from competing countries. The resulting specifications are given by:

        ext = β 0 + β 1 y t* + β 2 qt + β 3 z t + β 4 q~t + u 3,t ,   (6)

and

        imt = γ 0 + γ 1 y t + γ 2 qt + γ 3 wt + γ 4 q~t + u 4,t ,     (7)




Where qt is the bilateral real exchange rate, and q~t is an effective real exchange rate relative to

China’s other trading partners.

       Two sets of bilateral data are obtained; the first is sourced from the People’s Republic of

China Customs agency, and the second from US Customs. The valuation conventions differ

between the Chinese and US data as does the coverage. These differences are discussed in detail

by Schindler and Beckett (2006). The relevant bilateral series are presented in Figures 13 and 14.

       Now y* is measured using US real GDP (in chained 2000 dollars). qt is calculated by

deflating the Chinese RMB (taking into account the transactions taking place at swap rates pre-

1994) by the Chinese and US CPI. q~t is calculated using time-varying trade-weights based on

Chinese trade flows, and bilateral real exchange rates calculated using CPIs. In the calculation of

trade weights, we omitted Hong Kong, due to the difficulties in interpreting the trade with that

economy.

       Once again, our chief difficulty arises from the absence of an appropriate deflator. BLS

reports a price index for Chinese imports into the US starting from 2004 onward, which affords a

much too short time series for purposes of estimation. While the Chinese import price series has


                                                              24
tracked the import price index for East Asian Newly Industrializing Countries (NICs) over the

period that we have Chinese statistics, it is clearly inappropriate to use the NICs series going

back before June 1997, as China did not move its exchange rate with the other East Asian

countries. Hence, for Chinese exports to the US we use a variety of proxy measures. The first is

the US PPI for all finished goods. The second is a composite measure, that is the reported US

import series for Chinese goods from January 2004 onward, the NICs series from January 2000

to end-2003, and the GLU-K consumer goods index from 1992 to end-1999. The third is the

Hong Kong unit value index for re-exports to the US

        The BLS does not report a price index for US exports to China. Since according to

Chinese statistics, over half of Chinese imports from the US are categorized as machinery and

electrical equipment in 2006, we chose to use as one of our proxies for Chinese import prices,

the US capital goods export price index, in addition to the US PPI. A final proxy measure is the

Hong Kong unit value index for imports from the United States. This means there are three

deflators for each trade flow measure.

        The results for Chinese exports are reported in Table 7. The three left hand side columns

pertain to results obtained using US data, while the three right hand side columns pertain to

results obtained using Chinese data. We do not report results omitting the supply shift variable as

this leads to implausibly high income elasticities.

        The estimated income elasticities based on US data are positive, but not statistically

significant. On the other hand, there is a strong, statistically significant coefficient on the

bilateral real exchange rate. In other words, as the Chinese currency depreciates against the

dollar, Chinese exports to the US increase. In addition, as the Chinese currency depreciates

against its trade partners, it gains a larger share of exports – vis a vis ASEAN and other




                                                  25
economies – to the US22 However, this estimated effect is not particularly large and is nowhere

near statistical significance. Finally, the supply shift variable comes in with a large positive and

statistically significant coefficient.

          Interestingly, when we use Chinese data, we obtain a negative coefficient on US income

(significant in one instance). The other results remain intact, however. Hence, we can be

reasonably confident that the bilateral real exchange rate does have an effect on bilateral trade

flows.

          Which set of estimates should we place more weight on? Since Schindler and Beckett

(2006) argue that most of the error in calculating trade balances is attributable to China’s

inability to identify correctly the destination of Chinese exports trans-shipped through Hong

Kong, we believe the results based on US data are of greater reliability, at least insofar as

Chinese exports are concerned. For Chinese imports of US goods, Chinese data may be more

reliable.23

          In contrast to the results obtained for Chinese exports to the US, Chinese imports from

the US are relatively well explained by Chinese income and – at least for US data -- the real

exchange rate. Both elasticities are statistically significant and in the anticipated direction when

using US data. However, the Chinese exchange rate relative to other trading partners once again

do not enter in with any sort of recognizable pattern. Despite the similarity in the time series

behavior of the US and Chinese data, when the latter are used, the coefficient on the bilateral real

exchange rate is no longer statistically significant, nor is the sign negative.

4.4 Policy Implications of the Estimates

There are some complications in drawing out the policy implications of these regression

estimates. First, it is clear that the estimates are not robust to specification. Second, some of the

key point estimates are not statistically significant. Third, some of the point estimates – when

statistically significant – are counter-intuitive. In particular, the results pertaining to import

elasticities are problematic.

        For instance, consider a 10% appreciation. Using the point estimates from Table 5,

column 3 of Panels B and C for exports, one finds that Chinese real exports (in 2000$) decline

from 952.3 billion (recorded in 2006) to 927.4 in the long run. On the other hand, using column 3

estimates from Panels B and D from Table 6, one finds that Chinese imports fall also decline,

from 581.6 billion to 510.5 billion. This means that the trade balance increases from 400.9

billion to 416.9 billion, in response to a 10% real appreciation. (Note that parts and processing

imports fall as total exports rise.)

        The ordinary goods import price elasticity estimate of +2.6 drives this result. Alternative

econometric specifications lead to different estimates. For instance, using a single equation error

correction model, allowing for coefficient shifts with Chinese accession to WTO, leads to a

statistically insignificant estimate of the price elasticity. In the 2000-06 period, the implied price

elasticity is zero. Using this point estimate, then a 10% appreciation would actually lead to a

shrinkage of the trade balance from 400.9 billion to 355.2 billion. This estimate of 45.7 billion

(2000$) is somewhat less than the $88.6 billion current dollars reported in Marquez and

Schindler (forthcoming).

       Although the China-US trade balance is not, macroeconomically speaking, very

interesting, for political reasons it has taken on heightened visibility.24 We can apply our

estimates to answering the question of what would happen in response to a 10% appreciation of

the RMB against the USD. Since both export and import and price elasticities are approximately

unity (see column 3 in Tables 7 and 8), this implies the China-US trade balance would respond

fairly strongly to RMB appreciation. Assuming unitary elasticities, the 2006 trade balance of

229.3 billion (2000$) would fall to 195.9 billion, or by 33.4 billion. Of course, this does not

mean that the overall US trade deficit would shrink. In fact, the deficit could be re-allocated to

other countries, even as the Chinese surplus with the US fell.

       Interestingly, our estimate is not that far away from Thorbecke’s (2006) estimate of a

long run decrease of 29 billion dollars in response to a 10% appreciation in 2005.

       The ex-US trade weighted exchange rate ( q~ ) should capture the effect of the changes in

the value of the RMB relative to the currencies of other countries that also export to the US.

Unfortunately, the point estimate is not statistically significant at conventional levels. Hence, one

can take the foregoing calculation in either of two ways. First, it assumes that the RMB moves

against the US dollar, while holding its position relative to its trading partners constant – that is

other countries aside from the US move their currencies in line with China’s. Second, the other

country effect is absent.

5. Concluding Thoughts

This study has aimed to illuminate some of the determinants of the Chinese exchange rate and

China’s external balance. In documenting the empirical record, we have highlighted one



24
  See for instance Frankel and Wei’s (2007) analysis of determinants of Treasury’s decisions
regarding currency manipulators.


                                                  28
particularly important fact: that many of the empirical relationships that can be identified are of a

tenuous nature.

          Turning first to the real value of the RMB, we reiterate the findings of Cheung et al.

(2007b) – namely that the relationship between real per capita income and the real value of a

currency in purchasing power parity terms is quite diffuse. We can be quite certain that a

relationship exists, but the exact magnitude of the slope coefficient is subject to substantial

uncertainty. And this is even before one adds in model uncertainty and measurement error, the

latter of which has been spectacularly demonstrated as being of consequence . Hence, we cannot

reject the null hypothesis of no undervaluation at conventional levels of statistical significance.

Of course, it is critical to remember that the failure to reject a null is not the same as acceptance

of the null hypothesis.25 Even now, with the benefit of updated Chinese price and income data,

we could also not reject the null that the RMB was 40% undervalued.

          The same characterization applies to our findings regarding trade elasticities, perhaps

even more so than in the case of the exchange rate. That outcome occurs for a number of reasons,

in our view. First, in the approach adopted, we rely solely upon a single country’s data, rather

than appealing to cross-country data. Second, the data pertain to an economy experiencing rapid

structural changes. These structural changes include a rapid build up in the capital stock,

motivating our use of a proxy measure of China’s supply capacity.26

          We also freely acknowledge that our approach, while fully in the spirit of conventional

approach, may miss some important aspects of China’s recent macroeconomic behavior. In

25
     As is cogently discussed in Frankel (1990).
26
   Marquez observes that assuming a constant income elasticity of imports while the import to
GDP ratio increases over time presupposes a very specific behavior for the marginal propensity
to import. An alternative is to impose a constant marginal propensity to import, and retrieving
the implied time-varying income elasticities.


                                                   29
particular, some observers have noted that the decline in import growth during the 2005-06

period was associated with a decline in consumption, which in turn has been driven by a

declining disposable income to GDP ratio and a rising saving to disposable income ratio (IMF,

2006). Since consumption behavior clear affects imports and exports, omission of this factor is

something to be examined in subsequent work.

       With these caveats in mind, we conclude that there is some evidence that Chinese trade

flows respond to changes in real exchange rates – as well as income levels. However, the price

elasticities do not appear reliably estimated, and some estimates are counter-intuitive.

       Our bottom line conclusion regarding the estimated elasticities is that the real exchange

rate effect on overall trade flows – using typical point estimates – is relatively small, and

sometimes goes in the direction opposite of anticipated. Using some plausible estimates, and

zero-ing out perverse estimates, we obtain for a 10% RMB real appreciation a 46 billion (2000$)

reduction in the Chinese trade balance, which while not inconsequential, is still not tremendously

large when measured against a 2006 balance of 401 billion (2000$).

       These findings suggest that exchange rate policy alone will not be sufficient to reduce the

Chinese trade surplus, especially when taken in the context of a trend increase in China’s

manufacturing capacity. Depending upon which specification is selected, slower growth in the

rest-of-the-world could have substantial impact on Chinese exports. With less circumspection,

one can assert that slower growth in the United States would have a substantial impact on the US

trade deficit with China.

Notes: Relative PPP indicates the real exchange rate is calculated using price or cost indices and
no determinants are accounted for. Absolute PPP indicates the use of comparable price deflators
to calculate the real exchange rate. Balassa-Samuelson (with productivity) indicates that the real
exchange rate (calculated using price indices) is modeled as a function of sectoral productivity
levels. BEER indicates composite models using net foreign assets, relative tradable to
nontradable price ratios, trade openness, or other variables. Macroeconomic Balance indicates
cases where the equilibrium real exchange rate is implicit in a “normal” current account (or
combination of current account and persistent capital inflows, for the External Balance
approach). CCF denotes Cheung, Chinn and Fujii.

observations

Notes: The data covers 168 countries over the maximum of a twenty seven-years period from 1980 to
2006. The panel is unbalanced due to some missing observations. ** and * indicate 1% and 5% levels of
significance, respectively. Heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors are given in parentheses underneath
coefficient estimates. For the fixed effects models, the F-test statistics are reported for the null hypothesis
of the equality of the constants across all countries in the sample. For the random effects models, the
Hausman test statistics test for the independence between the time-invariant country-specific effects and
the regressor.
