                                          ABSTRACT

We measure credit risk premia - prices for bearing corporate default risk in excess of expected
default losses - using Markit CDS and Moody’s Analytics EDF data. We find dramatic variation
over time in credit risk premia, with peaks in 2002, during the global financial crisis of 2008-09,
and in the second half of 2011. Even after normalizing these premia by expected default losses,
median credit risk premia fluctuate over time by more than a factor of ten. Credit risk premia
comove with macroeconomic indicators, even after controlling for variation in expected default
losses, with higher premia per unit of expected loss during times of market-wide distress.
Countercyclical variation of premia-to-expected-loss ratios is more pronounced for investment-
grade issuers than for high-yield issuers.

1.    Introduction

     We estimate the level and time variation of corporate credit risk premia, which are the prices
for bearing corporate default risk, in excess of expected default losses. For each firm, we use
credit default swap (CDS) rates to measure the total price for bearing default risk. We define
the associated credit risk premium as the di↵erence between the CDS rate and the expected
rate of loss to protection sellers. This premium compensates sellers of default protection for the
riskiness of their losses. Credit risk premia are magnified by the countercyclicality of default-
timing risk and proportional losses in the event of default. Credit risk premia are also increased
by market illiquidity.
     Figure 1 shows the daily time series of median five-year CDS rates and estimates of their
expected loss components. Our data cover all public U.S. firms for which there are observable
Markit CDS rates and firm-specific default probabilities, as estimated by the Moody’s Analytics
EDF measure. This sample is comprised of almost 1.2 million matched CDS-EDF pairs, and
covers more than 500 firms over the period from 2002 to 2015.
     We find dramatic variation over time in credit risk premia, with peaks in 2002, during the
2008-09 global financial crisis (GFC), and during the second half of 2011. (The last half of 2011
included a component of the European sovereign debt crisis and also the U.S. government’s
“debt-ceiling” crisis.) Daily median premia-to-expected-loss ratios fluctuate between a low of
0.75 in March 2005 and a high of 9.7 in January 2009. In other words, the median net com-
pensation for bearing corporate default risk (above and beyond expected losses), per unit of
expected loss, ranges over time by more than a factor of ten.
     In addition to temporal variation, there are substantial cross-sectional di↵erences in credit
risk premia. Median premia increase from less than 10 basis points of bond principal per year
for Aaa firms to more than 700 basis points for Ca-C firms. Per unit of expected losses, median
premia exhibit a tent shape across the rating spectrum, increasing from 1.4 for Aaa firms to 4.0
for Ba firms before decreasing again to 2.1 for Ca-C firms. Across sectors, median premia-to-
expected-loss ratios are highest for utilities at 8.5, and lowest for financial firms at 0.64.

                                                  2
Figure 1: Median CDS rates and expected default losses The figure shows the daily times series of
median five-year CDS rates (CDS) and median five-year expected losses (ExpL). Only days on which matched
CDS-expected-loss pairs are available for 50 or more firms are shown. The data include about 1.2 million
firm-date pairs for 505 public U.S. firms and cover the period from 2002 to 2015.


   We investigate the extent to which variation in credit risk premia, across firms and over time,
can be explained by variation in firm-specific and macroeconomic variables. Standard asset-
pricing concepts (for instance, Cochrane, 2001) imply that in the absence of market frictions,
and under weak technical conditions, there exists a stochastic discount factor (SDF) process
with the property that the credit risk premium for short-term CDS contracts is approximately
equal to the conditional covariance between default losses and the SDF. For longer-term CDS
contracts, the risk premium is a slightly more complicated function of conditional covariances
between default losses or default indicators in future periods and the SDF (Berndt, 2015).
   These covariances with the SDF are difficult to quantify directly. Theory provides little
guidance on the “correct” specification of the SDF. Moreover, estimation is hampered by the
relative rarity of corporate defaults. As predictors of credit risk premia, we exploit variables that
help explain (i) future default losses or default events, by including expected loss rates, credit
ratings, and implied volatilities; (ii) future changes in the SDF, by incorporating business-cycle


                                                   3
indicators; or (iiii) conditional covariances between the two, for which we include business-cycle
indicators interacted1 with credit ratings. We also examine the explanatory role of proxies for
CDS market liquidity.
       As an alternative perspective on credit risk premia, we also focus on the ratio of the total
CDS rate to the expected rate of default loss. Not only are these CDS-to-expected-loss ratios
more incisive than un-normalized risk premia for the purpose of cross-sectional comparisons,
these ratios also have the technical advantage of always being positive, and hence of having
a well defined logarithm. We show that a sizable fraction of the cross-sectional and temporal
variation of CDS-to-expected-loss ratios—26% in a log-linear setting—is explained by variation
in the underlying expected loss rates. A 10% proportional increase in the expected loss rate is
associated with a 5.4% proportional increase in the corresponding CDS rate, implying that CDS-
to-expected-loss ratios (and hence premium-to-expected-loss ratios) tend to decrease as expected
losses increase. The one-standard-deviation confidence band for a given CDS-to-expected-loss
ratio, however, is wide, at 44% to 226% of the fitted ratio. We show that much of this noise can
be eliminated by controlling for firm fixed e↵ects and time fixed e↵ects.
       We investigate the extent to which these firm and time fixed e↵ects in credit risk premia
can alternatively be captured by observable firm characteristics and macroeconomic indica-
tors. To do so, we build a predictive model for CDS-to-expected-loss ratios that is based on
log-linear panel-data regressions. We argue that a fairly small set of predictor variables, con-
sisting of refined credit ratings and sector dummies, equity-option-implied volatilities, proxies
for investor-clientele e↵ects, interest rates, consumer sentiment, and a CDS market liquidity
measure, achieves nearly the same goodness of fit as that obtained by using firm and time
fixed e↵ects. Indeed, together with expected default losses, these variables capture 82% of the
variation in premia, just shy of the 84% explained by the fixed-e↵ects model.
       For a given firm, a refined credit rating from Moody’s can be defined by raising the firm’s
   1
   Hilscher and Wilson (2017) argue that credit ratings are strongly related to the systematic risk priced in the
CDS market.




                                                       4
alphanumeric credit rating by one notch (for example from Ba2 to Ba1) if the firm is on “positive
outlook” and by two notches if it is on “upgrade watch.”2 Symmetric but opposite adjustments
are made to refined ratings for firms with a negative outlook or on downgrade watch, respectively.
We show that refined ratings are important predictors of cross-sectional variation in credit
spreads, in that higher refined ratings are associated with significantly lower CDS rates, even
after controlling for EDF-based expected losses. In that sense, refined ratings supply a significant
amount of information about relative credit quality across firms.
       We show that both the level and “smirk” of option-implied volatility have significant positive
relationships with CDS rates, even after controlling for expected losses and refined ratings. The
level e↵ect is consistent with volatility risk being priced, in which case credit risk premia should
be higher for more firms whose equity volatilities are higher. The smirk is measured as the ratio
of out-of-the-money to at-the-money put-implied volatilities. This suggests that the volatility
smirk contains information about the cost of insuring against sudden large increases in firm
default risk, which is not surprising given the role of negative jump risk in individual-firm
option smirks, as found by, for example, Van Buskirk (2009).
       We also find a strong negative relationship between credit risk premia and interest rates,
and between credit risk premia and consumer sentiment. The countercyclicality of credit risk
premia tends to be more pronounced for investment-grade firms than for high-yield firms. This
is consistent with the notion that during times of market-wide distress, the supply of risk capital
is reduced across the spectrum of bonds in a manner that does not fully discriminate for credit
quality, resulting in a price for bearing default risk, per unit of default risk to be borne, that is
disproportionately higher for high-quality debt.
       In supporting work, we allow for a range of alternative assumptions that a↵ect our estimators
for a firm’s probability of default (PD) and expected loss given default (LGD). While our results
   2
     These are designations are published by Moody’s Investor Services, which supplied our ratings data. One
of the authors of this study has been a member of the board of directors of Moody’s Corporation since October
2008. These notch refinements compensate somewhat for the fact that credit ratings tend to be stable over time
relative to statistical estimates of default probabilities such as Moody’s EDF measures, which we exploit in this
study.


                                                       5
are robust to alternative LGD specifications, we highlight the importance of the choice of PD
estimators when quantifying the level and variation of credit risk premia. We also compare our
main results for the benchmark five-year maturity to results for longer and shorter maturities.
   Our work extends prior empirical research on default risk premia. Fisher (1959) took a
simple regression approach to explaining yield spreads on corporate debt in terms of various
credit-quality and liquidity related variables. Fons (1987) gave the earliest empirical analysis, to
our knowledge, of the relationship between expected default losses and credit spreads. Driessen
(2005) estimated the relationship between actual and risk-neutral default probabilities, using
U.S. corporate bond price data and assuming that conditional default probabilities are equal
to average historical default frequencies by credit rating. Kavvathas (2001) and others have
shown, however, that for a given firm at a given time, the historical default frequency of firms
of the same rating is a stale and coarse-grained estimator of conditional default probability. At
the same time, Kurbat and Korbalev (2002), Kealhofer (2003) and Bohn, Arora, and Korbalev
(2005) argue that the Moody’s Analytics EDF provides significantly more power to discriminate
among the default probabilities of firms. We therefore use EDFs as our primary measure of
default probabilities. We quantify how measured credit risk premia vary with alternative PD
measures.
   Blanco, Brennan, and Marsh (2005) show that CDS rates represent somewhat fresher price
information than do bond yield spreads. This may be due to the fact that default swaps are “un-
funded exposures,” in the language of dealers, meaning that in order to execute a trade, neither
cash nor the underlying bonds need to be immediately sourced and exchanged. Default swap
rates are therefore less likely to be a↵ected by market illiquidity than are bond yield spreads.
The extent of this di↵erence in liquidity is explored in Longsta↵, Mithal, and Neis (2005).
   While trading frictions in the CDS market seem less severe than those in the underlying
bond market, Bühler and Trapp (2009) find evidence of spillover e↵ects from bond illiquidity to
CDS prices. They argue that, everything else the same, CDS rates increase as the underlying
corporate bonds become more illiquid and, as a result, expected loss given default becomes


                                                 6
larger. Ambrose, Cai, and Helwege (2012), Ellul, Jotikasthira, and Lundblad (2012) and Chen,
Lookman, Schürho↵, and Seppi (2014) analyze the e↵ects of price pressure in corporate bond
markets associated with rating downgrades, particularly those associated with transitions be-
tween investment-grade (IG) and high-yield (HY) ratings. This IG-HY segmentation e↵ect may
also spill over from bond to CDS trading. A number of other studies, including Tang and Yan
(2008), Chen, Fabozzi, and Sverdlove (2010), Bongaerts, de Jong, and Driessen (2011), Chen,
Cheng, and Wu (2013), Junge and Trolle (2015) and Arakelyan and Serrano (2016), focus on
the CDS market itself and document significant liquidity e↵ects.
   Delianedis and Geske (1998), Delianedis, Geske, and Corzo (1998), Bohn (2000) and Huang
and Huang (2012) use structural approaches to estimating the relationship between actual and
risk-neutral default probabilities, generally assuming that the Black-Scholes-Merton model ap-
plies to the asset value process, and assuming constant volatility. Eom, Helwege, and Huang
(2004) have found that these structural models tend to fit the data rather poorly, and typically
underestimate credit spreads, especially for shorter maturity bonds. Chen, Collin-Dufresne, and
Goldstein (2009) show an improvement in fit by incorporating an assumption of counter-cyclical
default boundaries. Our study does not rely on structural modeling, except insofar as EDFs
depend in part on the Black-Scholes-Merton model. Our estimates of credit risk premia arise
directly from observed data and simple econometric specifications.
   The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the data and sam-
ple construction. Section 3 explains our calculation of expected default loss rates. Section 4
quantifies the cross-sectional and temporal variation in credit risk premia. Section 5 analyzes
the extent to which variation in credit risk premia is explained by variation in expected losses.
Section 6 presents panel regressions that point to significant comovement of credit risk premia
with refined credit ratings, equity-option-implied volatility, and a range of macroeconomic indi-
cators, even after controlling for expected losses. Section 7 extends our analysis to alternative
measures of expected default loss. Section 8 concludes.

2.    Data Sources and Sample Construction

     This section describes our data sources for default swap rates and conditional default prob-
abilities.

2.1 Markit CDS Data

     A credit default swap (CDS) is a derivative contract designed to transfer credit risk. With
minor exceptions, a CDS is economically equivalent to a bond insurance contract. The buyer of
protection makes periodic (usually quarterly) “insurance” payments until the expiration of the
contract or until a contractually defined credit event, whichever is earlier. The annualized rate
of payment, per unit of covered bond principal, is called the CDS rate. Beginning with the Big
Bang Protocol of April 2009, CDS rates were standardized to 100 basis points for investment-
grade debt and 500 basis points for high-yield debt. Since this change, each CDS trade is
negotiated with an “upfront” payment (positive or negative), as additional compensation for
the protection seller.
     Our CDS rate observations, obtained from Markit Partners, are “at-market,” meaning that
they represent bids or o↵ers of the default-swap rates at which a buyer or seller of protection is
proposing to enter into new default swap contracts without an up-front payment. Assuming no
upfront and zero dealer margins, the at-market CDS rate is, in theory, that for which the net
market value of the contract is zero. For CDS with standardized annual running payment rates
of 100 and 500 basis points, the bid and ask CDS rate data are as provided by Markit. A quoted
CDS rate is converted to an upfront payment using a standard industry formula. The rates
provided by Markit are composite CDS quotes, in that they are computed based on bid and
ask quotes obtained from two or more anonymous CDS dealers. We assume that the composite
CDS rate is the rate at which the market value of the default swap is indeed zero.
     For our CDS data the stipulated credit event is default by a named firm. If the credit event
occurs before the expiration of the CDS, the buyer of protection receives from the seller of
protection the di↵erence between the face value and the market value of the underlying debt.


                                                8
The contractual definition of default normally allows for bankruptcy, a material failure by the
obligor to make payments on its debt, or a restructuring of the debt that is materially adverse to
the interests of creditors. This is the same definition of default used for purposes of the Moody’s
Analytics EDF estimator of default probability.
       The coverage of default swaps for out-of-bankruptcy restructuring has varied somewhat.
ISDA, the industry coordinator of standardized default-swap contracts, has arranged a number
of consensus contractual definitions of default and coverage in the event of default. All of
our CDS data are for U.S. firms, with a consensus contractual definition known as “modified
restructuring.” The contractual definition of default a↵ects the measured credit risk premia,
of course, because a wider definition of default implies a higher default probability and more
recovery-value heterogeneity.3 We repeat our analysis for CDS without restructuring in the
internet appendix.
       Our CDS data apply to senior unsecured debt instruments. We vary expected loss given
default (LGD) estimates across firms and time using Markit estimates. In Section 7 we show
that our findings are qualitatively robust to alternative LGD assumptions. Additional details
regarding our CDS data, including a description of the settlement mechanism and the cheapest-
to-deliver option available to the buyer of protection, are provided in Internet Appendix A.

2.2 Moody’s Analytics EDF Data

       Moody’s Analytics provides current firm-by-firm estimates of annualized conditional prob-
abilities of default over time horizons that include the benchmark horizons of one and five
years. For a given firm and time horizon, this “EDF” estimate of default probability is fit non-
parametrically from the historical default frequency of other firms that had the same estimated
“distance to default” as the target firm. The distance to default of a given firm is e↵ectively
a leverage measure adjusted for current market asset volatility (see Internet Appendix B for
details). Duffie, Saita, and Wang (2007), Bharath and Shumway (2008), and Duffie et al.
   3
    While the probability of a CDS trigger event occurring increases when out-of-bankruptcy restructurings are
covered, Berndt, Jarrow, and Kang (2007) document that the likelihood of a restructuring event is substantially
smaller than that of a bankruptcy or missed payment.


                                                      9
(2009) show that although distance to default is a sufficient explanatory variable for conditional
default probabilities in the theoretical models of Black and Scholes (1973), Merton (1974), Fis-
cher, Heinkel, and Zechner (1989), and Leland and Toft (1996), among others, some incremental
predictive power can be obtained by including additional firm-specific and macroeconomic ex-
planatory variables. Consistent with this, we will show that, controlling for EDFs, CDS rates
are also explained in part by refined credit ratings.
   While one could criticize the EDF measure as an estimator of the “true” conditional default
probability, it has some merits relative to other available approaches to estimating conditional
default probabilities. First, the Moody’s Analytics EDF is readily available for essentially all
public U.S. companies, and for a large fraction of foreign public firms. Second, EDFs are fitted
non-parametrically to the distance to default, and are therefore somewhat robust to model mis-
specification. While the measured distance to default (DD) is itself based on a theoretical option-
pricing model, the function that maps DD to EDF is consistently estimated in a stationary
setting, even if the underlying theoretical relationship between DD and default probability does
not apply. That is, conditional on only the distance to default, the measured EDF is equal to
the “true” DD-conditional default probability as the number of observations goes to infinity,
under typical mixing and other technical conditions for non-parametric qualitative-response
estimation. Details on the out-of-sample predictive power of EDFs are provided in Internet
Appendix B.

2.3 Refined Credit Ratings

   We collect data on Moody’s alphanumeric senior unsecured issuer ratings. For the purpose
of obtaining refined credit ratings, continuous watchlist and outlook data are available from
November 15, 2003 onwards. Prior to that date, refined ratings are set equal to alphanumeric
ratings. Watchlist and outlook data sometimes are in the form of “Developing” or “Uncertain.”
In those instances, refined ratings are again set equal to alphanumeric ratings. We will show that
refined ratings exhibit substantially more time-series variation than raw alphanumeric ratings,


                                                10
and that they have more explanatory power for credit risk premia than unrefined ratings.

2.4 Sample Construction

   We identify all public U.S. firms that can be matched unambiguously across Markit, Moody’s
Analytics, Compustat and CRSP databases. We restrict Markit data to senior unsecured debt
and CDS based on modified restructuring. We use CDS quotes for which Markit rates the
quality of the quote as BB or higher, and for which a default recovery rate estimate is available.
If a quote-quality rating is not available, we require a composite level of “CcyGrp,” “DocAdj”
or “Entity Tier.” Although Markit CDS data go back as far as 2001, after cleaning the data
we find few 2001 observations. We therefore restrict our sample for estimation purposes to the
period of 2002 to 2015.
   We exclude firms with less than one year of matched CDS-EDF data, and remove any
extreme “needles” in the CDS and EDF time series for a given firm that cannot be explained by
market-wide or firm-specific events. This leaves us with 505 unique firms—as identified by their
Compustat identifiers called “gvkey”—from ten industry sectors, and with 1,189,330 matched
daily CDS-EDF pairs. The number of CDS quote contributors ranges from three to 33 in our
sample, with a median composite depth of seven.

2.5 Descriptive Statistics

   The range of credit qualities of the firms in our data may be judged from Table 1, which
shows, for each credit rating, the number of firms in our study with that median Moody’s
senior unsecured issuer rating during the sample period. The table indicates a concentration of
firms of medium credit quality. Across industry groups, ratings tend to be higher for financial,
healthcare and technology firms, and tend to be lower for telecommunication services firms.
   Figure 2 shows time series of median five-year CDS and EDF rates. Median CDS rates are
substantially higher following WorldCom’s default in July 2002, during the 2008-09 financial
crisis, and during the latter half of 2011 (when there were severe concerns about European
peripheral sovereign debt and faltering negotiations over the U.S. government debt ceiling).

While median EDFs also exhibit local peaks at these times, temporal variation in CDS rates
tends to be much more than proportionately impacted.

rates, by year, sector and credit rating. This table reveals cross-sectional di↵erences in the
relationship between CDS rates and EDFs. Financial firms and, to some extent, technology
firms stand out in that median EDFs are higher relative to median credit spreads than is the
case for other sectors. This suggests that financial and technology firms may have relatively
lower credit risk premia. While these cross-sector di↵erences in median credit risk premia are
confirmed in Section 4, our panel regression analysis in Section 6 reveals that much of these
di↵erences can be explained by di↵erences in credit quality across sectors.

   While recovery rate estimates tend to be close to 40%, we observe a notable decrease in
estimated recovery rates as credit quality decreases.
   Figure 3 highlights that refined credit ratings exhibit substantially more time-series variation
than raw alphanumeric ratings. The average annual frequency of refined rating changes per firm
fluctuates between a low of 0.22 in 2002 and a high of 0.69 in 2008. By comparison, the average
annual frequency of alphanumeric rating changes per firm ranges from 0.15 to only 0.32.

Figure 3: Rating changes The figure shows the average annual number of rating changes per firm. The left
panel is based on Moody’s unadjusted alphanumeric rating. The right panel is based on the refined rating. The
data include the 497 firms in our sample with alphanumeric and refined rating data, over 2002-2015.


     Figure C.1 in Internet Appendix C reveals that rating downgrades tend to outweigh rating
upgrades, especially in 2002-03 and 2008-09, which are both periods of credit stress.


3.    Estimating Expected Default Loss Rates

     For a given firm, let Ct denote the time-t at-market CDS rate. In the absence of market
frictions, and under purely technical regularity conditions (it suffices that there is a finite number
of states of the world), there exists a stochastic discount factor process M , defined so that a
payment of ZT at time T has a market value at time t  T of Et (ZT MT )/Mt , where Et denotes
expectation conditional on market information available at time t. Under these assumptions,
the at-market CDS rate satisfies

where T is the maturity of the CDS contract in years,             is the time between premium payments,
and K = T /      is the number of payment periods. We use Dt,y to denote the indicator of default
of the firm in the period (t, t + y] and Lt,y to denote the conditional expected loss given default,
as a fraction of notional, that would apply if the firm were to default in period (t, t + y]. The
left-hand side of Equation (1) is the value of the premium leg of the CDS contract. The right-
hand side is the value of the protection leg.4 The at-market CDS rate Ct equates the market
values of the two legs.
       We ignore the CDS counterparty risk on CDS rates because, as shown by Arora, Gandhi,
and Longsta↵ (2012) and Du et al. (2016), these tend to be tiny in practice, given standard
collateralization and netting agreements.
       If investors were risk-neutral, Mt would be be deterministic and the resulting CDS rate,
denoted ExpLt , would solve the equation

       The “credit risk premium,” denoted Premt , is defined to be the di↵erence between the
observed CDS rate Ct and the hypothetical CDS rate ExpLt that would apply in the absence of
risk aversion. Our main object of concern is the decomposition


                                             Ct = ExpLt + Premt .                                                       (4)

    We take the simple view that defaults, should they occur, occur at the end of a payment period. This allows
us to abstract from accrued interest computations.




                                                          15
By this construction, any liquidity-related e↵ects in CDS pricing are also absorbed into Premt .
       We assume for simplicity that the expected loss given default and the default indicator are
conditionally independent, so that Et (Lt+k               ,    Dt+k   ,   ) = Et (Lt+k   ,   ) Et (Dt+k   ,   ). In the
main part of the paper, we set Lt ⌘ Et (Lt+k          ,       ) equal to one minus the time-t Markit recovery
rate estimate for the given firm. An alternative LGD specification that allows Et (Lt+k                          ,   ) to
change with the forecasting horizon k is proposed in Internet Appendix D.
       For a flat and relatively low term structure of default probabilities, ExpLt is a close approx-
imation of the annualized expected rate of loss to the protection seller, and we will henceforth
refer to ExpLt as “the expected loss rate.” We do not, however, impose a flat term structure
of default probabilities. As a result, computing the weighted expected loss rate ExpLt in Equa-
tion (3) involves computing expected default frequencies at di↵erent horizons. In particular,


                             Et (Dt+k    ,   ) = Et Dt,(k+1)                 Et (Dt,k ) .


       Moody’s Analytics estimates of Et (Dt,T ) are available for a maturity T of one year or five
years. To estimate the term structure of PDs at other maturities, we adapt the methodology
of Nelson and Siegel (1987), originally developed to fit term structures of risk-free interest
rates, along with the extension suggested by Svensson (1994). Unlike reduced-form single-factor
term structure models commonly used to describe default arrival, the Nelson-Siegel-Svensson
framework is flexible enough to fit both one-year and five-year EDFs for a given firm on a given
date.5 This flexibility is useful, given the changes in the EDF term structure over time observed
in Figure E.1 in the internet appendix.
       Details regarding the specification and our fitting of PDs with the Nelson-Siegel-Svensson
model are provided in Internet Appendix E. Figure 4 shows the fitted term structures of default
probabilities out to ten years, at the median across firms and time, for each given credit rating.
   5
     In a prior version of this paper, we estimated the Black-Karasinski model for actual default intensities using
one-year EDFs. While the model-implied five-year EDFs matched their observed counterparts reasonably well
for the 2002-2004 period, fitting errors at the five-year maturity became more substantial once we extended the
sample period to 2015.


                                                              16
For high-yield firms, the short end of the term structure generally exhibits an inverted hump.
For investment-grade firms, the term structure is generally upward sloping, with a steeper slope
at medium maturities and a more shallow slope at short and long maturities. In Section 7 we
perform robustness checks by using a simple interpolation between observed default probabilities,
instead of using the Nelson-Siegel-Svensson fit.
         Summary statistics for expected losses are provided in Table 3. The median expected loss
component of five-year CDS rates, across firms and over time, is 22 basis points. The median
ratio of expected loss to CDS rate ranges from 0.16 in 2008 and 2012 to 0.44 in 2004, with
an overall median of 0.26.6 Across sectors, the ratio of expected loss to CDS rate tends to be
highest for financial firms—the median ratio across firms in this sector and over time is 0.61—
and lowest for utilities, with a median ratio of 0.11. Across the rating spectrum, the median
ratio of expected loss to CDS rate has an inverted tent shape, in that this ratio decreases as
credit quality declines from 0.41 for Aaa firms to 0.20 for Ba firms, and then increases again to

         This section quantifies the cross-sectional and temporal variation of credit risk premia.

4.1 Level and Cross-Sectional Variation of Credit Risk Premia

         Summary estimates of credit risk premia, Premt , are described in Table 3. These are shown
in basis points of covered debt principal per year. We also show these credit risk premia as a
fraction of CDS rates, and also as a multiple of the expected weighted default loss rate, ExpLt .
The median credit risk premium, across firms and over time, is 58 basis points of notional per
year. There is substantial variation in credit risk premia across firms. Median premia increase
from less than 10 basis points for Aaa firms to more than 700 basis points for Ca-C firms. As a
multiple of the expected loss rate, median premia increase from 1.4 for Aaa firms to 4.0 for Ba
     6
    Median expected-loss-to-CDS ratios are computed as one minus the median ratios of premium to CDS rate,
with the latter being reported in the fourth column of Table 3.

loss ratio, at the sample median across firms and over time, is 3.9. In the absence of market fric-
tions, CDS rates are approximately equal to corresponding par bond yield spreads (Duffie, 1999).
Thus, CDS-to-expected-loss ratios are close proxies for yield-spread-to-expected-loss ratios. De-
scriptive statistics for the ratio of average corporate bond yield spreads to average expected
loss rates have been provided by Huang and Huang (2012), Driessen (2005) and Giesecke et
al. (2011), among others. These authors use historical default frequencies to compute average
expected losses rates and report yield-spread-to-expected-loss ratios between 1.1 and 2.6.7
       Our estimates are thus somewhat higher than those reported in prior work. Some of this
   7
     Giesecke et al. (2011) compute a ratio of average yield spreads to estimated average actual credit losses of
2.0 for the 1866-2008 period. Driessen (2005) uses a reduced-form modeling approach and reports a ratio of
risk-neutral to actual default intensities of 1.8 for AA-rated firms, 2.6 for A-rated firms and 2.4 for BBB-rated
firms, for the 1991-2000 period. Using the structural model of Leland and Toft (1996), and bond price data for
1973-1993, Huang and Huang (2012) calibrate model parameters that determine actual and risk-neutral default
probabilities. Our calculation of the associated estimated ratios of annualized risk-neutral to actual five-year
default probabilities ranges from 1.8 for Aa-rated firm to 1.1 for B-rated firms.

di↵erence is based on the fact that we compute expected loss rates based on EDFs rather than
on rating-based PDs. In Section 7 we show that median CDS-to-expected-loss ratios decrease
from 3.9 to 3.2 when EDFs are replaced by rating-based PDs. As a further source of di↵erence
from the prior literature, we report the sample median of ratios for specific firms and dates,
rather than the ratio of sample-average CDS rates to sample-average expected loss rates. For
rating-based PDs, changing the computation from the median ratio to the ratio of averages
further lowers the reported ratio from 3.2 to 2.2, which is in line with the prior literature.

4.2 Temporal Variation of Credit Risk Premia

   The daily time series of median credit risk premia is displayed in Figure 5. Annual summary
statistics are provided in Table 3. We observe dramatic changes over time in the price of default
insurance, even after controlling for changes in expected default protection losses. Annual
median premia (CDS rate net of expected loss due to default) were 65 basis points in 2002,
then dropped almost 50% to 35 basis points in 2003. These premia stayed below 30 basis points
between 2004 and 2007, before sharply increasing to over 100 basis points during the 2008-09
financial crisis. For the first three years following the crisis, median premia remained fairly
high—between 85 and 100 basis points—before declining to lower levels. They amounted to
70, 52 and 57 basis points in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. Notably, throughout the entire
2010-15 post-crisis period, median premia remained far above their pre-crisis levels.
   Per unit of expected default loss, annual median credit risk premia were lowest at 1.3 in
2004 and highest at 5.2 in 2008. Their temporal pattern is similar to that for premia measured
in basis points, mainly because the variation in credit spreads far outweighs that of expected
losses. (The time series of median premia, measured as a fraction of CDS rates, is shown in
Figure C.2 in the internet appendix.)
   In Table 4, we report the sample correlation between median credit risk premia and various
macroeconomic variables. The latter are described in detail in Internet Appendix F. For premia
measured in basis points of notional debt per year, the comovement is most pronounced for

median credit risk premium component of five-year CDS rates in basis points. The right panel shows the median

measures of aggregate stock-market volatility, consumer sentiment and consumption growth.
The sample correlation between each of these macro time series and median credit risk premia
has an absolute magnitude in excess of 70%.8 For premium-to-expected-loss ratios, the macro
variables whose correlation with median credit risk premia are largest in magnitude are consumer
sentiment and the five-year Treasury yield. In each case, the sample correlation is close to or
below –70%.
       Table 4 reveals that the extent to which credit risk premia change over time and co-move
with macro fundamentals depends on the credit quality of the underlying firm. When measured
in basis points of notional, premia tend to be more volatile for lower credit quality firms. But
when expressed as a multiple of expected loss rates, premia generally exhibit more variation over
time for higher credit quality firms. Indeed, daily median premium-to-expected-loss ratios are
twice as volatile for investment-grade firms as for high-yield firms, as visualized in Figure C.3 in
   8
     The statistics in Table 4 are computed using daily data. If a macro variable is observed only once a month
or quarter, for any given day we use the last available observation. Details are provided in Internet Appendix F.
We note that the square of a correlation reported in the table is equal to the R2 of the regression of median
risk premia on the associated macro variable. This statistic therefore measures the fraction of the variation in
median premia that can be explained by variation in the macro variable.

Table 4: Comovement between credit risk premia and macroeconomic variables The table reports
the standard deviation of daily median credit risk premia (column 1) and the correlation between daily median
premia and various macroeconomic variables (columns 2 through 12). The macro variables include market-
wide implied volatilities for standardized 91-day at-the-money and out-of-the-money put options on the S&P500
index (MVatm and MVotm ), aggregate stock market volatility as measured by the VIX index (VIX), the five-
year Treasury rate (Trsy rate), the di↵erence between five-year and one-year Treasury rates (Trsy slope), the
University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index (CSENT), the unemployment rate (UNRATE), consumption
growth (Cons growth), the leading index for the U.S. (USSLIND), a dummy variable that is one during NBER
recessions and zero otherwise (NBER), the average monthly volume of defaulted U.S debt over the past twelve
months (Dfltd debt), and CDS notional outstanding (CDS notional). The macro variables, and how they are
sourced, are described in detail in Internet Appendix F. The standard deviations and correlations are reported
for median premia computed across all firms (row 1), investment-grade firms (row 2) and high-yield firms (row
3). Only days on which premia are available for 50 or more firms are used in the respective calculations. The

the internet appendix. For IG firms, median premium-to-expected-loss ratios move closely with
consumer sentiment, Treasury rates, aggregate stock-market volatility and consumption growth.
For HY firms, however, there is a much smaller correlation between credit risk premium ratios
and these macro fundamentals.
   Our observations are consistent with the notion that during times of market-wide distress,
increases in credit spreads outpace increases in expected default losses. The disproportionate
increase in the price of default insurance is more pronounced for firms of higher credit quality.
   Lastly, Figure C.4 in the internet appendix displays the time series of daily median premium-
to-expected-loss ratios for each sector. These ratios tend to be most volatile for utilities (with
a standard deviation of 7.8) and least volatile for financials and technology firms (each having
a standard deviation of 1.1). In Section 6, we investigate in more detail the extent to which
variation in premia, across firms and over time, is associated with variation in firm-specific and

macroeconomic variables.
     Internet Appendix G characterizes the term structure of credit risk premia, over time, by
industry and by credit rating. The term structure was relatively flat prior to the financial crisis
of 2008-09, and steepened in the post-crisis years. Between 2010 and 2013, median di↵erences
between five-year and one-year premia were particularly wide, often in excess of 50 basis points.
In what follows, we develop a predictive model for cross-sectional and temporal variation in five-
year credit risk premia. Corresponding results for one-year and ten-year premia are provided in
the internet appendix.


5.    The Fraction of Variation in Credit Risk Premia Explained by Expected Default
      Losses

     This section investigates the extent to which variation in credit risk premia can be explained
by variation in expected default losses. In light of Equation (4), this is equivalent to quantifying
the sensitivity of credit spreads to expected losses. While Figure 6 shows the expected positive
relationship between five-year CDS rates and five-year expected loss rates, the dispersion in
observed CDS rates is large at each level of expected loss, and becomes larger as the expected
loss rate increases.
     In order to obtain a tighter link between credit spreads and expected losses and to mitigate
the e↵ect of heteroskedasticity, we explore this relationship in log-log space. That is, we relate
the logarithm of CDS rates to the logarithm of expected loss rates. The sample distribution of
the logarithm of CDS-to-expected loss ratios exhibits much less skewness and is more suited to
linear modeling than that of the raw ratios. (See Figure C.5 in the internet appendix.) Figure 7
reveals a strong positive relationship between log(Cti ) and log(ExpLit ).
     At the five-year maturity, regressing the logarithm of the CDS rate on the logarithm of the
expected loss rate produces a highly significant regression9 coefficient of 0.555. The CDS rate

     This regression analysis is based on a somewhat smaller sample of 1,003,488 firm-date pairs that covers 467
firms. These data later enter regressions that include additional covariates, and hence impose greater demands
on data availability.

each 10% proportional increase in the expected loss rate. This fitted relationship implies that
credit spreads, per unit of expected losses, are decreasing in expected losses.

expected-loss ratio of between exp( 0.817) = 44% and exp(0.817) = 226%, as a multiple of the
fitted ratio. While the CDS data are noisy in this sense, the relationship between the logarithm
of the CDS-rate-to-expected-loss-rate ratio and the expected loss rate is highly significant. Vari-
ation in expected loss rates, on its own, explains a sizable fraction—an R2 of about 26%—of
variation in this log ratio.
    Table 5 reveals that the inclusion of firm and month fixed e↵ects in Equation (5) results in a
substantially higher R2 (84% with fixed e↵ects, compared to 26% without) and in a much lower
root mean squared error (0.39 with fixed e↵ects, compared to 0.82 without). The left panel in
Figure 8 and Figure C.6 in the internet appendix reveal that lower rated firms tend to have
higher credit spreads, even after conditioning on expected losses. This may be due to di↵erences
in the degree of systematic risk across credit quality or to clientele e↵ects that restrict the set
of investors that supply default protection for risky firms.

In the next section, we investigate the extent to which firm and time fixed e↵ects are captured
by observable firm characteristics and macroeconomic variables.


6.    Predicting Credit Risk Premia

the important firm and time fixed e↵ects that we discovered in Equation (5), we estimate a

Here, Xti and Yt are vectors of firm-specific and macroeconomic predictors, respectively,                    X   and

 Y   are coefficient vectors to be estimated, and "it is a random disturbance. The predictor vari-
ables that we consider in the regression analysis are described in detail in Internet Appendix F.

6.1 Firm-Specific Predictors

     Here, we explore firm-specific predictors of credit risk premia. Our findings are summarized
in Table 6. Specification I is the benchmark model of the previous section, which assumes that

 X   = 0 and    Y   = 0. Specification II is motivated by our findings in Figures 8 and C.6, and
includes dummies for the alphanumeric rating, as adjusted for watchlist and outlook status,
in the vector Xti of firm-specific predictor variables. Table 6 reports that these refined ratings
dummies are highly statistically significant and have large explanatory power for credit spreads,
even after controlling for expected loss rates. Indeed, adding refined ratings dummies increases
the R2 from 26% to 58%, and lowers the residual standard error from 0.82 to 0.62. Comparing
these results with those for the model with firm fixed e↵ects in Table 5, we find that refined
ratings dummies have nearly as much explanatory power as firm fixed e↵ects.

Table 6: Firm-specific sources of variation in credit risk premia The table reports the results of the
panel data regression (6). Here, IVatm and IVotm are the standardized 91-day put-implied volatilities at a Delta
of –50% and –20%. Refined ratings dummies identify the firm- and date-specific Moody’s rating, adjusted for
watchlist and outlook status. Recent upgrade/downgrade dummies are one if the firm’s alphanumeric rating
has been upgraded/downgraded in the past six months, and zero otherwise. Credit spreads and expected losses
are measured in basis points of notional, and implied volatility is measured in nominal terms. The benchmark
refined rating category is Baa2 and the benchmark sector is Consumer Goods. Driscoll-Kraay standard errors
that are robust to heteroskedasticity, autocorrelation and cross-sectional dependence are reported in parentheses.

    The regression coefficient estimates for the refined ratings dummies follow the pattern dis-
played in Figure C.7 in the internet appendix. They are higher for lower rated debt. For
example, at a given expected loss, investor compensation per unit of risk is estimated to be
46% lower for A than Baa firms, and 112% higher for Ba than Baa firms. In that sense, refined
ratings are important predictors of cross-sectional variation in credit spreads.
    Our findings are consistent with permanent ratings-based investor clientele e↵ects. While



                                                         28
many investors would consider buying an investment-grade (IG) bond, a more restricted set
of investors are open to buying high-yield (HY) bonds, often because of agency-based asset
management mandates. What we have in mind, in addition to portfolio holdings regulations
and risk-based capital requirements for financial institutions, are supply and demand e↵ects
associated with di↵erent types of investors. Less sophisticated investors may not trust their
information as much as investment professionals who specialize in distressed debt. Less sophis-
ticated investors, in this sense, may also know less about managing distressed debt positions, in
particular through a restructuring. As a result, less sophisticated investors are likely to prefer
higher-rated bonds over a lower-rated bonds, controlling for a given price per unit of default
risk, and are more likely to provide IG-restricted investment mandates to their asset managers,
such as mutual funds.
   Specification III goes further by including firm-specific implied-volatility measures as pre-
dictor variables. Although our expected-loss measure includes the impact of equity volatility
through distance to default, it could su↵er from functional misspecification and noise. Hence
an additional direct measure of expected future equity volatility such as a firm’s at-the-money
put-implied volatility, IVatm , may help control for solvency risk. Furthermore, under the natu-
ral presumption that there is a price for bearing market-value volatility above and beyond that
implied by default risk, we would expect credit risk premia to be higher for more volatile firms
after controlling for expected losses.
   In addition to the level of implied volatility (IV), we also control for the smirk of the IV
surface. The smirk is measured as the ratio of out-of-the-money (OTM) to at-the-money (ATM)
put-implied volatilities, IVotm /IVatm . The idea here is that the volatility smirk may contain
information about the cost of insuring against sudden large increases in a firm’s default risk.
Table 6 shows that adding the log of a firm’s IV and the log of the smirk of the IV surface to
the regression model increases the R2 from 58% to 70%, and lowers the residual standard error
from 0.62 to 0.52.
   The loadings on IV and the IV smirk are both positive and highly statistically significant.


                                               29
An increase in the level of the IV surface from 30% to 45%, for example, is associated with10 an
increase in the CDS-rate-to-expected-loss-rate ratio of exp(0.985 ⇥ log(1.5))                  1 = 49.1%. An
increase in the volatility smirk of 10% is associated with an estimated increase in the ratio of
CDS rate to expected loss rate of about exp(1.722 ⇥ log(1.10))                1 = 17.8%.
       Specification IV adds sector fixed e↵ects. With this, the regression R2 increases from 70%
to 71%, and the residual standard error decreases from 0.52 to 0.51. The estimated sector
loadings are shown in Figure C.8. Using Consumer Goods as the benchmark sector and holding
everything else the same, financial, technology, telecommunications and utility firms tend to
command higher credit risk premia per unit of expected loss, whereas healthcare companies
tend to command lower prices for bearing default risk.
       Specification V further augments the set of conditioning variables with dummy variables for
recent upgrades, downgrades and changes in the IG/HY status. While there are only minor im-
provements in the goodness of fit, we find evidence of statistically significant ratings momentum
e↵ects. We find that CDS rates of firms whose alphanumeric rating has been downgraded in the
past six months tend to be exp(0.105)             1 = 11.1% higher than those of firms that, although
otherwise similar, did not experience a recent change in rating. This proportional increase is
even more pronounced, at exp(0.105 + 0.049)                 1 = 16.7%, for firms that were downgraded
from IG to HY status. These temporary price pressure e↵ects are in addition to the perma-
nent ratings-based clientele e↵ects discussed earlier. Their presence points to inefficiencies in
the re-allocation of corporate bonds that are sold by restricted to unrestricted investors when
firms fall out of IG status.11 A recent upgrade, on the other hand, tends to be associated with
exp( 0.098)       1=      9.3% proportionately lower credit spreads. The tightening of spreads is
particularly pronounced for upgrades from HY to IG status, with spreads expected to change
  10
     According to Table F.1 in the internet appendix, the average value of log(IVatm ) is –1.23, which corresponds
to an ATM IV of about 30%. The standard deviation of log(IVatm ) is 0.42, which roughly translates into a
50% change in IVatm . The standard deviation of log(IVotm /IVatm ) is 0.10, which roughly translates into a 10%
change in IVotm /IVatm .

     Ambrose, Cai, and Helwege (2012), Ellul, Jotikasthira, and Lundblad (2012) and Chen et al. (2014), among
others, also analyze price pressure e↵ects in corporate bond markets associated with rating downgrades from IG
to HY.

proportionally by exp( (0.098 + 0.068))             1=       15.3%.
       The most elaborate model in Table 6, Specification VI, allows for second-order terms of
expected losses and interactions of the volatility surface variables with high-yield ratings status.
These additional variables increase the R2 from 71% to 72%, and lower the residual standard
error from 0.51 to 0.50. We find that the log-log relationship between the CDS-rate-to-expected-
loss-rate ratio and the expected loss rate exhibits some degree of convexity. Specifically, the
sensitivity of the logarithm of C/ExpL to the logarithm of ExpL decreases as the expected loss
rate increases. While a 10% increase in the expected loss rate from 10 to 11 basis points of
notional is associated with a 9.6% decrease in C/ExpL, a 10% increase in the expected loss rate
from 100 to 110 basis points is associated with only a 6.7% decrease in C/ExpL. The sensitivity
of credit risk premia to the implied volatility surface also decreases as credit quality deteriorates.
       Taking these e↵ects together, the credit risk premia of riskier firms tend to be less sensitive to
changes in firm-specific default risk and volatility controls. This is consistent with the evidence
in Figure C.3 in the internet appendix, which shows that CDS-to-expected-loss ratios tend to
exhibit more (counter-cyclical) time-series variation for investment-grade firms than for high-
yield firms.

6.2 Macroeconomic Predictors

       Figure 9 displays the time series of average regression residuals for the most elaborate model
in Table 6, Specification VI. While the fit is reasonably close, it tends to underestimate CDS
rates between 2003 and 2007. The model overestimates CDS rates in 2002 and between 2008
and 2015. We now explore the extent to which this unexplained common co-movement can be
explained by comovement of credit spreads with macroeconomic variables.
       To this end, we augment the vector of conditioning variables in our basic regression model
with macroeconomic variables. We focus on the five-year Treasury rate and the University
of Michigan consumer sentiment index, as these exhibit the highest correlation with CDS-to-
expected loss ratios in Table 4, and also include a proxy for CDS market liquidity.12 Interest

rates may be able to capture some of the unexplained variation in Figure 9 given that they
were substantially higher prior to the Great Recession (when average regression residuals were
lower) and lower afterwards (when average residuals were higher). A negative relationship
between interest rates and credit spreads would also be consistent with the evidence in Duf-
fee (1998, 1999), Collin-Dufresne, Goldstein, and Martin (2001), Campbell and Taksler (2003)
and Avramov, Jostova, and Philipov (2007), among other research.
    Indeed, we find that, all else the same, lower interest rates are associated with higher credit
spreads. Specification VII in Table 7 includes all of the firm-specific controls in Table 6, as well as
five-year Treasury rates. For this model, a marginal decrease in interest rates of one percentage
point (in absolute interest rates) is associated with an increase in the ratio of CDS rate to
expected loss rate of exp( 0.211 ⇥ ( 1)) = 23.5%. Controlling for interest rates improves the
goodness of fit dramatically. It raises the R2 from 72% to 79%, and lowers the residual standard
ity measures or the slope of the Treasury yield curve, for example, does not measurably improve the fit.

for the panel data regression (6). The numbering of the model specifications continues that of Table 6. Here,
IVatm and IVotm are the standardized 91-day put-implied volatilities at a Delta of 50% and 20%. Refined
ratings dummies identify the firm- and date-specific Moody’s rating, adjusted for watchlist and outlook status.
Recent upgrade/downgrade dummies are one if the firm’s alphanumeric rating has been upgraded/downgraded in
the past six months, and zero otherwise. CSENT is the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment index. Credit
spreads and expected loss rates are measured in basis points of notional, interest rates are measured in percent,
and implied volatility IV is measured in nominal terms. The market total CDS notional outstanding is sourced
from ISDA and BIS, and is measured in trillions of U.S. dollars, adjusted for double-counting. The benchmark
refined rating category is Baa2 and the benchmark sector is Consumer Goods. Driscoll-Kraay standard errors
that are robust to heteroskedasticity, autocorrelation and cross-sectional dependence are reported in parentheses.

       In Specification VIII in Table 7, we also control for the logarithm of the University of
Michigan consumer sentiment index (CSENT) and the reciprocal of aggregate CDS notional
outstanding.14 The estimated coefficients for both variables are statistically and economically
significant. The R2 is raised from that of Specification VII, from 79% to 81%, and the residual

standard error is lowered from 0.43 to 0.42.
   The consumer sentiment index is a leading economic indicator that may be used by investors
to predict where the economy is headed. The higher the index the more optimistic consumers are
about near-future economic conditions. We therefore anticipate a negative relationship between
consumer sentiment and the price for default insurance. Consistent with this intuition, we find
that a 15% increase in consumer sentiment, which is roughly consistent with a one-standard
deviation increase in log(CSENT), is associated with a exp( 0.989 log(1.15))           1 =    12.9%
proportional change (decrease) in CDS rates.
   A marginal increase in aggregate CDS notional outstanding is associated with a decrease in
CDS rates. For example, a one-standard-deviation increase in notional outstanding from 25 to
40 trillion is associated with a exp(0.612 (1/40        1/25))   1=   0.9% decrease in spreads.
   Motivated by the observation in Table 4 that the credit risk premia of high-yield firms tend
to exhibit less comovement with macro fundamentals than those of investment-grade firms,
Specification IX allows the loadings on the macroeconomic controls to depend on whether a
firm is investment grade or high yield. We include these interaction terms for Treasury rates
and CDS notional outstanding, only. The sample correlation of the interaction term for CSENT
with that for ATM implied volatility and also that for Treasury rates is nearly 90% in absolute
terms, implying that the loadings on these three interaction terms would be difficult to interpret.
   We find that credit risk premia of HY firms are indeed less sensitive to the level of Treasury
yields than those of IG firms. For total CDS notional outstanding, the di↵erence in loadings is
less pronounced, which is consistent with the evidence in Table 4. Both IG and HY firms tend
to experience a decrease in CDS rates with increases in CDS notional outstanding.
   The most elaborate model in Table 7, Specification IX, has an R2 of 81% and a root
mean squared error of 0.41. An assumption of normally distributed disturbances implies a
one-standard-deviation confidence band for a ratio of CDS rate to expected loss rate covering
the interval between exp( 0.41) = 66% and exp(0.41) = 151% of the fitted ratio. This error
band is only slightly wider than that implied by the model with firm and month fixed e↵ects in

Table 5.
    Figure 10 shows multipliers for the refined ratings and sector dummies. The refined ratings
multipliers are similar across the model specifications in Tables 6 and 7 for investment-grade
firms. Even so, the inclusion of additional predictor variables in specifications III through
IX—in particular the inclusion of implied volatility measures and the second-order term of
expected losses—dampens the increase in ratings multipliers that we observed in Figure C.7
for Specification II. This is notable as credit quality drops from Ba to Ca-C. It suggests that
the comparatively high proportional credit risk premia observed for lower rated firms often
go hand in hand with much higher volatility or large expected default losses. In terms of the
marginal cross-sector distribution of credit spreads, financials and telecommunication firms tend
to command the highest ratio of credit risk premia to expected default losses. Healthcare firms
have the lowest average credit risk premia in this sense.

the underpricing between 2003 and 2007 has been corrected. This suggests that much of the
previously unexplained comovement across firms in credit spreads is explained by time variation
in macroeconomic variables that influence credit spreads.

6.3 Economic Impact of Predictor Variables

    Figure 12 shows the contribution of firm-specific variables to predicted credit risk premia,
using Specification IX of Table 7. For this, we fix a specific date, December 31, 2003. On that
date, the five-year Treasury rate was 3.25%, the consumer sentiment index (observed with a
one-month lag) was 93.7, and the total outstanding CDS notional (last reported for June that
year) was 2.7 trillion USD. For the benchmark scenario, we set the alphanumeric rating to Baa3.
In order to select the remaining firm-specific variables, we first compute sample statistics for

                                                       36
the December 31, 2003 subsample of firms with a Baa or Ba letter rating, that is, near the Baa3
benchmark. We then set the implied at-the-money and out-of-the-money volatilities to 25% and
30%, respectively, which are close to their respective sample means (and medians). We assume
that the firm is part of the Consumer Goods sector, that its watchlist and outlook status are
stable, and that it has not experienced any recent rating changes.

Figure 12: Impact of firm-specific predictor variables The figure shows fitted ratios of credit risk premium,
Prem, to expected default loss rate, ExpL, as this ratio varies with the expected default loss rate, based on the
estimated model for Specification IX in Table 7.


    The solid line in Figure 12 shows how, for the benchmark scenario, the fitted ratio of credit
risk premium to expected loss rate changes as a function of the expected loss rate, displaying
a convex relationship. The range of expected loss rates shown—from 5 to 120 basis points of
notional per year—captures over 90% of the cross-sectional sub-sample distribution of expected
loss rates. The mean (and median) of that distribution is close to 30 basis points, and the
sample standard deviation is about 40 basis points. The fitted model predicts that an increase
in the expected loss rate from 30 to 70 basis points, for example, is associated with a decrease
in the premium-to-expected-loss-rate ratio from 2.0 to 0.5, which represents a decrease in the

                                                                                            37
credit risk premium from 61 to 36 basis points of notional.
       Holding the expected default loss rate constant, we recompute the fitted ratio of credit risk
premium (Prem) to the expected default loss rate (ExpL) as the following consecutive changes
occur: (i) the rating drops from Baa3 to Ba1, (ii) the implied volatility increases proportionately
by 50% (roughly a one-standard-deviation increase), and (iii) the sector changes from Consumer
Goods to Financials.15 At an expected loss rate of 30 basis points, the downgrade from Baa3 to
Ba1 results in a sizable increase in fitted premium-to-expected-loss-rate ratios, from 2.0 to 4.7.
The increase in volatility leads to a further increase in the fitted ratio, from 4.7 to 6.3. Finally,
the change in sectors means yet another increase, from 6.3 to 7.4. Although the relative increase
in the fitted ratio, Prem/ExpL, resulting from the downgrade is higher for larger expected loss
rates, the impact on the fitted ratio of an increase in implied volatility or a change in sector is
not so sensitive to the level of the expected loss rate.
       In the left plot of Figure 13, we hold the firm-specific variables at their benchmark levels,
and shift the macro variables from their December 31, 2003 values to their December 31, 2008
values. By the latter date, the five-year Treasury rate had dropped to 1.56%, the consumer
sentiment index had fallen to 55.3, and the total notional outstanding amount of CDS had
expanded to 54.6 trillion USD. We observe that each of these variable changes has a sizable
impact on predicted credit risk premia. At an expected default loss rate of 30 basis points, the
decrease in interest rates is associated with an increase in the fitted premium-to-expected-loss-
rate ratios from 2.0 to 3.4. The decrease in consumer sentiment results in a further increase in
fitted premia from 3.4 to 6.4. The increase in CDS notional outstanding, however, brings fitted
ratios back down, from 6.4 to 4.9.
       In the right plot of the figure, we repeat the exercise for a new benchmark date, December
31, 2008, and examine the impact of shifting the macro variables to their levels five years later,
on December 31, 2013. At the end of 2013, the Treasury rate was only slightly higher, at 1.76%,
  15
    As the level of volatility changes, we hold the volatility skew constant. For HY firms, the degree of association
between the volatility skew and credit risk premia is rather limited.

than five years earlier. Between 2008 and 2013, consumer sentiment rose from 55.3 to 75.1,
whereas CDS notional outstanding had shrunk from 54.6 to 24.3 trillion USD. In Figure 13,
we find that the adjustment in predicted premia was mainly due to the increase in consumer
sentiment.

6.4 Shorter and Longer Default Horizons

    Table C.2 in the internet appendix reports the results for regression (6) when five-year CDS
rates and expected losses are replaced by their one-year or ten-year counterparts. The results
are qualitatively similar to those for the five-year default horizon. Short-term credit risk premia,
however, are more closely aligned with firm-level implied volatilities, consumer sentiment, and
total CDS notional outstanding than are long-term credit risk premia. These controls may have
a relatively low degree of persistence in their impact on corporate default risk and pricing.

7.      Alternative Measures of Expected Default Loss Rates

       In this section, we decompose CDS rates into expected loss rates and credit risk premia using
various alternative estimators of probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD).

7.1 Alternative Estimators of Probability of Default

       So far, our estimates for expected loss rates and credit risk premia have been based on a
Nelson-Siegel-Svensson term structure of default probabilities. This term structure was cal-
ibrated to one- and five-year EDFs and ten-year refined-ratings-based PDs (see Section 3).
Internet Appendix I lists alternative sources for default-probability data and Table 8 describes
the PD measures that we construct from these sources. These measures include (i) raw EDFs,
(ii) PDs disseminated by the Risk Management Institute at the National University of Singa-
pore (RMI PDs), (iii) ratings-based PDs that are equal to historical default rates for the firm’s
alphanumeric rating category, (iv) refined-ratings-based PDs that are matched to historical de-
fault rates based on the firm’s alphanumeric rating adjusted for watchlist and outlook status,
(v) refined-ratings-based PDs that are re-scaled so as to have the same cross-sectional mean
on each date as that of the EDFs on that date, and (vi) combined PDs that are computed by
averaging refined-ratings-based PDs with EDFs.
       An important distinction between point-in-time PDs (such as EDFs and RMI PDs), which
are updated frequently based on current information, and ratings-based PDs is that ratings tend
to be updated more slowly.16 This practice implies a reduction in the accuracy of the point-in-
time translation of a rating to an implied default probability, and an increase in the stability of
ratings and lower volatility of ratings-implied PDs, a somewhat desired property among users
of ratings.
       The appeal of scaled refined-ratings-based PDs is that they contain the same information
about the relative credit quality across issuers as refined ratings, but that their variation over
time, at least for average levels, tracks that of a point-in-time absolute measure of default risk.

Averaging (rather than scaling) refined-ratings-based PDs with EDFs is another attempt to
capture the cross-sectional ranking of firms provided by refined ratings with the time-series
properties of EDFs in one combined PD measure.
       For each alternative PD measure in Table 8, we use Equation (E.1) in the internet appendix
to convert observed PDs into spot default hazard rates, and then linearly interpolate hazard
rates across maturities.17 This allows us to compute estimates of y-year default probabilities
Et (Dt,t+y ) for any horizon y. Expected losses are calculated according to Equation (3), using
Markit estimates of recovery rates as before.
       Table C.3 in the internet appendix reports summary statistics for the various PD measures,
and Table C.4 reports on the associated estimates of expected loss rates and credit risk premia.
EDF-based estimates closely match those reported in Tables 2 and 3 for benchmark PDs.18
RMI-based PDs and expected loss rates tend to be smaller than their EDF-based counterparts,
especially between 2004 and 2005 and between 2013 and 2015. The di↵erences between RMI-
  17
     If the shortest observed horizon is one year, we assume that annualized spot default hazard rates for maturities
of less than one year are equal to one-year hazard rates.
  18
     Any di↵erences between the EDF statistics in Tables 2 and C.3 are due to the sample underpinning the
results in the latter table being somewhat smaller.



                                                         41
and EDF-based estimates are particularly pronounced for HY firms.
       Ratings-based and refined-ratings-based PD and expected loss estimators tend to be lower
than their EDF- and RMI-based counterparts for high-credit-quality firms, and substantially
higher than these counterparts for low-credit-quality firms. For example, the median ratings-
based expected loss rate for Caa-rated firms is 693 basis points, compared to 198 and 66 basis
points for EDF-based and RMI-based expected loss rates. Scaled refined-ratings-based PDs
have the same cross-sectional mean on each date as EDFs.19 Since the cross-sectional average of
EDFs is generally lower than its refined-ratings-based counterpart, scaled PDs tend to be lower
than their unscaled counterparts. Combined PDs fall between EDFs and refined-ratings-based
PDs. They tend to be higher (lower) than refined-ratings-based PDs for firms of high (low)
credit quality.
       Consistent with our estimates for expected default loss rates, the ratios of credit risk premia
to expected loss rates tend to be largest for RMI-based PDs and smallest for (refined) ratings-
based and for combined PDs.
       We re-estimate the panel data regressions (5) and (6) for the alternative expected loss mea-
sures. The corresponding results are summarized in Table 9, and reported in more detail in
Table C.5 in the internet appendix. To better facilitate comparisons across models, we replace
log CDS-to-expected-loss-rate ratios with log CDS rates as the dependent variable. With this,
the dependent variable is the same for all measures of expected loss rates. Despite the change
in the left-hand-side variable, the information content of the panel data regressions is preserved.
The only associated change in the estimated regression coefficients is that the coefficient for
log(ExpL) increases by one if log(C) is used as the dependent variable instead of log(C/ExpL).
       The univariate model, Specification I, explains 36% and 35% of the variation in log CDS rates
using, respectively, EDF- and RMI-based expected loss rates. Using ratings-based expected
  19
    To be precise, for each date t and maturity horizon y, the scaled refined-ratings-based PD of a firm is
computed by multiplying the refined-ratings-based estimate of Et (Dt,t+y ) for the firm with the ratio of the
cross-sectional mean of EDF-based estimates of Et (Dt,t+y ) to the cross-sectional mean of refined-ratings-based
estimates of Et (Dt,t+y ).

loss rates instead yields a substantially higher R2 : 53% for unadjusted ratings and 56% for
ratings adjusted for watchlist and outlook status. If refined-ratings-based PDs are adjusted
again by re-scaling them so as to have the same cross-sectional mean each date as EDFs, the
R2 increases from 56% to 62%. With over one million observations, this increase is rather
significant. Alternatively, if we adjust refined-ratings-based PDs by averaging them with EDFs,
the R2 increases from 56% to 59%. This suggests that there is market-relevant default risk
information in refined ratings that is not in EDFs, and vice versa.
    The RMSE of the regression is the same for log(C/ExpL) or log(C) as the dependent variable,


                                                         43
and it can be compared across model specifications and expected loss measures in Tables 5-7
and 9. When benchmark or EDF-based expected loss rates are replaced by their scaled refined-
ratings-based or combined-PD-based counterparts, the root-mean-squared prediction error is
lowered from above 0.80 to below 0.65, which translates into an incremental reduction in RMSE
in excess of 20%. Independent of the expected loss measure, however, the inclusion of firm and
month fixed e↵ects yields an RMSE of 0.41 or lower. Replacing firm and month fixed e↵ects by
the firm-specific and macroeconomic variables in Specification IX results in only slightly wider
error bands.
   Duffie et al. (2009) and Azizpour, Giesecke and Schwenkler (2017) find persistent variation
in the average rate of realized corporate defaults, in excess of that predicted by observable
variables. Among the additional sources of default clustering, they infer a significant latent
influence on realized default probabilities, a macroeconomic process that they call “frailty.” In
principle, some portion of what we have measured as credit risk premia could arise from mis-
specification of our measure ExpLt of the expected default loss rate, which does not include such
a latent frailty e↵ect. To address this concern, we use Moody’s Default & Recovery Database to
compute the predicted number of defaults among all rated firms using refined-ratings-based PD
estimates and compare this to the ex-post observed number of defaults. As shown in Figure C.9
in the internet appendix, we find that the ex-post observed number of defaults over the previous
year exceeds the number of defaults predicted at the beginning of that year following times
of significant market-wide distress, and that the number of realized defaults is lower than was
predicted during non-crisis periods.
   If market participants were indeed able to account for the role of latent factors that may
cause future default rates to deviate from those predicted by EDFs, RMI PDs or ratings-based
PDs, then our estimates of credit risk premia could potentially overestimate peak credit risk
premia and underestimate trough risk premia, and perhaps overestimate time-series variation
in credit risk premia.
   We define the frailty ratio FRt as the ratio of the observed number of defaults over the past


                                               44
twelve months among all rated firms to the number of defaults predicted at the beginning of the
same year, using PDs based on refined ratings.20 This ratio obviously involves a “look-ahead”
e↵ect that overstates the potential impact of frailty on the degree of variation over time in
expected loss rates. In order to gauge the potential impact of latent factors on our estimates of
credit risk premia, we therefore multiply expected loss rates ExpLt with the factor (1 + FRt )/2,
meaning we compute frailty-adjusted expected loss rates as the equally weighted average of
unadjusted expected loss rates ExpLt and adjusted expected loss rates FRt ⇥ ExpLt . We use
this rough frailty adjustment to test whether our overall finding of large variation over time in
credit risk premia survives after accounting for the potential impact of frailty.
       Figure C.9, in combination with Figure 1, suggests that the frailty ratio FRt tends to increase
with the expected loss rate ExpLt . As a consequence, the top panel of Figure C.10, shown in the
internet appendix, shows that our estimates of credit risk premia for the period 2002-03 tend
to be significantly lowered by the frailty adjustment. The same e↵ect occurs from mid-2008
to 2010. Conversely, this rough adjustment for frailty tends to increase estimated credit risk
premia at other times (when FRt < 1 but ExpLt is relatively small).
       The bottom panel of Figure C.10 shows median-firm ratios of credit risk premia to expected-
loss rates, before and after adjusting expected loss rates. These median ratios are significantly
reduced by the frailty adjustment in 2002-03 and from mid-2008 to 2010, and are significantly
increased at most other times. Even after accounting for this potential frailty bias in our
expected loss rates, there remains substantial time variation in credit risk premia relative to
expected loss rates.

7.2 Alternative Estimators of Loss Given Default

       We consider alternative estimates of loss given default, including (i) an assumption of con-
stant LGD, (ii) historical LGD estimates based on issuer-weighted averages dating back to
1982, (iii) trailing LGD estimates based on the previous year’s average recovery rate, and (iv)
  20
    We compute FRt separately for IG-rated firms and for HY-rated firms, allowing for potential di↵erences
across credit quality in the severity of the latent influence on realized default probabilities.


                                                   45
ratings-based LGD estimates. The latter take into account the timing of default. Details on
the definition of these alternative LGD measures are provided in Internet Appendix D, and
summary statistics are reported in Table C.6.
     The median expected loss given default is 0.60 for the benchmark specification, 0.62 under
the constant LGD assumption, 0.55 for historical LGD, 0.55 for trailing LGD, and 0.57 for
ratings-based LGD and a five-year-ahead time of default. Compared to benchmark, constant
and historical LGD estimates, trailing and ratings-based LGD estimates exhibit somewhat more
temporal and cross-sectional variation. Overall, however, the various LGD estimates are fairly
stable over time and across firms and default horizons.
     We re-estimate the panel data regressions (5) and (6) for the alternative LGD specifications.
The results are reported in Table C.7. The root mean squared errors remain nearly unchanged
from those shown in Tables 5 and 7 for the benchmark model.


8.    Concluding Remarks

     We quantify the level and degree of variation in credit risk premia, measured as the rate of
compensation for bearing default risk in excess of the expected rate of default loss. At each fixed
level of expected default loss rate, we find dramatic variation in these risk premia over time,
with peaks in 2002, during the 2008–09 global financial crisis (GFC), and in the second half
of 2011. A potential explanation for the comparatively high credit risk premia in 2002, during
the GFC, and in 2011, is that corporate debt and derivatives markets experienced significant
reductions in risk-bearing capacity, relative to the amount of risk to be borne at these times,
driving premia to comparatively high levels relative to the expected loss rates.
     The slow decline in credit market premia following the peaks in 2002, 2008 and 2011 is
consistent with frictions in the entry of new risk capital. Along the lines of the explanation
suggested by Froot and O’Connell (1999) for time variation in catastrophe insurance risk premia,
and by Duffie (2010) for asset markets more generally, capital moves into and out of the market
for corporate credit in response to fluctuations in the price of risk, but not instantaneously.

                                                46
Generally, when there are large losses or large increases in risk in a particular market segment,
if capital does not move immediately out of other asset markets and into that segment, then risk
premia would tend to adjust so as to match the demand for capital with the supply of capital
that is available to the sector. Investors or asset managers with available capital take time to
be found by intermediaries, to be convinced (perhaps being unfamiliar with the particular asset
class) of the available risk premia, and to exit from the markets in which they are currently
invested.
   We document that the time variation in the ratio of credit risk premia to expected default loss
rate is more pronounced for investment-grade firms than for high-yield firms. This is consistent
with the notion that during times of market-wide distress, risk-bearing capacity is reduced across
the credit quality spectrum, disproportionally increasing the price for bearing default risk, per
unit of default risk to be borne, for high-quality debt.
