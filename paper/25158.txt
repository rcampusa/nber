Tax Equivalences and their Implications

                                          ABSTRACT

In economic analyses of the effects of tax policies, one commonly encounters discussions of the
equivalence of apparently different policies, where equivalence is defined as the policies having
the same impact on fundamental economic outcomes. These related tax policies may differ in
many respects, which give rise to conditions under which the equivalences may break down.

This paper draws out the key issues that relate to tax equivalences, using several illustrations
from important instances of such equivalences that span different areas of taxation, with many of
these illustrations relating to the taxation of capital income. Recognition of equivalences and the
ways in which they may fail to hold is important both for positive analysis (e.g., the political
reasons for choosing one approach over another) and for normative analysis (to determine which
approach may be a more effective way of implementing a policy).

I. Introduction

In economic analyses of the effects of government policies, one commonly encounters

discussions of the equivalence of apparently different policies. Perhaps most familiar is that a

tax imposed on transactions in a market should have the same impact whether it is formally

levied on the consumer or the producer.




                                                                                   𝑆𝑆′

Fig. 1. A unit tax at rate 𝑡𝑡 on seller or buyer.


        As illustrated in Figure 1, the imposition of a unit tax at rate 𝑡𝑡 on sellers raises the supply

curve from 𝑆𝑆 to 𝑆𝑆′, whereas the same unit tax imposed on purchasers lowers the demand curve

from 𝐷𝐷 to 𝐷𝐷′. In each case, purchases fall from 𝑄𝑄0 to 𝑄𝑄1 , the tax-inclusive price paid by

purchasers rises to 𝑃𝑃2, the after-tax price received by sellers falls to 𝑃𝑃1 , and government

revenue equals 𝑡𝑡 ∙ 𝑄𝑄1 . The only difference between the two outcomes is that the observed

                                                                                                      1
market price falls to 𝑃𝑃1 when the tax is paid by consumers and rises to 𝑃𝑃2 when producer pay

the tax. This simple example illustrates the central elements of a tax equivalence: the budget

constraints and economic incentives of agents and the government are unaffected, as is the

resulting equilibrium, even though market prices may differ. It follows from the equivalence

that the incidence and efficiency effects of the two tax policies are the same as well, regardless

of the behavioral elasticities of individuals and firms, because these elasticities apply equally

across different versions of the equivalent policy.

       Implicit in this equivalence is the absence of real-world factors that might cause it to

break down, such as restrictions on the movement of market prices (for example, a minimum

wage or frictions that result from bargaining institutions), differences in the salience of the two

taxes among market participants, and differences in the costs of taxpayer compliance or tax

administration. Without any such differences, the choice between the two approaches would

be arbitrary. With them, there might be an advantage to adopting one approach rather than

the other, which is a good reason for identifying an equivalence in the first place. For distinct

reasons, for example if one approach causes taxes to be more hidden than the other does,

there could be differences in political appeal.

       Equivalences among different approaches to taxation are common in the literature, but

analyses that discuss them generally focus on one particular market context, such as

international trade, labor markets, or saving and investment. 1 The objective of the broader

review that follows is to draw out the main issues that relate to tax equivalences, using several

illustrations from important instances of such equivalences that span different areas of

taxation. In addition, although most of the equivalences discussed below have appeared in the


                                                                                                    2
previous literature, a number of them will be unfamiliar to many readers. This lack of

familiarity has contributed to erroneous arguments regarding the properties and relative

attractiveness of different taxes, particularly in cases where new approaches to taxation have

been the subject of discussion.

       Drawing on different examples, the next section of the paper reviews the types of

differences that might arise between otherwise equivalent tax systems, i.e., factors that might

contribute to making an equivalence less than exact and hence relevant to the design of tax

policy. Section III uses illustrations of such differences to demonstrate how they matter in the

implementation of tax policy. Many of the equivalences introduced in sections II and III

concern the taxation of capital income and the relationship among different taxes bases, such

as wealth, capital income, consumption, and cash flow. Section IV provides some concluding

comments.

       While the analysis will cover many important tax equivalences, the aim here is not to

provide a comprehensive catalog. In addition, we leave aside other important areas of policy

equivalence. One such area, covered only briefly below, is between tax-based and spending-

based policies, associated with the concept of “tax expenditures.” Another is between tax-

based and regulation-based policies. Familiar examples here include the classic equivalence

between tariffs and quotas in international trade, those between environmental polices based

on taxes and quantity restrictions (as discussed in Weitzman 1974), and indeed the recently

litigated one between mandates and taxes in health insurance markets. Although the paper

will not discuss these categories of policy equivalences directly, we note that many of the issues

considered here carry over to these other contexts, and that many of this paper’s lessons apply.


                                                                                                   3
II. Differences Relevant to Tax Equivalences

In addition to which side of a market faces the tax, there are many other differences relevant

when considering tax equivalences. We discuss these differences in this section, while

maintaining the assumption of perfect competition, information, etc., deferring until the next

section how real-world considerations may cause the equivalences to break down. As we

show, several of these differences may apply simultaneously to a particular tax equivalence.


A. Differences in Form or Characterization

Perhaps the closest equivalences involve taxes assessed in the same manner on the same

individuals, but with some superficial difference in form or characterization. One such

equivalence relates to whether a tax benefit is delivered as a tax credit or as tax deduction (or

exclusion). For any given tax rate, 𝑡𝑡, a deduction or exclusion from the tax base of an amount is

equivalent to a fractional tax credit on that amount at a rate equal to the tax rate; e.g., a

taxpayer facing a 15 percent marginal tax rate would receive the same benefit from a deduction

and a 15 percent tax credit. Naturally, for a progressive tax system, equivalence to a deduction

would generally require a schedule of credit rates increasing with income, a point often made

when comparing the distributional effects of credits versus deductions.

       Another equivalence with respect to form involves the imposition of a tax on a tax-

exclusive basis versus a tax-inclusive basis, i.e., having the tax apply to gross expenditures

(including tax) or net expenditures (excluding tax). A tax at rate 𝑡𝑡 applied on a tax-inclusive
                                     𝑡𝑡
basis is equivalent to a tax at rate 1−𝑡𝑡 applied on a tax-exclusive basis. As an illustration, one

could impose a consumption tax of 25 percent on a tax-exclusive basis or at 20 percent on a


                                                                                                      4
tax-inclusive basis. It is sometimes more natural to use one approach or the other. For

example, as laid out in Andrews (1974), one might tax consumption through a personal tax on

income used to finance consumption expenditures (i.e., by providing a deduction under an

income tax for net saving). For this, a tax-inclusive approach would be more natural: if income

(𝑌𝑌) is exhausted by consumption (𝐶𝐶), savings (𝑆𝑆) and taxes (𝑇𝑇), so that 𝑌𝑌 = 𝐶𝐶 + 𝑆𝑆 + 𝑇𝑇, then a

tax on income less savings is a tax on 𝐶𝐶 + 𝑇𝑇. It would be more natural to implement a

consumption tax taking the form of a retail sales tax on a tax-exclusive basis (as sales taxes

currently are), adding the tax to the net-of-tax price of consumption goods and services.

       There is a one-to-one correspondence between tax-inclusive and tax-exclusive rates and

hence no evident importance whether one uses a tax-inclusive or tax-exclusive approach.

Unfortunately, even this equivalence can be misunderstood, as appears to have been the case

during the U.S. debate over a national retail sales tax, for which proponents sometimes

expressed the rate on a tax-inclusive basis, contrary to the common sales-tax approach that

others might have inferred was being used (Gale 2005).

       A related distinction involves whether prices are quoted inclusive or exclusive of tax. In

the United States, goods subject to retail sales taxes (RSTs) have their prices quoted exclusive of

tax, while excise taxes are included in listed prices, which is also the case for value added taxes

(VATs) in place outside the United States. This distinction closely tracks whether the tax is

assessed on sellers or buyers, but, in principle, one could have prices quoted as inclusive of tax

even if the formal tax liability were on buyers.

       The comparison between a proportional retail sales tax and a proportional personal

consumption tax highlights another minor distinction between otherwise equivalent taxes,


                                                                                                        5
namely between indirect and direct taxes, the former (in this case, the sales tax) applying to

transactions and the latter (the personal consumption tax) applying to individuals (or, in other

instances, businesses). As the retail sales tax is legally an obligation of individual purchasers,

both taxes are proportional taxes on consumption assessed on individuals – the same tax rate,

tax base, and taxpayer. Yet, the direct-indirect distinction is relevant in law, perhaps because in

practice, direct and indirect taxes have usually differed in more substantive ways as well.

Through treaties and other international agreements, this legal distinction between direct and

indirect taxes has the potential to introduce real differences in economic impact even in cases

where none would exist otherwise.

       A more substantive economic difference in form occurs between unit taxes (also called

specific taxes) and ad valorem taxes. Unit taxes are assessed per unit of quantity, 𝑞𝑞, while ad

valorem taxes are assessed per unit of expenditure, 𝑝𝑝⋅ 𝑞𝑞. For any given price, 𝑝𝑝, a unit tax at
                                                   𝑡𝑡
rate t is equivalent to an ad valorem tax at rate 𝑝𝑝.

       Finally, one tax may be equivalent to a combination of other taxes. Notably, it would be

possible to implement the VAT as the combination of two taxes, one a proportional tax on

wages and the other a proportional tax, at the same rate, on the non-wage components of

value added. This equivalence is at the heart of flat tax proposals, as in Hall and Rabushka

(1983). These authors’ reason for breaking up the two pieces of the VAT was to facilitate a shift

in the location of the wage component to the individual level from the firm – to the other side

of the labor market, leaving only a cash-flow tax at the business level. 2 However, this second

step does not inherently follow the first: one could implement the two taxes separately at the

business level.

                                                                                                     6
       Another familiar equivalence between one tax policy and a combination of others, in the

international trade context, is between a tariff on imported goods and the combination of a tax

on all domestic sales and a domestic production subsidy at the same rate, since aggregate

domestic sales equals the sum of sales by foreign sellers and those by domestic sellers.

       Yet another important example of the equivalence of one policy instrument and a

combination of others involves investment incentives, such as an investment tax credit or an

accelerated schedule of depreciation allowances. Since these incentives lower the present

value of taxes associated with new investment, which, as discussed below, is equivalent to

reducing the tax rate on the income from such investment, one may think of them as a

combination of (1) a reduction in taxes on the income from old and new capital; and (2) an

offsetting tax increase on the income from old capital (or, alternatively, a capital levy on the

value of old capital).


B. Differences in Entities

There are cases in which a given tax may be collected from more than one entity. For example,

individuals may pay taxes related to their assets or associated income directly, as individual

taxpayers, or indirectly through the entities or accounts they own, such as corporations or

retirement accounts. In other cases, even where individuals own businesses that receive and

report the income, the income is taxed directly to the individuals, through pass-through

treatment.

       Another example concerns the individual income tax, which is assessed on individuals

but, through withholding, collected and remitted by employers. The same is true with the

employee portion of the OASDHI payroll tax.

                                                                                                   7
C. Differences in Markets

Consider a one-period model in which individuals earn labor income and use their income to

purchase two consumption goods, so that the budget constraint in the absence of taxation is


       𝑝𝑝1 𝑐𝑐1 + 𝑝𝑝2 𝑐𝑐2 = 𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤,                                                              (1)


where 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 and 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 are the price and quantity of good-𝑖𝑖 consumption, 𝑤𝑤 is the wage rate and 𝐿𝐿 is

labor supply. Even though labor income taxes and consumption taxes are imposed in different

markets (for labor and consumption goods), it is easy to see in this model that proportional

taxes on labor and consumption are equivalent, with this equivalence working through the

individual’s budget constraint.

       A tax on labor income at rate 𝑡𝑡 multiplies the right-hand side of the budget constraint by

(1 − 𝑡𝑡), and a uniform, proportional tax on consumption at rate τ divides the left-hand side of

the budget constraint by (1 − τ) (assuming that both are imposed on a tax inclusive basis.)

Setting τ = 𝑡𝑡 leaves the individual with the same budget constraint and provides the

government with the same amount of tax revenue.

       Note that the equivalence between the two taxes in this example does not require the

observed price level to be the same in the two cases. For example, if the wage rate paid by

firms and the prices received by them were fixed in nominal terms, a sales tax added to

producer prices would raise the consumer price level, while a tax subtracted from employee

wages would not. But relative prices (between the two goods and between each good and

labor, and hence the real wage) are still the same in the two cases.




                                                                                                       8
D. Differences in Timing

Tax policies may also differ with respect to the timing of tax payments. The equivalence

between proportional taxes on labor income and consumption just discussed carries over in a

life-cycle model in which individuals neither leave nor receive bequests. In a two-period

version of that model, in which the individual is retired in the second period and there is one

consumption good in each period, the lifetime budget constraint without taxes is


                  1
       𝑝𝑝1 𝑐𝑐1 + 1+𝑟𝑟 𝑝𝑝2 𝑐𝑐2 = 𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤,                                                          (2)


where 𝑟𝑟 is the interest rate, the two consumption goods from expression (1) are reinterpreted

as first- and second-period consumption, and 𝐿𝐿 is first-period labor supply. As in the previous

example, the individual and government budget constraints are the same – in this case in

present value – under equal-rate consumption and labor income taxes.

       A slight modification of the budget constraint in (2) applies when the individual starts

period 1 with initial assets, which may be interpreted as an inheritance, access to above-market

rates of return, or rents, on certain investments of fixed size, or, in the analysis of a tax reform,

as the asset accumulated by the individual in past periods. For the budget constraint,


                  1
       𝑝𝑝1 𝑐𝑐1 + 1+𝑟𝑟 𝑝𝑝2 𝑐𝑐2 = 𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤 + 𝐴𝐴,                                                     (3)


the tax on consumption is equivalent to the combination of two other taxes, on labor income

and initial assets. This distinction between wage taxes and consumption taxes – the capital levy

on initial wealth – features prominently in discussions of the efficiency and distributional

properties of the adoption of a consumption tax (e.g., Auerbach and Kotlikoff 1987). Indeed,


                                                                                                        9
this is the same distinction as in the case of investment incentives versus reductions in capital

income taxes, given the saving-investment identity and the fact that consumption equals

income less saving.

       Of course, whether the component 𝐴𝐴 in the budget constraint in (3) is truly exogenous

from a broader perspective, for example taking account of previous decisions regarding saving

or the location of investment that would be influenced by an anticipated tax on 𝐴𝐴, plays an

important role in how one interprets potential efficiency effects.


E. Portfolio Adjustments

In the previous equivalence example, the individual and the government both have the same

present-value budget constraints across tax systems, but translating these budget constraints

into the same economic outcome requires additional adjustments to private and government

saving. The individual must save more under a consumption tax than under a wage tax to

achieve the same first-and second-period consumption, because some tax payments are

deferred under a consumption tax. Likewise, the government must save less under the

consumption tax, which provides it with some resources in the second period. There is no

difference in national saving between the two cases, just the division of national saving

between private and public saving. (This illustrates the limited usefulness of focusing on how

tax policies affect specific components of saving.)

       A more complex response is needed in cases where there is uncertainty, as the impact

of tax systems on the riskiness of assets may call for changes not only in the level of saving but

also with regard to portfolio composition. 3 To focus specifically on this issue, suppose that in

the two-period budget constraint both labor and first period consumption are fixed, so that the

                                                                                                    10
individual saves a fixed amount, 𝑉𝑉, allocating a share 𝑎𝑎 to a risky asset yielding a stochastic

return 𝑥𝑥 and a share (1 − 𝑎𝑎) to a safe asset yielding a certain return 𝑟𝑟. Then, without taxes,

second-period consumption equals 𝑉𝑉 multiplied by [1 + 𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 + (1 − 𝑎𝑎)𝑟𝑟]. If a proportional

income tax at rate 𝑡𝑡 is imposed on excess returns – those returns above the rate 𝑟𝑟 – then the

expression for second-period consumption becomes 𝑉𝑉⋅[1 + 𝑟𝑟 + 𝑎𝑎(𝑥𝑥 − 𝑟𝑟)(1 − 𝑡𝑡)]. It follows

that the individual can achieve the same outcome as in the absence of taxation by increasing
                                                              𝑎𝑎
the portfolio share invested in the risky asset from 𝑎𝑎 to   1−𝑡𝑡
                                                                    . From the government’s

perspective, the same adjustment in reverse will be needed to maintain the original level of risk

in the government’s revenue stream (assuming that combining different taxpayers’ risky tax

payments results in no additional risk-pooling 4). That is, the government will need to shift

some of its investment portfolio from risky to safe assets, as might be achieved, for example, by

reducing government borrowing – which makes the government’s net position in safe assets

less negative – and at the same time reducing public investment, which type of investment

presumably yields uncertain returns.

        If a tax on excess returns has no impact on individual or government budget constraints,

it follows that a tax on all returns, equal to a tax on the risk-free and excess return components,

is equivalent to a tax only on the risk-free components. This tax on risk-free returns, in turn, is

equivalent to a tax on wealth, following the equivalence between unit and ad valorem taxes

discussed above, since a tax at rate 𝑡𝑡 on returns at the risk-free rate on wealth, 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟, is equivalent

to a tax at rate 𝑡𝑡⋅𝑟𝑟 on wealth itself, 𝑉𝑉.




                                                                                                    11
III. Tax Equivalences and the Implementation of Tax Policy

If all of the conditions for complete equivalence held, then it would be a matter of indifference

through which equivalent version a particular tax policy were implemented. It is through the

exceptions to equivalence that choices among otherwise equivalent policies matter.


A. Perception and Salience

Otherwise-equivalent taxes may differ in how they are perceived by market participants or by

those engaged in the political process. As to the former, empirical evidence (Chetty, Looney,

and Kroft 2009) suggests that taxes included in prices (e.g., excise taxes) have a larger impact

on consumer responses than those that are added to seller-quoted prices (e.g., sales taxes).

Lower salience can have complex effects on a policy’s desirability, reducing deadweight loss

because of a lower sensitivity to taxation but increasing it through a misallocation of household

budget constraints. In addition, to the extent that salience differs among households, the use

of less salient forms of taxation may have adverse distributional consequences (Goldin and

Homonoff 2013). Rees-Jones and Taubinsky (2018) describe the various ways in which salience

and other psychological biases may cause equivalences to break down, and emphasize the

importance of considering the actual tax policies being implemented, rather than the

underlying incentives and budget sets that may establish policies as equivalent.

       As distinct from how psychological factors may influence the behavior of direct market

participants, such factors may also lead the political process to treat economically equivalent

taxes differently, possibly influencing the form of policies adopted. A common reference here

is the distinction between the employer and employee components of the payroll tax, both of

which are withheld by the employer prior to paying workers but which are officially assessed on
                                                                                                   12
different sides of the labor market. Even though we lack strong evidence that these

components affect labor outcomes differently simply because of the side of the market on

which they are imposed (except in specific cases where wage adjustments are difficult, as

where minimum wages intervene or where differential wage changes would be required) 5, the

durability of these separate components suggests that statutory incidence is politically quite

relevant, perhaps because policy equivalences are not sufficiently evident or well-understood.

       Standard conventions for analyzing the distributional effects of taxes may also

contribute to perceived differences. For example, in earlier years it was common for U.S.

government agencies not to allocate corporate taxes to individual taxpayers for purposes of

analyzing the distributional effects of taxes. This meant that equivalent tax policies, such as a

corporate tax reduction for dividends paid and a shareholder tax reduction for dividends

received, would have been treated quite differently, being ignored in the former case and

included in the latter case. More recently, the convention of viewing a standard VAT as a tax on

retail sales borne by consumers, but the components of the two-part VAT (described above) as,

respectively, taxes falling on asset owners and on workers, helped sow confusion over the

distributional effects of a business cash-flow tax, i.e., the first component of the two-part VAT

(Viard 2018).

       Just as differences in the statutory incidence of taxes may affect perceptions of these

taxes, so may the distinction as to whether policy changes are classified as affecting taxes or

transfer payments. In 1993, for example, this labeling choice resulted in an argument in

Congress about whether to characterize the pending increase in the taxation of social security

benefits (from 50 percent to 85 percent of benefits subject to tax, over an exempt threshold) as


                                                                                                    13
a tax increase or as a reduction in government spending, given its equivalence to a policy of

reducing social security benefits. Potentially hinging on the choice of terminology was one’s

conclusion about the policy’s impact on the “size of government,” which some would see a

benefit cut (but not a tax increase) as reducing, based on measuring the size of government

using the level of government spending. A similar issue arises with the Earned Income Tax

Credit, which for budget scoring purposes is divided between a tax reduction and a component

of government spending depending on whether a recipient receives a net payment from the

government (which is treated as spending), but which also could be implemented solely as an

expenditure-based transfer program.


B. Market Imperfections

Tax equivalences may also break down when market imperfections are present. It may be

possible to lessen the impact of such imperfections by choosing a particular version of a tax

policy. We focus on three types of imperfections below: liquidity constraints, incomplete

private risk-pooling, and private-sector market power.

1. Liquidity Constraints

When households or firms face liquidity constraints, shifting tax liability to periods when such

constraints are relaxed may improve market outcomes. As emphasized by Hubbard and Judd

(1986), this could change one’s conclusions about tax policies that shift the timing of tax

payments. From the perspective of equivalent taxes, it could introduce a difference between

two systems that differ only with respect to timing. For example, in the pure life-cycle model

with no initial assets (i.e., for the lifetime budget constraint in expression (2)), individuals facing

liquidity constraints in the first period would fare worse under a labor income tax than under a
                                                                                                    14
consumption tax, which shifts some of their tax liabilities to the second period, after they have

accumulated assets.

        Liquidity constraints may influence firms as well. Consider the case of the incentive to

invest, which according to standard analysis depends on the present value of depreciation

deductions, but not their timing. Under this standard analysis, immediate expensing of

investment is equivalent to following a standard pattern of depreciation deductions over time,

but with an additional deduction for the nominal rate of interest multiplied by the

undepreciated asset basis in each year (Boadway and Bruce 1984). That is, rather than

receiving an immediate deduction of the cost of investment, writing off the asset at some

geometric rate, α, leaves an undepreciated basis of 𝑒𝑒 −𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼 and a depreciation allowance of 𝛼𝛼𝑒𝑒 −𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼

at date 𝑡𝑡 per dollar of initial investment. Providing the taxpayer also with a deduction for the

nominal interest rate, 𝑟𝑟, multiplied by the undepreciated basis yields a total deduction at date
                                                                            ∞
𝑡𝑡 of (𝑟𝑟 + 𝛼𝛼)𝑒𝑒 −𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼 . The present value of all such deductions is ∫0 𝑒𝑒 −𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 (𝑟𝑟 + 𝛼𝛼)𝑒𝑒 −𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 = 1, the

same value as under immediate expensing. 6

        If firms are liquidity constrained, though, expensing or other investment incentives that

are more “front-loaded” may be more effective in stimulating investment. There is convincing

evidence that liquidity-constrained firms respond more strongly than other firms to up-front

investment incentives such as expensing and “bonus” depreciation (which allows firms a

fractional immediate write-off of qualifying investment expenses). This response does not

occur simply through a reduction in the present value of taxes, but due to a shift in the timing

of taxes as well (Zwick and Mahon 2017).




                                                                                                                    15
2. Incomplete Risk-Pooling

To the extent that private markets do not efficiently pool risks, taxes that shift risks from

taxpayers to the government may reduce aggregate risk. In this case, the tax on all returns to

investment would no longer be equivalent to a tax only on the risk-free rate of return, contrary

to the result discussed earlier. Taxing all returns would reduce aggregate risk, through the

pooling of the investment risks faced by taxpayers.

       However, one needs to ask why markets may inefficiently pool risk. To the extent that

risk-pooling would harm economic incentives (for example, in the case of entrepreneurs whose

effort may influence the distribution of risky outcomes), efficiency may call for incomplete risk-

pooling. In such cases, lessening an individual’s exposure to risk through taxation could have

the same negative effect as further private risk-pooling.

3. Market Power

When firms have market power, certain tax equivalences break down and leave one alternative

preferable to the other. For example, the equivalence between unit and ad valorem taxes

relies on the assumption that firms are price-takers. If firms are not, then they will consider the

sensitivity of profits to variations in price, which ad valorem taxes dampen because they are

imposed in relation to prices. This can lead to lower prices and more output under ad valorem

taxes than under unit taxes (Delipalla and Keen 1992).

       Another aspect of imperfect competition is the presence of non-competitive rents

earned by firms. In this case, the equivalence between expensing of new investment and

imposing no tax on the returns to such investment breaks down, as with expensing there is no

tax in present value on the returns to marginal investment but there is a tax on investments

                                                                                                 16
yielding above-market returns. For an investment with cash flows 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 at each date 𝑖𝑖, allowance

of investment expensing results in a cash-flow tax. Under a cash-flow tax, the government

taxes positive flows and negative flows (i.e., investment costs) at a common tax rate 𝑡𝑡. This

means that from the investor’s point of view all cash flows are all multiplied by (1 − 𝑡𝑡), so that

after-tax cash flows at each date are (1 − 𝑡𝑡)𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 . Thus, there is no change in the present value of

investments with a before-tax present value of zero, for (1 − 𝑡𝑡) multiplied by zero is still zero.

Hence, the cash-flow tax is equivalent, except for timing, to imposing no tax on returns to

marginal investments. On the other hand, positive present-value investments are reduced in

value by a factor of 𝑡𝑡. This means not only that the positive returns to past investments will be

taxed – in present value, there is a capital levy on returns to “old” capital, for which past

investments receive no expensing deduction – but also that future rents will be taxed as well.

       This ability to capture a portion of rents using a cash-flow tax holds if the tax is imposed

at the firm level. Unless the firm is taxed on a pass-through basis, the timing of such rent

taxation will differ for taxation at the individual level. Without rents, a cash-flow tax at the firm

level and at the shareholder level would be equivalent, assuming the same rate of tax and that

the value of the firm equals the value of its assets. It would not matter if cash flowing into the

firm were deducted by the individual owner or by the firm itself, or whether cash flowing out of

the firm were taxable to the firm or to the ultimate recipient. However, if rents are present at

the firm level, this equivalence is altered, for the value of the firm should include the capitalized

value of its rents. 7 Hence, rents would face no tax at the individual level once they have been

capitalized, with the tax on such capitalized rents being paid in advance by those original

shareholders who owned the firm when the capitalization occurred. This difference in timing


                                                                                                   17
need not break the equivalence, if tax rates remain constant over time; nor would the incidence

of the taxes differ, in both cases falling on the original shareholders, as future taxes imposed at

the firm level would be taken into account in the determination of the value at which they

could sell their shares.


C. Government Accounting and Budget Rules

Equivalences among different policies may also break down because of government accounting

and budget rules and conventions. For example, having different rules that apply to transfer

payments and taxes can disrupt the equivalence between a reduction in benefits and a tax on

those benefits. However, perhaps the biggest impact of government accounting, for policies

that differ with respect to timing, comes from the use of a limited time horizon, in particular

the focus on revenues over a one-year, five-year or ten-year period. With budget

measurement that applies only through a certain date, policies that shift revenue losses outside

the budget window relax the constraints that legislators face. 8 The creation and expansion of

so-called “Roth” accounts for retirement saving owe much to this motive, as do tax incentives

for conversion of other retirement accounts into Roth accounts.

       Roth accounts follow the TEE (Taxable/Exempt/Exempt) pattern of taxation with respect

to the three phases of saving: initial contributions, inside build-up during the accumulation

period, and withdrawals, respectively. This is in contrast to the EET approach traditionally

followed for pensions and other retirement accounts such as IRAs and 401(k) plans. The

approaches are economically equivalent if the tax rate does not change over time, another

instance of the equivalence between cash-flow taxation and tax exemption. The equivalence

here also relies on the additional but reasonable assumptions that there are no rents earned by

                                                                                                  18
investors themselves in making passive retirement-account investments and that government

taxation of ex post returns from such investments under the EET approach does not improve

risk-pooling.

         However, when the budget window is truncated, the government revenue losses

associated with the Roth accounts are understated relative to those following the traditional

timing of tax payments. Relative to a full, present-value accounting of the revenue costs of

adopting tax-favored saving accounts, the TEE approach understates the cost, by ignoring

future revenue losses, while the EET approach overstates the cost, by ignoring future revenue

recoupment.

         A related example comes from the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which was constructed to

have a balanced revenue impact over a five-year budget window. In that setting, a policy of

eliminating the investment tax credit and lowering the corporate tax rate on new investment to

maintain the same present value of taxes on such investment would have shown a revenue

gain, with the tax cuts on the income from the first five years’ investment falling to some extent

outside the budget window and the tax increase from eliminating the investment tax credit

falling fully within the budget window. This may have influenced the ultimate policy outcome,

which was to reduce the corporate income tax rate (on all investment) while eliminating the

investment tax credit, a policy that provided windfalls to existing capital (i.e., a reverse of the

capital levy that would have resulted from increasing the investment tax credit and the

corporate tax rate) while actually raising the effective tax rate on new investment (Auerbach

1987).




                                                                                                      19
       To the extent that distributional analysis of tax policies adheres to the limited-budget-

window approach, one encounters the same problem that fundamentally equivalent polices

may be perceived (or at least reported) as being quite different. For example, given that

retirement saving is concentrated among higher-income individuals, the distributional impact of

the EET approach will appear less progressive than it is, and less progressive than the TEE

approach, because it will show tax deductions during the budget window while ignoring the

eventual tax payments made on withdrawals outside the budget window.

       In addition to government accounting, private accounting conventions may also

influence how otherwise equivalent tax policies are viewed. One important example is the

treatment of tax benefits based on timing, such as accelerated depreciation, which do not

affect measured tax rates in public financial statements, because in such statements the time

value of money is ignored in the computation of the deferred tax liabilities arising from

accelerating deductions. This convention makes investment incentives provided through

accelerated depreciation appear different in companies’ financial statements from direct tax

rate reductions, even if the present value of tax benefits is the same for the two policies.

Companies seeking to report higher after-tax earnings may prefer tax rate reductions to

accelerated depreciation for this reason, even if other factors (such as liquidity constraints)

might point in the other direction; and this preference may have political consequences as well.

As with government accounting rules and conventions, financial accounting procedures may

affect both private decisions and political outcomes.




                                                                                                   20
D. Tax Administration

Differences among otherwise equivalent taxes arise in many dimensions relating to the ease of

administering and enforcing tax systems as well as the costs of compliance to taxpayers. We

consider three such dimensions below, relating to a tax system’s self-correcting features (its

ability to adapt to changes in economic conditions without being explicitly modified), the costs

of enforcement and compliance, and, especially, the information required by the government

for its implementation.

1. Self-Correcting Features

Tax systems that respond automatically to fluctuations in the economy or a taxpayer’s

individual circumstances have an administrative advantage over those requiring explicit

adjustment on the part of the government.

        One challenge from the economic environment is inflation, which causes problems with

measuring the tax base as well as with adjusting the tax schedule. Measuring the tax base is

especially a problem for capital income, where nominal income must be adjusted for changes in

the purchasing power of assets over time. For example, the present value of historic-cost

depreciation allowances, 𝐷𝐷(𝑡𝑡) at each date 𝑡𝑡, permitted over time per unit cost of an asset
                                ∞
purchased at date 0, equals ∫0 𝑒𝑒 −𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 𝐷𝐷(𝑡𝑡)𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 , where 𝑟𝑟 is the nominal discount factor. As the

inflation rate rises, so does r, and this reduces the present value of depreciation deductions,

even if the real interest rate is unaffected. This problem motivated the proposal by Auerbach

and Jorgenson (1980) for “first-year capital recovery” – permitting firms to deduct in the year of

an asset’s purchase the present value of depreciation allowances, calculated using an assumed



                                                                                                       21
real interest rate, equal to the nominal discount rate 𝑟𝑟 minus the inflation rate π, or

  ∞
∫0 𝑒𝑒 −(𝑟𝑟−𝜋𝜋)𝑡𝑡 𝐷𝐷(𝑡𝑡)𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 .

          In the absence of inflation, the two approaches – actual deduction of depreciation

allowances over time, and up-front deduction of the present value of these depreciation

allowances – would yield the same deduction, in present value. In the presence of inflation, it

would be necessary to index depreciation allowances for inflation – to multiply them by 𝑒𝑒 −𝜋𝜋𝜋𝜋 –

for the present value of allowances to equal those provided by first-year capital recovery,
  ∞                               ∞
∫0 𝑒𝑒 −𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 𝑒𝑒 𝜋𝜋𝜋𝜋 𝐷𝐷(𝑡𝑡)𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 = ∫0 𝑒𝑒 −(𝑟𝑟−𝜋𝜋)𝑡𝑡 𝐷𝐷(𝑡𝑡)𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 .

          As for adjusting the tax schedule, this presents another difference between ad valorem

and unit taxes. Whereas ad valorem taxes rise in proportion to prices, and so maintain their

real value as prices rise, unit taxes do not, making continual adjustments necessary, which may

be particularly burdensome in economies with high rates of inflation.

          Another issue of self-correction relates to the fact that the income tax has a progressive

marginal tax rate schedule applied on an annual basis. Because of this convexity in the tax

schedule, for individuals with the same average income over time, those with fluctuating

incomes face higher average tax rates than those with stable incomes. Here, the EET approach

to pension taxation may be preferable to the TEE approach, although the ability to choose

between the two may provide a further improvement in performance.

          Consider, again, the two-period life-cycle model in which individuals work and save for

retirement in the first period and consume in both periods. Under the EET approach, the first-

period tax base equals wage income less saving, or the amount of first-period consumption

expenditure, and the second-period tax base equals the amount of second-period consumption

                                                                                                  22
expenditure. Thus, if the household smooths consumption fully, the tax base will be the same

in both periods. Under the TEE approach, by contrast, the first-period tax base will be higher –

equal to all wage income – and the second-period tax base lower – in this case equal to zero.

Thus, the EET approach incorporates an automatic income-averaging feature that is absent

under the TEE approach.

       While the EET approach results in complete smoothing of the tax base in this simple

case, it would not do so if a taxpayer’s preferences led to a rising or falling consumption profile,

or in cases of year-to-year fluctuations in consumption expenditures. For the general case, one

could improve smoothing simply by giving the taxpayer a choice between the TEE and EET

approaches each year. For example, having a choice would facilitate shifting the tax base to

years with low consumer expenditures by using the TEE approach in those years. Indeed,

making this choice available was suggested in U.S. Treasury (1977) for implementing a personal

consumption tax, under which all saving would be tax-favored, following either the EET or the

TEE approach. 9

2. Enforcement and Compliance

Even though taxes may have the same impact in a world of costless enforcement and complete

information, in a realistic setting important differences may arise.

       One difference involves the identity of the person or entity with either the statutory

responsibility for a tax or the obligation to remit the tax (as in the case of firms that withhold

and remit income taxes on behalf of individual taxpayers who have the statutory responsibility

for the taxes). In many situations, it is easier to monitor firms than individuals.




                                                                                                     23
       Another difference relates to the incentives for taxpayer compliance. A classic

illustration is the difference between the VAT and the RST. From national income accounting,

we know that final consumption equals value added less investment, government purchases,

and net exports:


       𝐶𝐶 = 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺 − 𝐼𝐼 − 𝐺𝐺 – (𝑋𝑋 – 𝑀𝑀).                                                   (4)


Hence, there is an equivalence between a VAT and an RST, which is imposed directly on

consumption. One may express this equivalence in terms of a series of switches in tax liability,

from seller to buyer, for each intermediate transaction in the value-added chain, starting from

the VAT. This cascade of switches from seller to buyer at each successive stage, none of which

affects the equilibrium outcome, ultimately concentrates the entire tax liability at the last point

of sale, as under the RST. However, under a credit-invoice VAT, each successive seller is able to

deduct purchased inputs from the tax base only by presenting evidence that tax was previously

paid on the sales of such inputs, providing a third-party enforcement mechanism that is absent

under the RST.

3. Information

In addition to ease of enforcement, some versions of equivalent tax systems require less

information on the part of government than other versions. One may think of this, ultimately,

as an issue of enforcement as well, although it is useful to understand the sources of

enforcement challenges. Many of the illustrations below involve some form of cash-flow

taxation, which is endowed with the natural informational advantage of being based only on

observable cash flows.


                                                                                                  24
       Consider the taxation of consumption, which as just discussed could be implemented

through a VAT. Leaving aside the tax exemption for government purchases (which, for a unified

government, is of no consequence, as it amounts to a government paying taxes to itself) and

the exemption for net exports – to which we return below – a VAT amounts to a tax on income

net of investment. Income may be broken into wage and non-wage components, and thus one

may implement the consumption tax as a cash-flow tax on non-wage income net of investment,

𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺 − 𝐼𝐼 – 𝑊𝑊, plus a tax on wages, 𝑊𝑊. As mentioned earlier, one may tax these two

components separately, as under a flat tax, but unless they face different rates of tax (as they

would under a flat tax), this separation is unnecessary. Indeed, VATs as traditionally

implemented do not distinguish between wage and non-wage components of value added.

       As already discussed, a business cash-flow tax – the non-wage component of the VAT –

effectively exempts the safe rate of return to investment, but not rents. To the extent that

rents are not important (as in the case of passive investments), one could also exempt the safe

rate of return simply by imposing a zero tax rate on returns to capital. However, imposing a

zero tax rate on returns to capital and a positive tax rate on wages requires that the

government be able to distinguish between capital income and labor income, whereas this is

not necessary under a VAT or other forms of consumption taxation, such as a personal

consumption tax, which tax expenditures rather than income. A consumption tax approach to

exempting the return to capital alleviates the need to distinguish between capital and labor

income, and is not subject to the argument against exempting returns to capital based on the

concern that taxpayers will attempt to disguise labor income as capital income to achieve a

lower tax rate. Put another way, a business cash-flow tax falls on all returns in excess of the


                                                                                                   25
safe rate, including rents as well as disguised labor income, in addition to the returns to risk-

taking.

          Another illustration of differential information requirements in equivalent tax systems

arises with respect to the taxation of capital gains. A problematic feature of capital gains

taxation is the realization doctrine, under which capital gains are taxed only when assets are

sold and the gains “realized.” Because delaying realization allows an investor to defer tax on

gains already accrued, this causes a “lock-in” effect, an economic distortion whereby investors

continue to hold assets that they otherwise would wish to sell.

          A potential solution to the lock-in effect is to tax capital gains on accrual or, to deal with

possible liquidity problems coming from having to pay taxes before assets are sold, to continue

taxing gains upon realization but with an annual interest charge being added to the tax on gains

already accrued but not yet realized. That is, as proposed originally by Vickrey (1939), the tax

accrued as of the end of period 𝑡𝑡 on an asset purchased at the end of period 0 would be:


          𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡 = [1 + 𝑟𝑟(1 − 𝜏𝜏)]𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝜏𝜏(𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡 − 𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡−1 ),                                    (5)


where 𝑇𝑇0 = 0, 𝑟𝑟 is the safe rate of return applied to unpaid taxes, 𝜏𝜏 is the income tax rate

(assumed here to be the same for interest and capital gains), and 𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡 is the value of the asset at

the end of period 𝑡𝑡. An obstacle to implementing this method of taxation (or accrual taxation)

is that the government may not observe the path of 𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡 , but only the asset’s value at the times

of initial purchase and final sale. One could assume some arbitrary path of appreciation after

observing the sale price at realization, for example using a smooth geometric growth rate

between the purchase and sale dates, but doing so would not fully eliminate the lock-in effect


                                                                                                       26
(or its opposite, an incentive to realize losses immediately) if the assumed path differs from the

actual one. 10

        However, as shown in Auerbach (1991), a tax liability that instead evolves according to

the expression


                        1+𝑟𝑟 (1−𝜏𝜏) 𝑡𝑡
        𝑇𝑇𝑡𝑡 = �1 − �        1+𝑟𝑟
                                     � � 𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡                                                                (6)



(which depends only on the holding period 𝑡𝑡 and the observed value at realization) imposes the

same tax rate τ at each date 𝑡𝑡 on the safe component of the rate of return, 𝑟𝑟𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡−1 , as in (5),

                               1+𝑟𝑟(1−𝜏𝜏) 𝑡𝑡
and a tax rate of �1 − �            1+𝑟𝑟
                                            � � on the excess return, (𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡 − 𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡−1 ) − 𝑟𝑟𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡−1 . This tax rate on

the excess return differs from that on the safe return component, and from the tax rate under

the Vickrey approach. But, as discussed above in relation to the taxation of risky assets, the

investor can use a portfolio adjustment to offset the tax on the excess return, leaving the

investor in the same position as under the tax system in (5), but without the government

needing to observe the asset appreciation trajectory in order to eliminate the lock-in effect.

        The retrospective capital gains tax system described in (6) eliminates the need for the

government to observe any asset’s appreciation pattern, but it still requires the observation of

the holding period and sale price for each asset subject to capital gains taxation. However,

even these requirements can be eliminated by adopting a generalized version of the system,

based on cash-flow taxation. As Auerbach and Bradford (2004) show, taxing all of the investor’s

cash flows (positive and negative, from all investments) at date 𝑡𝑡 at a rate equal to


                    1+𝑟𝑟(1−𝜏𝜏) 𝑡𝑡−𝐵𝐵
        �1 − 𝑎𝑎 �     1+𝑟𝑟
                               �       �,                                                                    (7)

                                                                                                                   27
where 𝐵𝐵 is some fixed base-year reference date for each taxpayer and 𝑎𝑎 is an arbitrary

constant, would have the same properties as the retrospective capital gains tax (a specific

version of the system described in (7) for which 𝑎𝑎 = 1 and 𝐵𝐵 equals the date of purchase, and

hence must be different for each asset). Thus, one of the main advantages of cash-flow

taxation – not needing to measure asset income – carries over even when the tax system does

impose an income tax, effectively reducing the normal return to investment through a cash-

flow tax rate that rises over time.

       Returning once again to the simple, constant-rate cash-flow tax, an important

equivalence first noted by the Meade Committee Report (Institute for Fiscal Studies 1978) was

between different methods of implementing a cash-flow tax. As that report (Chapter 12)

observed, the transactions of the business sector are related by an identity which, using our

notation, may be written for a closed economy as


       (𝑅𝑅 − 𝐼𝐼 ) + 𝐹𝐹 + 𝑆𝑆 = 0,                                                            (8)


where 𝑅𝑅 equals the cash-flow returns to real investment expenditures, 𝐼𝐼, 𝐹𝐹 equals net

financial inflows to the firm (excluding transactions with shareholders), including net borrowing

and net interest receipts, and 𝑆𝑆 equals dividend payments and net transactions in corporate

shares, i.e., the net inflows to firms from their shareholders. Under the cash-flow (i.e., non-

wage) component of most existing VATs, only 𝑅𝑅 − 𝐼𝐼 is included in the tax base – financial

transactions are ignored. The Meade Committee referred to this approach as the 𝑅𝑅 base cash-




                                                                                                  28
flow tax, and to the tax base that included the financial flows, 𝐹𝐹, as the 𝑅𝑅 + 𝐹𝐹 base cash-flow

tax.

       The present value of a firm’s financial flows 𝐹𝐹 should equal zero to the extent that

borrowing and lending are at the same interest rate – borrowing and lending activities each

having zero present value – and that similar conditions hold for other financial activities, e.g.,

the provision of insurance is actuarially fair, etc. However, this conclusion presumes that any

value added in the financial sector is measured separately from these financial flows and hence

already included in the real returns, 𝑅𝑅.

       In reality, much of the value added that the financial sector generates appears not as

explicit payment for services, but instead takes the form of differences in rates of return (e.g., a

lower rate of interest paid to depositors; a higher rate of interest received from borrowers),

higher insurance premiums, or, more generally, differences between financial inflows and

outflows that make 𝐹𝐹 positive in present value. Thus, an 𝑅𝑅 base is likely to miss a large

component of the services provided by financial institutions. An information advantage of

including financial flows in the tax base is that doing so obviates the need to try to distinguish

the value-added components of financial flows, since real and financial flows both are subject

to taxation.

       Note also from expression (8) that the 𝑅𝑅 + 𝐹𝐹 base could be implemented simply by

taxing net distributions to shareholders, (−𝑆𝑆), including dividends and net share repurchases. 11

However, imposing a business-level cash-flow tax may be easier from the government’s

perspective than taxing individual shareholders on their net distributions. This is especially so

in the global context, where investments by individuals and companies cross borders. To


                                                                                                     29
consider this, we return to expression (4), the national income identity relating consumption to

income.

       Assuming, for simplicity of notation that the government imposes a tax on its own

purchases, achieving a consumption tax in an open economy requires not only a tax on wages

plus domestic business cash flows, (𝑊𝑊 + 𝑅𝑅 − 𝐼𝐼 = 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺 − 𝐼𝐼), but also a tax on net imports,

𝑀𝑀 – 𝑋𝑋. This last tax component, accomplished by taxing gross imports and providing an equal

subsidy for gross exports, is known as a border adjustment. Border adjustment is a standard

component of existing VATs and is also part of the destination-based cash-flow tax (DBCFT),

which is equivalent to the VAT combined with a deduction for wages (or a VAT combined with a

payroll subsidy at an equal rate).

       A familiar equivalence from international trade theory is between a tax on exports and a

tax on imports, which arises from the intertemporal international constraint that a nation’s

exports and imports must be equal, in present value. This is the Lerner Symmetry Theorem

(Lerner 1936) and it implies that a tax on imports and an equal-rate subsidy to exports is

neutral. That is, border adjustment of imports and exports at the same rate is equivalent to no

border adjustment at all.

       However, it is the failure of conditions needed for the Lerner Symmetry Theorem that

provides a central, information-based argument for implementing the DBCFT rather than the

origin-based cash-flow tax (the tax on 𝑅𝑅 − 𝐼𝐼 alone, with no border adjustment). In particular,

the government’s inability to observe 𝑅𝑅 – the domestic returns to investment – makes the

DBCFT attractive, to prevent companies from using various accounting techniques to shift

profits to lower-tax jurisdictions (Auerbach 2017, Auerbach et al. 2017).


                                                                                                   30
       Border adjustment eliminates a company’s ability to shift domestic profits to other

countries using cross-border transactions with related foreign parties, because those

transactions have no impact on the company’s domestic tax liability with the border

adjustment in place. In the computation of a company’s domestic tax base, the revenues from

exports and the expenses of imports are exactly offset by the border adjustments applied to

these items. 12

       Understanding the relationship between the DBCFT and the taxation of shareholders

requires the use of one additional identity, relating the capital and current international

accounts. According to the balance of a country’s current and capital accounts (and ignoring

government reserve transactions and international transfer payments which also enter into the

identity), the trade surplus, 𝑋𝑋 − 𝑀𝑀, plus net foreign source income, 𝐸𝐸, equals net foreign

investment; equivalently, the trade deficit equals net foreign source income less net foreign

investment, or 𝑀𝑀 – 𝑋𝑋 = 𝐸𝐸. Substituting this relationship into the definition of the DBCFT tax

base yields:


       DBCFT Tax Base = (𝑅𝑅 − 𝐼𝐼 ) + 𝑀𝑀 − 𝑋𝑋 = (𝑅𝑅 – 𝐼𝐼) + 𝐸𝐸.                                (9)


That is, as noted in Auerbach (1997), implementing the DBCFT is equivalent to imposing a tax

on domestic cash flows (𝑅𝑅 – 𝐼𝐼) as well as net cross-border cash flows (𝐸𝐸). 13 This equivalence

provides another perspective as to why the DBCFT eliminates the tax incentive for companies

to shift earnings abroad. Because an understatement of domestic earnings and net cash flows,

(𝑅𝑅 – 𝐼𝐼), will lead to an equal-size increase in net foreign-source earnings and net cash flows

from abroad, 𝐸𝐸, misreporting the first component of their sum will have no impact on the


                                                                                                    31
DBCFT tax base, although understating (𝑅𝑅 – 𝐼𝐼) in this manner may increase tax liabilities in

other countries that still impose source-based taxes . 14

       From this final way of writing the DBCFT tax base, it also follows that, if one adopts the

Meade Committee’s 𝑅𝑅 + 𝐹𝐹 approach and incorporates domestic financial flows 𝐹𝐹 in the tax

base as well, the resulting tax system amounts to the taxation of domestic resident

shareholders on the distributions from their investments, whether these investments are

domestic or foreign. That is, the DBCFT is equivalent to a tax on the distributions received by

domestic shareholders. However, to impose the latter directly would require the government

to observe its domestic shareholders’ net distributions from foreign investments. Through the

international accounts identity, the DBCFT accomplishes the same outcome, working through

different markets (trade in goods and services versus capital and income flows), via the border

adjustment.


IV. Conclusions

Recognizing tax equivalences is important to help us understand the possible economic effects

of tax systems; applying what may be known about the effects of some tax systems may help us

understand the effects of other systems that are equivalent.

       Perhaps more important for the design and analysis of tax policy is that understanding

tax equivalences is also a valuable first step in considering the ways in which equivalences may

fail. Such a consideration is useful both for positive analysis (e.g., to understand the political

reasons for choosing one approach over another) and for normative analysis (to determine

which approach may be a more effective way of implementing a policy, given the many



                                                                                                     32
deviations from the assumptions of perfect markets and information that can apply in realistic

settings).

       Finally, one should keep in mind that deviations from equivalence like those discussed

here need not be immutable. Government budget rules could be more rational, technological

innovations may increase the government’s access to information about taxpayer behavior,

market environments relating to competitiveness and nominal rigidities may change, and so

forth. For a similar reason, specific policy prescriptions may differ across countries at any given

time. Thus, perhaps the most important lesson to be taken from the discussion here relates to

the process of evaluating tax policy rather than any particular results. One can learn much from

understanding tax equivalences and deviations from them. Therefore, we should keep this way

of framing tax policies in mind when considering the effects of new proposals as well as existing

law.

Endnotes
1Auerbach, Frenkel and Razin (1997), a paper on which the current one relies, does consider a range of
equivalences broader than the “international taxation” in its title suggests.
2Taxing wages at the individual level, in the flat tax proposal, would have facilitated the imposition of a
progressive tax rate schedule on individual or household wage income, rather than the proportional one included
as part of a VAT.
3   For further discussion, see Kaplow (1994).
4Whether government can improve risk-pooling depends on the extent to which efficient private markets for
sharing risks already exist, as well as on the extent to which individual risks are themselves correlated.
5 Saez et al. (2012) find that employer and employee payroll taxes have different incidence for a Greek tax reform

that affected different cohorts of employees differently, for which equal incidence would have required posted
wages to differ based on whether workers were subject to the tax reform.
6 A further equivalence here is between tax systems that provide a deduction for the nominal interest rate
multiplied by the undepreciated basis, as represented here, and those that permit a deduction for interest on the
share of debt used to finance the asset, 𝑑𝑑, and for the interest rate multiplied by the undepreciated basis net of
debt, (𝑒𝑒 −𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼 − 𝑑𝑑). This latter approach is known as an “allowance for corporate equity,” or ACE (Institute for Fiscal
Studies 1991).
7 In the parlance of the investment literature, Tobin’s 𝑞𝑞 would exceed 1, as the firm’s value would equal the value
of its measured assets plus the present value of its above-normal returns. While expensing at the firm level would
be based on the cost of asset purchases, expensing at the individual level would be based on the higher value paid
for the firm.
8To a lesser extent, the practice of adding up nominal effects on revenues over different years without discounting
has the effect of encouraging a shift of revenue losses to earlier years within the budget window, when nominal
magnitudes are smaller for any given ratio to GDP.
9 Taxpayers may also have an incentive to use the choice between EET- and TEE-based accounts to time their tax
bases for strategic reasons, if they expect the tax system to change over time. An individual who expects marginal
tax rates to rise, for example, will be more likely to opt for the TEE approach, beyond what would be needed to
accomplish a smoothing of his or her tax base across periods, in order to subject a greater share of lifetime income
to a lower marginal tax rate.
10For example, if an asset appreciated substantially shortly after purchase, the use of an assumed constant annual
growth rate based on the ultimate sale price would leave the investor locked in, as holding the asset longer would
spread more of the large immediate gain over subsequent periods of lower rates of appreciation.
11Note that, with no net share repurchases, this amounts to a tax on dividends. This equivalence between a
dividend tax and a cash-flow tax, and particularly the property that the dividend tax does not affect the after-tax
rate of return to investment, is a major element of the “new view” of dividend taxation (Auerbach 1979).
12 Note that the Lerner symmetry theorem may break down for other reasons, for example because of nominal
rigidities, which may not serve as advantages for the DBCFT. See Barbiero et al. (2018). In such circumstances, the
violation of other equivalences, for example leading the side of the market on which the tax is applied to matter,
will be relevant for implementation.
13 In terms of how this cash-flow tax on foreign-held assets would be effected, the border adjustment should lead
to an offsetting appreciation of the real exchange rate, through some combination of an increase in the domestic
price level or an appreciation of the nominal exchange rate. This real exchange rate appreciation reduces the real
value of cash flows on foreign assets. See Auerbach et al. (2017). Several factors could influence the mix of
increases in domestic prices and the nominal exchange rate, including exchange rate policy and whether there
were a wage deduction on the employer side or a wage subsidy on employee side, in the presence of some
nominal wage rigidity.
14 As discussed in Auerbach et al. (2017), it would also be desirable to include a border adjustment for the financial
flows incorporated in 𝐸𝐸, to prevent firms from using related-party cross-border lending to shift profits.
