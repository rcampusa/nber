We analyze the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on state and local government finances, with
an emphasis on health spending needs and the role of the Medicaid program. We arrive at three
conclusions. First, we find that nationwide, and over the entirety of the federal budget window,
the enhanced federal matching funds are of roughly the same magnitude as expected increases in
state Medicaid costs. There is a difference in timing, however, as projected relief funds are more
concentrated in the near term than projected spending needs. Second, we show that there is
substantial variation in states' exposure to increases in Medicaid program costs. Third, we
evaluate the extent to which federal aid has been targeted at states with large increases in
Medicaid costs. We show that the enhanced Medicaid matching funds are quite weakly correlated
with variations in states' cost increases. In contrast, the state aid formula in the American
Recovery Plan Act appears, to at least a moderate degree, to direct dollars toward states with
large increases in their Medicaid enrollments.

Federal Fiscal Stabilization in the United States

Our aim in this paper is to describe the fiscal challenges that confront state and local

governments as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the federal government's role in

addressing them. As we have discussed elsewhere (Clemens and Veuger, 2020a), challenges

arise due to three factors. First, to varying degrees, state and local governments are constrained

by balanced budget requirements. Second, the pandemic has adversely affected revenues. Third,

the pandemic has increased certain expenditure needs. In this paper, we attempt to have a unified

discussion of these issues, with an emphasis on health spending needs and the role of the

Medicaid program.

      Taken together, state and local governments serve a broad set of functions. They administer

and at least partially finance many public services, as well as major income-support programs.

The services provided by state and local governments range from education to public safety and

public utilities. In recent years, the delivery of these services had led state and local governments

to employ just under 20 million workers (Shoag and Veuger, 2020). This accounts for roughly 13

percent of all nonfarm employment.

      The motivation for federal fiscal stabilization arises from state and local balanced-budget

constraints. When state governments face downturns their balanced budget rules prevent them

from contributing to countercyclical policy and in fact force them to engage in procyclical

policy.1 As revenues decline and spending needs rise, compliance with balanced-budget rules

dictates increases in tax rates and a search for budgetary savings. Savings may come from wage

freezes and layoffs for members of the public-sector work force. Figure 1 illustrates the

reductions in state and local government employment that took place between January 2020 and

February 2021. This can, in turn, imply reductions in service delivery just as needs run high.

    Given the existence of states' balanced-budget requirements, it is not surprising that the

federal government has a history intervening to reduce states' fiscal stress. The 2009 American

Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which included $232 billion in support for state governments,

is a prominent example (US Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), 2020b). In the current crisis,

federal support for state and local governments has come piecemeal through existing and new

legislation discussed below. This support is of central importance to the US system of fiscal

federalism, which is characterized by heavy reliance on the central fiscal authority for

countercyclical policy.2

     In the next section we summarize what is known about the COVID-19 pandemic's impacts

on the revenues and expenditure needs of state and local governments. We also discuss the major

provisions in federal legislation that have been enacted to support state and local government

budgets. We then turn to the meat of the paper: a discussion of the role of the Medicaid and

CHIP programs, which highlights the complex relationships between new spending needs,

intergovernmental transfers, and the conditions on which the federal government makes its aid

contingent. Medicaid is of particular importance in the current context for three reasons: it

provides health insurance, which may be more important during a pandemic than in normal

times; it provides a safety net for workers who have lost their employment, as so many did

during the COVID-19 recession; and it was the channel through which the federal government

provided some of its earliest financial support to the states, both through Medicaid's normal

financing and by increasing the federal matching rate. It also provides us with a setting that lets

us illustrate the heterogeneity across states in new spending needs. This allows us, in turn, to

assess how effective federal aid has been in dealing with that heterogeneity.

   We conclude the paper with a discussion of the conditions under which federal funding, for

Medicaid in particular, is provided to state and local governments. We discuss the relevance of

the timing and duration of federal aid flows, as well as the importance of uncertainty surrounding

these parameters.



State and Local Government Budgets During the COVID-19 Crisis

The COVID-19 crisis has changed the budgetary situation of US state and local governments

through three main routes. These routes include changes in tax and other revenue, increases in

spending needs, and increases in flows of federal aid.

   Several analyses have undertaken the task of estimating the revenue shortfalls that are likely

to face state and local governments over the current fiscal year. The preferred approach for



                                                 4
projecting shortfalls makes use of forecasts for macroeconomic variables that are reasonably

close proxies for major revenue bases. This is the approach taken in Clemens and Veuger

(2020a; 2020b), Whitaker (2020a; 2020b), Auerbach et al. (2020), and Chernick et al. (2020).

Following this basic approach, a recent estimate finds that the total revenue shortfall for state and

local governments between April 2020 and June 2021 amounts to about $130 billion (Clemens

and Veuger, 2021).3

    The aggregate revenue shortfall across states masks significant heterogeneity. Across states,

for example, Auerbach et al. (2020) estimate a loss of revenue, expressed as a share of own-

source revenue, excluding fees to hospitals and institutions of higher-education, that ranges from

3.1 percent in Kansas to 9.6 percent in Nevada. This variation reflects, among other things,

variation in state and local governments' reliance on different tax instruments as well as

differences in the distribution of economic activity across sectors.

    A second factor to consider are the actions already taken by the federal government to

support state and local government budgets. The federal government's initial response to the

economic downturn triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic was swift and sizable. In March and

April last year, Congress and the executive branch passed a number of pieces of legislation that

together provided trillions of dollars in relief. Auerbach et al. (2020) calculate that between the

Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA), the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic

Security (CARES) Act, and the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement

(PPPHCE) Act, the federal government provided up to "$212 billion in aid to state and local

governments, excluding aid to public hospitals and higher ed, and $250 billion including that



3
  This time period spans the pandemic's first 5 quarters. June 2021 is when fiscal year 2021 ends for all but a few
states. Shortfall estimates have declined in magnitude as forecasts, in particular from the Congressional Budget
Office, have improved relative to the most pessimistic estimates from the summer of 2020.

                                                          5
aid" in 2020. If we add to that the relief funds for state and local governments included in the

December 2020 Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, the overall number exceeds $300

billion (Clemens and Veuger, 2021; Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, 2020).

Finally, the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) of 2021, which became law in March 2021,

contains well over $500 billion in additional funding directed at state and local governments

(Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, 2021a). In summary, total federal aid for state and

local governments allocated so far is in excess of $800 billion, much of which will be allocated

before the end of the 2021 fiscal year (Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, 2021b).

   Among these funding streams, the most important for our Medicaid analysis is that the

aforementioned FFCRA raised the federal matching assistance percentage for the bulk of states'

Medicaid expenditures by 6.2 percentage points. This increase, which we discuss at length in the

next section, applies for the duration of the formally declared public health crisis.

   Finally, state and local governments have incurred increased spending as a result of the

pandemic. In the following section, we discuss spending increases in the Medicaid program at

length. Other important categories of state and local governments spending include K-12 and

higher education, healthcare and welfare spending outside the Medicaid program, unemployment

and retirement benefits, public safety, housing, and utilities. In Clemens, Ippolito, and Veuger

(2020) we estimate that state and local governments may face elevated operating costs from their

usual activities on the order of $50 billion for the 2021 fiscal year. The bulk of these costs are

linked to the operation of schools for students in grades K-12. This estimate is quite rough and

does not include extraordinary public health and relief spending in direct response to the crisis.

This summary of the COVID-19 pandemic's fiscal impacts suggests that, in the aggregate and

throughout the current fiscal year, state and local government budgets are unlikely to face unmet



                                                  6
fiscal needs. After all, if revenue losses amount to $130 billion, federal aid exceeds $800 billion,

and new spending needs for existing programs are around $50 billion, the net change in state and

local budget balances is surely positive. The $800 billion in federal aid leaves substantial fiscal

space to absorb state and local government exposure to the cost of vaccine distribution and

impromptu relief programs for households and businesses. That said, there is, of course,

significant heterogeneity across states and localities.

   We will now turn to our main contribution, an analysis of developments surrounding the

Medicaid program throughout the crisis. In this analysis, we will highlight the sometimes-

complicated interactions between revenue shocks, spending needs, and intergovernmental

transfers, which, as discussed thus far in general terms, are the principal mechanisms through

which a downturn affects subnational budgets.



Understanding the Pandemic's Implications for States' Medicaid Programs

The pandemic's unusually sharp impact on employment has had substantial effects on both

eligibility for Medicaid and the availability of employer provided coverage. In this section, we

consider how that has affected state finances and assess the federal government's response.

       Specifically, we proceed here in five parts. First, we provide evidence on the magnitudes

of the total increase in Medicaid and CHIP enrollment and expenditures. We place these

increases in context by contrasting them with changes that occurred during both the Great

Recession and the recession of the early 2000s. Second, we discuss aspects of the federal

response to COVID-19 that have both increased the Medicaid program's expenditures and

increased the extent of federal support. Third, we assess the implications of the pandemic and

federal response for states' net exposure to expenditures through the Medicaid and CHIP



                                                  7
programs. Fourth, we illustrate the significant heterogeneity across states in Medicaid enrollment

increases since the start of the pandemic. Finally, we explore whether federal aid instruments

have effectively targeted this dimension of heterogeneity in needs.



The Pandemic's Impacts on Medicaid Enrollment and Expenditure

                       Owing to the Medicaid program's income-based eligibility requirements, program

enrollment and spending typically follow a countercyclical pattern. As shown in Figure 2, for

example, Medicaid enrollment increased substantially surrounding both the 2001 recession and

Great Recession. Note that the large spike in enrollment in 2014 reflects eligibility expansion

connected to the Affordable Care Act (ACA).

                       The baseline nature of Medicaid's countercyclicality has evolved in recent years owing to

the ACA's Medicaid expansion for childless adults. In states which adopted the ACA's Medicaid


                                                                 8
expansion (39 states plus DC), adults with incomes below 138 percent of the Federal Poverty

Level ($17,774 for singles, $36,570 for a family of four in 2021) can qualify for Medicaid

coverage (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2020b). This represented something of a break from the

previously categorical nature of eligibility, which generally required that adults have both low

incomes and be aged, disabled, or pregnant. The non-categorical nature of the ACA Medicaid

expansion should amplify the growth of enrollment in economic downturns.

    Unsurprisingly, the economic downturn associated with COVID-19 has resulted in a sharp

increase in Medicaid and CHIP enrollment. Using data from the Centers for Medicare and

Medicaid Services (CMS), Figure 3 shows that total enrollment across both programs increased

by 6.7 million, or 9.4 percent, from February to September of 2020.

    Figure 3: Total Medicaid and CHIP Enrollment, October 2019-September 2020

    Recent enrollment increases have differed meaningfully across eligibility groups. Figure 4

shows enrollment in Medicaid and CHIP for both adults and children, relative to their levels in

February of 2020. Note that income eligibility limits are generally higher for children on

Medicaid than adults, and higher still for children covered by CHIP (Kaiser Family Foundation,

2020a). Enrollment was relatively stable leading up to February of 2020; however, Medicaid

enrollment has increased markedly since, and most so among adults. In September 2020, child

Medicaid enrollment had increased 8.1 percent since February, while CHIP coverage saw little

change (together, child enrollment across Medicaid and CHIP was up 2.3 million or 6.7 percent).

Over that same period, adult Medicaid enrollment was up 12.1 percent.

    The difference between adult and child enrollment growth has been particularly pronounced

in expansion states, as depicted in Figure 5. In expansion states, total adult enrollment grew by

roughly 2.2 times as much as child enrollment (11.7 percent versus 5.2 percent). In non-

expansion states adult enrollment outpaced that of children by just 52 percent (14.2 percent

versus 9.4 percent).4

Note: Data are from CMS (2020b). States were classified as expansion states if enrollment in that group had occurred
by July of 2020 (34 states). Information about expansion decisions taken from Kaiser Family Foundation (2020b).


         It is not immediately obvious how these enrollment trends translate to state expenditure

needs. Because Medicaid and CHIP are financed jointly by the state and federal governments,

the cost of increased enrollment does not fall entirely on the states. States have considerable

latitude to design their programs and the federal government "matches" expenditures at a

prespecified Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP). The federal government pays at

least 50 percent of costs, with that share rising for states with lower per-capita incomes. For



4
 These results are consistent with our own discussions with a state budget officer in an expansion state. Preliminary
data from that state indicated that enrollment growth in the expansion population exceeded that of the non-expansion
population from March through September of 2020. Note that expansion states generally have higher income limits
for CHIP (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2020a), which complicates an a priori assessment of how relative enrollment
patterns are expected to differ across states.

                                                         11
fiscal year 2021 the primary matching rates in Medicaid and CHIP averaged 60 and 72 percent,

respectively (Federal Financial Participation in State Assistance Expenditures, 2019). Notably,

however, expenditures for the ACA expansion group are matched at the enhanced level of 90

percent.

        The CMS data for 2020 do not separately report enrollment growth for all coverage

categories. Given markedly different per-capita expenditures across enrollment groups, this

makes it challenging to translate observed enrollment growth into costs for the states and the

federal government. Using recent CBO reports, however, we can more precisely estimate total

program costs associated with anticipated enrollment increases for a near and medium-term

horizon. In particular, the agency estimates that, due to policy changes (discussed in more detail

below) and the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, total program enrollment will be 9 million

higher in 2021 than it had forecast prior to the pandemic (CBO, 2020e). CBO further forecasts

that enrollment will remain above the pre-pandemic baseline until 2027.5 Moreover, enrollment

growth is expected to differ meaningfully across categories of beneficiaries. Consistent with the

evidence shown above, for example, CBO estimates that enrollment will remain flat in CHIP but

increase across Medicaid enrollment categories (CBO, 2020e). Given average expenditures for

each group, these enrollment changes imply an additional $59.8 billion in combined state and

federal costs in 2021, and $225.6 billion additional costs for 2020-2030.6 These enrollment and

spending increases have the distinct potential to strain state budgets; however, the ultimate

burden on states depends heavily on the effects of recent federal legislation.




5
 For this calculation we assume zero growth in Medicaid enrollment for those over age 65.
6
 This reflects median total expenditures among states that CMS deems to have a high level of data usability. Results
are similar if we use estimates from all states. Data are from 2018 (CMS, 2020a).

                                                        12
How Has the Federal Response to COVID-19 Impacted Medicaid and CHIP?

         The FFCRA aided states by increasing the federal matching assistance percentage

(FMAP) by 6.2 percentage points for the duration of the public health crisis. Indirectly, this

increased CHIP matching rates by roughly 4.3 percent (CMS, 2020a). The increased match rate

did not directly apply to spending on groups with already enhanced match rates, including the

ACA expansion population. Importantly, receipt of the enhanced FMAP was conditional on

states maintaining continuous coverage for enrollees, regardless of changes to their eligibility

status, for the duration of the health emergency.7 Further, states were prohibited from tightening

eligibility rules or increasing premiums.

         The FMAP enhancement and continuous coverage provisions have opposing effects on

state expenditures. A higher FMAP delivers pure transfers from the federal government--state

financing needs fall one-for-one with each dollar in federal transfers. The continuous coverage

provision, however, increases program enrollment and total expenditures. States must still fund

their portion of these new program costs. The net effect on state budgets is ambiguous.

         CBO estimates that, together, the Medicaid provisions increased federal spending by $79

billion in 2021 and by $172 billion over the years 2020-2023 (CBO, 2020d). As with prior

recessions, this is a substantial portion of total federal spending aimed at states. For example, the

American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009 included a similar FMAP enhancement that

was in effect from October of 2008 through June of 2011. This increased federal spending by

roughly $100 billion (Clemens and Ippolito, 2018; Kaiser Family Foundation, 2011),8 which




7
  As observed by Baicker, Clemens, and Singhal (2012), the U.S. federal government has a long history of
conditioning its intergovernmental transfers on states' compliance with rules that sometimes have substantial costs.
8
  Note that the FMAP increase from the ARRA was initially set to expire in December of 2010 but was then
extended through June of 2011 with some modifications (GAO, 2011). Cost estimates which exclude the extension
are lower--approximately $89 billion (Chodorow-Reich et al, 2012).

                                                         13
represented a substantial portion of the total $232 billion in grants-in-aid that was transferred to

states through the ARRA (BEA, 2020b). In the current context, the gross transfers triggered by

the Medicaid provisions in the FFCRA exceed the $150 billion allocated to state and local

governments through the Coronavirus Relief Fund in the CARES Act. However, the $172 billion

in federal spending is not a form of pure budgetary support for the states. To estimate the net

budgetary effects, we calculate the transfers and costs associated with the FMAP increase and

continuous coverage provision separately. As detailed below, we conclude that a significant

share of the fiscal relief owing to the FMAP increase is offset by expenditures linked to the

continuous coverage provision.



Net State Fiscal Stress Connected to the Medicaid Program

       Let us now parse the effects of the FMAP increase and continuous coverage provision to

estimate the net fiscal effect of COVID-related Medicaid legislation. The available data imply

that the FMAP increase will transfer about $39 billion to states in 2021, and a total of $89.9

billion from 2020 to 2023. The continuous coverage provision partially offsets this transfer by

increasing state expenditures by $20 billion in 2021, and by $41.0 billion for the 2020-2023

period. We conclude that these provisions provided an estimated $18.8 billion in net general

fiscal relief to states in 2021, and a total of $43.8 billion for 2020-2023.

       These estimates are informed by recent CBO reports. Specifically, the two Medicaid

provisions are expected to increase federal expenditures by $41, $79, $47, and $5 billion in

2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively (Table A-2, CBO, 2020d). CBO also notes that the

FMAP provision accounts for $30 billion in federal spending in 2021 for the population under

age 65 (CBO, 2020e). Scaling by the portion of Medicaid spending attributable to those under



                                                  14
65, we conclude that the FMAP provision is responsible for $38.9 billion in total federal costs for

2021.9 This implies that federal costs of the two provisions are split nearly evenly in 2021:

49.2% owing to the FMAP increase and 50.8% due to the continuous coverage provision.

         CBO's assumption for 2021 provides a useful reference point for allocating federal costs

for 2020 through 2023. In 2020, the continuous coverage provision should account for a modest

share of federal costs, since the pandemic's negative effects on low-earning households' incomes

will limit the continuous coverage provision's bite. Subsequent income growth, however, will

increase the continuous coverage provision's impact so long as the public health emergency

remains in effect. For our preferred calculations, we assume that the FMAP provision accounts

for 75 percent of federal costs in 2020, roughly 50 percent in 2021 (as calculated above), 40

percent in 2022, and 30 percent in 2023.10 In aggregate, we assume that the FMAP provision

accounts for 52 percent of federal costs over the 2020-2023 period. This implies a total federal

cost of $82 billion for the continuous coverage provision. After adjusting by the average FMAP

nationwide (inclusive of the 6.2 percentage point increase), state expenditures owing to the

continuous coverage provision are $41.0 billion from 2020 to 2023, and $20.0 billion in 2021.

On net, the FMAP and the continuous coverage provisions reduce states' exposure to Medicaid

and CHIP expenditures by $43.8 billion over the four years during which they are assumed to be

in effect. Table 1 summarizes these results.

  Specifically, MACPAC reports that those over the age of 65 account for $94.2 of $409.3 billion in total Medicaid
benefit spending, or 23% (MACPAC, 2019). We assume that 23% of enhanced FMAP spending will be spent on
enrollees over age 65 in 2021
10
   If we instead assume that the nearly 50/50 split in 2021 is constant across years, we estimate that total net
transfers to states for 2020-2023 are a similar $41 billion. However, the distribution across years differs somewhat,
with smaller net transfers occurring in 2020 owing to larger costs of the continuous coverage provision and vice
versa for 2022/2023.

Note: The estimated federal cost of the FMAP and Continuous Coverage provisions together are from Table A-2 of
CBO (2020d). The FMAP provision is assumed to represent a particularly large portion of federal costs in 2020
(75%), 49.3% of total federal costs in 2021 (based on CBO, 2020e), 40% in 2022, and 30% in 2023. The state cost
of the continuous coverage provision assumes a federal matching rate of 66.7% (normal matching rate inclusive of
6.2 percent add on). Numbers within columns may not add due to rounding.


        Legislated transfers via the FMAP increase are projected to outstrip the additional state

costs owing to the continuous coverage provision. However, it is not yet clear how these

transfers compare to total state Medicaid and CHIP costs owing to the COVID-19 pandemic--

costs that stem from both the continuous coverage provision and broader economic decline. As

noted above, enrollment increases owing to both of these sources stood to increase total state and

federal costs by an estimated $59.8 billion in 2021 and $225.6 billion for 2020-2030 (though,

note that costs are assumed to be zero for the last three years of this budget window as

enrollment returns to baseline). At their normal matching rate for these enrollment categories,

state expenditures would have increased by $19.9 billion in 2021 and $84.2 billion for the entire

budget window. The FMAP increase offsets these costs by an estimated $38.9 billion in 2021

and $89.9 billion for 2020-2023. On net, federal transfers are projected to effectively offset total

state expenditure needs for the Medicaid program over the 2020-2030 window, though

somewhat unevenly over time, as shown in Table 2. Note that federal transfers exceed state

expenditure needs through 2022. Enrollment, however, is expected to remain above pre-COVID

projections beyond the conclusion of the public health emergency. Because the formal

conclusion of the health emergency terminates the FMAP and continuous coverage provisions,

the pandemic's long-run effects on enrollment imply a net increase in states' costs after 2022.

         Across the entire budget window, federal support is well matched to expected state

Medicaid and CHIP financing needs owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. During the worst

portions of the economic downturn and health crisis, federal transfers overshoot increases in state

financing needs for these programs, effectively providing broader fiscal relief. However, federal

transfers are expected to expire before economic conditions fully recover, leaving states with

elevated financing needs starting in 2023. Given the large amounts of other funding provided by

the federal government to state and local governments since the start of the pandemic, this ought

not pose unsurmountable challenges. In the absence of the ARPA, however, this mismatch might

have generated significant uncertainty about state governments' future budgetary and fiscal

policy. Uncertainty of this sort can, in its own right, have damaging consequences (Shoag and

Veuger, 2016). We also note that these estimates are themselves uncertain. If the economic

recovery is more rapid than expected, Medicaid enrollment may return to baseline more quickly

than in CBO's projections, alleviating some of the financing pressures in later years.



Cross-State Heterogeneity in Medicaid Enrollment Increases

        The numbers presented so far mask significant cross-state heterogeneity in enrollment

increases, spending needs, and federal aid flows. Figures 6 and 7 illustrate this heterogeneity.

Figure 6 maps the increase in Medicaid enrollment per state resident from February to September

2020. The increases range from 0.009 in to 0.054. Figure 7 breaks the states out into quartiles,

ranked according to the percent increase in their number of Medicaid enrollees between February

and September 2020. While the bottom-quartile states have seen their Medicaid rolls grow by

around 5%, top-quartile states have witnessed a 13% increase.

Estimates.

Applications, Eligibility Determinations, and Enrollment Reports).

Has Federal Aid Targeted Cross-State Heterogeneity in Medicaid Enrollment Increases?

         We now consider the extent to which federal aid has been targeted towards states in

which Medicaid enrollments have risen the most dramatically. The biggest source of relief

targeted to the needs generated by enrollment shocks is the matching structure of Medicaid itself,

which triggers additional federal funds when spending rises to finance enrollment increases

(Clemens and Ippolito, 2018). As Medicaid spending rises, the federal match automatically

reduces states' exposure.

         In contrast with the basic match, the enhanced FMAP provision delivers the most

substantial aid to states with relatively high levels of qualifying expenditures at baseline.


                                                         19
Whether this aid targets states that experienced relatively large enrollment shocks is an empirical

question. We answer this question in Figure 8. Through September, growth in Medicaid and

CHIP enrollments (and the mechanical growth in federal spending that accompanies it) was

positively related to states' unemployment rates and unemployment rate changes, as shown in

panels B and C. Panel A, however, shows a weak correlation between Medicaid enrollment

increases and Medicaid relief funds delivered through the FFCRA's enhanced FMAP (both

expressed on a per capita, or per state resident, basis).

                                 Panel C: Unemployment Rate (Sept 2020)




Note: This figure illustrates state level increases in Medicaid and CHIP enrollment per state resident from February-
September 2020 against indicators of need. Total monthly Medicaid and CHIP enrollment data are from Kaiser
Family Foundation (based on CMS, Medicaid & CHIP Monthly Applications, Eligibility Determinations, and
Enrollment Reports). Medicaid relief funds represent additional federal spending associated with the enhanced
FMAP included in the FFCRA and are from the COVID Relief Tracker from the Committee for a Responsible
Federal Budget. Unemployment data for the noninstitutionalized population are from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.



                                                         20
       We analyze these relationships further in Table 3. Column 1 confirms that the federal

funds from the FFCRA enhanced FMAP (per capita) do not correlate strongly with enrollment

changes per capita. This confirms that the FMAP increase rewards states that had high baseline

expenditures rather than states that were more "shocked" by new enrollments. In contrast,

column 2 shows enrollment increases were moderately correlated with unemployment as

measured from October to December. Here, the unemployment variable we analyze is

constructed using the unemployment data that feed into the state-aid formula legislated through

the ARPA. Specifically, we show here that shocks to enrollment per capita correlate positively

with the average of October through December unemployment expressed on a per capita basis.

In other words, relief provided through the ARPA is likely to be somewhat correlated with this

dimension of heterogeneity in COVID needs.

       Column 3 shows that enrollment shocks, expressed in terms of enrollees per state

resident, have been particularly large in ACA expansion states. Note that to the extent that this

reflects more strongly countercyclical enrollment among the expansion population itself, this

mechanically triggers large transfers in federal funds owing to the 90 percent federal match for

this group. Alternatively, the correlation between enrollment shocks and ACA expansion status

may result from expansion states' general approach to administering Medicaid. That is,

expansion states may tend to be states with more streamlined enrollment processes, while non-

expansion states may tend to be states with more onerous enrollment processes. Regardless, it is

of descriptive interest to note that ACA expansion status predicts the magnitude of pandemic

enrollment shocks as strongly if not more strongly than some measures of macroeconomic

conditions. Recall, for example, that changes in states' unemployment rates quite weakly predict



                                                21
       states' enrollment increases, as shown in Panel B of Figure 8. The relationship between

       expansion status and enrollment shocks maintains its magnitude and significance in Column 5,

       where the enhanced FMAP funds, the ARPA unemployment variable, and expansions status are

       jointly included in a descriptive multivariate analysis.

       Conclusion

                The COVID-19 pandemic has affected state and local government budgets by changing

       revenue streams, raising spending needs, and triggering enormous amounts of federal aid. This

       paper adds to past work on the pandemic's effects on state and local governments' budgets, and

       the literature on fiscal federalism more generally, with a detailed look at the Medicaid program.

                Our inquiry included two lines of emphasis. First, we investigated the intricate

       relationship between increased spending needs and additional federal grants in the aggregate.

       Through the current 10-year budget window and in the aggregate, the additional federal grants

                                                                22
roughly cover expected state Medicaid and CHIP financing needs due to the pandemic. While

this is true across the budget window, we illustrate the potential relevance of timing. Federal

grants overshoot initially and are forecasted to expire before either the economy or Medicaid

enrollments have returned to trend. Mistiming of this sort may interact in unintended ways with

states' balanced budgeting practices. Interestingly, the duration of the enhanced FMAP is tied to

the duration of the public health emergency in a binary fashion. The formal repeal of the public

health emergency will thus be a high stakes determination from a state-budgeting perspective. A

more gradual phase-out of federal support, perhaps tied to macroeconomic conditions, would

reduce this pressure.

       Our second line of emphasis has been on the heterogeneity in states' experiences.

Specifically, we have explored the extent to which federal grants have targeted the states in

which Medicaid enrollments rose the most substantially. We show that the enhanced FMAP

funds were, in this key respect, ill-targeted; these funds target states with high expenditures at

baseline rather than states that have been subject to the largest shocks. In this sense, the enhanced

FMAP funds have targeted inframarginal Medicaid spending rather than pandemic-induced

increases in Medicaid spending. Interestingly, we show that the American Rescue Plan Act's

unemployment-driven formula for allocating unrestricted fiscal assistance better targets aid

towards states with large increases in Medicaid and CHIP enrollments.

       Going forward, the design of federal fiscal assistance merits additional scrutiny given its

role in the American system of fiscal federalism. During both the COVID-19 pandemic and the

Great Recession, substantial federal aid has been legislated on an ad hoc basis. The time pressure

under which emergency legislative vehicles must be designed may, in turn, risk ill-targeted




                                                 23
approaches to dispensing substantial quantities of aid. The design of "automatic stabilizers" for

state and local governments may thus a be fruitful area for further analysis.
