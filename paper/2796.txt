          THE EFFECTIVENESS OF FOREIGN-EXCHANGE INTERVENTION:
                           RECENT EXPERIENCE


                                ABSTRACT


     Since the September 1985    Plaza     Hotel   announcement    by     the
                                                               of
Group of Five industrial countries, a substantial realignment
exchange rates has  been  achieved.  At  the  same time,  foreign
                                                    and much of it
exchange market intervention, much of it concerted
sterilized, has been undertaken on a scale   not   seen  since the

early 1970s    This paper takes a fresh look at the effectiveness of

sterilized intervention in the light of recent experience.


     The paper concludes that sterilized intervention, in itself,
has played an unimportant role in        promoting   exchange-rate
realignment. Instead, clear shifts in patterns of monetary and
fiscal policy appear to have been the main medium-term policy
factors determining currency values. Over certain shorter time

periods, intervention has influenced exchange        markets    through     a

signalling channel; but this signalling effect has been operative

only as a result of    authorities'frequent readiness to adjust

monetary policies promptly to counteract unwelcome exchange-market

pressures. The paper makes some progress in formalizing reasons
why intervention might enhance the credibility of messages that
governments could convey as well through simple        verbal     announce-

ments -

intervention policy. The monetary crises under the Bretton Woods

system showed that powerful market trends cannot be suppressed
through exchange market interventions by central banks, and more
recent monetary history has reaffirmed this.

Introduction

      In a report published in July                 1985.       economic    policymakers

from ten industrial countries reviewed the performance of floating

exchange rates to date and concluded that "the key elements of the

current     international          monetary        system         require        no     major

institutional      change." Within three months,                        however,      finance

ministers      and central-bank       governors          from    five    of the largest

industrial      countries       announced        their    readiness        for     concerted

action    to    reduce    the United States              dollar's       foreign-exchange

value, The Group of Five's announcement, made at the Plaza Hotel

in New York on           Sunday,    September       22,     initiated       a    series    of

international accords centered around the management of key dollar

exchange rates.2 Understandings              concerning joint            intervention      in


foreign     exchange     markets     have        figured        prominently        in   these

accords, which thus represent a clear modification of the distaste

for   intervention       that    prevailed       during the        first    half of the

       Thia    paper      focuaes    on the recent practice               and effecta   of

foreign-exchange          intervention by          the    three    largest     industrial

economies,      Germany, Japan, and the United States. A wide variety

of economic policy tools--monetary, fiscal, and commercial,                             to

name just three--can            he used to influence exchange rates. To

isolate       the   "pure" effects of intervention                 on exchange rates,

the     discussion           below      distinguishes             between      sterilized

interventions,         vhose        monetary       effecta       are      neutralized   by

offsetting          domestic    liquidity          measures,        and     nonsterilized

interventions, which alter money supplies                        and rherefore     involve

the joint exercise of monetary policy and exchange-market policy.

If effective in achieving significant and sustained exchange-rate

changes,       sterilized       intervention         could       give     governments   an

additional policy tool helpful in resolving conflicts between the

monetary policies            apprepriate       for   internal       balance    and these

appropriate for external balance.

       In June 1982, participants at the Versailles economic summit

comaissiened         an     official    Working          Group    on    Exchange   Market

Interventionto study the efficacy of government interventions in
exchange markets. The Working Group's April 1983 report concluded
that   sterilized         intervention is a relatively weak instrument of

exchange-tate         policy, with little apparent effectiveness                    beyond

the very short run. This finding is in accord with the quotation

from the Bundesdbank reproduced above, as well as with academic

research on the subject,               which reaches conclusions that arm at

however, a substantial realignment of industrial-country                         currency

values has been achieved and exchange-market intervention (much of

it sterilized) has been conducted on a scale not seen since the

early 1970s. A fresh look at intervention experience may yield new

conclusions,      conclusions       relevant        for     evaluating     the       recent

experience of international policy coordination and the prospects

for its future success.

        The paper    is organized         as follows. Section I reviews the

recent evolution       of key macroeconomic fundamentals,                       other    than

intervention, that are likely to have influenced exchange rates.

This narrative        Sets    out    the    macroeconomic          context      in    which

intervention      has been conducted,           and also       provides      information

needed      for     assessing       intervention's          independent         role      in

currency-market developments.

        Section II then sets out the mechanics of both sterilized and

nonsterilized       intervention,         emphasizing       the    effects      on asset

supplies of alternative intervention strategies. Portfolio-balance

theories of effective sterilized intervention are reviewed in this

section,     which     also     presents        some      econometric     evidence        on

foreign-currency risk premiums.

        Section III considers an alternative to the portfolio-balance

rationale    for sterilized         intervention,         the "signalling"           theory.

According to this view, official portfolio shifts between nonmoney

against     the Japanese      yen;   by the end of August            1985, having

depreciated from February levels by 19.4 percent against the mark

and by 9.4 percent against the yen, the dollar seemed set on the

necessary downward adjustment path.5 (See figures 1 and 2, which

show bilateral      nominal    exchange rates from the end of 1978 and

from the start of 1985, respectively.) A sharp dollar upswing                   in

the first week of      September 1985, occurring against a backdrop of

rising protectionism       in the U.S. Congress, was the catalyst for

the   C-S   Plaza   announcement      and      the   approach    to exchange-rate

management it initiated.7

      Significant     milestones      in    the      ongoing   evolution   of this

approach include the following:

          Plaza agreement      (Septeher       22,   1985). Participants    agreed

that "exchange rates should better reflect fundamentml economic

conditions than has been the case," that "in view of the present

and prospective      changes     in fundamentals,          some further orderly

appreciation of the main non-dollar currencies against the dollar

is desirable,"      and    that C-S governments would "stand ready to

cooperate more closely         to encourage this when to do so would be

helpful."    Funabashi     (1988) has given          an account of the meeting


5The cited changes are based on end-of-month exchange rates,
expressed as dollars per foreign currency unit. Between December
1978 and August 1985, the U.S. price level had risen by a
greater percentage than Japan's or Cermany's had, so even a
complete reversal of the nominsl exchange-rate movements up to
February 1985 would not have restored the real exchange rates
prevailing at the period's start.

7The   dollar's    September surge   is   not visible                      in   the
end-of-month   data plotted in figures 1 and 2.

to     this     account,      an     understanding       was     reached     to     conduct

policy were made, however,                 including a U.S. pledge          to pursue     tax

March 6 and 7, the central banks of France, Germany, Japan, and

global        growth    without upsetting         the     exchange-rate       realignment

process.       On April 21 the monetary authorities of Japan and the

U.S. both lowered their discount rates again.

        • Tokyo summit        (May 4-5, 1986), The C-i           heads of    state set up

compatibility"          of   members'       policies    between     the annual       summit


meetings.        These       multilateral       surveillance        exercises,       to   be

conducted        in cooperation           with the International        Monetary      Fund,

were to censider a number of "indicators'sof' economic performance,

Lncludirlg exchange           rates, international reserves, current-account
and trade balances,               and fiscal deficits. The summit              declaration
seemed to back off a bit from the more vigorous interventionism of

 the    Plaza announcement:           it recommended         that "remedial efforts
 focus    first and foremost          on underlying policy fundamentals,"                 and

 reaffirmed the 1983 Williamsburg                 summit commitment         "to intervene
in exchange markets when to               do   so would be helpful.

     N First      meeting of        the    G-7   Finance Ministers (September             27,

1986).     A year after the     Plaza agreeeent,             the 6-7 Finance Ministers


agreed     that mesbers should adopt macroeconomic policies to reduce
external       imbalances      to     sustainable           levels     "without     further


significant     exchange rate adjustment." In other words, even though

major effects     ef the exchange-rate realignment en current accounts
remained to be seen, realignment had proceeded far enough over                            the
past year to allow countries to stabilize currency values.
Nonetheless, between October 1986 and February 1987, the dollar
depreciated     roughly 11.0 percent further against the mark and 5.5

percent further against the yen.                 (See figure 2,)

       N    Louvre    accord        (February        22,    1987).     The 0-7      finance

ministers      and central      bank governors               (sans    Italy)    made     their

strongest      statement     yet      on the need to hold nominal exchange

rates near existing         levels, but did not reveal to the public exact

reference levels or allowable ranges of variation                          around them:


The MInisters  and Governors agreed that the substantial exchange
rate   changes  since   the  Plaza Agreement will     increasingly
contribute to reducing external imbalances and have now brought
their currencies within ranges broadly consistent  with underlying
economic fundamentals,   given the policy commitments summarized
in this statement. Further subsrantial exchange rate shifts among
their currencies could damage growth and adjustment prospects in
their countries. In current circumstances, therefore, they agreed
to cooperate closely to foster stability of exchange rates around
current levels.


The published        "policy commitments"             included       a German   promise     of

tax cuts, Japanese          assurances of fiscal stimulus                  and tax reform,

and a U.S. pledge to cut the federal deficit to 2.3 percent of GNP

in     1988.    According      to         Funabashi        (1988,    pp.     186-187),     the



                                                 8
participants       also      agreed      to     spend     as     much     as    $4       billion

intervening       over the      period        ending    in     April.     Their goal, he

reports, was to stabilize the mark and the yen within                                5   percent

ranges of 1,8250 marks/dollar             and 153.50 yen/dollar,               respectively.

Intervention       would occur 'on a voluntary basis" within a                                2.5

percent band of these central                 rates, was "expected             to intensify"

between the 2.5 and        5   percent limits, and would be supplemented by

mandatory       "consultation     on     policy      adjustment"        at the     5 percent

limit.    A 7    percent appreciation          of the yen relative to its Louvre

parity    was     however,     ratified        at a G-7 meeting in April 1987,

where    it was agreed,         once     again,      that      "around    current         levels"

member     currencies      "are       within ranges          broadly      consistent         with

economic    fundamentals       and the basic policy intentions outlined at

the     Louvre    meeting.'       A    similar       favorable      assessment            of the

appropriateness      of current exchange-rate levels was offered by the

G-7     after      their     September         26,      1987     meeting.        This        last

announcement,       however,      followed       nearly      six months         of       relative

stability of mutual 0-7 exchange rates.

dollar     depreciated         sharply        against     foreign currencies.                 The

subsequent G-7 communiqué refrained from any direct pronouncement
on the appropriateness          of current exchange-rate                 levels.     A warning
to the foreign exchange markets was, however, issued:


The Ministers and Covernors      agreed  that   either  excessive
fluctuationof exchange rates, a further decline of the dollar, or
a rise in the dollar to an extent that becomes destabilizing to
the adjustment process could be counterproductive by damaging
growth prospects in the world economy. They re-emphasized their
comison           in more stable exchange rates among their
            interest
currencies  and agreed tn conrinue to enoperate        clnsely  in
monitoring and implementing polities to strengthen underlying
economic iundamentals to foster stability of exchange rates. In
addition, they agreed to cooperate closely on exchange markets.


(This    W5tOiO was      repeated,    in almost      identical words,              after    the

April lkii G-7 meeting.)             The   communiqué    praised           the    period    ci

or "destabilizing"         appreciation.       Around   the same time, however,

positive    news on the     US,     foreign deficit, rising dollar interest

rates, and official remarks seemingly favorable to the possibility

of some dollar appreciation set off a two-month slide of the mark

Exchange-Rate      Fundamentals:     Monetary Policies


        In evaluating      the role played by pure intervention in recent

years,     it is useful to have some perspective                 on the behavior of

other     fundamental      determinants      of exchange        rates,      and on the

ability      of    these     fundamentals          to   explain       exchange-market

developments.      Because of the dlose link between intervention and

monetary     policy,     a natural     focus      is an account       of money-market

conditions in Germany, Japan,              and the U.S.        In recent years, the

often erratic behavior of money demand and of individual monetary

aggregates         has made it perilous to use any one as                        an   indicator of

the stance          of monetary      policy.     Some          inferences         about    monetary

tfghtness       can, however,        he based       on the behavior of short-term

nominal       interest      rates.    In sticky-price                 exchange-rate        models,

these rates tend to fall (rise) in the short run, reinforcing                                     the

home currency's depreciation (appreclaton), when monetary policy

is     expansionary         (contractionary)            or     when       the      money    demand

short-term nominal             interest rates as indicators                     of monetary    ease

is, of course, that these rates are influenced                              by    other    factors,

notably the price level and output.                      l'c   is therefore           advisable    to

consider      additional relevant        information, when it is available,                        in

assessing      the stance of monetary policy.

        Figure       3 shows    short-term     nominal          interest         rates    on mark,

yen,        and dollar deposits          since          1978;     interest         differentials

(dollar less mark and dollar less yen) are shown in figure 4. The

figures suggest thmt the foundation for                        the downward trend of the
dollar       after    the first quarter of 1985 wee a falling trend                                in

muimaer of 1914, As dollar interest fell through rho laro spring of

1985,        yen     and   mark    interest      fluctuated               in     narrow     ranges.

Accordingly,         the interest differentisl in favor                    of    dollars dropped



Lisee   for example, Dornbusch (1976). . In Dornbusch's model,
monetary expansion could cause an immediate rise in the short-term
nominal interest rate if output were to respond immediately and
strongly to monetary expansion. This possibility does not seem
very relevant to the three main industrial countries: central
bankers  seem confident   of their ability to lower short-term
interest rates in the short run, and some formal econometric tests
(such as tests based on money announcements) support their view.

began to fall, M2 growth, which had been in the lower portion

its    6'to-9    percent    1984     target     range, jumped sufficiently         to

finish the year around the top." In addition, the Federal Reserve

made    1/2    percent     cuts in its discount rate             in November      and

December      of 1984. In subsequent            testimony before Congress,        Fed

Chairman      Paul    Volcker   included      the   disruptive    effects    of the

dollar's continuing strength among the factors that motivated this

easing of monetary policy.'5

        The effects of looser money did not show up immediately in

exchange      markets;     indeed, during the fall of 1984,             the dollar

appreciated       against    the mark and yen,         and   then   jumped     upward

between       December   1984   and    February 1985      as the     pace    of U.S.

interest       rate    reduction    slowed    and   (in   February)    temporarily

reversed. The dollar began to decline from its peak, however, as a

renewed narrowing         of the interest differentials favoring dollars

began in March. Fueling this development was U.S. M2 growth around

the top of its range, another 1/2 percent discount rate cut in

May,    and progress on the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit reduction

legislation,          which President Reagan signed at the end of 1985.

Falling       interest rates       in Cermany probably slowed, but did not

prevent, the dollar's very sharp depreciation against the mark.

        A firming of U.S. interest rates in the summer of 1985 helped

set the stage for the September dollar rally that preceded the

Plazs    announcement.   The announcement was not accompanied by an

immediate change in international interest differentials; however,

it occasioned    an immediate    fall   in the dollar, even before any

official    intervention   occurred. The    exchange   markets'    response

represented, in part, a reassessment of the likely permanence of

the expansionary monetary      tack pursued    by the Federal Reserve in

previous months. As an official U.S. account put it:


In part, the exchange market reaction reflected the fact that the
announcement was unexpected. More importantly, market participants
noted that the initiative had come from the United States and
viewed it as a change in the U.S. government's previously
perceived attitude of accepting or even welcoming the strong
dollar, In addition, the agreement was interpreted as eliminating
the likelihood that the Federal Reservo would tighten               reserve
conditions in response to rapid U.S. monetary growth.'3


Faced with upward pressure on the yen, the Bank of Japan                pushed

yen interest sharply higher in October; mark interest rates rose

only slightly in that month. Over the course of 1986, dollar
interest first rose, then declined, and then rose relative to yen

interest, while     falling more or less       steadily relative   to mark

interest.     The   dollar's    depreciation    against    the    yen    from

end-September 1985 to end-December 1986, 36.4 percent, was about

the same as its depreciation against the mark,            37.6 percent,    in

contrast to the dollar's greater fall vis-A--vis the mark in the

months before the Plaza agreement. During this period, U.S. H2

growth      remained    strong;      in     addition        to    the        coordinated

discount-rate    cuts mentioned above, which brought                    the U.S.      rate

down to 6.5 percent by the end of April, the Fed carried out two

unilateral 1/2 percent cuts in July and August.

      Already by mid-1986, some policymakers in the U.S., notably

Chairman Voicker,       and many abroad, worried that further dollar

depreciation might have adverse effects on U.S. inflation and on

the   world      economy.       In   September,          the     C-i     issued       the

above-mentioned declaration that current exchange-rate levels were

broadly consistent with "fundamentals." On October 31,                        1986,   the

U.S. Treasury secretary, James A. Baker, and the Japanese finance

minister,     Kiichi    Miyazawa,    reiterated      that      "the    exchange       rate

realignment     achieved between      the yen and the             dollar since        the

Plaza Agreement        is now broadly          consistent      with the underlying

fundamentals...."       The Bank of Japan cut its discount rate,                      and

Miyazawa pledged to stimulate the Japanese economy further through

tax   reform     and    additional     public       spending.14         In    November,

short-term dollar interest rates began to edge upward.

      Disappointing news on the U.S. trade balance, disappointing

implementation     of     the    Japanese       fiscal      undertakings        in    the

Baker-Miyazawa     accord,      and hints       from U.S.      officials       that   the

dollar might need to depreciate further led to a renewed bout of

dollar weakness in December and January. On January 21, Baker and

Niyazawa issued a second communiqué characterizing the dollar-yen

rate as "broadly consistent with fundamentals," despite a dollar

depreciation    against   the yen       of close to 6 percent since the

earlier                      declaration.'5 In subsequent        attempts    to
           Baker-Miyazawa

relieve the upward pressure on their currencies,               the Bundesbank

and the Bank of Japan lowered their discount rates, reinforcing an

                                     dollar's    interest                   The
ongoing     widening of      the                             advantage.

Bundesbank's action followed a year in which, partly as a result

of interventions connected with European Monetary               System     (EMS)

               partly   as a       result of    dollar    interventions,     the
pressures,

central-bank    money   stock had finished far above the top of its

target range. (The mark was revalued within the EMS            on January 12,

1987.)    The Louvre accord,   the     first concerted   attempt to stabilize

currency values       since the dollar turnaround of early 1985, was

announced on February 22, 1987.

     The Louvre accord resulted in a period, about              eight    months


long, of approximate        stability for       the main industrial-country

exchange     rates.   This broad stabilization was achieved             despite

                                                         in part,

also unusually stable.

      It    seems     apparent      in     retrospect             that     the     relative

September 1987. Germany's central-bank money stock was allowed to

overshoot    its 1987 target growth range of 3 to 6 percent by a

considerable margin;        as a result, German Ml and M3 both grew at

exceptionally       rapid       rates     over        the     year.       Japan's     money

supply- -whether measured as Ml or as M2 plus the                                stock    of

certificates of deposit- - grew at              its   fastest rate of the decade

(in both cases well above               10 percent per year).               In the U.S.,

meanwhile, short-term interest rates moved to a higher range and

the growth rate of M2 was held below the bottom of its target

interval;'8 in early        September the Fed raised its discount rate

cited in this paragraph are changes in annual averages (table A14,

easing of monetary policies, a measure of money growth more
relevant for assessing the domestic-policy impact of the Louvre
agreement may be the growth rate of money for the year ending in
September 1987. (A year-long interval is chosen to correct for
money-supply seasonality.) From end-September 1986 through the
same time in 1987, growth rates of Japan's monetary aggregates and
of German Ml are not very different from the figures in the text;
growth of German M3 is 6.4 percent, which is, however, higher than
the upper limit for 1988 M3 growth (6 percent) set by the
Bundesbank in January of that year.

shifted from stocks into bonds and as central banks acted to

off any incipient liquidity crisis; in the process, the interest

differential       in favor of dollars declined. gy the end of 1987,

the    dollar    had    registered       another         decisive      external        decline,

shattering      the lower      limit specified by the Louvre accord. The

dollar's fall was heavily influenced by adverse U.S. trade news,

and it occurred in spite of an interest-rate reduction in Japan

and sn even deeper reduction in Europe. The December 0-7 meeting,

as noted earlier, reaffirmed the goal of exchange-rate                                stability

and    warned against          further dollar            depreciation,          to    no great

immediate effect.

summer-time rise raised the worrisome possibility that progress in

external     adjustment     might     be    slowed       or    even reversed          By

September, however, the dollar upswstng had moderated with the aid

of sharply higher short-term interest rates in Germany.


Exchange-Rate Fundamentals: Government and Private Demand


     A brief look at events impinging more directly than monetary

policy     on    output    markets     will         complete      this      survey    of

macroeconomic       developments    in the recent period of exchange-rate

realignment.     Table 1 reports       data on central-government                fiscal

deficits    (general-government       deficits are         given      in parentheses)

and real domestic demand growth in the three largest economies.'7

        Important    changes    in fiscal positions            are    evident   in the

data.     Over   the   course      of the       early    1980s,      U.S.   government

deficits--central and general alike--rose sharply relative to GNP;

starting    in 1986, a leveling-off and possible                     reversal of this

trend appears. Both Germany and Japan, however, display declining

deficit    ratios over the early           1980s.       In the German case,          this



'7Domestic demand is the sum of domestic consumption and investment
demand, both private end public. Domestic demand growth ratper
than output growth is reported because the former variable is a
more direct measure of pressure on the exchange rate, in the
Mundell-Fleming model, for example, an increase in domestic demand
can cause ths home currency to appreciate even though output does
not change. (See Mundell 1968; a more recent analytical discussion
of the effects of demand factors on real and nominal exchange
rates is in Obstfeld 1985.) The movements in government deficits
reported above, though not cyclically or inflation adjusted, are
broadly consistent (in recent years) with changes in the IMF's
fIscal impulse measures.

downward    trend seems       to end    in 1985-86, while            in the Japanese

case,    the   trend continues        through the           time   of writing.        These

changes in the three countries' internal public deficits over the

decade     correlate     reasonably      well with the             changes      in    their

external deficits.

        In retrospect, the stabilizing of the American and German

fiscal deficit ratios around the mid-l980s stands                       out as a key

factor behind the dollar-mark realignment that began late in the

first quarter         of 1985.      Although       Japan's    fiscal    deficits      have

continued        to   decline       throughout        the     l980s,     U.S.        fiscal

consolidation has promoted dollar-yen realignment as well. Before

1985, market participants            may have expected the then-divergent

trends in national          fiscal positions to continue               for some       time;

these     expectations      would    have contributed,             in turn,      to the

dollar's appreciation against the mark and yen. Thus, the impact

of fiscal policy on exchange rates in the late l980s should not be

judged by the sizes of actual fiscal adjustments alone. To the

extent that fiscal policy actions from 1985 on signalled changes

in the trends of the decade's                first half,      they would have been

accompanied by changes in expected future deficit ratios that have

an effect on exchange rates independent of current fiscal moves.

Rranson (1988) has insisted on the importance of such expectations

effects     in    arguing     that     the        anticipated      enactment     of     the

Grasss-Rudman-Hollings legislation contributed to the dollars 1985

depreciation.

    Lacking the benefits of hindsight, market participants were

able to discern changes in national fiscal trends only over time.



                                             20
A growing perception that American end German fiacel trends had

been altered probably contributed to steady downward pressure on

the dollar relative to the aark and yen after 1985.

       Given    the   likely importance of fiscal-policy                expectations,

little can be gained from attempts to correlate even year-to-year

movements       in currency values with ex post                    changes    in    fiscal

stance. Possibly, more can be learned from divergent movements in

real domestic demand, which are less likely than fiscal-deficit

changes to have been associated with large shifts in long-term

expectations, It is difficult in practice, however, to disentangle

the "pure" exchange-rate            effect of a demand shift--which alters

the    terms    of trade      at    constant       money   price    levels--from         the

expectations about future monetary policy reactions that the shift

creates. Thus, an acceleration of demand growth in the U.S. can

cause neminal dollar appreciation for two reaaona: it signals the

concributora to the yen's appreciation against both the dollar                           and

the    mark.     The extremely high rate of U.S. demand growth in 1984

(8.7 percent)         is noteworthy.      A   plausible hypothesis           is that the

buoyant     business       enwironnient     associated       with this exceptional

growth, perhaps coupled with expectations that monetary tightness

would be needed later          to discourage           inflation,    kept   the dollar

high in 1984 and early              1985    even after      U.S.     monetary     policy

II. Sterilized Intervention as a Policy Instrument

      After 1985. monetary policies in the three main industrial

countries     have      operated    in a setting of relatively              inflexible

fiscal policies,         first to amplify the dollar's              teal depreciation

in    the   hope    of hastening       current-account       adjustment,         then    to

stabilize currencies at levels supposedly consistent with external

equilibrium        in the long run. At the same time, each country has

used monetary means to pursue the additional, domestic, goal of

growth with low inflation.           Iii   a world of N countries and N policy

tools (the individual countries' monetary policies), it is only by

accident that       N   domestic objectives and N-l exchange rate targets

can   be simultaneously            attained.     Unless    N-l   additional       policy

instruments are available, conflicts between internal and external

balance     are bound to arise,            as they have       done    continually        in

recent years.

       Sterilized        foreign-exchange         intervention        furnishes         N-I

additional         policy   tools     with       the    potential     to    be    useful

complements to monetary policies. These N-l additional tools are

pure changes        in the relative stocks of national-currency bonds

held in private portfolios.                A major difficulty          in evaluating

intervention        is to identify         empirically the channels,             if any,

through     which intervention has mignficant, lasting effects on

exchange rates.

The Mechanics of Intervention and Sterilization


      Offioial intervention in the foreign exchenge market has tho

direot effect of altering the balance sheet of the central bank,

and     possihly    of       other      government       agencies.    United    States

intervention,      for       example,    is   carried out by both the Federal

Reserve and by the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF)                     of the US.

Treasury.

        Wnen foreign exchange intervention is not sterilized, it can

affect exchange         rates by changing the stock of high powered                (or

base)     money,    a    change      that     leads   to adjustments     in broader

monetary aggregates, in interest rates, and in market expectations

about future price-level inflation. A stylized balance sheet for

the       German        Bundesbank          would        show   its      net     asset

holdinga -consisting of net foreign assets (UFA) and net dorestic

assets     (NDA)--equei         cc   its      monetary    liabilities,    the   Gerren

A nonsterilized Bundesbenk purchase of a $1 million dollar bank

deposit at PM 2 per dollar, say, alters the central bank's balance

sheet by raising NFA (on the asset aide) and B (on the liability

side), both by DM 2 million. The corresponding                        change    in the

private sector's balance sheet is the mirror image of this one: a

intervention practices. Kenen (19BB, chapter 5) discusses some
asymmetries in currenr intervention arrangements.
DM 2 million rise in German high-powered money holdings, and a DM

2 millIon decline in holdings of dollar deposits.

     The     Bundesbank         could      sterilize       this      intervention's

expansionary effect on the monetary base through several types of

offsetting operation, for example, a DM 2 million open-market sale

of   mark-denominated           domestic        government      securities.     This

additional operation         would reduce the Bundesbank's net domestic

assets and its monetary liabilities, both by OM 2 million. Taken

together,      the     two      Bundesbank        actions--intervention             plus

sterilization- -would leave the public with unchanged holdings of

high-powered    money, but with a higher stock of interest-bearing

mark assets and a correspondingly lower stock of interest bearing

dollar assets. In this sense, sterilized intervention is a 'pure"

change in the relative stocks of national-currency bonds held by

the public, that is, a change that is not accompanied by a change

in the monetary base.'9

     As noted above, sterilized interventions can take many forms.

Consider,    for     example,    a hypothetical forward            exchange    market

intervention       in which     the Bundesbank         sells   three-month    forward

marks for forward dollars. This operation is essentially the same

as   the    sterilized       intervention       just    described,     in    that     it



'9My discussion draws a perhaps artificially. sharp distinction
between "money" and "bonds," and lumps all interest bearing assets
together under the latter category. As a practical matter,
fiancial authorities have available a rich menu of financial
operations,   across   liquidity   categories,    maturities,  and
currencies. I judge an intervention to be sterilized when it has
no effect on the monetary base, defined as the stock of reservable
central-bank liabilities, including currency; and I exclude from
the definition of "bonds" any interest-bearing reserves of the
domestic banking system held at the central bank.

increases the net stock of mark bonds held by the private sector

(the private      sector's net claims on future delivery                 of marks),

decreases the net stock of dollar bonds, but does rot change the

German base.2° Operations by non-central bank government                  agencies,
such as    the United States ESF, are automatically sterilized if               the
balances    drawn    on for     intervention purposes        are    held in the

private    banking    system,    say,     or in the        form of government

securities purchased and sold in the open market. If some of these

balances    are     held at     central    banks,     however,     the    agencies'
interventions may have monetary effects.

     Certain        central-bank        transactions       are     automatically

sterilized, after some time lag. Imagine that the                Bundesbank   lends

DM 1 million        to the Bank of France for              intramarginal      franc

International Portfolio Balance and Exchange Rates


        Since     sterilized      intervention     operates        by   changing

the     currency denomination       of bonds     held by the public,         such

changes must affect asset-market equilibrium if any exchange-rate

change    is to result, As a isatcer of theory,              the   link between

government       asset   swaps    and equilibrium     is   not     iaaediate:    a

government      exchange of foreign for domestic assets with domestic

residents may wash out if private agents fully capitalize, as part

of    their     own   wealth,    all   future net    taxes    levied    by      the

governmenc. In this extreme case of Ricardian equivalence becween

debt issue and taxes, the government csnnot aystemacically affect

the relevant       "outside" bond supplies, that is the net supply of

claims on governments that the public must hold. The evidence on

Ricardian       equivalence    is ambiguous, so in what follows, I will

assume that government           asset operations do indeed move         outside

asset supplies in the intended directions, though not necesssrily



2tFor  simplicity,  this example has abstracted entirely from
interest payments. Of course, the intervention's effects would be
reversed entirely if the Bank of France went to the open market to
purchase the needed marks with high-powered francs.

       How should changes in outside supplies of national-currency

debt     affect   asset     markets?        Portfolio-balance   theories   of

exchange-rate     determination   link relative expected nominal rates

of return on bonds of different currency denomination to outside

asset supplies. According to these theories, a wealth owner cares

about the riskiness of a portfolio as well as the expected return

that it offers. Since bonds of different currency denomination are

perfect     substitutes    for risk averters only under very unlikely

circumstances, a change in outside asset supplies generally alters

the risk characteristics of the market portfolio and thus requires

an     equilibrating   adjustment      in    currencies'   relative   expected

returns -

       More precisely, let          be the one-period risk-free nominal

interest rate on domestic currency,               the corresponding rate on

                           the (spot) price of foreign currency in terms

setting for the same reason that private firms' decisions
currency of denomination of their borrowing may have no effect.
(See the chapter by Froot in this volume.) Stockman (1979) and
Obatfeld (1982) discuss the relation between Ricardian equivalence
and intervention effects. As illustrated in those papers, and as
stressed more recently by Backus and Kehoe (1988), the analysis of
intervention cannot be conducted independently of an analysis of
the resulting effects on the government's intertemporal budget
constraint. Thus, if pure intervention disturbs asset-market
equilibrium   because   taxes  are distorting,    the   effect  of
intervention would depend heavily on which taxes (if any) need to
be adjusted afterward to ensure government solvency. In principle,
it is easy to imagine that a given intervention could have a wide
variety of effects, depending on how its budgetary impact is
accommodated. (The same point naturally applies to the evaluation
of any other policy.) Section III below discusess the linkage
between intervention and government budget constraints from the
perspective of policy credibility.

is a function of the outside supplies                             of assets denominated in

domestic and foreign currency. An implication is that changes in

outside     asset supplies,            such       as those          caused by        sterilized

intervention,       can alter asset-market prices, including exchange

rates.     The general       presumption           is       that,     all    else    equal,     an

incremse in the stock of domestic-currency debt that the public

must hold will raise            the domestic-currency interest rate, lower

the foreign-currency           interest rate, and depreciate                     the domestic

currency     in the foreign exchange market. Branson and Henderson

(1985) provide a complete survey of portfolio-based approaches.

      There     is    a    large       body       of    evidence        contradicting          the

hypothesis    that         in   (I)    is identically zero, or even constant

over time; Hodrick          (1987) presents a                     thorough    review      of this

evidence, and of its interpretation by various authors. The risk

premium         could be        identically zero                  if investors       were     risk

neutral    (and certain other conditions held); in this case, bonds

differing      in     currency         of     denomination             would        be     perfect

substitutes,        implying     that       changes         in their         relative      outside



                                              29
supplies   do not   necessarily    call for         equilibrating      changes    in

relative asset returns. Under         perfect substitution,          there    is no


meaningful   distinction      (leaving      aside    the     incentive       effects

to be discussed in section III) between monetary changes brought

about by transactions in foreign exchange markets and changes of

equal magnitude     brought   about    by measures         such   as open-market

trades of domestic     securities.       The condition
                                                             p        0 is often

called the uncovered interest parity condition.ZS

     The statement that uncovered interest parity fails to hold is

not the same as the statement            that sterilized          intervention    is

effective.2 The latter statement would be supported, however, by



23Engel and Flood (1985, p. 314) argue that "certain types of
sterilized intervention can be effective in temporarily altering
exchange rates, even in the presence of uncovered         interest
parity." They give as an example a (nonsterilized) sale of foreign
bonds by the central bank, accompanied by a temporary rise in
monetary transfer payments that holds the money supply constant
and simultaneoLsly raises private net wealth at the initial money
price level.   A key feature of this policy package is, however,
the fiscal policy change that accompanies the central bank's
foreign-exchange intervention. It is not surprising that a fiscal
change accompanied by a nonsterilized intervention        disturbs
equilibrium, even when the money supply remains constant as a
result of the combined policy actions.



2The implication of Ricardian equivalence, that the government
does not change outside asset supplies when it conducts sterilized
intervention, has already been mentioned. Backus and Kehos (1988),
in a non-Ricardian model with risk-averse investors, present other
examples of sterilized interventions that have no effects. Suppose
that the dollar.mark rate will be $S(w) per mark next period if
the state of nature ca occurs, and imagine two bonds with
respective payoffs of DM I and $S(w) in state ca, and with a common
payoff of zero in other states. These securities are perfect
substitutes because they have the same payoff in every state of
nature;   intervention  operations  that change    their  relative
supplies thus have no effects, in spite of the fact that the
bonds' face values differ in currency of denomination. Backus and
Kehoe present further examples, all of which involve operations in
securities which are perfect substitues (despite private risk

however, been forthcoming. Define

(1987, pp. 119-128) documents the failure of such tests co produce

significant        evidence        chat asset supplies         affecc risk premiums.

        Some of the tests discussed by 1-lodrick impose added structure

on the problem of relating the cx post excess recurn (2) to

outside    asset supplies by assuming that international                         investors

are mean-variance          optimizers. The resulting capital-asset pricing

model     (CAPM)     implies        that     the      coefficient   in the regression

equation depends on the degree of investor risk aversion and cbs

covsrisnce     matrix of unexpected asset returns, which is assumed

not to change over time. Evidence that the covariance matrix does

indeed change over time (see Cumby and Obstfeld,                           1984) hss led

some researchers          to postulate explicitly time-varying covsrisnce



aversion) because of their identical state-contingent payoffs.
These examples sre of limited practical relevance for evslusting
sterilized intervention, since the securities traded in reality do
not have identical payoffs scross states of nature, and therefore
are not generally perfect substitutes for investors.

matrices in estimation. Engel and Rodrigues (198]), Giovannini and

Jorion (1989), and Mark (1988) take this approach; the first two

papers    find    evidence      against        versions    of     the    CAPM    with

time-varying     covariances,     while    the last       is more favorable.      It

seems fair to say, however, that none of these models can explain

more than a small fraction of the volatility in the ex post excess

return (2). Allowing for time-varying covariances in the CAPM does

little if anything       to support the view that shifts in outside

asset supplies, per se, have significant exchange-rate                   effects!

Consumption-Based Asset Pricing Models


       An alternative approach to modelling the risk premium views

consumption risk as a major determinant of asset returns. On this

view, the mechanisma that might underlie any effects of sterilized

intervention     are    somewhat        less    direct     than    those     driving

portfolio-balance       models.    Presumably,       sterilized         intervention

could affect exchange rates by altering the composition of private

wealth, and thereby altering the covariance of wealth, and hence

of consumption, with the returns on various currencies.

       The consumption-based       theory builds          on the    intertemporal

efficiency condition      for an individual who derives utility
                                                                                u(c)

        To asaeaa the possibility that the results of table 2 are

explained by a time-varying consumption-based risk premium, it is

useful to write (3) in s fora that is comparable to (4). This can

be done by observing that                                    +
                          E(Q+i)                                  R)   l, which      implies

Equation       (5)   shows   how depreciation,             adjusted    for      consumption

reports the results of empirical tests. For the purpose of these

tests, it was assumed that (I) utility is separable in consumption

of services, nondurables, and dursbles;                     (2)    the utility derived

from any consumption category can be measured by a function that

is isoelastic with elasticity 2 (so that u' (c) is a constant times

c -2); and (3                                        27

27Consumption of dursbles is not considered in rhe tests for
reasons outlined by Grossman and baroque (1987). Because of the
deseasonslization     I    performed    in    constructing    the
consumption-adjusted depreciation series used in table 3, the
reported standard errors are subject to a (hopefully minor)
asymptotic inconsistency. See the data appendix for a description
of the seasonal-adjustment procedure used.

5 illustrates why the consumption-based model cannot go very fat

in explaining the risk premium; it compares the cx post values of

the right-hand sidos of equations (4) and (5), using data for the

first                      reported   in table        3.     (This      is    a completely
          regression

representative        picture, however.)        The correlation between               these

two     variables     is    extremely   high:     price          levels      are   not very

variable compared with exchange rates, and except at implausibly

high levels of risk aversion, aggregate consumption variability is
insufficient        to help much in explaining               excess       returns    in the


foreign exchange market.

         Hodrick (1987) reviews a largely negative body of evidence on

consumption-based          international asset         pricing models.28 Slightly

more      favorable    results     have been reported               recently       by Cushy

(1988), Hodrick (1989), and Obetfeld (1989a). Nonetheless, the low

explanatory power of these models precludes any strong inferences

about the validity of a portfolio-balance rationale for sterilized

intervention.         Perhaps   the point      to take           home    is that cx post

exchange-rate variability             is so high relative               to that of other

variables     in all of the models reviewed that only the weakest

conclusions can be drawn from tha econometric record.



III. Intervention as a Signal to Exchange Markets

 from uncovered         interest      parity    has        led    some       researchers   to

                       forecasts.29        Others    researchers         interpret        the
exchange-rate

            results         as evidence      of weaknesses        in the econometric
negative

methods and the empirical risk models that have been applied°

        Members     of both achools agree, however,                 that    there      is    a

channel     through which          sterilized    intervention      can move exchange

rates     even    when bonds        of different currency           denomination          are

perfect     substitutes. That channel is the new information about

economic conditions and future economic policies that the volume

and     direction       of    intervention       may    signal     to     the        aarkot

independently of any other current policy changes. Marston (1988)

provides         an     interesting          comparative     discussion           of        two

episodes--the Carter administration's dollar support operations of

late      1978,       and    the    Plara     declaration--in       which       sterilized

intervention accompanied explicit                   policy announcements          aimed     at

changing the course of exchange markets.

        Notice that the signalling              effect of intervention might not

be     detectable       by means       of econometric        teats       such   as     those

discussed in section II, because forward-rate forecast errors can

be uncorrelated with lagged intervention despite being correlated

with contemporaneous intervention. This correlation pattern could


 29Froot and Frankel (1989) suggest this as one possible explanation
 (among others) for the results of their study of survey data on
 exchange-rate expectations.
 One type of econometric problem, which arises when large
 infrequent interventions can disturb the data-generating process,
 is the "peso problem," (See Lewis 1988 and Obstfeld 1988 for
 discussions.) Peso problems are clearly of potential relevance in
 analyzing recent exchange-market data.

occur if, for example,         currency-denominated          bonds     were perfect

substitutes,         expectations    were       rational,        and         sterilized

intervention helped significantly in             predicting       future           monetary

policies.        While   the   results   of     section     II   allow       no      direct
inferences about the signalling           effect,        alternative         econometric

tests of signalling can be          designed.      In a      study     covering          the

period 1977-1981, Dominguez (1988) provides empirical support                            for

the proposition that Federal Reserve              intervention         has     at     times

communicated informatiou useful           for    predicting       future           monetary
            31
policies.
     Consideration of episodes such as those described by                          Marsto

raises three fundamental (and closely connected>                  questions           about

the hypothesis that sterilized intervention affects exchange rates

through     a     signalling   mechanism.       First,    what    information            is

contained in interventions that is not              contained        in      the    verbal

policy announcements that typically             complement       intervention            and

sometimes substitute for it? Second, why should sterilized foreign

exchange intervention, rather            than other        reallocations            of   the

government's        asset   portfolio,    be particularly              effective          in

signalling official intentions or information? For example,                           would

it not be equally effective to signal that                 currency       depreciation




31Dominguez   shows   that   in  the   period   from   the   Fed's
monetary-targeting shift in October    1979 until the following
spring, there is a significant positive relationship between money
surprises (defined as Fed money announcements less Money Market
Survey forecasts) and official U.S.       purchases   of   foreign
currencies carried out in the interval between forecast and
announcement. Her interpretation is that the Fed used intervention
to signal information about monetary policy not reflected in the
prior market forecast.

is desired through open-market sales of domestic bonds                   that are

subsequently sterilized" by an offsetting increase in commercial

banks' rediscount quotas? Third, what,                if anything, assures the

market    that     the   signals     sterilized    intervention       conveys   are

credible?    In other       words,     are    there    coats   that     discourage

governments from sending deceptive signals in attempts to obtain

short- term advantages?

     An     obvious advantage of foreign-exchange intervention as a

signalling device is that it can be daployed rapidly and around

the clock, with immediate            impact in the markets where          exchange

rates are set. The difficulties one feces in taking the analysis

of   intervention        signals     beyond this       observation     were     well

summarized    by Tobin (1963), in a discussion                 of the role        of

discount-rate changes in monetary management:


For many students of central bank policy the psychology of the
announcement is the most important and perhaps the only important
aspect of the discount rate, Unfortunately there is little of a
systematic character that ten be said shout it. Will the public
conclude from the announcement of a fell in the discount rate that
predictions of recession are now confirmed by the expert economic
intelligence of the central benk, and therefore regard the
announcement as a deflationary portent? Or will the market judge
that the authorities have tbua indicated their resolute intention
of preventing deflation, arresting and reversing the recession,
and accordingly interpret the announcement as an inflationary
sign? What do the authorities themselves regard as the likely
psychological effects of their announcements? Clearly it is easy
to become enmeshed in a game of infinite regress between the
central bank and the market.



In the quarter-century         since     this passage was published,            some

progress     has     been     made     in     systematically    modelling        the

announcement     effects    of sterilized intervention. It is fair to

say, however, that the models put forward so fer are not close to


                                         38
representing      the full range of government concerns that motivate

intervention.

       One reason sterilized intervention may send more informative

and more credible        signals       than announcements       or other   public

debt-management      policies    centers on the effect of unanticipated

exchange-rate changes on the government's net worth, (Mussa, 1981,

discusses the relevance of this effect.) For example, a government

that buys foreign exchange on a sterilized                basis- - thereby going

long    in foreign currency       and short       in domestic--will    lose more


money    than it otherwise        would     have lost if its own currency

                                                        than the
subsequently appreciates by a percentage amount greater

nominal interest differential. Public finance considerations thus

lend credibility to a government that uses sterilized purchases of

foreign exchang to signal a future depreciation of the domestic

currency;     conversely,      sterilized    sales   of foreign currency may

communicate       a credible    signal that       policies   to appreciate     the

domestic currency will be pursued. The expectations created when a

policy authority "puts its money where its mouth is" in this way

can move exchange rates even under perfect asset substitutability.

        As   an   illustration,     suppose        that   the   U.S.   Treasury's

             Stabilization      Fund    decides    to   intervene   in marks    to

                                                                in
purchases dollar securities on the open market (say, $5 million

U.S. Treasury bills at an exchange rate of OH 2 per dollar). The

effect on the U.S. government's balance sheet is:

This intervention              has     no    effect    on the U.S.         monetary   base.


Although its           monetary         effects       in      the   US.    are   therefore


sterilized, the          intervention does alter U.S.                 incentives: having

gone long in dollars and abort in marks, the Treasury is now more

wilnerable       to an unanticipated rise in the mark's dollar price.

         In November          1978,    the announcement thst          the U.S.    Treasury

would sell "Carter bonds" denominated in marks and Swiss francs

may initially have altered market forecasts by appearing to reduce

the 1J.S. government's                incentive to inflate. <The rapid unwinding

of the initial favorable market response to the Carter package

illustrates the perils of intervention signals that are not backed

up promptly by                concrete       policy     changes.)     Similarly,      recent

       The    foregoing       idesa can be formalized            in the context of

recent research         on dynamic optimal taxation, Work by Lucas and

Stokey (1983), Persson, Persson, and Svensson                     (1987), Calvo         and

Obstfeld      (1988), and Obarfeld          (1989h) has       shown how government

(technically        speaking,       the     dynamic     consistency)       of    optimal

government plans.            More generally, alternative debt strategies can

      As suggested          above, a government       that buys         home-currency

bonds and sells foreign bonds may reduce its own future incentives

to creates•.tprise          inflation, and thereby lead traders to infer

that the hoae currency will be stronger in the future than they

had   previously          believed.   Given    current     money    supplies,       the

sterilized     sale       of foreign currency        will- thus     cause     a   spot

appreciation of the home currency. Bohn (1988) develops a model of

the type     described       above    to examine     the   incentive      effects   of

government operations in foreign

      Such models could be useful in understanding                  tha apparently

intervention, If the Japanese authorities coordinate their dollar



33gackus  and Kehoe (1988) also mention the possible strategic
effects of sterilized     intervention, but do not suggest       a
particular model. Bohn's account stresses that a nationalistic
government will be motivated nor only by its own budgetary needs
but by its potential ability to alter the net real foreign asset
position of the domestic private sector, For example, if the
domestic public has a net foreign debt denominated in horn
currency, the government has an added incentive to inflate. The
welfare effects of policy-induced wealth zedistributions from
                      -




foreigners to domestic residents are likely to be large corpared
with the costs of tax distortions           (which determine   the
welfare value of wealth transfers from the domestic public to the
government). If bonds are perfect substitutes, however, individusl
portfolio composition is indeterainste in equilibrium, as is the
direction   of the wealth redistribution associated with an
exchsnge-rate change. In this setting, the government might well
lack sufficient information to calculate the effect on net foreign
wealth various actions. gven if U.S. treasury bonds were initially
placed with Japanese investors, say, there is nothing to prevent
the original buyers from quickly selling the bonds to Americans in
the secondary market and investing the proceeds in, say, sterling.

government's gains from yen appreciation, and the U S.

positive effect on the dollars value would he smaller if Japan

intervened         alone        and      the    Ametiran           government's        incentives

       How     powerful             in practice           are    the   budgetary       incentives

underlying these idema? In testimony before Congress shortly after

the Plaza announcement,                 Stephen      1-1.   Axilrod, then Federal Reserve

Staff       Director       for       Monetary        and        Financial    Policy,     felt    it

necessary to commene on the budgetary                            implications of recent U S.

purchases      of foreign currencies. After pointing out that lower

intereat      earnings          on those investments might be offset by an

appreciation          of     foreign          curronciea          against     the   dellar,      he

concluded that any net effect "would be very amall absolutely and

         lncerestir.g as thcy are, the publinfinance nodels are quite

specialized: they capture only one aspect of goverusent behavior,

and probably not the most important crc. In reality, governments

pursue many gcals       r.ot   present          these    models,    such   as high

erployment,     and respond      to purely political             events,   such   as

sactcral pressures for protection              Furthermore, the ohservability

inadequate     for addressing    some    issues.
     Stein (1988) presents a simplc incomplete-information model
in which the market cannot observe directly the authorities'
utility trade-off between an exchange-rate target and a domestic
policy     target. Uncertainty over official preferences prevents the
market fromaccurately f'-recssting future monetary policy. 8ecause
of the temptation to manipulate the currant exchange rate through
a  time-inconaisrant policy, the authorities cannot credibly
announce the future level of the money supply. Surprisingly,

however?     the authorities car. credibly communicate              some   of their
private information to the marker, and in a way that favorably
affects the current exchange rate. Specifically, the authorities
can credibly announce a range of future exchange-rate targets,
even though the announcement of any precise policy target is not
credible. Aside from rationalizing the recent 6-7 practice of
 indicating only broad target ranges for exchange rates, Stein's

                                          44
model suggests that intervention itself could provide a noisy hut

credible message about policymakers' private information,

      Intervention may be costly foc a government, as noted earlier,

with costs that depend on the private information the government

has. While such signalling costs play no role in Stein's analysis,

they may allow the market to use observed interventions for more

precise    inferences about that data available to the authorities,

Asymmetric     information          thus   provides         an additional     mechanism

through which intervention costa can lend credence to intervention

aignmls.

      Uncertainty has additional implications for intervention that

any   realistic           analysis      must        recognize.      Policymakers     have

imperfect      information about              market      fundamentals; for      example,

they usually are unable to observe directly shifts in comparative

advantage     or     the        location      of    new     international     investment

opportunities.       By      "testing      the      market"    through    intervention,

authorities        may     gain    a    better       idea     of whether      particular

exchange-rate movements represent transitory factors that ought to

be offset--such            as erroneous rumora             about future policies--or

permanent developments that it would be unwise to resist through

monetary adjustments. Government agencies may well lose money in

carrying     out    such     exploratory         intervention operations,          but at

least part of            this    cost   can    be    viewed    as   a price    paid for

insight     into    market        conditions,        Generally,     individual     market

actora will        also    gain    information by observing              the effects   of

official interventions.

to answer this question by examining the timing and magnitude of

interventions                   three             industrial        countries.       The
                    by the              largest

message    in the data appears           to be that monetary               and    fiscal

actions,    rather     than     sterilized     interventions,       have    been     the

dominant policy determinants of the             broad    exchange-rate movements

of recent years. On several occasions, however, intervention seem

to have been effective in signalling to exchange markets the major

governments' resolve to adjust other macroeconomic                    policies,       if

necessary,      to achieve exchange-rate          goals. On other          occasions,

authorities have been convinced              by exchange-market pressures to

modify     these    goals     rather    than to make        fully     accommodating

monetary or fiscal changes. Sterilized intervention has not helped

governments        resolve    conflicts between internal and                 external

balance    in   an! fundamntsl way.

to exchange-rate          induced      fluctuations           in   the    dollar       value    of

existing        nondollat       reserves;         but     despite          this        valuation

discrepancy, the nuabers in table S are reasonably well correlated

with the dollar value of actual foreign exchange acquisitions by

the      two     countries'        authorities.          Because          of      German       EMS

interventions, the reported series is significantly mote reliable

as an indicator of dollar acquisitions for Japan than for Germany.

        The intervention series probably most useful in assessing the

pressure       of intervention on domestir financial markets is the
domestic-currency              value        of      official              foreign          asset
acquisitions- -essentially,            the balance            of payments         in domestic

currency.       This variable          captures         the    incipient       addition         to

domestic base money resulting from intervention.                           Table 6 reports

quarterly      data on the mark value              of Bundesbank mcquisitions of

excluded from the acquisition data, appear in the second rolumn.3

35The coverage of table 6 is potentially broader than that of 5,
because 5 excludes foreign assets other than those classified by
the IMF as foreign exchange reserves, for example, SDRs and the
IMF reserve position. Notice that the capital gains reported in
table 6 are changes in the mark (not dollar) value of reserves; in
some quarters, these data measure capital gains inexactly because
they include SDR allocations.

financial markets, but they can have significant consequences for

the government's financea.

      Some caveats applying to all of the data are in order. Even

in the absence of valuation changes, the figures in tables                         5   and 6

may differ considerably               from outright          official     purchases       of

foreign exchange       in the open market.                 Interest    earnings    on the

Bundesbank's     dollar       assets,       for     axample,    when reinvested            in

dollars,    swell     the    hank's net       foreign       assets,     even though no

transaction in the foreign exchange market is directly                         involved.

As    argued    by     Adams        and    Henderson         (1983),    however,         such

reinvestment     is correctly thought of as intervention,                      since      the

German government           could    have used dollar interest              earnings       to

reduce the flow of mark-denominated government                        debt into private

portfolios,     simultaneously            leaving    more     dollar bonds         for    the

private market to hold. There are, in addition, some problems of

measurement     related       to     off-balance-sheet         items,    end-of-quarter

"window dressing" of balance sheets, and so on.


Intervention and the Exchange Markets


      An informml review of tsbles 4-6 in the light of section l's

nmrrstive      provides      a      vantage   from which to             evaluate       recent

intervention experience.

        Pre-Plaza      period        (January-September 1985). Table               6 shows

that the Bundesbsnk           intervened heavily            in the first quarter of

1985 to stop the dollar's rise to its peak; the U.S. intervened at

the   smme time, but on a much smaller                         scale.    The   Bundesbsnk

sterilized      its     intervention--in             the     Bundesbsnk's      published

billion) is aceompanid by so unusually large domestic open-carkec

purchase undec repurchsse agreement (DM 12.1 billion), Short-term

mark interest rates showed only a temporary and relatively small

increase in this quartet.35 In the two subsequent quartets,                                the

German authorities purchased dollars am the dollar depreciated,

and     took   advantage     of the mark's          relative       strength        to   lower

interest       rates in the face of a weak domestic                     economy. Japan's

foreign reserves show a net rime over theme two quarters                                (table

5);    the U.S., for the momt part, stayed on the aidelinea                             (table

last quartet of          1985     the U.S.    and Japan, backing              up the Plaza

announcement, both intervened                to push the dollar down.               Germany

also    carried out       open-market dollar          sales,       but    once     nonmarket

transactions are taken into account, its foreign reservea show a

net     increase    for    the     quartet    (tables       S    and    6).    Intervention

clearly played no role in promoting the dollar's depreciation over

1986; U.S. activity was insignificant, and Japan bought dollars to

counteract yen appreciation. Indeed, by the second half of 1986,

the Bundesbank had joined Japan                in trying to brake              the dollar's

fall     through dollar         purchases,    but the resulting interventions

5). (Germany's sizable intervention in the first quarter of 1987

was motivated largely by an EMS realignment episode.) On March 11,

the U.S. bought $30 million in marks                 to counteract heavy private

sales    of the German currency.               Pressure      on the mark       rapidly

subsided, but then the yen befan to appreciate. Between March 23

and April 6 the Fed intervened daily and purchased                  a   total of $3.0

billion with yen; between April 7 and 17, the Fed intervened on

three occasions, buying $532 million,45 These operations marked the

first major U.S.      interve,tion          in foreign exchange rarkits          since

the   Plaza period in late            1985,    but    intervention now aimed         at

supporting the dollar,        not bringing it dawn. The Bundesbank and

other European     central baaka            also participated       in these dollar

support    operations.   Presrare           on the yen eased only after              the

end-September and end-December                       1987, before partially             recovering

and stabilizing               in in the last part of January 1988. From then

until       mid-June,         the     dollar-mark      and dollar-yen         exchange         rates

fluctuated within relatively                       narrow ranges. The            U.S.    conducted

moderate       dollar support operations                    in March and April of 1988,

while        Japan        intervened           more        heavily    to     discourage           yen

                         Germany,          however,    allowed       its    reservea      to    fall

weakness of the mark. Short-term mark interest rates also drifted

upward after the end of January. Until the second half of June,

however,          the    interest          differential       favoring      dollar      over    mark

assets increased.

developments, already reviewed above, led to a sharp appreciation

of the dollar in June. The U.S. began intervening to discourage

the dollar's rise on June 27;                        foreign-exchange operations by the

U.S.        and    foreign          authorities,        sometimes      on    a     large       ocalo,

continued          through          the    summer.     By early       September         the    dollar

appeared once again to have stabilized; but from                                        end-May    to

end-August,             the    U.S.       currency    had appreciated by 7.9 percent

against       the mark and by 7.2 percent                       against      the yen,         despite

forceful coordinated intervention efforts.


How Effective Has Intervention Been?


        International               currency    experience       since      1985   lends       little

support        to the idea that sterilized                      intervention        has       been an

41See Federal Reserve Bulletin, February 1986, p.   112. As noted
earlier, this figure may overstate the true extent of intervention
becauae it omits such factors as intereat earnings on dollar
reserves. Feldatein (1986) argues that the intervention that
followed the Plaza announcement had little effect on exchange
rates.


                                                  54
        intervention totals for 1987-88           are much higher         than for   1985

or   1986,   but even so, the intervention provided at best a partial

brake    on exchange-market pressures. Germany's official                       external

asset acquisitions in 1987 were DM 41.2 billion, equal to ronghly

a third      of its   year-end     currency       stock. Most of this             reserve

inflow was       sterilized     through domestic           open-market      operations,

however,     and Germany's      stock of high-powered              central-bank      eoney

rose by only GM        15.5 billion         in 1987. in 1986, when reserve

inflows were much lower,            central-bank           money    rose by DM 13.1

billion. How large were the effects of this GM 41.2 billion inflow

on the supply of mark-denominated bonds? OECD estimates snggear

that the net debt of the German government                     in 1987 was no core

than 25 percent of GNP, or            081   505.8     million.       The 198?     reserve

inflow thus represented more than 8 percent of Germany's total nor

public debt- -a large number, but not large enough to prevent                            a


sharp mark appreciation           against the        dollar        over   l98?.    It   is

doubtful that sterilized interventions on this scale could be the

norm in a         viable      target-zone        system.     As    noted    above,      the

interventions had a serious adverse                  effect on Germany's           public

finances.

        Japan,    too, sterilized much of the massive reserve inflow it

experienced as a result of its own 1987                      interventions.       Foreign

 table 1.3; GEGO, Economic Outlook 43, June 1988, p. 27. To assess
 the intervention's effect on relative bond supplies, the entire
 foreign reserve inflow (and not just the sterilized portion) is
 counted as an addition to the stock of outstanding mark debt,
 because monetary-base growth not brought about by foreign asset
 purchases would otherwise have been brought about by purchases of
 mark assets.

trillion in that year, yet high-powered money rose by only V 2,8

trillion, compared with a rise of Y 2.4 trillion in               l986.   OECI)

estimates put Japan's 1987 net public debt at around 25 percent of

GNP, or V 86.2 trillion." So Japan's V 5.1 trillion 1987 reserve

increase     amounted to roughly 6 percent of the net public debt.

(And this figure is an understatement,             because    it includes yen

capital losses on official Japanese foreign reserves, suffered as a

result of the dollar's 1987 depreciation.) Although too large and

costly to become a way of life for the Japanese                government, the

intervention    of   1987    still   did not prevent a substantial yen

appreciation ov,er the course of that year.

      Shifting fiscal trends contributed to the dollar's fall from

its peak of early 1985, but it is monetary policy that has been

the   more     important     instrument     of   medium-term     exchange-rate

management. On several occasions, officials chose to adjust their

exchange-rate    objectives     in the face of market pressure, rather

than compromise domestic policy goals. Substantial departures from

internationally agreed exchange-rate targets occurred, in spite of

heavy intervention,        in the three months after the Louvre accord,

in the three months following the October 1987 stock-market crash,

11 and 14. As noted below, the dollar depreciated over 1987, so
the V 5.1 billion figure understates the expansionary pressure on
Japan's money supply; it includes the negative effect of capital
losses on official dollar reserves measured in yen. Such capital
losses do not directly reduce the high-powered money supply.

In the absence of this additional instrument, however, authorities

inevitably    encounter      dilemmas       as a result of attempts to gear

 that    the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates farther to

                     alternative exchange-rate reg-lmes to various
 shocks are analyzed in Obstfeld (1985). Controls on cross-border
 capital movements are a possible way out of the dilemma of
 instrument insufficiency, but it is fanciful to think that a
 reversal of the trend toward more global financial markets is
 fully enforceable or, at the: moment, politically feasible.
