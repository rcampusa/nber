                                             ABSTRACT

Little is known about whether breastfeeding may prevent disabilities throughout childhood. We
evaluate the effects of breastfeeding on child disability using data from the National Survey of Family
Growth merged to the National Health Interview Survey for a large nationally representative sample
of children aged 1 to 18 years from the U.S. including over 3,000 siblings who are discordant on
breastfeeding status/duration. We focus on a mother fixed effect model that compares siblings in
order to account for family-level unobservable confounders and employ multiple specifications
including a dynamic model that accounts for disability status of the prior child. Breastfeeding the
child for a longer duration is associated with a lower risk of child disability, by about 0.2 percentage-
points per month of breastfeeding. This effect is only observed on the intensive margin among
breastfed children, as any breastfeeding has no effect on the extensive margin. We conclude that
very short breastfeeding durations are unlikely to have an effect on reducing disability risk.

1. Introduction

       A wide literature exists on the effects of breastfeeding on infant and child health

outcomes. Meta-analyses of previous studies in developed countries have found that

breastfeeding is associated with improvement in certain physical health measures including

reduced risks of infection, obesity, diabetes, and asthma (Ip et al., 2009). Meta-analyses and

randomized studies have also found an improvement in infant’s physical growth with prolonged

breastfeeding (Kramer and Kakuma, 2002, 2004). Furthermore, breastfeeding for a longer

duration has been reported to improve achieving several developmental milestones among

infants including gross and fine motor, language, and social adaptation skills (Belfield and Kelly,

2012; Chiu et al., 2011; McCrory and Murray, 2012). Improvement in neurodevelopmental

outcomes with breastfeeding has also been reported in other smaller observational studies

(McCowan et al., 2002). In addition, some studies that compare siblings to each other have

found that breastfeeding may enhance cognitive ability and long-term educational achievement

(Belfield and Kelly, 2012; Evenhouse and Reilly, 2005; Rees and Sabia, 2009).


       Even with this large literature, there are still important gaps in the knowledge about the

effects of breastfeeding on child health and development. In particular, it remains unclear

whether breastfeeding may reduce the risk of child disability in the form of physical and

cognitive limitations or not. Identifying this effect is important for determining whether

breastfeeding, an easily accessible household intervention, may reduce child disability risks and

enhance child physical and cognitive development. This is especially relevant given the high

and rising prevalence of child disability in the United States over the past few decades, and the

fluctuating rates of breastfeeding including a recent increase over the past few years. More than

15% of children in the U.S. are estimated to have one or more of chronic physical or mental
conditions that may eventually result in activity limitations (Boyle et al., 2011). More

importantly, the rate of children experiencing these activity limitations in the U.S. has increased

from about 1.8% in 1960 to 7% in 2004 (Perrin et al., 2007). The reasons behind this increase

remain unknown.


        In contrast, breastfeeding rates have been fluctuating significantly over the past few

decades including some periods of significant decline. Figure 1 shows the breastfeeding rates

between 1965 and 1995, which is the period covered in our study. Breastfeeding rates were very

low in the late 1960s through late 1970s – less than 40%. However, after an increase to over

55%, breastfeeding rates declined again in late 1980s but increased after that to about 60% in

1995. In 2007, 75% of mothers breastfed their children, and about 44% were still breastfeeding

at age 6 months (CDC, 2011). Changes in certain population-level factors such as maternal

employment and awareness of breastfeeding value correlate with these trends (Wright and

Schanler, 2001).


        The previously reported positive effects of breastfeeding on child health and

developmental outcomes and the opposite trends between child disability and breastfeeding over

several periods in the past four decades may suggest a potential effect of breastfeeding on child

disability. However, this question has not been adequately evaluated, and it is unclear whether

the declines in breastfeeding over the past four decades may have contributed to the increase in

disability rates and whether the recent increase in breastfeeding rates may reduce future

disability rates.


        Even though some studies have reported improvements in neurodevelopmental

milestones with breastfeeding, these studies do not provide direct evidence for an effect of
breastfeeding on child disability. Most studies were generally limited to infants under 2 years of

age and did not provide information on development and disability status later in life. At this

very young age, the infant’s performance on these milestones may not accurately reflect

disability and functional limitations later in childhood as it may under- or over-represent future

limitations. A few studies evaluated the effects of breastfeeding on cognitive and motor

development later during childhood. For example, Lucas et al. (1992) reported a higher IQ at

age 7-8 years among breastfed preterm children. However, the study included a small sample of

300 children, was limited to preterm birth children, and did not report child disability measures.

Another limitation of this study is potential bias from maternal self-selection into breastfeeding

based on unobservable characteristics related to both the choice of breastfeeding and other

maternal behaviors and investments or household or health risk factors that in turn affect child

development and disability. Belfield and Kelly (2012) evaluated the effects of breastfeeding on

several physical and cognitive outcomes up to 54 months of age. Using instrumental variable

and propensity score approaches to account for the endogenous selection into breastfeeding and

data from Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey, they reported improvement in several outcomes

including in motor and cognitive scores. However, no direct measures of child disability were

included in that study. Furthermore, the oldest child age was under 5 years. Given that many

disabilities are not diagnosed until later in childhood, it is important to evaluate the effects of

breastfeeding on child development and disability throughout childhood and not only during the

first few years of life. Other studies evaluated cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes later in

childhood, but also had no direct measures of child disability.1 Therefore, a study that employs


1
  For example, Borra et al. (2012) evaluated the relationship between breastfeeding for at least the first 4
weeks and child cognitive development based on academic achievement tests administered up to age 14
years and non-cognitive (psychosocial and behavioral) outcomes measured up to age 6 using data from
the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). They found a positive effect on the
direct measures of child disability and a nationally representative sample of U.S. children at

different stages of childhood is still needed to fully understand the long term effects of

breastfeeding on functional aspects of the child’s wellbeing and development. This is especially

important given the intertwined relationship between disability particularly early in life and

human capital accumulation and labor outcomes (Kidd et al., 2000; McGee, 2011).


        In this study, we evaluate the effects of breastfeeding on child disability based on activity

limitations – the standard definition of disability – using a nationally representative sample of

U.S. children aged 1 to 18 years that has not been previously studied for this question. We

account for self-selection into breastfeeding using a within-mother siblings’ comparison that

removes maternal time-invariant heterogeneity that may affect breastfeeding and child disability

such as maternal preferences for health, time discounting, and risk taking, family history of

disability and health problems, and maternal efficiency in health production. Such unobservable

factors result in a theoretically ambiguous direction of bias in models that compare mothers who

vary on these characteristics.2 In that regard, our study is the first to provide nationally

representative estimates of the effects of breastfeeding on child disability that explicitly account

for such unobserved time-invariant maternal heterogeneity in breastfeeding behavior. However,

despite their likely advantage over classical models that only account for observable

confounders, sibling comparisons do not account for child-specific and time varying


cognitive outcomes; the effects on non-cognitive outcomes were overall inconsistent. Similarly, Rees and
Sabia (2010) reported positive effects of breastfeeding on high school graduation and college attendance
by comparing siblings in the AddHealth study.
2
  For example, mothers who are future oriented may breastfeed their children more but also invest more
through other ways in their children’s health and development than mothers who are present oriented.
This may result in overestimating the benefits of breastfeeding. In contrast, mothers who have a family
history of disability may face a greater incentive to breastfeed their children as a way to reduce their
elevated risk of future disability due to time-invariant heritable factors predisposing to disability such as
genetic factors. Such an unobservable effect may result in underestimation of the benefits of
breastfeeding.
unobservables that result in variation in breastfeeding between siblings. Most important among

these are potential confounders that influence maternal decision to breastfeed and child disability

risk such as child health status at birth or very early in life.3 We control for birth weight and

gestational age, which are important early indicators for child health and development, child’s

sex and birth order, pregnancy wantedness, and time varying maternal demographics. However,

it is possible that these do not capture all relevant unobservable child-specific factors, which may

still bias our estimation.

        Consistent with the broad literature summarized above reporting a positive relationship

between breastfeeding and child developmental (cognitive and non-cognitive) outcomes, we find

that longer breastfeeding is associated with a reduced risk of child disability, by about 0.2

percentage-points per month of breastfeeding. This effect is only observed on the intensive

margin among breastfed children, as any breastfeeding has no effect on disability risk. This

finding is consistent with the expectation that very short breastfeeding durations are unlikely to

have an effect on disability.



2. Methods


2.1 Data and Measures


        We employ data from the 1995 National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) merged with

the 1993 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). The research question we address requires

measures on breastfeeding and disability measures for each live birth the mother has had. The

3
 For example, children born with certain congenital malformations (e.g. heart, neural tube, or craniofacial
defects) may be less likely to be breastfed or breasted for shorter duration because of difficulty in
breastfeeding (Rendon-Macias et al., 2002).
NSFG-NHIS dataset is one of the few data sources that provide these data for all of the children

the mother has had. For each child, the NSFG provides the data on breastfeeding and several

other maternal and child characteristics such as maternal age at pregnancy and the child’s sex

and birth outcomes, while the NHIS provides the data on child disability. The NHIS includes a

nationally representative sample of all households in the U.S. (NCHS, 1995). The NHIS

provides health data on all household members including the presence of activity limitations

which we use to define the child disability measures as described below. The NSFG includes a

nationally representative sample of women of reproductive age in the U.S. (NCHS, 2000). The

NSFG provides data on the women’s pregnancy history and pregnancy outcomes. For each

child, data are available on whether the child was breastfed and the age of the child when

breastfeeding ended as well as on birth outcomes such as birth weight and gestational age. Data

are also available on certain maternal characteristics for each pregnancy such as maternal marital

status and age. These data are collected through a series of questions that are asked for each

pregnancy or live birth.


       The fifth cycle of the NSFG in 1995 included as a sampling frame the women who were

in the households included in the 1993 NHIS sample. Therefore, the 1993 NHIS data on mothers

and their households which include disability measures for the children can be merged to the

1995 NSFG data on the complete pregnancy history and outcomes and breastfeeding.


       We limit the sample to children older than one year of age at the time of the NHIS

interview in 1993 since disability based on functional limitations may not be apparent very early

in life. A few children were excluded from the sample due to having a birth weight less than 500

grams or gestational age less than 20 weeks as these might suggest data recording errors in these

variables since infants born below these thresholds are expected to be stillbirths. The main
analytical sample includes 8,519 children born to 4,984 mothers who have complete data on the

variables in the model comparing siblings including breastfeeding duration.4 Of these, there are

1,294 siblings who are discordant on ever being breastfed and born to 518 mothers, and 1,990

siblings who are discordant on breastfeeding duration and born to 837 mothers. Therefore, there

are 3,284 siblings (born to 1,355 mothers) who are discordant on the main study’s measure of

breastfeeding duration (described below) that includes a zero for no breastfeeding. The total

number of children per mother in the sample that only includes discordant siblings on this

breastfeeding duration measure ranges from 2 to 7 with an average of 2.6 children per mother.5


        The NHIS asks about whether the person is limited in performing their major activities as

reported by the household member being interviewed. The major activity is the person’s main

activity in the past 12 months at the time of the 1993 interview (NCHS, 1995). For children

under 5 years of age, the major activity is playing. For children between 5 and 17 years of age,

major activities are school attendance and needs, and the limitations include whether the child is

unable to attend school, attends (or needs to attend) special school/classes, or is limited in school

attendance. Information is also available on whether the child has limitations in performing any

other activities.


        We define disability based on the presence of limitations in activities that children would

be expected to perform at their age. This definition, considered the standard approach for

measuring disability based on the NHIS (Perrin et al., 2007), includes both inabilities to

participate in activities as well as limitations in activity participation, and is consistent with a

4
  A slightly larger sample is used when evaluating the effect of any breastfeeding (8553 children
including 1305 siblings discordant on breastfeeding status) since a few children reported to have been
breastfed had missing data on breastfeeding duration.
5
  An average exceeding 2 children is expected in this subsample (by definition) given that only mothers
with at least two children are included.
globally accepted definition of disability from the Word Health Organization (WHO, 2002). We

study a comprehensive measure of disability that considers children as disabled if they meet any

of the following conditions: 1- unable to perform major activity for their age; 2- limited in

kind/amount of major activity for their age; and 3- limited in any other activities appropriate for

their age. As mentioned above, major activity for children younger than 5 years is playing, while

major activity for older children is school attendance. Non-disabled children are those without

any limitations in activity participation. Our specification of the disability measure is also

consistent with other studies of child disability using this dataset (MacInnes, 2008; Park et al.,

2003). An alternative approach may proxy for disability based on the presence of chronic

conditions, but such a definition may significantly overestimate disability since many children

with chronic conditions may not experience activity limitations (Perrin et al., 2007). As

described above, the prevalence rate of these chronic conditions is over twice that of disability.


       The mothers were first asked about whether the child was breastfed or not. For each

child who was breastfed, the mother was asked about the child’s age in days when breastfeeding

was stopped, which defines breastfeeding duration in cases that were breastfed. We first

evaluate the average effect of breastfeeding duration across the whole sample assigning a zero

value to children who were never breastfeed. This measure captures the variation in both

initiation and duration of breastfeeding. Next, we decompose this effect over changes in the

extensive and intensive margins, by separately estimating the effect of any breastfeeding on

disability in the total sample (extensive margin), and the effect of breastfeeding duration

conditional on breastfeeding (intensive margin), i.e. only for children who were breastfed.

Conceptually, breastfeeding duration is likely more relevant for studying disability than a yes/no

measure for any breastfeeding which includes children breastfed for very short times in the same
category as those who were breastfed for much longer durations. For example in this study

sample, about 5% of the children were only breastfed for a week or less after birth and about

18% were breastfed for a month or less. Therefore, separating these effects is of interest to

understanding the responsiveness of disability to breastfeeding.


        We observe several other maternal and child characteristics that we include in our models

as described below. The child characteristics include sex, birth order, age at the 1993 NHIS

interview, birth weight and gestational age. Except for the NHIS interview date used to calculate

the child’s age at the 1993 interview, all of these measures are from the NSFG. Maternal

characteristics include maternal age and marital status at pregnancy, pregnancy wantedness,

maternal education, maternal employment after pregnancy, and family poverty level, all

measured from the NSFG.


2.2 Empirical Model and Estimation


        Our main model to evaluate the effects of breastfeeding on child disability is based on the

following specification:


Dij  0   Fij  Xijλ  U j  eij            (1).


For child i born to mother j, child disability (D) is modeled as a function of breastfeeding

duration (F) or alternatively an indicator for any breastfeeding, its effect (β), and child and

maternal characteristics (X) that are specific to child i including child’s sex, age at the NHIS

interview (when disability is measured), number of previous children born to the mother before

the current child, birth weight (in grams), gestational age (in weeks), pregnancy wantedness and
enthusiasm, and maternal age and marital status at the time of pregnancy with the child.6 The

model also includes mother fixed effects (U) in order to account for unobservable time-invariant

characteristics that affect both breastfeeding and child disability such as extended family history

of disability and maternal preferences for health, investment in children, risk taking, and present

versus future orientedness. This model only utilizes within-mother variation from siblings who

are discordant on breastfeeding duration and identifies the effect of breastfeeding duration on

disability (β) only if the relevant unobservables are shared by all children born to the same

mother, i.e. do not vary between different siblings. This is likely a reasonable assumption for

several theoretically relevant unobservables that may be time-invariant such as family history of

disability which may be driven by genetic influences or maternal preferences which may

associate with rather stable personality traits. However, unobserved child-specific variables such

as early indicators of child health problems and developmental risks that may not necessarily be

captured by birth weight and gestational age may bias the estimates from this model. We discuss

below the implications of these issues for our inference.


        We estimate this function by a linear probability model (OLS) and weighting by the

sampling probability weights available for the NHIS-NSFG merged sample in order to obtain

nationally representative estimates.7 We estimate the standard errors using a Huber-type

estimator that allows for clustering at the mother level (Wooldridge, 2002).


6
 We first estimate a specification without controlling for maternal employment since it affects
breastfeeding but there is no consistent evidence that it is causally related to child disability. If so,
controlling for employment as an “irrelevant variable” would inflate the standard errors of the
breastfeeding (Greene, 2003). However, in an additional specification, we control for maternal
employment after pregnancy and find the same pattern of results.
7
  We estimate the model using OLS instead of a conditional (fixed-effects) logit model for two reasons.
First, conditional logit cannot be estimated with sampling probability weights. Second, conditional logit
limits the estimation sample to siblings who are discordant on disability status not on breastfeeding.
        Model (1) assumes that maternal investments in future pregnancies and children are not

dependent on their behaviors and investments at previous pregnancies and on the health of

previously born children. However, this may be restrictive since mothers may update their

preferences for children’s health and their information about household investments such as

breastfeeding based on their experiences with previous children. In order to account for such

possible effects of previous children, we estimate another model in which we control for the

disability status of the child born to the mother before the current child.


         Dij  0   Fij  Xijλ   Pij  U j  eij       (2),


where P denotes the disability status of the child born before child i; for simplicity, we show

similar coefficients in equation (2) as in equation (1) but realize that these are different after

including P. This dynamic model is expected to account for any “feedback” effects from the

previous pregnancy.


        In order to empirically evaluate the extent to which the unobservable time-invariant

maternal characteristics may bias the effect of breastfeeding if ignored, we also estimate the

above two models using OLS without maternal fixed effects and compare the estimate of β from

those models to the models with maternal fixed effects.8 When excluding maternal fixed effects,



Since disability is relatively rare (6.8%), this significantly reduces the estimation sample size to 834
observations, which may limit the generalizability of the estimates. Even though a linear probability
model is generally less preferred than a logit model, the linear probability model should provide a
consistent estimate of the “average” effect of breastfeeding duration (or any breastfeeding) on the
probability of becoming disabled (β).

8
 The equations for the OLS models without maternal fixed effects are as follows:
Dij  0   Fij  Xijλ  M jδ  u j  eij (1a),
Dij  0   Fij  Xijλ  M jδ   Pij  u j  eij      (2a),
we add observed time-invariant maternal characteristics including race, highest educational level

and household poverty level, as reported in the 1995 NSFG interview.9


3. Results


3.1 Sample description


        Table 1 reports the study variables and weighted summary statistics. About 6.7% of the

 sample children have a disability based on the activity limitation measure described above,

 which is consistent with previously reported estimates from the NHIS data (Perrin et al., 2007).

 Average breastfeeding time is 3.5 months when assigning 0s for children who were not

 breastfed at all and is 6.7 months among breastfed children. The children were about 8 years

 old on average at the 1993 NHIS survey with a range from 1 to 18 years. Average maternal

 education is 12.6 schooling years, and average household income is about 280% of the federal

 poverty line.


3.2 Breastfeeding effects


        Table 2 shows the effects of breastfeeding in the child disability regression of equation

 (1). Column 1 shows a linear probability model including maternal fixed effects, while column

 2 shows the same model restricting the sample to siblings who are discordant on the

 breastfeeding measure; without covariates, the breastfeeding effect would be identical between

 the two estimations, but may slightly vary when including covariates. We first describe the



where u is unobservable time-invariant maternal characteristics, and M is a vector of observable time-
invariant characteristics such as education.
9
  Maternal education and household poverty level may vary at different pregnancies within the same
mother. However, these characteristics are only available from the NSFG in 1995 in the NHIS-NSFG
merged dataset. Therefore, these measures are considered the same across all children born to the mother
in the dataset.
 results under Panel A which reports the effects of breastfeeding duration including both

 breastfed children and those who were not breastfed and were assigned a zero on this measure.10

 In this model, breastfeeding duration has a significant negative effect on child disability;

 breastfeeding the child for an additional month is associated with a lower probability of

 disability by about 0.2 percentage-points, or by about 3% relative to the population disability

 rate. The effect is virtually the same whether all children are included or only siblings

 discordant on breastfeeding duration.


        In column 3 of Table 2, we report the effects of breastfeeding from the linear probability

 model without maternal fixed effects (which uses both within- and between-mother variation).

 The effect of breastfeeding duration in that model including all children is very close to that in

 the model with fixed effects; a one-month increase in breastfeeding duration is associated with a

 0.18 percentage-point decrease in the child’s probability of having a disability. The relative

 similarity between the two estimates suggests that unobservable time-invariant characteristics

 have little influence on the magnitude of estimates in this specification.


        Turning next to the results for any breastfeeding shown in panel B of Table 2, we find

 insignificant effects on child disability in all models with or without maternal fixed effects. The

 breastfeeding coefficient is of the positive (unexpected) sign when including maternal fixed

 effects.11


        In contrast, we find significant negative effects of breastfeeding duration among breastfed

 children in all models (panel C of Table 2) that are slightly bigger than those for breastfeeding


10
  Full regression results of this specification are in Appendix Table A1.
11
  This may be partly driven by the smaller number of siblings that are discordant on breastfeeding status
than duration (1305 versus 2152 children) and potentially limited variation in within-mother estimation in
this model.
duration across the entire sample (panel A). Combined with the results for any breastfeeding,

these results suggest that child disability is likely sensitive to prolonged breastfeeding but not to

very short durations of breastfeeding. The effect of breastfeeding duration conditional on

breastfeeding is slightly bigger when including maternal fixed effects than in the model

excluding these effects; an additional month of breastfeeding is associated with a decrease in

child disability risk by about 0.28 percentage-points, compared to 0.22 percentage-points when

excluding maternal fixed effects. However, the relatively small difference between these

estimates again suggests that unobservable time-invariant characteristics are unlikely to

substantially bias the effects of breastfeeding on child disability.


      In order to account for feedback effects from the previous pregnancy, we re-estimate the

child disability regression controlling for the disability status of the previous child as mentioned

above (equation 2). The results from this regression, shown in Table 3, are consistent with the

previous results. Despite the decrease in the sample size, the estimates of breastfeeding

duration conditional on breastfeeding are identical to those excluding the disability status of the

next older sibling and are significant in all specifications (panel C). In contrast to the earlier

specification ignoring effects from the prior child, the effects of any breastfeeding when

allowing for these effects switch to negative in the model including maternal fixed effects but

remain insignificant (panel B). The effects of breastfeeding duration across the entire sample

(when assigning 0 on duration for non-breastfed children) are all significant and slightly bigger

with maternal fixed effects in this specification (equation 2) than the earlier one excluding

effects from disability status of prior child (equation 1).
3.3 Additional specifications


       Our main disability measure combines both moderate and severe disabilities. This

 measure allows for a potential effect of breastfeeding on risk of any disability and avoids a

 potential sample-selection bias from selecting the sample based on disability level. However, it

 is possible that the risk of severe disabilities is less sensitive to breastfeeding than moderate

 disabilities. Our sample includes a very small number of children with severe disabilities

 (defined by being unable to perform the major activity appropriate for their age including

 attending school for children 5 years and older) representing about 10% of the children with

 disabilities and 0.6% of the total sample. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the results to

 different levels of disability, we re-estimate the main model (equation 1) excluding children

 with severe disabilities. We find an overall similar pattern of results (Appendix Table A2),

 suggesting that the estimates are mainly driven by moderate or less than severe disability

 (limited in performing the major activity but still able to perform it).


       We also evaluate a specification that controls for maternal employment after pregnancy.

 As mentioned above, we exclude employment from the main specification since there is no

 consistent evidence that it is causally related to child disability and to avoid inflated standard

 errors from including an “irrelevant variable” (Greene, 2003). Adding maternal employment

 has no effect on the pattern of results described above. Being employed has insignificant effects

 on child disability in the mother fixed effect models but is associated with a decrease in

 disability risk in the model without fixed effects.12




12
  Employment is associated with shorter breastfeeding duration by about 1 month (based on comparing
employment changes within the same mother).
4. Conclusions

        We find that prolonged breastfeeding is associated with reduced risk of child disability

and activity limitations across multiple specifications. Our estimates suggest that breastfeeding

for six months compared to no breastfeeding is associated with a lower risk of disability by 1.3

percentage-points or 19% relative to the population disability rate of 6.7%. Very short

breastfeeding durations are unlikely to have an effect on reducing disability risk. To the best of

our knowledge, this is the first study to shed light on a potential effect of breastfeeding on direct

measures of child disability in a nationally representative U.S. sample.13 Several studies using

U.S. data suggest benefits to multiple infant and child health and development outcomes from

breastfeeding, but none includes direct measures of disability. Our findings complement this

literature and lend further support to the potential value of breastfeeding as an input for a broad

range of child health and development outcomes that in addition to cognitive and non-cognitive

skill development may include outcomes such as disability and activity limitations that may be

thought of as less sensitive to such household activities.


13
  All our estimations use the sampling probability weights for this survey sample to obtain nationally
representative estimates; therefore the estimates should be well generalizable to the population. The
overall similarity of the estimates across all models (maternal fixed effects in entire sample, fixed effects
from discordant sibling sample, and classical estimation without fixed effects using entire sample)
suggests that estimates are generalizable across different sources of variation. The similarity of the
disability rate in this study to the population rate using similar disability definitions also supports the
generalizability of the results. Appendix Table A4 compares the subsample with discordant siblings on
breastfeeding duration (with 0 assigned to non-breastfed children) to the entire sample on both maternal
and child characteristics. The subsample of discordant siblings is comparable to the entire sample on most
child and maternal characteristics including child disability, sex, age at interview, and gestational age,
maternal age, pregnancy wantedness, and maternal education and employment. The discordant sibling
subsample has higher breastfeeding rates and slightly longer breastfeeding durations conditional on
breastfeeding, more children in the family, slightly higher birth weight on average, fewer single mothers,
and a smaller proportion of black mothers. Most of these differences are driven by the rule for
constructing this subsample requiring that only mothers with at least two children discordant on
breastfeeding duration are included. However, these differences have no real impact on the
generalizability of the results from the discordant sibling subsample given the similarity of the estimates
obtained from this subsample to the model with maternal fixed effects using the entire sample and to the
model without fixed effects (using both within- and between-mother variation in the entire sample).
        Our estimation relies on comparing the disability status between siblings who differ on

breastfeeding duration, which removes the effect of unobservable time-invariant maternal and

family-level confounders. We find that these estimates are very close to those that also compare

children across different families, suggesting that family-level unobservables do not substantially

bias those estimates.14 However, as mentioned above, sibling comparisons are still limited by

unobservable child-specific and time-varying family/maternal characteristics relevant to both

breastfeeding choices and child health and development. Early manifestations of child health

problems are examples of such factors. For example, breastfeeding may be difficult (but not

impossible) for children with certain congenital anomalies ( end n - ac as et al., 2002), even

though breastfeeding is encouraged among children with such anomalies (Barbas and Kelleher,

2004). Such cases may bias the estimates towards suggesting greater (more beneficial)

breastfeeding effects. However, congenital malformations are overall rare, collectively affecting

around 3% of children (CDC, 2013). A similar bias may result from breastfeeding being likely

one of many other household activities and investments toward child development such as

educational investments and avoiding risk behaviors such as smoking during pregnancy (Wehby

et al., 2012; Wehby et al., 2011). In contrast, an opposite bias could occur if mothers choose to

breastfeed children with a higher disability risk for a longer duration. Therefore, it is unclear

based on theory alone whether the breastfeeding effect may be over or underestimated from



14
   The slightly larger effects of breastfeeding duration conditional on breastfeeding when maternal fixed
effects are included may suggest as small bias towards underestimating the effect in analyses comparing
children across families. This may be explained by family history of disability if mothers who have a
positive disability history in their extended family (such as due to genetic influences) perceive a stronger
incentive to breastfeed their children as a safeguard to reduce their risk of having a disabled child and if
positive family history of disability increases the risk of child disability. Indeed, we find that the
disability status of the prior child is positively related to that of the currently child excluding maternal
fixed effects. However, again our results suggest that any potential bias from unobservable time-invariant
confounders is rather small.
child-specific and time-varying unobservables as the net bias may be a function of opposite

biases.

          We control as much as possible with this dataset for observable child-specific and time-

varying maternal factors, several of which were related to breastfeeding.15 Among these are

indicators for birth weight and gestational age, which are important early markers for child

health. It is also possible that bias from unobservable child-specific factors is larger for any

breastfeeding than for breastfeeding duration among breastfed children which only applies to

mothers who breastfed all their children (albeit for different durations) and may therefore

represent a group that is more selective of breastfeeding and possibly less influenced by child-

specific factors in their choice of breastfeeding. However, we cannot rule out an influence from

such unobservables on the observed results for either of the breastfeeding measures. We leave

this question for future research with data that provide child-specific instruments for

breastfeeding status and duration which are unavailable in this dataset.




15
  In a descriptive regression for breastfeeding status over child-specific and time-varying maternal
characteristics and maternal fixed effects, we find that the likelihood of any breastfeeding increases with
maternal age but decreases with birth order, not wanting the pregnancy, and being unenthusiastic about
the pregnancy. The birth weight and gestational age coefficients are positive but insignificant (p=0.11 and
0.13, respectively). Similar differences are observed when regressing breastfeeding duration among
breastfed children over these variables (decline with birth order marginally significant); a decline in
breastfeeding duration is also observed among employed mothers. The birth weight and gestational age
coefficients are positive and insignificant (p values of 0.38 and 0.94) in the regression of breastfeeding
duration conditional on breastfeeding, but they are significant in the total sample when assigning a zero
value on breastfeeding duration to children who were not breastfed.

  The sample size is slightly lower when excluding maternal fixed effects since additional
time-invariant covariates (maternal education, race, and family income level are included);
therefore the few observations with missing data on these additional covariates are
dropped.
b
  The sample sizes in panel B when including all children are slightly larger than those in
panel A because they include a few children with data that they were breastfed but with
missing data on breastfeeding duration.
