                                            ABSTRACT

In this paper, we present data on trends over time in domestic saving rates in twelve economies in
developing Asia during the 1966-2007 period and analyze the determinants of these trends. We find
that domestic saving rates in developing Asia have, in general, been high and rising but that there have
been substantial differences from economy to economy and that the main determinants of these trends
appear to have been the age structure of the population (especially the aged dependency ratio), income
levels, and the level of financial sector development. We then project future trends in domestic saving
rates in developing Asia for the 2011-2030 period based on our estimation results and find that the
domestic saving rate in developing Asia as a whole will remain roughly constant during the next two
decades despite rapid population aging in some economies in developing Asia because population
aging will occur much later in other economies and because the negative impact of population aging
on the domestic saving rate will be largely offset by the positive impact of higher income levels.

1. Introduction




Developing Asia has been characterized by high domestic and national saving rates almost across

the board in recent years, and these high saving rates have made possible high levels of domestic

investment but have also led to large capital outflows (current account surpluses) (see, for example,

the data presented in Park and Shin (2009)). To put it another way, the developing economies of

Asia have oversaved and underinvested, leading to large current account imbalances (surpluses),

as asserted by Bernanke (2005) and others.




The purpose of this paper is to present data on trends over time in domestic saving rates in twelve

economies in developing Asia during the 1966-2007 period, to analyze the determinants of those

trends, and to project trends in domestic saving rates in these same economies during the next

twenty years (2011-2030 period) based on the estimation results. The twelve economies included

in our analysis are the People’s Republic of China (PRC); Hong Kong, China; India; Indonesia;

Republic of Korea (hereafter Korea); Malaysia; Pakistan; Philippines; Singapore; Taipei,China;

Thailand, and Viet Nam, which comprise 95 percent of the GDP of developing Asia. This paper

contributes to the literature in several respects.   First, it presents and compares data on both

nominal and real domestic saving rates, even though few past studies have looked at real rates

despite their importance.      Second, it examines the nonlinear impact of financial sector

development on the saving rate, which is particularly relevant for our sample of countries.   Finally,

it generates long-term projections based on the estimation results.




This paper is organized as follows:      In section 2, we present our estimation model of the

determinants of domestic saving rates; in section 3, we discuss past trends in domestic saving rates

and in the determinants thereof in developing Asia; in section 4, we present our empirical results


                                                 1
concerning the determinants of domestic saving rates in developing Asia; in section 5, we discuss

our future projections of domestic saving rates in developing Asia; and section 6 concludes.




To summarize the main findings of this paper, we find that domestic saving rates in developing

Asia have, in general, been high and rising but that there have been substantial differences from

economy to economy, that the main determinants of the domestic saving rate in developing Asia

during the 1960-2007 period appear to have been the age structure of the population (especially the

aged dependency ratio), income levels, and the level of financial sector development, and moreover,

that the direction of impact of each factor has been more or less as expected. We also find that the

domestic saving rate in developing Asia as a whole will remain roughly constant during the next

two decades because the negative impact of population aging thereon will be roughly offset by the

positive impact of higher income levels thereon but that there will be substantial variation from

economy to economy, with the rapidly aging economies showing a sharp downturn in their domestic

saving rates by 2030 because the negative impact of population aging thereon will dominate the

positive impact of higher income levels thereon and the less rapidly aging economies showing rising

domestic saving rates, at least until 2020, because the positive impact of higher income levels

thereon will dominate the negative impact of population aging thereon.




2. Estimation Model of the Determinants of Domestic Saving Rates




In this section, we discuss the estimation model we will use in our econometric analysis of the

determinants of domestic saving rates in developing Asia.        There have been many previous

empirical analyses of the determinants of saving rates using cross-section or panel cross-country

data or time series data for individual countries, among them Modigliani (1970), Feldstein (1977,

1980), Modigliani and Sterling (1983), Horioka (1989), Edwards (1996), Dayal-Ghulati and


                                                 2
Thimann (1997), Bailliu and Reisen (1998), Higgins (1998), Loayza, et al. (2000), Chinn and Prasad

(2003), Luhrman (2003), International Monetary Fund (2005), Bosworth and Chodorow-Reich

(2007), Kim and Lee (2008), Park and Shin (2009), Horioka and Yin (2010), and Hung and Qian

(2010), and a smaller number of studies that conduct similar analyses of the determinants of

current account balances, among them Chinn and Ito (2007, 2008) and Ito and Chinn (2009). The

present study is based most closely on Higgins (1998), Bosworth and Chodorow-Reich (2007), and

Park and Shin (2009).




These studies suggest an important role for demographic variables based on the life cycle model.

Looking first at the impact of the age structure of the population, since the aged typically finance

their living expenses by drawing down their previously accumulated savings, the aged dependency

ratio (the ratio of the aged population to the working-age population) should have a negative

impact on the saving rate, and similarly, since children typically consume without earning income,

the youth dependency ratio (the ratio of children to the working-age population) should also have a

negative impact on the saving rate. Moreover, a higher youth dependency ratio means more

children to provide care and financial assistance during old age and less need to save on one’s own

for old age, and hence the youth dependency ratio could have a negative impact on the saving rate

for this reason as well.    Park and Shin (2009) and most other studies find that the aged

dependency ratio and the youth dependency ratio both decrease the saving rate, as expected.




A high growth rate of real GDP is another important factor, creating a virtuous cycle in which rapid

income growth makes it easy to save, and high saving feeds back through capital accumulation to

promote further growth.    Bosworth and Chodorow-Reich (2007) as well as Park and Shin (2009)

find that both contemporaneous and lagged real per capita GDP growth rates increase the saving

rate. Moreover, Park and Shin (2009) also find that the level of per capita income has a significant


                                                 3
nonlinear or more precisely convex relationship with the saving rate in Asia, but Bosworth and

Chodorow-Reich (2007) do not find a significant effect.




Aside from demographic and GDP-related variables, financial sector development is also

considered to be a crucial determinant of saving rates, but the direction of its impact is ambiguous

theoretically as well as empirically. Wang, Xu, and Xu’s (2011) theoretical analysis of the impact

of financial sector development on the saving rate finds that, if both households and firms are

subject to financial friction and if the financial sector development occurs first in the corporate

sector and then spreads to the household sector (a likely scenario), then financial sector

development will have a hump-shaped impact on the saving rate, initially increasing the saving

rate by increasing firms’ ability to borrow and invest but then reducing the saving rate by

weakening the precautionary saving incentives of households.           Turning to empirical studies,

Loayza, et al. (2000) as well as Horioka and Yin (2010) find that financial sector development has a

negative impact on the saving rate, Park and Shin (2009) find that its impact is insignificant, and

Wang, Xu, and Xu (2011) find a hump-shaped relationship.            By contrast, anecdotal evidence

suggests that relaxing financial constraints by increasing the availability of saving instruments

and accessibility to banks may promote higher saving, as argued by Chinn and Prasad (2003) and

Jha, et al. (2009).   Thus, both the theoretical and empirical literature suggests the possibility of a

nonlinear relationship between financial sector development and the saving rate, and this paper

investigates this possibility.




Finally, the real interest rate should, in theory, have an impact on the saving rate although the

direction of its impact is theoretically ambiguous.




Thus, the reduced form estimating equation we will estimate is as follows:


                                                   4
SRi ,t   0,i  1 * AGEi ,t   2 * DEPi ,t   3 * LNGDPi ,t   4 * LNGDPSQi ,t   5 * CREDITi ,t 
 6 * CREDITSQi ,t   7 * X i ,t  ui ,t



where i = 1, … 12 (1 = PRC, 2 = Hong Kong, China, 3 = Indonesia, 4 = India, 5 = Korea, 6 =

Malaysia, 7 = Pakistan, 8 = Philippines, 9 = Singapore, 10 = Thailand, 11 = Taipei,China, and 12 =

Viet Nam); and t = 1, … 8 (1 = 1966-70, 2 = 1971-75, 3 = 1976-80, 4 = 1981-85, 5 = 1986-1990, 6 =

1991-1995, 7 = 1996-2000, and 8 = 2001-2007).




SRi ,t represents the real domestic saving rate in country i at time t; AGE i ,t is the aged


dependency ratio (the ratio of the population aged 65 or older to the population aged 15-64); DEPi ,t


is a youth dependency ratio (the ratio of the population aged 14 or younger to the population aged

15-64); LNGDPi ,t is the log of per capita real GDP; LNGDPSQ i ,t is the square of LNGDPi ,t ,


CREDITi ,t is the ratio of private credit from deposit money banks and other financial institutions


to GDP; CREDITSQ i ,t is the square of CREDITi ,t , and X i ,t is a vector of the other explanatory


variables included in the estimation model.              0,i is a constant plus country fixed effects when a

fixed effects model is estimated. In addition, in some variants, we include CHGDPi ,t , the growth


rate of real per capita GDP and/or RINTi ,t , the real interest rate.




In addition, we also try using one-period lags of variables relating to LNGDPi ,t , CREDITi ,t , and


CHGDPi ,t in lieu of contemporaneous values because these variables are endogenous and thus

using lagged values thereof would alleviate simultaneity bias.

3. Past Trends in Domestic Saving Rates in Developing Asia




In this section, we discuss past trends in the domestic saving rate and in the determinants thereof

in the twelve developing Asian economies in our sample.         First, in Table 1 and Figure 1, we

present data on past trends in both the nominal as well as real domestic saving rates for each of the

twelve developing Asian economies in our sample as well as for these twelve countries as a whole

(weighted by real GDP) for each five-year subperiod during the 1966-2001 and for the most recent

period, which includes the years from 2001 to 2007.




Nominal domestic saving rates are computed as the ratio of gross domestic saving in current local

currency units to gross domestic product in current local currency units and are taken from the

World Development Indicators of the World Bank, while real domestic saving rates are computed

by subtracting the consumption and government shares of real GDP from 1 and are taken from the

Penn World Table, version 6.3 (Heston, et al. (2009)).    The nominal and real measures can show

divergent trends if trends in GDP and capital goods deflators differ significantly.




As can be seen from this table and figure, there is enormous variation among the twelve economies

in the sample in their domestic saving rates, with the nominal domestic saving rate ranging from

39.8 percent in Singapore (and also above 30 percent in the PRC, Malaysia, and Hong Kong, China)

to 11.2 percent in Pakistan (and also below 20 percent in Viet Nam and the Philippines) during the

1966-2007 period as a whole.    In fact, Viet Nam showed negative real domestic saving rates until

she transitioned to a market economy in the 1990s.       Korea, Taipei,China, Thailand, Indonesia,

and India showed intermediate nominal domestic saving rates during this period. Nonetheless,

domestic saving rates were relatively high in developing Asia as a whole relative to the rest of the

world throughout the 1966-2007 period.

The real domestic saving rate ranged from 49.9 percent in Singapore (and also above 30 percent in

Malaysia, Korea, and Hong Kong, China) to 3.1 percent in Viet Nam (and also below 20 percent in

Pakistan, India, and the Philippines) during the 1966-2007 period as a whole.                                                                   The PRC,

Indonesia, Thailand, and Taipei,China showed intermediate real domestic saving rates during this

period.                                Thus, the ranking ordering of the twelve countries is roughly the same regardless of

whether we look at nominal or real domestic saving rates, with the biggest difference being that

PRC falls from second to fifth when real domestic saving rates are used.




Turning to trends over time, both the nominal and real domestic saving rates showed upward

trends throughout the 1966-2007 period for the twelve developing Asian economies as a whole,

                                                                                            8
increasing from 19.8 (18.8) percent in 1966-70 to 37.5 (29.4) percent in 2001-07 in the case of the

nominal (real) domestic saving rate.    Overall, the real saving rate tends to be higher than the

nominal measure in higher per capita income economies such as Singapore and Korea, and the

opposite holds in lower per capita income economies such as Pakistan, Viet Nam, India, and PRC.

This is consistent with the notion that capital goods prices will tend to fall or grow more slowly

than the GDP deflator as technological progress occurs and the economy grows.




Moreover, the nominal and real domestic saving rates of most individual economies also showed

upward trends during most or all of the 1966-2007 period, with the primary exceptions being that

the nominal and real domestic saving rates of the Philippines, the nominal domestic saving rates of

Hong Kong, China; Indonesia; the Republic of Korea; and Taipei,China, and the real domestic

saving rate of Thailand have started declining in recent years, that the real domestic saving rate of

Indonesia has been declining throughout the 1966-2007 period, and that the real domestic saving

rates of Hong Kong, China, and Pakistan declined in the early years of the 1966-2007 period before

turning upward.



Given that the rank ordering of countries and trends over time are broadly similar regardless of

whether we use nominal or real domestic saving rates, given that using a real measure is

preferable from a theoretical point of view, and given that a number of authors (such as Aghion,

Comin, Howitt, and Tecu (2009) and Shioji and Vu (2011)) have used a real measure of saving, we

decided to use the real domestic saving rate as our dependent variable throughout our regression

analysis. Note, however, that we also tried using the nominal domestic saving rate and that the

results were qualitatively very similar (with the main difference being that the coefficient of the

AGE variable (to be defined later) is higher in absolute magnitude when the nominal domestic

saving rate is used than when the real domestic saving rate is used.


                                                 9
Various factors affected the trends in domestic saving rates described above. First of all, many of

the economies in our sample experienced rapid demographic transition.          Life expectancy rose

sharply from an average of about 53 in the early 1960s to 73 in the late 2000s in the sample as a

whole.   Consequently, the aged dependency rate also increased (from 6.5 to 10.2 percent on

average) during the same period.      Population aging has been particularly significant in Hong

Kong, China; Korea; Singapore; and Taipei,China. Meanwhile, the aged dependency rate has been

declining somewhat in Pakistan and Viet Nam. The youth dependency rate shows a uniform

picture, declining in all of the economies in our sample, though to a lesser extent in Pakistan.




Financial sector development played an especially significant role in developing Asia. James, et al.

(1989) discuss the role played by financial incentives such as raising interest rates on time and

saving deposits in increasing the domestic saving rate when the financial system was still shallow

in the 1970s (in Korea and Singapore, for example). Financial deepening accelerated in many

Asian economies after the mid-1980s, driven by financial liberalization, which relaxed financial

constraints and eased access to credit.   However, these earlier forms of financial deepening tend to

be more relevant for the corporate sector, as often discussed in the context of the financial

development and growth nexus (see King and Levine, 1993, for example), and thus they

presumably had a positive impact on the saving rate as firms’ investments become more profitable

and the increasing demand for credit pushed up interest rates.      By contrast, improved access to

credit by households and the resultant decline in precautionary saving tend to occur at a later stage

of development, and thus the negative impact of financial sector development on saving rates will

presumably tend to come later.        The developing Asian economies in our sample recorded

deepening of their credit markets to more than 100% of GDP by the 2000s except in India,

Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Viet Nam, and thus further financial deepening can be


                                                  10
expected to contribute toward reducing their saving rates, unlike in the case of earlier financial

incentives and/or the relaxation of financial constraints.




Moreover, these demographic and financial developments were accompanied by the continuing but

uneven increase in per capita GDP and its growth rate.




4. Estimation Results concerning the Determinants of Domestic Saving Rates in Developing Asia




In this section, we present our estimation results concerning the determinants of domestic saving

rates in the twelve developing Asian economies in our sample during the 1966-2007 period.




We estimated both a country fixed effects model and a random effects model with robust standard

errors, and we use non-overlapping five-year averages except for the most recent period which

includes the years from 2001 to 2007 in order to eliminate the impact of cyclical fluctuations and to

focus on long-term rather than short-term variations. Thus, we have maximum of 8 observations

per country and a maximum of 78 total observations.




Details concerning the variables used in our analysis (including data sources) can be found in

Appendix Table 1, and descriptive statistics can be found in Appendix Table 2.




Our estimation results are shown in Table 2. Models 1-3 are country fixed effects models with no

lags, models 4-6 are random effects models with no lags, models 7-9 are country fixed effects models

with lags for LNGDPi ,t , LNGDPSQ i ,t , CREDITi ,t , CREDITSQ i ,t , and CHGDPi ,t , and models


10-12 are random effects models with lags for these same variables.



                                                 11
While the results of standard specification tests such as the Hausman test and the Breusch and

Pagan Lagrangian multiplier test suggest the use of random effects models, we show the results for

both fixed effects and random effects models.    This is because a test of the joint significance of the

country fixed effects rejected the null hypothesis that the coefficients of all of the country fixed

effects are zero, because omitting country fixed effects seems to increase the residuals for some

economies such as the PRC, as also argued by others including Hung and Qian (2010), and because

we are interested in knowing whether there are significant country fixed effects when explaining

domestic saving rates.




As the results in Table 2 show, our results are intuitive and broadly consistent with those of

previous studies.    Looking first at the results for the models without lags (models 1-6), the

coefficient of AGE (the aged dependency ratio) is negative and significant, as expected, in every

case, ranging from -0.83 to -0.98 in the country fixed effects model and from -1.58 to -1.69 in the

random effects model. Thus, the absolute magnitude of the coefficient of AGE is much larger in

the random effects model than it is in the country fixed effects model and is, in fact, much larger in

absolute magnitude than theoretical expectation (the life cycle model predicts that it should equal

the negative of the ratio of working years to lifespan and thus should be well below one in absolute

value). This is presumably due to omitted variable bias arising from the omission of country fixed

effects and other relevant variables.     The coefficient of DEP (the youth dependency ratio) is

negative, as expected, in almost every case but is totally insignificant in all cases.




Turning to the GDP-related variables, the coefficient of LNGDP (the log of real per capita GDP) is

negative and significant, as expected, in all cases, with its square term being positive and

significant in all cases, suggesting a nonlinear (convex) relationship with the domestic saving rate,

as was also found by Park and Shin (2009). In other words, income levels initially have a negative

impact on domestic saving rates but their impact becomes more and more positive as

income levels rise.   Our results imply that, by 1976-80, income levels had become high

enough for income levels to have a positive impact on domestic saving rates in nine out of

the twelve economies in our sample, with income levels reaching this threshold by 1981-85

in India, by 1986-90 in China, and by 1991-95 in Viet Nam.       Thus, by 1991-95, income

levels had become high enough for income levels to have a positive impact on domestic

saving rates in all twelve economies in our sample, as also found by Park and Shin (2009).




Turning to the financial variables, the availability of private credit exhibits a nonlinear

(concave) relationship with the domestic saving rate, with the coefficient of CREDIT (the

ratio of private credit to GDP) being positive and significant and the coefficient of its

squared term being negative and significant in all cases.      This nonlinear relationship

indicates that financial sector development leads to a higher domestic saving rate up to a

point, after which it works to lower the domestic saving rate, which is consistent with the

theoretical model of Wang, Xu, and Xu (2011) and with the discussions in Chinn and

Prasad (2003) and Jha, et al. (2009). Our results imply that financial sector development

has progressed enough in six of the twelve economies in our sample (PRC; Hong Kong,

China; Korea; Malaysia; Singapore; and Taipei,China) for the availability of private credit

to have a negative impact on the domestic saving rate in these economies but that

financial sector development has not progressed enough in six of the twelve economies in

our sample (India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam) for the

availability of private credit to have a negative impact on the domestic saving rate.




Turning to the impact of CHGDP (the growth rate of real per capita GDP) and RINT (the



                                            15
real interest rate), the coefficient of CHGDP is positive, as expected, in all cases and

significant in two out of four cases, and the coefficient of RINT is not stable in sign and is

totally insignificant.   This might be due to the often discussed fact that interest rates

start to matter for saving behavior only after economic development has progressed

beyond a certain threshold (see Ogaki, Ostry, and Reinhart, 1996).




Turning to the results for the models with lags (models 7-12), the results are broadly

consistent with the results for the models without lags:     the coefficient of AGE is negative,

as expected, and significant in all cases, the coefficient of DEP is negative, as expected, but

totally insignificant in all cases, the coefficients of LNGDP and LNGDPSQ are negative

and positive, respectively, and are significant in most (but not all cases), the coefficient of

CHGDP is positive, as expected, and significant in three out of four cases, and the

coefficient of RINT is negative but totally insignificant.




The biggest difference between the results for the models without lags and those for the

models with lags is in the impact of financial sector development.     The significant impact

of financial sector development found in models 1-6 without lags disappears in models

7-12 with lags, which suggests the existence of simultaneity bias even though the signs of

the relevant variables still indicate a concave impact of financial sector development on

the domestic saving rate.     Another difference is that the absolute magnitudes of the

coefficients of AGE and CHGDP are larger in the case of the models with lags whereas the

absolute magnitudes of the coefficients of LNGDP, LNGDPSQ, CREDIT, and CREDITSQ

are larger in the case of the models without lags, which suggests that the models without

lags exaggerate the impact of LNGDP, LNGDPSQ, CREDIT, and CREDITSQ due to



                                              16
simultaneity bias.




Finally, the results of the fixed effects models show that the country fixed effects are

significant for most economies (except for Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore) with a

significant negative sign when the PRC is taken as the reference country, indicating a

much higher domestic saving rate in the PRC than predicted by the other explanatory

variables.




As a robustness check, we also tried including time dummies for 7 out of the 8 time periods.

When we did so, we found that the coefficients of 3 out of the 7 time dummies were

significant at the 10 percent level (with the coefficients indicating a downward trend over

time).   However, a test for the joint significance of the time dummies failed to reject the

null hypothesis that the coefficients of all of the time dummies are zero at the 5 percent

significance level in the case of the benchmark model, and the results for the other

explanatory variables were roughly comparable to those for the model without time

dummies (except that the absolute magnitude of the coefficient of AGE becomes larger and

the absolute magnitude of the coefficients of CREDIT and its squared term become

smaller).    Thus, we have not shown the results for the model that includes time dummies.




In sum, the main determinants of the domestic saving rate in developing Asia during the

1966-2007 period appear to be the age structure of the population (especially the aged

dependency ratio), income levels, and (to a lesser extent) the level of financial sector

development, except as noted above, and moreover, the direction of impact of each factor is

more or less as expected.

5.   Projections of Domestic Saving Rates in Developing Asia for 2011-2030




In this section, we discuss our projections of domestic saving rates in the twelve

developing Asian economies in our sample for 2011-2030. We should note at the start,

however, that future projections over such a long time horizon are fraught with dangers

and that we implicitly assume that there will be no changes in any factor (e.g., economic

policies, institutions, etc.) other than those explicitly included in our analysis, which is not

likely to be the case. Thus, our results should be taken with a grain of salt.




We show only the projections based on the fixed effects model because, while the results of

standard specification tests such as the Hausman test and the Breusch and Pagan

Lagrangian multiplier test suggest the use of random effects models, a test of the joint

significance of the country fixed effects rejected the null hypothesis that the coefficients of

all of the country fixed effects are zero, because the absolute magnitude of the coefficient of

the aged dependency ratio seems unreasonably large in the estimation results based on

the random effects model, as noted earlier, and because comparing out-of-sample

projections based on the fixed effects and random effects models suggests that the random

effects model does not perform as well as the fixed effects model in fitting the domestic

saving rate for a number of economies such as the PRC, Korea, Singapore, Pakistan, and

the Philippines.    The projections from the random effects models underestimate the

saving rates of the former three economies while overestimating those of the latter two

economies.   This is consistently true for all six random effects models. For the PRC,

omitting the country fixed effect would yield a saving rate of about 24% of GDP for the



                                              18
2001-2007 period—10 percentage points lower than the actual rate.            Our finding is

remarkably consistent with Hung and Qian’s (2010) finding that China’s national saving

rate is about 10 to 12 percentage points higher than that predicted by their regression

analysis. A possible explanation for the case of the PRC is omitted factors such as the

increase in the corporate saving rate during this period (IMF, 2009) and/or the distorted

sex ratio of those of marrying age (Wei and Zhang, 2009). Another example of an obvious

deviation of the fitted saving rate from the actual rate is the Philippines, where the fitted

saving rate based on the random effects model does not show the decline observed in the

actual rate.   The rapidly increasing coverage of the social security system has been

suggested as one of the explanations for why this might be (Terada-Hagiwara, 2009).




Our projections for the next two decades, 2011-2020 and 2021-2030, rely on the United

Nations’ (U.N.) projections of the age structure of the population (the aged and youth

dependency ratios, median variant) and the GDP projections of Lee and Hong (2010).




Since projections of financial sector development are not available, we assumed that

financial deepening progresses according to the level of per capita income.    We projected

in which World Bank income group each country would belong in 2011-2020 and

2021-2030 using Lee and Hong's (2010) GDP projections and assigned to each country the

2008 value of the financial sector development variable (private credit to GDP ratio) for

the income group to which it is projected to belong in each time period except that, for

economies in which the financial sector has already deepened beyond the average value for

the income group to which they are projected to belong (Hong Kong, China; the PRC,

Taipei,China, and Viet Nam in 2011-2020 and these same countries minus the PRC in



                                             19
2021-2030), the financial sector development variable was assumed to remain at the same

value as in the recent past (the average value for 2000-2007).    The average 2008 values

of the financial sector development variable for each income group were 130% for the high

income group, 105% for the upper middle income group, and 46% for the lower middle

income group, as shown in Beck et al. (2008).       Hong Kong, China; Korea; Malaysia;

Singapore; the PRC; and Taipei,China are projected to belong to the high income group,

Thailand to the upper middle income group, and Indonesia, India, Pakistan, the

Philippines, and Viet Nam to the lower middle income group by 2021-2030.




Saving rate projections are generated for the 2011-2020 and 2021-2030 periods using the

coefficients in model 7 of Table 2, the baseline country fixed effects model with lags,

because simultaneity bias will presumably be less severe in the model with lags.    Table 3

shows future projections of domestic saving rates for the twelve economies in our sample,

and as can be seen from this table, domestic saving rates in Hong Kong, China; Indonesia;

Korea; Malaysia; Philippines; Singapore; Thailand; and Taipei,China are expected to

decrease (except for a slight upturn in Korea in 2021-30); that of Viet Nam is expected to

increase in 2011-20, then decrease in 2021-30; that of the PRC is expected to remain

roughly flat for the next two decades; and that of India and Pakistan are expected to

increase (comparisons are being made to fitted values for the 2001-07 period).




While all of the developing Asian economies in our sample are projected to post steady

growth, which will lead to higher income levels, which in turn will create upward pressure

on their domestic saving rates, the dramatic differences among these economies in

projected future trends in their domestic saving rates are not surprising because there is a



                                            20
40- to 50-year gap in the timing of population aging, as can be seen from Table 4.    As a

result of these dramatic differences in the timing of the demographic transition in the

coming decades, the decline in domestic saving rates will not occur simultaneously in the

economies of developing Asia but will rather be spread out over close to a half-century,

with the decline in domestic saving rates in some economies being offset by the increase in

domestic saving rates in other economies until at least 2030.




In particular, economies in which population aging is expected to occur the soonest (such

as Hong Kong, China; Korea; Singapore; Thailand; and Taipei,China) are projected to

show the earliest declines in domestic saving rates, economies in which population aging

is expected to occur neither early nor late are projected to either show declines in domestic

saving rates right from the start (as in the case of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the

Philippines) or to show an increase in domestic saving rates early on, followed by a decline

(as in the case of Viet Nam); and economies in which population aging is expected to occur

the latest (such as India and Pakistan) are projected to show an increase in domestic

saving rates at least until 2030. The primary exception is the PRC, where the domestic

saving rate is projected to remain roughly constant for the next two decades (for the

reason we will discuss shortly).




                                             22
The projected decline in domestic saving rates from the 2000s until the 2020s in the

rapidly aging economies ranges from 5.4 percentage points (Korea) to 12.5 percentage

points (Singapore), which is about the same or larger than what other already aging

economies such as Japan have experienced over the last 20 years.     In Japan, the domestic

saving rate declined from its peak of 39% in the late 1980s to 33% in the early 2000s,

during which time the aged dependency ratio rose from 16% to 29%.                 The more

pronounced decline in developing Asia’s domestic saving rate might be due to the fact that

aging is expected to progress more rapidly.




Finally, we calculate the historical and projected domestic saving rates of developing Asia

as a whole by weighting the domestic saving rates for each economy by its real GDP (see

Table 3).   According to the fixed effects model, the domestic saving rate in developing Asia

as a whole is projected to remain roughly constant for the next two decades—averaging

26.3% during the 2011-2020 period and 27.2% during the 2021-2030 period, compared to

an actual value of 29.4% and a fitted value of 27.4% during the 2001-2007 period.




The population of emerging Asia is projected to age rapidly over the next 20 years, with

the aged dependency ratio expected to climb from 11 percent in 2001-2007 to 19 percent in

2021-2030.     However, the domestic saving rate of developing Asia as a whole is expected

to remain high despite the rapid aging of the population because of differences among

economies in the timing of population aging and because the negative impact of population

aging on the domestic saving rate will be largely offset by the positive impact of higher

income (per capita GDP) levels on the domestic saving rate.1


1   Projections based on the random effects model indicate that the domestic saving rate in


                                              23
To corroborate this contention, we analyze the determinants of future trends in domestic

saving rates with the help of Table 5, which shows the contribution of each factor to the

change in the domestic saving rate of each country from the 2001-2007 period to the

2011-2010 period and from the 2011-2010 period to the 2021-2030 period.                   These

contributions were calculated by multiplying the estimated coefficients of each factor from

the country fixed effects model with lags (model 7 in Table 2) by the projected change in

the factor in question during the period in question.      Note, however, that in the case of

(per capita) GDP and CREDIT, the contribution shown represents the sum of the

contribution of the variable itself and that of the square of the variable.




As can be seen from this table, the change (increase) in AGE will lower the domestic

saving rate in every country in both time periods, the change (decrease) in DEP will raise

the domestic saving rate in 21 out of 24 cases, the change (increase) in GDP will increase

the domestic saving rate in every country in both time periods, and the change (increase)

in CREDIT will increase the domestic saving rate in 15 out of 24 cases.         Note, however,

that the contributions of DEP and CREDIT are not precisely estimated because they are

calculated based on statistically insignificant coefficients and that their contributions are

very small (in absolute magnitude) in any case.




developing Asia as a whole will decline from 29.2% in 2001-07 to 26.6% in 2011-2020 and
further to 23.5% in 2021-2030, contrary to the projections based on the country fixed effects
model. However, as discussed earlier, the absolute magnitude of the coefficient of the aged
dependency ratio seems unreasonably large in the estimation results based on the random
effects model, and this is what is causing the domestic saving rate to show such a sharp decline.
Thus, the projections based on the fixed effects model appear to be more credible than the
results based on the random effects model.

The variables making by far the largest contributions (in absolute magnitude) to future

trends in the domestic saving rate are AGE and GDP, with AGE making the largest

contribution (in absolute magnitude) in 18 out of 24 cases and GDP making the largest

contribution (in absolute magnitude) in 6 out of 24 cases.        This corroborates my earlier

contention that the downward pressure on the domestic saving rate caused by the increase

in AGE will be largely offset by the upward pressure on the domestic saving rate caused by

the increase in GDP.    The impact of AGE will dominate in 10 economies in 2011-2020 and

in 8 economies in 2021-2030, causing their domestic saving rates to decrease, on balance,

whereas the impact of GDP will dominate in 2 economies in 2011-2020, in 4 economies in



                                               25
2021-2030, and in developing Asia as a whole, causing their domestic saving rates to

increase, on balance.




Our results shed light on why the domestic saving rate of the PRC is projected to remain

more or less unchanged during the next two decades. The reason is that the substantial

downward pressure thereon caused by the rapid aging of her population will be roughly

offset by the substantial upward pressure thereon caused by higher income (per capita

GDP) levels.




The trajectory of the domestic saving rate in developing Asia as a whole appears to be

heavily influenced by trends in the PRC, which will account for more than 50% of regional

GDP in the next two decades.        Thus, any developments in the PRC that affect its

domestic saving rate (such as the worsening of its fiscal balance, increases in expenditures

on social services and pensions, and/or changes in the speed of population aging) have

important ramifications for future trends in saving rates in developing Asia as a whole.




6. Summary and Conclusions




In this paper, we presented data on trends over time in domestic saving rates in twelve

economies in developing Asia during the 1966-2007 period, conducted an econometric

analysis of the determinants of those trends, and projected trends in domestic saving rates

in these same economies during the next twenty years (2011-2030 period) based on our

estimation results.     We found that domestic saving rates in developing Asia have, in

general, been high and rising but that there have been substantial differences from



                                            26
economy to economy, that the main determinants of the domestic saving rate in developing

Asia during the 1960-2007 period appear to have been the age structure of the population

(especially the aged dependency ratio), income levels, and the level of financial sector

development, and moreover, that the direction of impact of each factor has been more or

less as expected.   We also found that the domestic saving rate in developing Asia as a

whole will remain roughly constant during the next two decades because the negative

impact of population aging thereon will be roughly offset by the positive impact of higher

income levels thereon but that there will be substantial variation from economy to

economy, with the rapidly aging economies showing a sharp downturn in their domestic

saving rates by 2030, because     the negative impact of population aging thereon will

dominate the positive impact of higher income levels thereon, and the less rapidly aging

economies showing rising domestic saving rates, at least until 2020, because the positive

impact of higher income levels thereon will dominate the negative impact of population

aging thereon.
