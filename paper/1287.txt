           Asset Markets, Exchange Rates and the Balance of Payments



                                  ABSTRACT



         This paper, written as a chapter for a Handbook of International
Economics, reviews developments in the theory of international monetary
economics from the late 1960's through the early 1980's.    Following a review
of the operation of the monetary mechanism of balance of payments adjustment
in the context of the Mundell—Fleming model, the paper reviews the more modern
analysis of the dynamics of balance of payments adjustment under fixed exchange
rates and of exchange rate determination under flexible exchange rates.     Begin-
ning with a simple exposition of the monetary mechanism, the model is then
extended to incorporate sluggish wage and output adjustments, endogenous monetary
policy and sterilization operations, multiplicity of tradable and nontradable
goods, large countries, capital mobility and portfolio balance.    The review then
turns to an exposition of exchange rate theory, starting with the monetary ap--
proach to exchange rate determination.    Issues discussed in this context include
purchasing power parities, nontraded goods, the real exchange rate, currency
substitution and the interaction between real and monetary factors in effecting
exchange rates.    The paper proceeds with a presentation of a more general frame-
work that views the question of exchange rate determination as part of the
general theory of the determination of asset prices, and which highlights the
unique role of expectations.    The general framework is then applied to charac-
terize the interaction between the balance of payments and the equilibrium real
exchange rate.    The paper concludes with a brief discussion of some empirical
issues of exchange rate analysis.

      This chapter reviews developments in international monetary economics

from the late 1960's through the early 1980's.   Since the world remained on a

system of fixed exchange rates until 1973, most of the research in the earlier

part of this period focused on monetary relationships and macroeconomic

behavior of open economies under a system of fixed exchange rates.      An issue

of central importance in this research, including the extensive literature on

the "monetary approach to the balance of payments," was the economic deter-

minants of the behavior of the balance of payments, especially, the

theoretical elaboration and empirical investigation of the dynamic mechanism

of balance of payments adjustment.   With the shift to a system of floating

exchange rates among major currencies in 1973, there was a corresponding shift

of research interests away from primary focus on the balance of payments and

to principal concern with the economic determinants of the behavior of

exchange rates.   The unifying theme in much of this research was the "asset

market approach to exchange rates" which emphasizes conditions for equilibrium

in the markets for stocks of assets, especially national monies, as the

proximate determinant of the behavior of exchange rates.

      Three general features of the research surveyed in this chapter

distinguish it, in general emphasis and broad outline, from the earlier work

on international monetary economics surveyed in chapter 13 by Kenen.     First,

in the policy approach to open economy macroeconomics developed most exten-

sively by Meade (1951), and extended by the important work of Mundell (1968c)

and   Fleming (1962), it is usually assumed that the level of national income

is controlled by government policy, and that maintenance of full employment

(or internal balance) is the paramount objective of economic policy.     In this

approach, the balance of payments is a "problem" because maintenance of
                                        —2—




balance of payments equilibrium (or external balance) constrains the use of

macroeconomic policy for purposes of maintaining full employment.    This

problem can be satisfactorily resolved provided that governments have an

adequate number of independent and effective policy instruments.    More recent

research on macro—economics, for both closed and open economies, expresses far

less confidence in the ability of governments to systematically affect levels

of national income and consistently maintain full employment through policy

manipulation.   This view is reflected in the more recent research on

international monetary economics where the balance of payments and the

exchange rate are regarded as important in their own right, rather than as

subsidiary concerns of policy management.

     Second, in much of the earlier work on international monetary economics,

policy actions and economic disturbances were assumed to have essentially

permanent effects on payments flows.    It was recognized, of course, that the

losses of foreign exchange reserves associated with official settlements

deficits would imply a declining domestic money supply, unless the monetary

effects of the reserve loss were sterilized by domestic credit expansion.     It

was also recognized that reserve losses sterilized by domestic credit

expansion could not go on forever because a government would ultimately run

out of reserves.   However, relatively little attention was paid to the dynamic

process that would operate if reserve losses (or gains) were allowed to affect

the money supply, or to the long run equilibrium that would be established if

this process were allowed to operate, or to the longer run consequences of

changes in supplies of securities necessarily associated with policies of

sterilizing reserve losses and gains.    In contrast, in the research surveyed

here, the dynamic interaction among asset stocks and payments flows is at the

center stage of the analysis.
                                       —3—




     Third, in earlier work on exchange rate theory, the condition for

equilibrium in the flow market for foreign exchange transactions (exports,

imports, and capital flows) was usually regarded as the proximate determinant

of the exchange rate.   In some analyses, expectations of future exchange rates

had an important influence on current exchange rates by affecting speculative

capital flows.   But, even in these analyses, expectations of future exchange

rates were usually determined exogenously or by some ad hoc expectations

mechanism.   Recent research on the theory of exchange rates, in contrast, has

focused more on the conditions for asset market equilibrium as the proximate

determinant of equilibrium exchange rates, and has usually regarded expec-

tations of future exchange rates as a critical factor affecting the conditions

for equilibrium in the relevant asset markets.    Moreover, by adopting the

assumption of "rational expectations," many recent models of exchange rate

behavior have allowed for endogenous determination of expectations of future

exchange rates in a manner consistent with the structure of the economic

system, and have thereby permitted explicit analysis of the role of

information in forming and revising expectations critical to explaining the

behavior of exchange rates.

     Differences between the research surveyed in this chapter and earlier

approaches to balance of payments analysis and exchange rate theory should

not, however, be overemphasized.    The theoretical models applied to balance of

payments analysis in the late 1960's and early 1970's incorporate the same

basic elements as earlier such models and, correspondingly, share many of the

same properties and implications.   This essential unity is emphasized in this

survey by beginning our discussion, in section 2, with a review of the

operation of the monetary mechanism of balance of payments adjustment in the

context of the Meade—Mundell—Fleming model of open economy macroeconomics,    we
                                          —4—




then turn in section 3 to the more mordern analysis of the dynamics of balance

of   payments adjustment under fixed exchange rates beginning with a simple
exposition of the key elements of the monetary mechanism of balance of pay-
ments adjustment.     The simple model is then extended to incorporate sluggish
wage and output adjustments, endogenous monetary policy and sterilization
operations, multiplicity of tradable and nontradable goods,      the case of large

countries   with endogeneously determined terms of trade and, finally, capital
mobility and portfolio balance.
      Section   4 deals with the theory of flexible exchange rates.    The

evolution of the international monetary system from a regime of pegged

exchange rates into a regime of flexible rates resulted in a renewed interest

in   the theory of exchange rate determination. Analogously to the charact-
eristics of the modern    theory of the   balance of payments under fixed exchange
rates,   the modern theory of exchange rate determination has shifted the

emphasis from the circular flow approach (that gained popularity with the

Keynesian revolution) to considerations of portfolio choice and stock equi-

librium.    A consequence of this shift has been the development of the asset—

market approach to the determination of exchange rates.       Models which belong

to the general category of the asset—market approach differ in their emphasis

on the role of money and the other assets hut they all highlight the roles of

expectations and of stock equilibrium.

      Our exposition of exchange—rate theory starts with a simple exposition of

the monetary approach to exchange—rate determination.       In this context we

highlight the roles of purchasing power parities, non-traded goods, the real

exchange rate, currency substitution, as well as the interaction between real

and monetary factors which determine the equilibriuiu.exchange rate.      We then

present a more general framework that views the question of exchange—rate
                                         —5—



determination as part of the general theory of the determination of asset

prices.   The broader framework highlights the unique role of expectations.

The general framework is then used to characterize the interaction between the

balance of payments and the equilibrium real exchange rate.          This model shows

that the current exchange rate depends on the entire expected future time

paths of the relevant exogenous variables.      The section concludes with a brief

discussion of some empirical issues for exchange—rate analysis.



2.   The Mundell-Fleming Model

     The key development in the area of balance of payments analysis in the

late 1960's and early 1970's was the theoretical elaboration and empirical

investigation of the dynamic mechanism of balance of payments adjustment.             The

essential idea of this dynamic mechanism, which dates back to Hume's dis-

cussion of the price—specie—flow-mechanism, is that changes in asset stocks

(especially the money supply) associated with payments imbalances alter the

instantaneous   equilibrium position of the economy over time and ultimately
drive it to a long run   equilibrium   at which the payments imbalance is
eliminated.     In much of the literature on balance of payments theory and open
economy macroeconomics of the 1950's    and 1960's,   this dynamic   mechanism   of
balance   of payments adjustment was either ignored or suppressed by assuming

that the domestic monetary authority sterilized the monetary effects of

foreign exchange reserve gains and loses.      However, at least in Mundell's

(1961) description of the international disequilibrium system, this dynamic

mechanism was explicitly introduced into the standard model that represented

the main line of development in this earlier literature.

      As illustrated in fiqure 2.1, Mundell's analysis is based on the open

economy extension of the IS—LM model, frequently referred to as the Mundell—
                                                                          —6—




Fleming model.                In this diagram, the positively sloped LM curves show

combinations of national income,                                    y,     and the domestic nominal interest

rate,    i,       for which the real demand for domestic money, L(Y, i)

(where     L/3Y > 0                    and     aL/ai < 0),                is equal to the real supply,                   M/P.   The

different 1)4 curves are all drawn for the same, parametrically determined

domestic price level,                         p,       but for different levels of the domestic nominal

money supply,                M,       with lower LM curves corresponding to larger domestic

nominal money supplies.                            The negatively sloped IS curve indicates the

combinations of                   y     and        i    for which the demand for national product is equal

to national income.                      The demand for national product is the sum of domestic

demand for domestic product,                                 fl(Y j;       T)       (where     3D/3y > 0,         aD/3j < 0,    and

3D/3T < 0),             plus foreign demand for domestic product,                                        I*('r)    (where   aI*/3T < 0);
              *
 = p/sep           is the terms of trade between domestic goods and foreign goods,

where p denotes the foreign price of foreign goods and                                                       S denotes the

exchange rate which is defined as the price of foreign exchange in terms of

domestic currency.                      Alternatively, the demand for national product is the sum

of total domestic expenditure,                                 E(Y, i)              (where     1    > 3E/aY > 3n/3y      > 0,


and     E/i <           0)        plus the trade balance surplus.                                  In that alternative

formulation, total domestic expenditure includes expenditure on imports,

I(Y,       t) = E(Y,                  i) — D(Y,         i;    T),        and, using this expression, the trade

balance surplus is,                      T(Y,            t) =       I*(t)       —    i(Y,    i; t),    where

3T/3Y < 0,        9T/3i > 0, aT/ar < 0.                             The positively sloped FF curve shows

combinations of                   y     and        i    for which the trade balance is zero.1                            The terms

of trade,         'r,        is a parameter affecting the positions of the IS and FF curves.

        At any moment of time, the instantaneous equilibrium position of the

economy is determined by the intersection of the IS curve and                                                     the   LM curve

drawn for the current money supply.                                       in particular, when the money supply is

     and the terms of trade is                      the instantaneous equilibrium point is

at   A0   in figure 2.1.           At this instantaneous equilibrium, the trade balance

is in surplus, as indicated by the fact that                       A0        is above and to the left of

the FF curve.            Since the present analysis assumes an absence of private

capital flows, it follows that for the government to maintain a fixed exchange

rate, it must purchase foreign exchange reserves at a rate equal to the trade

surplus at         A0.       If the government does not sterilize the monetary effects of

this reserve accumulation, the domestic nominal money supply will grow at a

rate equal to the rate of accumulation of foreiqn exchange reserves, valued in

domestic money.              Growth of   M gradually shifts the LM curve in figure 2.1

downward and to the right, moving the instantaneous equilibrium point along

the IS curve away from A0                and toward the point            A    determined by the

intersection of the IS and FF curves.                    When the instantaneous equilibrium

point (and the LM curve) readh                .,    the trade balance is zero accumulation of

foreign exchange reserves ceases, and economy is in long run equilibrium.                                                 The

dynamic mechanism which drives the economy from                          A0     (or any other initial

instantaneous equilibrium position) to long run                         equilibrium       at     .       is    the


monetary      mechanism of balance of payments adjustment.                        The total accumulation
of foreign exchange reserve (the cumulative official settlements surplus)
associated      with the movement from             A0     to   ,   valued in domestic money, is

determined by the difference between the initial nominal money supply,                                              M0,


and the long run equilibrium level of the money supply,                             M =    P0L(Y,             i),


where     y    and       i    are the long run equilibrium levels of                 Y     and       i        that are

associated with the long run equilibrium point                          A.


        Starting at the instantaneous equilibrium                       1L,     if the money supply were

increased by a domestic credit expansion to the extent of the difference

between       M0     and ,        the result would be an immediate shift of the LM curve
                                                      —8—



to     its long run    equilibrium     position and an immediate jump              of   national income
and the     domestic interest rate to their respective long run equilibrium

values.     As a consequence of this domestic credit expansion, therefore, the

government would forego the increase in foreign exchange reserves that would

otherwise occur as a consequence of the natural adjustment process of the

economy in moving from            A0   to A,    but    would gain a more immediate increase in

the level of national income.                lternatively, if the government expanded

domestic credit starting from a situation of long run equilibrium, it would

temporarily shift the LM curve downward and to the right, creating an

instantaneous equilibrium at a point like                   A1   corresponding to the higher

quantity of money, M1.            At   A1,     there would be a balance of payments deficit,

and the gradual adjustment of the domestic money supply implied by losses of

foreign exchange reserves would ultimately drive the instantaneous equilibrium

point back      to     A.   In the long run, therefore, the increase in the domestic

credit component of the money supply would be fully offset by an equal loss of

foreign exchange reserves, and the stimulative effect of the domestic credit

expansion on national income would only be temporary.                          If the government

attempted to maintain national income at a level above its long run equi-

librium level by sterilizing foreign exchange reserve losses through

offsetting domestic credit expansions, it could do so for a while, but

ultimately it would run out of reserves.

        A devaluation from an initial equilibrium at                   A    increases    S   and

reduces     r   from         to        (since in this analysis             p    and P are assumed
to be given) shifting both the IS and FF curves to the right to I'S' and
F'F', respectively. The new long run equilibrium is at A', with a higher

devaluation, the money supply was at the long run equilibrium level

appropriate for the old exchange rate, the impact effect of the devaluation

will be to move the instantaneous equilibrium point up along the LM curve

passing through       A    to the intersection between this LM curve and the new IS

curve as illustrated by point        At•   The impact effect of devaluation,

therefore, is to increase domestic income and the domestic interest rate and

to create a balance of payments surplus.          These impact effects of devaluation,

however, are not the permanent, long—run effects of devaluation.            Increases in

the money supply resulting from payments surpluses that are the short run

consequence of the devaluation drive the economy to its new long run equi-

librium     A'   at which domestic income is higher and the domestic interest rate

is lower than A and at which the (flow) balance of payments surplus

initially created by the devaluation is eliminated.         With respect to the

balance of payments, therefore, the long run effect of devaluation is a

permanent, cumulative change in the level of reserves equal to increase in the

long run equilibrium size of the nominal money supply from         M =    L(Y,   I)

to   M' =   L(Y',   1'),   but not a permanent surplus in the flow magnitude of the

balance of payments.

      When privately held financial assets are internationally mobile, this

analysis of the balance of payments adjustment mechanism needs to be modified

to take account of the effects of capital movements on reseve holdings and

national money supplies,        specifically, with perfect capital mobility, the FF

curve indicating balance of payments equilibrium becomes a horizontal line at

the level of the world interest rate, i,          as indicated in figure 2.2.         In

this situation an instantaneous equilibrium at a point like         A0,    determined

by the IS curve and the LM curve for a domestic money supply of           M0,     is not

sustainable as an instantaneous equilibrium because a domestic interest rate

i0   that is above the world interest rate        1*   would induce a huge capital

inflow.    Domestic residents would sell securities to foreigners in order to

increase their money balances to the level consistent with          i =   i.   The

increase in reserves implied by this capital inflow causes the LM curve to

jump until it passes through the long run equilibrium point          A    determined by

the intersection of the IS curve with the FF curve.          Thus, with perfect

capital mobility, the balance of payments adjustment process is not a gradual

process in which money supply gradually adjusts to reserve gains and losses

associated with trade imbalances, but rather an instantaneous adjustment

process in which the level of reserves adjusts immediately in response to

international capital movements.

     The essential elements in this analysis of the mechanism of balance of

payments adjustment, including the analysis of the cumulative effects on the

balance of payments of changes in domestic credit or the exchange rate and of

the consequences of international capital mobility are also central in the

literature on balance of payments theory that developed during the late 1960's

and early 1970's.    In this literature, howe.ver, less reliance is placed on the

Keynesian assumptions of rigid domestic prices and demand determined output

levels as the relevant assumptions for balance of payments analysis, and more

attention is devoted to explicit modelling of the dynamics of the balance of

payments adjustment process.      The analysis in section 3 focuses on these

issues.




3.   The dynamics of balance of payments adjustment under fixed exchange rates
3,1. Adjustment in a small open economy without capital mobility
     To illustrate   the   monetary   mechanism of balance of payments adjustment
consider   first a small open economy facing given world relative prices of all
                                                   —11—



 (tradeable) goods produced and consumed by domestic residents.                      Using the

 Hicksian aggregation principle, domestic real income (equal to domestic

 output),      Y,   and domestic real expenditure,              E,     are measured in common units

 of a composite tradeable good.           Domestic real income is constant at the level

determined by full employment of domestic resources.                       Domestic real

 expenditure depends on domestic real income, the domestic real interest

rate,     r,    and the real value of privately held domestic assets,                     Al?;

        E = E (Y,   r,   A/P),   3E /3Y >    0,    3E /3r <     0,      3E /3(A/P)   0.           (3.1)

        Privately held domestic assets consists of domestic money,                    M,     and

domestic interest bearing securities,               B,    which are denominated in units of

domestic money and have an infinitesimal maturity (like call loans);

                                     A=M+B.                                                           (3.2)

In the absence of international mobility of capital, these assets are assumed

to be non—tradable internationally.               The real value of these assets depends on

the domestic price level,         P, which is equal to the foreign price,                  ?,
multiplied     by the exchange rate,        S:


                                    P =   S•P.                                                   (3.3)

The domestic money supply (under the simplifying assumption that the money

multipler is unity) is high powered money issued by the domestic central bank

and is equal to the sum of the domestic money value of the foreign exchange

reserves of the central bank,         S'R,        domestic securities held by the central

bank,    Bgi    and the fiat issue (the "net worth") of the central bank,                        J;

                                    M=SR+B g+J.                                                  (3.4)

The fiat of the central bank designates a balance sheet entry which represents

the "net worth" of the central bank——that is, the difference between the value

of the central bank's monetary liabilities,                M,        and the value of its reserves

and domestic security holdings,           SR +     B.     An increase in the domestic
                                                     —12—



currency value of foreign exchange reserves due to an increase in S that is

not monetized by the central bank is offset by a corresponding decline in                         J.

        Interest bearing securities and national monies are not internationally

tradeable.        The total stock of domestic securities issued by the domestic

government,        , is       held either by domestic residents or by the central hank3

                                       B+B g =3.                                              (3.5)

        Since the asset demands of domestic residents for domestic money and

domestic securities must satisfy the balance sheet constraint, the condition

for asset market equilibrium in this country can be expressed as the condition

for money market equilibrium:

     L(Y, i, A/?) = M/P;           3L/Y > 0,        3L/3i < 0,    1   > L/(A/P) > 0,           (3.6)

where     L(Y, i, A/P)        is the real demand for domestic money, and where             i


denotes the domestic nominal interest rate that is equal to the real rate,

r,     plus the expected rate of inflation.                 In what follows we assume that the

expected rate of inflation is zero and, therefore, we identify                    r    with the

nominal rate of interest.            The condition of asset market equilibrium

implicitly determines the equilibrium of the domestic interest rate so that

 r =    i(M/P,    3/?, Y),      a/3(M/P) <     0,     /(B/P) > 0, /Y > 0.                  (3.7)

Given the interest rate (whichis implicitly determined by the requirement of

asset market equilibrium), the level of real domestic expenditure becomes a

reduced form function of the real money supply, real private security

holdings, and domestic real income:

        E =   (M/P,      3/?, Y)     E(Y, (M/P, B/P, Y), (MI? + (B!?)).                    (3.8)

An increase in          M/?   increases         both because it reduces          and because it

increases        A/P.    An increase in      B/P     has an ambiguous effect on         because

the effect on            works in the opposite direction of the effect on              A/P.     An

increase in        Y    may be presumed to increase              provided that the direct
                                                         —1 3—




effect,          E/Y,     is stronger than indirect interest rate effect,

(E/r).(/Y).                   The indirect interest rate effect, however, should be

sufficient to insure that                SE/Dy <    1,     even if       3E/aY > 1.

        In accord with the basic equation of the absorption approach to the

balance of payments, the home country's real trade balance,                              T,     must equal

the excess of domestic real income (equal to domestic output) over domestic

real expenditure; that is,               T = Y     — E    [see Alexander (1952)].             Using the

reduced form expenditure function ,                        it    follows that

                          T =      M/P, B/P, Y)             —    (M/P,   B/P, Y).                        (3.9)

An increase in           M/P     raises spending and worsens the real trade balance

since       '/3(M/P)      =    -/a(M/p)    < 0.     An increase in             B/P   has an ambiguous

effect on the real trade balance because its influence on spending, i.e., the

sign of         a/3(B/P)        is ambiguous.      An increase in          Y     improves the real trade

balance because it raises income by more than spending since                              3T/Y =     1    —   E/3Y
is presumably positive.

        Since, by assumption, trade imbalances cannot be financed by private

capital flows or by changes in private holdings of foreign monies, they must

be financed by a flow of international reserves which the domestic central

bank is compelled to absorb or supply in order to maintain the fixed exchange

rate.     The magnitude of this reserve flow is given by

                                                   p*.T                                                  (3.10)

where     i3.    denotes the rate of change of international reserves, i.e.,

    dR/dt.           Assuming that the central bank does not alter its domestic

security holdings or fiat issue, either to sterilize the foreign exchange flow

or for any other reason, the rate of change of the domestic nominal money

supply,         A,   must equal the nominal value of the trade balance:

                                     =   P.(M/P,     B/P, Y).                                            (3.11)
                                              —14—




This result captures four essential features of the monetary mechanism of

balance of payments adjustment.

           First, there is a natural equilibrating process through which foreign

exchange reserve flows associated with trade imbalances adjust the domestic

money supply to its long run equilibrium level and simultaneously bring

equilibrium to the trade balance.           The nature of this equilibrating process is

illustrated in figure 3.1 where the          PT(M/P, B/P, Y)      curve shows the

relationship between the rate of change of the domestic money supply and the

level of the domestic money supply, given constant values of             B, I and P.

This       P'T(M/P, B/P, Y)     curve is negatively sloped because an increase in       M

reduces the trade balance surplus or increases the trade balance deficit.               The

unique intersection of this curve with the            M   axis occurs at the long run

equilibrium level of the domestic money demand,            (Y, B, P),    which is

determined implicitly by the requirement that

                                   '(M/P, B/P, Y) = 0.                              (3.12)

When       M    is less than   (Y, B, P),    the relatively high level of the domestic

interest rate and the relatively low level of privately held domestic assets

induce a level domestic real expenditure that is less than domestic real

income and, correspondingly, a trade balance surplus.            The reserve inflow

implied by this trade surplus gradually raises the domestic money supply and

ultimately drives the economy to its long run equilibrium where

M = M(Y, B, P),         and the trade balance is zero.     The opposite process occurs

if     M       is initially larger than   (Y, B,

           Second, any change, in the supply of domestic money that is not offset by

a change in the long run equilibrium level of domestic money demand leads to

an equivalent change in foreign exchange reseves and to a corresponding

cumulative payments surplus (or deficit).            This change in reserves and

                                          —15—



cumulative payments surplus must be measured relative to the long run                 level       of

reserves and cumulative payments position that would have resulted in the

absence of the initiating change in the money supply.                 For example, suppose

that starting with a money supply of ,           there is an increase M in the
fiat issue of the central bank.        Immediately after this increase in fiat,               M

will exceed      by j     and, as illustrated in figure 3.1, there will be a

trade deficit corresponding to the nominal value of the induced excess of

domestic real expenditure over domestic real income.              From the figure it is

clear that the cumulative magnitude of nominal trade deficits during the

process of convergence back to     i    must equal the initial fiat increase in the

domestic money supply.5

     Third, any change in the long run equilibrium level of domestic money

demand that is not offset by changes in the domestic assets component of the

money supply ultimately leads to corresponding change in the foreign exchange

reserve component of the money supply and to a corresponding cumulative

payments surplus (or deficit).     For example, suppose that economic growth

increases domestic real income from          to y1,       thereby increasing the long

run equilibrium level of money demand from            =   i(Y0,       B, P) to   =   i(y,          p)   6


If there are no changes in the other components of the money supply, then

relative to what would have happened in the absence of the increase in

domestic income, there must be net inflow of foreign exchange reserves and a

corresonding cumulative payments surplus equal to
                                                                  -

     Another example is a devaluation that raises the exchange rate,                 S,     and

hence the domestic price level,     P =   SP.     The elasticity of the long run

equilibrium level of money demand with respect to the domestic price level

(and hence the exchange rate) is given by

              (p/).aM/p =   1   + (B/)•[/3(B/P)/'/3(M/p)].                            (3.13)
                                         —16—




If   /a(B/?) = -    3/(B/P)   <   0,   then a devaluation will result in a more

than proportional increase in the long run equilibrium level of money demand

and in a corresponding increase in foreign exchange reserves and cumulative

payments surplus.   If the effect of the rise in the rate of interest is

sufficiently strong so as to result in       a/3(B/P) > 0,       then (when the system

is stable so that   (B/i)'[/a(B/P)/3/3(M/p)]        >   —1),    a devaluation will

result in a less than proportional increase in the long run equilibrium level

of money demand and in a correspondingly smaller increase in foreign exchange

reserves and cumulative payments surplus.       The reason why the long run

equilibrium level of money demand may not rise proportionately with the

increase in the exchange rate (as it does in some simple monetary models of

devaluation) is that the nominal stock of bonds,         B,    is a parameter affecting

the long—run equilibrium level of money balances.         This non—neutrality of

exchange rate changes disappears if domestic bonds are denominated in real

goods rather than in domestic money, or if private residents see through the

government budget constraint and regard government debt as completely and

perfectly offset by expected future tax liabilities.7          tn import tariff, in

contrast to a devaluation, generally has non—neutral effects because a tariff

alters relative commodity prices, in addition to affecting the general level

of domestic prices, and this alteration of relative prices may influence the

long run equilibrium level of real money balances.8

     Fourth, the factors that influence the path of convergence of the money

supply toward long run equilibrium and hence the flow magnitude of payments

surpluses and deficits are to a large extent distinct from the factors that

influence the cumulative payments surplus or deficit that results from a

change in the long run equilibrium level of money demand or in the in the

components of the money supply other than foreign exchange reserves.          For
                                        —17—




example, the speed of convergence to long run equilibrium and the magnitude of

the payments flow resulting from an increase in the fiat issue of the central

bank are determined by the slope of the        p.12       curve in figure 3.1:

         3/3(M/P) = — 3E/3(A/p)   —   (E/9r).{        1   —   (L/a(A/P))              (3.14)
                                                                           ]




      High responsiveness of desired spending to the real value of privately

held assets and to the interest rate, and low responsiveness of money demand

to these same variables all contribute to produce a high speed of convergence

to long run equilibrium and hence a rapid loss of foreign exchange reserves in

response to an increase in the fiat issue of the central bank.                 In contrast,

the long—run, cumulative response of the balance of payments to an increase in

the fiat issue of the central bank does not depend on any of these properties

of the desired expenditure function and the money demand function, but only on

the property that a change in the fiat issue does not alter the long run

equilibrium level of money demand.



3.2   Extensions of the simple model

      The preceding analysis of the monetary mechanism of balance of payments

adjustment for a small open economy employed a number of restrictive

assumptions that have been the focus of much of the criticism of the monetary

approach to the balance of payments.9     Some of the critics of the monetary

approach have argued that some of its simplifying assumptions lack realism.

Among the assumptions that were singled out were (i) the reliance on some form

of real balance effect, (ii) the assumption that commodity and factor prices

adjust instantaneously to clear commodity and factor markets and maintain full

employment, (iii) the assumption that central banks do not systematically

offset foreign exchange reserve flows through sterilization operations,

(iv) the assumption that all goods are internationally traded, (v) the small
                                        —18—



country assumption that implies that the economy takes the relative prices of

all goods, or at least of all traded goods, as fixed by world conditions and

(vi) the neglect of international capital mobility in many of the simple

expositions of the monetary approach.        The next section presents extensions of

the simple model.     It is shown that these simplifying assumptions can be

relaxed without altering significantly the fundamental characteristics of the

monetary approach to the balance of payments.



3.2.1..The real balance effect

       The model examined in the preceding section incorporates a "real balance

effect" through the assumption that desired real spending depends positively

on the real value of assets, which includes the real value of money

balances.    This real balance effect, however, is not necessary to deriving the

critical reduced form relationship     M =    PT   of the type illustrated in figure

3.1.    The essential features of themonetary mechanism of balance of payments

adjustment remain unchanged even if the real balance effect is absent.,               in

that case the reduced form effect of an increase in            M   on   M   depends

exclusively on the effect of the increase in        M       on the rates of interest and,

thereby, on desired expenditure.

       alternatively, the model of the preceding section could be modified so

that the only channel through which changes in          M    affect the trade balance

and    M   is through a special form of the real balance effect known as the

"hoarding function" [see Dornbusch (1973a, l973bH.              If there are no domestic

interest bearing securities (and financial capital is not internationally

mobile), all saving and dissaving must take the form of accumulation and

decumulation of money balances.     Under these conditions, it is plausible to

suppose that desired real saving, which equals the excess of domestic real

income over domestic real expenditure, depends on the divergence between the

long run desired level of real money balances,                                  (y),   and the actual level of

real money balances,                   M/P;

                                 T       Y — E =     H(L(Y)       —   (M/P))                              (3.15)

where H(    )   is       the "hoarding function" which                   has the properties that

H(o) = 0 and H'            > o    [see    Dornbusch and Mussa, (1975)].                 Since the trade

surplus (or deficit) must be financed by an inflow (or outflow) of foreign

exchange reserves, and since these reserve flows alter the domestic money

supply in the absence of offsetting changes in other assets of the central

bank, it follows that

                                 M =    PT    =   P.H(L(Y)    —       (MI?)).                             (3.16)
        The key point of this exercise is that the reduced form relationship

M =   P.H(L(Y)       —    (M/?))        has the same critical properties as the reduced form

relationship             M =   PT(M/P,        B/P, Y)    examined in the preceding section.                It

follows that the specification of a hoarding function yields all of the

essential features of the monetary mechanism of balance of payments adjustment

discussed in the preceding section.                          But, neither this special form of the

assumption of a real balance effect, nor any other form of that assumption is

necessary to the derivation of the essential features of this adjustment

mechanism.

3.2.2    Wage and output dynamics

        The assumption of instantaneous adjustment of commodity and factor prices

to    clear all markets and maintain full employment is easily modified without
altering the         essential          features of the monetary                mechanism of balance of

payments    adjustment.                A simple, alternative assumption is that the domestic
nominal wage rate,                W,     is   at least temporarily fixed, and that the              level       of

employment is determined by the quantity of labor that domestic producers
                                                —20—



demand at this nominal wage rate [see Rodriguez (1976a) and Leiderman

 (1979)].    With this assumption about the labor                 market,   domestic output is

determined by an aggregate supply function,

                     =   ySp,r,          3y5/a(p/w)      >   0.                                (3.17)

Allowing for the endogenous determination of domestic output modifies the

reduced form relationship describing the rate of change of the domestic money

supply,

                     =   p6(p,        B/P,   YS(P/W)).
                                                                                               (3.18)

      If the nominal wage rate is determined parametrically,                     rather than

adjusted endogenously, the process of adjustment of the domestic money supply

through reserve flows toward its long run equilibrium level is exactly as

described in section 3.1.           Moreover, changes in the fiat issue of the central

bank, in private securities holdings, or in the long run equilibrium level of

money demand that do not involve changes in                  W    or    P   have exactly the same

long run and short run effects as in section 3.1.                      A change in   W,   holding
p   constant, changes     y       and has exactly the same long run and short run

effects as a change in        Y    in section 3.1.       The only significant modification

of previous results is with respect to the effects of a devaluation which

raises, proportionately, the domestic price level.                     Previously, the long run

effect of devaluation on the stock of foreign reserves reflected the typical

proportional effect of a. rise in the price level on the long run equilibrium

level of money demand, supplemented by the effect of a reduction in the real

value of privatley held securities on the long run equilibrium level of money

demand.     Allowing for the endogenous determination of domestic output through

the function    yS(p/)
                          and assuming that nominal wages are given, increases

the effect of devaluation in expanding the stock of foreign exchange reserves

because it introduces an additional channel, an increase in domestic output,
                                                             —21 —




through which a devaluation increases the long run equilibrium level of money
demand.

        If the nominal wage rate adjusts endogenously, modifications of the

analysis of section 3.1 are more substantial, but the essential features of

the monetary mechanism of balance of payments adjustment remain intact.

Abstracting from anticipated inflation and anticipated changes in produtivity

that would contribute a trend component to the rate of change of the nominal

wage rate, suppose that                  W    adjusts at a rate that is proportional to the

divergence between its equilibrium value,                               W,    and its current value,                W;


                                  W =         — W),          >    0.                                                (3.19)

The equilibrium nominal wage rate is the value of                                   W     that would keep

aggregate output at its full employment level,                                Y;        it is proportional to the

domestic price level and is determined implicitly by the requirement that
                                              yS(p/q)
                                                         =       Y.                                                 (3.20)

      The dynamic system that jointly determines the evolution of the domestic

money supply (resulting from reserve flows) and the adjustment of the domestic

nominal wage rate consists of the differential equations (3.18) and (3.19).

The behavior of this dynamic system (for given values of the parameters

B,   P, W1 Bg and J)               is illustrated in the phase diagram shown in figure 3.2.

The horizontal line along which                       W = 7           shows the combinations of           M        and       W

for which        w   = 0.         Above this line        W        is negative, and below this line                       W       is

positive.        The negatively sloped schedule labled                             14 =   0   shows the

combinations of              14    and   W    for which           P.T(M/P, B/P, Y5(p/w)) = o,                 for    the

given values of              B     and   p.    This line is negatively sloped because an

increase in          M      which makes        M < 0     needs to be offset by a decrease in                             w

which makes          14 >    0     in order to keep              M = 0.      Above and to the right of the

M = 0     line       M      is negative, and below and to the left of this line                                M     is

positive.       The intersection of the          %7 =   0 and    = 0   schedules occurs at the

long run equilibrium point where             w   =,        as determined by (3.20), and the

nominal money supply is equal to the long run equilibrium level of money

demand,     M(Y, B, p)       as determined by (3.12) with            Y =

      Since the dynamic system illustrated in figure 3.2 is stable, for any

positive speed of adjustment of the nominal wage rate, the domestic money

supply will ultimately adjust to             i    through reserve flows associated with

trade imbalances.          Further, given any initial divergence of the domestic money

supply from the long run equilibrium level of money demand, the cumulative

payments surplus or deficit that occurs along the path of convergence to the

long run equilibrium point in figure 3.2 must entail a cumulative gain or loss

of foreign exchange reserves just sufficient to bring the domestic money

supply to equality with .                This conclusion also applies to any divergence
between     M   and   i     that    is created by a change in the non—reserve assets of

the central bank or in factors that determine the long run equilibrium level

of money demand.          Thus, the modifications of monetary mechanism of balance of

payments adjustment implied by simultaneous endogenous adjustment of the

domestic nominal wage rate do not affect the stability of this mechanism or

the conclusions concerning the long run, cumulative effects of disturbances to

the money supply or to the long run equilibrium level of money demand.

      These modifications affect only the details of the behavior of the money

supply and the balance of payments along the path of convergence to long run

equilibrium.      In particular, in the analysis of section 3.1, convergence of

the domestic money supply to the long run equilibrium level of money demand

was always monotonic.          With endogenous adjustment of the domestic nominal wage

rate, however, the money supply need not converge monotonically to its long

run equilibrium value.             For example, if we start at the point            (M0, W0)   in
                                                        —23—




figure 3,2, with             < M          and    w0   well below ,            the path of convergence to

long run equilibrium is one along which the money supply rises above its long

run equilibrium level through a series of trade surpluses and reserve inflows,

and then falls back to            M        through a series of trade deficits and reserve

outf lows.10

3.2.3     Endogenous monetary policy and sterilization

        Sterilization is a form of endogenous monetary policy in which a central

bank offsets all or part of the changes in the money supply resulting from

foreign exchange reserve flows by countervailing changes of its non—reserve

assets.     A simple form of sterilization policy is described by the rule

                            J =   — •'S'R,            0 <      <       1,                          (3.21)

where the sterilization coefficient                     •    indicates      the fraction of foreign

exchange changes that the central bank offsets by varying its fiat issue, and

where the rate of change in the domestic currency value of foreign exchange

reserves,    S.i,     is determined by the nominal trade surplus,                         P.T(M/P, B/P, Y).

     This form of sterilization policy does not affect the long run

equilibrium level of money demand, but it does slow down the convergence of

the money supply to the long run equilibrium level.                            Specifically, with the

sterilization policy (3.22), we have

               =    s.i +   3.   = (1      —    4)•s'   = (1       —   4)•P•(M/P,   B/P, Y)        (3.22)

This slowdown in the speed of convergence to long run equilibrium comes at the

expense of a greater cumulative change in foreign exchange reserves.                             If the

initial divergence between the long run equilibrium level of money demand and

the actual domestic money supply is                     M,     the cumulative change in foreign

exchange reserves in the process of convergence to long run equilibrium is

                                      =    (M/s)/(1     —    ).                                   (3.23)
and it is apparent that a policy of complete sterilization is not feasible.
                                              —24—



If a central bank attempts to set             = 1,   then any small divergence between

M and M        will ultimately lead either to an infinite gain in foreign exchange

reserves or an infinite loss of such reserves.11

        In addition to sterilization, it is possible to analyze other forms of

endogenous monetary policy.        One such policy might be directed at moderating

movements in the domestic interest rate.             If the only cause of interest rate

fluctuations, other than variations in the domestic money supply, were changes

in the long run equilibrium level of money demand, then such a monetary policy

might contribute to economic stability and reduce the need for variations in

foreign exchange reserves.        However, if fluctuations in interest rates were

caused by disturbances other than fluctuations in the long run equilibrium

level of money demand, then an interest rate stabilization rule for monetary

policy would probably exacerbate fluctuations in foreign exchange reserves and

might destabilize the economic system [see Frenkel and Mussa (1981)].



3.2.4     Nontraded goods

        The assumption that a small country produces and consumes only traded

goods with relative prices determined in world markets is easily modified by

allowing the country to produce and consume its own nontraded good.2

Equilibrium in the market for this nontraded good requires that

        Nd(E      Q)   N5(Q);   aNd/3E > 0,    Nd/3Q   < 0,    3N5/9Q > 0,         (3.24)

where     Nd     is demand for the nontraded good,      NS    is supply of the nontraded

good,     E     is total real expenditure (measured in traded goods), and

Q   = N'X        is the relative price of nontraded goods (whose domestic nominal

price is           in terms of traded goods (whose domestic nominal price is

The supply of nontraded goods, NS(Q), and the supply of traded goods, XS(Q),

are determined by the point on the economy's transformation curve at which the
                                                            —25—




slope of this curve, relative to the N—axis, is equal to Q.                                              Domestic income

(measured in traded goods) is given by

                      y =   yS0     =   x5(Q) +   Q.NS(Q)      3Y
                                                                    5
                                                                        /3p =    N

Domestic demand for traded gools, xd(c,                        Q), is          related to            domestic demand for
nontraded goods through the expenditure constraint,

                                                                   axd,E        > 0,
                                                                                                         >
                                                                                                             0.    (3.26)

              Desired real expenditure (measured in traded goods) depends on domestic

real income (measured in traded goods),                            y,     on the domestic interest rate,

r,           and on the real value of privately held assets (measured in traded goods),

(A/Px)                        + (B/Px) through an expenditure function E(Y, r, A/Px) With

the same properties of the expenditure function introduced in section 3.1.

The condition of asset market equilibrium is expressed by the requirement

L(Y, r,          Q,   A/Ps)    =   M/Px;       L/3Y > 0,            3L/r < 0,                      3L/Q > 0,       (3.27)
                                              0 < L/(A/P) <               1,



where L is the real demand for domestic money and M/Px is the real supply,

each measured in traded goods.                     The relative price of nontraded goods enters

the money demand function because the general level of domestic prices,

     =
                            is a linear homogeneous function of the domestic money prices

of both traded and nontraded goods.

             Replacing the variable y with y5(Q) in the real money demand function and

substituting E(Y3(Q), r, A/Px) for the variable E in the nontraded goods

market equilibrium condition, yields equilibrium conditions for the asset

market         and the nontraded goods market that jointly determine the instantaneous
equilibrium values of Q and r as functions of M/Px                                       and

         p   = ;(M/P,       B/Px);         a0/(M/P) > 0,            aQ/3(B/P)                  0,                  (3.28)

         r =   r(M/P,       B/Px);         3r/(M/P) < 0,            ar/3(B/P) >                0.                  (3.29)

The domestic nominal price of traded goods is determined by the fixed exchange

rate,       S,     and the world market price for such goods,                       p,    through the

arbitrage condition

Given the domestic nominal price of traded goods, the domestic nominal price

of nontraded goods and the general domestic price level are determined by


                   = PN(M,    B,        =   Px.Q(M/Px, B/Px)                                             (3.31)

not equal the domestic demand for traded goods.                              The excess of supply over

demand is the instantaneous equilibrium value of the trade balance, measured

in traded goods;


        T        T(M/Px, B/Px)       x5(Q)     —   xf(E(yS(),                A/p)   Q),

                                                                                                        (3.33)

where       Q     and   r     are the functions of M/Px and B/Px that indicate the

instantaneous equilibrium values of Q and                       r.        Using (3.25) and (3.26) and the

fact that Nd = NS at any instantaneous equilibrium, it is easily established

that the trade balance at any instantaneous equilibrium is equal to the excess

of domestic income over domestic expenditure, as required by the fundamental

equation of the absorption approach to the balance of payments:
                                     yS()      —   E(Y5(Q),      , A/P)•                            (3.34)
                 T(M/Px, B/Px) =

        Since neither monies nor securities are assumed to be internationally

traded among private agents, trade imbalances occuring at any instantaneous

equilibrium must be financed by a net flow of official foreign exchange

reserves.         Assuming no sterilization of the effects of such reserve flows on

the domestic money supply, the rate of change of the domestic nominal money

supply occuring at any instantaneous equilibrium is given by

                                 M =    Px.T(M/Px, B/P).                                                     (3.35)

The qualitative properties of the relationship between the rate of change of

the money supply and the level of the money supply embodied in (3.35) are

exactly the same as those embodied in (3.18) and illustrated in figure 3.1.

For given values of              B     and         = S                 there is a unique long run

equilibrium level of domestic nominal money supply,                               M,   determined by the

condi tiori


                                       T(M/Pxi B/Px) = 0,                                                    (3.36)

at which the trade balance and the rate of change of the money supply are both

zero.13       When    M        is less than            M,     there is a trade surplus and          M   is

positive.      When       P4    is greater than               M, there is a trade deficit and           P4    is

negative.      Thus, there is a natural dynamic process through which monetary

changes resulting from reserve flows associated with trade imbalances

gradually drive the economy to its long run equilibrium where the trade

balance and the rate of change of the domestic money supply are both zero.

      The positively sloped                  Nd = NS          curve in the upper panel of figure 3.3

shows the relationship between                     Q        and    M/Px    for a given value of     B/Ps.

This curve may also be interpreted as showing the relationship between

and   M,    for given values of               B        and        P.    Since the market for nontraded

goods must clear, the instantaneous equilibrium position of the economy must

always be at the point on the                     Nd = NS          curve, corresponding to the actual

value of M/Px.

      The market for traded goods, need not clear domestically. jy excess

supply of traded goods can be sold on the world market and any excess demand

for traded goods can be purchased from the world market, in exchange for flows

excess supply of traded goods:

It is noteworthy that the function (M/P, B/Px, Y)                         is the same as the

function      (M/P, B/P, Y)          introduced in section 3.1 and that the trade balance

can also be expressed as the difference between domestic income and domestic

expenditure; that is,

is fixed at       S•p,      this curve may be regarded as representing the

combinations of                and   M   for which (M/P, B/Px,                          =   o.     In
either case, above and to the right of this curve there is excess domestic

demand for traded goods and a trade deficit; and below and to the left of this

curve there is a trade surplus.

       The intersection of the Nd = NS curve and the                      = XS   curve in the upper

panel of figure 3.3 occurs at the point where the relative price of nontraded

goods equals its long run equilibrium value                   Q   and where the real domestic

money supply is at its long run equilibrium value                                Alternatively, this
                                                                     M/PX.

money supply       M.

      When the domestic money supply differs from its long run equilibrium

value, the economy must be at the point in the upper panel of figure 3.3 along

the   Nd = NS      curve corresponding to the actual size of the domestic money

supply.     At such a point, the trade balance is given by
                                            —29—




              T = T(M/Px, B/Px)     T{M/P, B/P, Ys(Q(M/Px, B/Ps))].

Corresponding to the trade balance there is a net flow of foreign exchange

reserves which, holding constant the other assets of the central bank,

determines the rate of change of the domestic money supply;

                           M      PT(M/P, B/P).                                   (3.40)

         In the lower panel of figure 3.3, the curve labeled                        shows
                                                                  T(M/PX, B/Px)
both the trade balance and the rate of change of domestic real money balances

as a function of      M/Px, for a given value of B/Px.     Alternativey, if this
curve is labeled as the        PXST(M/P, B/Pg)     curve, it shows the rate of change

of the domestic nominal money supply as a function of the level of the

domestic nominal money supply, for given values of         B   and P.     The

intersection of the     T(M/P, B/P)       curve with the horizontal axis occurs at

the long run equilibrium level of real money balances,                  where the value
                                                               M/P,
of   M    is determined implicitly by the condition

                           T(M/PX, B/Pr) = 0.                                     (3.41)

     Comparison of the lower panel of figure 3.3 with figure 3.1 and

comparison of the condition (3.41) with the condition (3.12) reveals the close

analogy between the monetary mechanism of balance of payments adjustment that

operates with nontraded goods and the mechanism that opetates when all goods

are traded, and between the condition that determines the long run equilibrium

level of money demand with nontraded goods and the condition that is relevant

when all goods are traded.        Momentary reflection reveals that the four general

features of the monetary mechanism of balance of payments adjustment that were

discussed in section 3.1, as well as many of the specific conclusions of that

earlier analysis, carry over to the case where we have nontraded goods.

     The major innovations resulting from the introdution of nontraded goods

are that we allow for variations in the relative price of nontradable goods
                                       —30—



and in the general domestic price level along the path of convergence to long

run equilibrium.   As is apparent from the upper panel of figure 3.3, if the

domestic money supply is initially less than        M,     the instantaneous

equilibrium relative and nominal prices of nontraded goods determined by the

point on the Nd = NS curve are less than their respective long run equilibrium

values,   Q and         The general domestic price level, P, which is an index

of the nominal prices of traded and nontraded goods will also be less than its

long run equilibrium value.    As the domestic money supply rises due to reserve

inflows resulting from trade surpluses, the instantaneous equilibrium position

of the economy moves up along the Nd = NS curve toward the long run

equilibrium point, implying an increase in the relative and nominal price

level as the economy converges to long run equilibrium.           The opposite process

occurs if the initial money supply exceeds     M.        It follows immediately that an

increase in the fiat issue of the central bank, starting from           M = M,   would

have the initial effect of raising the relative and nominal price of nontraded

goods and the general domestic price level above their long run equilibrium

values, and this would be followed by a period of adjustment during which the

domestic money supply and these prices all returned to their respective long

run equilibrium levels,    Starting from an initial position of long run

equilibrium, a devaluation would immediately result in an equiproportional

increase in the domestic nominal price of traded goods and would increase (not

necessarily proportionately) the long run equilibrium value of the domestic

nominal money supply.     The nominal price of nontraded goods, however, would

not rise immediately in proportion with the devaluation nor will it rise to

its new long run equilibrium level.     The relative and nominal price of

nontraded goods and the general domestic price level immediately following

devaluation would all be below their new long run equilibrium values and would
                                       —31—




only gradually rise to these values as the domestic money supply rises to its

new long run equilibrium level.14

     When we consider the effects of growth in an economy with nontraded

goods, the modifications of the earlier analysis are more substantial.      With

only a composite traded good, the long run, cumulative effect of growth in

domestic output and income depended only on the effect of an increase in

income on the demand for domestic money.      With nontraded as well as traded

goods, growth can affect the long run equilibrium level of money demand both

through the usual effect of an increase in income and through the effect of

changes in the long run equilibrium relative price of nontraded goods.      For

exampe, if the growth of domestic output (at constant relative prices) is

biased toward traded goods, relative to the growth of domestic demand, then

the long run equilibrium relative price of nontraded goods will have to rise

as growth occurs.15   With the domestic nominal price of traded goods fixed by

the exchange rate and by the given world prices of such goods, the increase in

the long run equilibrium relative price of nontraded goods requires an

increase in the domestic nominal price of such goods and, hence, in the

general price index. This increase in the general price index enhances the

effect of growth in expanding the long run demand for domestic money and,

thereby, increases the cumulative payments surplus resulting from growth.         The

opposite holds if growth is biased towards the production of nontraded

goods.    It is still true, however, that the cumulative effect of growth on the

balance of payments reflects the effects of growth on the long run equilibrium

level of money demand.    With nontraded goods, there simply are more channels

through which growth can effect the long run equilibrium level of money

demand.

3.2.5     Large countries

        When the home country is not small relative to the rest of the world, it

is necessary to modify the preceding analysis to account for the interaction

between the home country and the rest of the world in determining the prices

of tradable goods and the distribution of the world stock of foreign exchange

reserves.        To illustrate these modifications, it is useful to assume that the

economic structure of the home country and the foreign country (identified

with the rest of the world) is described by the model in the preceding

section, with the two countries producing and consuming a common traded good,

X, and with each country producing and consuming its own nontraded good, N.

Variables for foreign country are indicated by an asterisk (*)•

        The relative prices of nontraded goods that clear domestic markets in the

two countries are given by            Q(M/P, B/Px)     and   Q*(M*/P, B*/P).

The trade balance surpluses for the two countries are given by             T(M/PXV B/Px)

and     T*(M*/P, B*/P).           Nominal prices of traded goods in the two countries

are linked by the fixed exchange rate through the relationship                 =


The condition for equilibrium in the world market for traded goods is

expressed by the requirement

                        T(M/Pxi          + T*(M*/P,    B*/P) = 0.                     (3.42)

        Given the domestic .and foreign nominal money supplies and the

parametrically fixed values of B, B* and S, this equilibrium condition

determines the instantaneous equilibrium value of the nominal price of traded

goods in the two countries, as is illustrated in figure 3.4.              In this figure,

surplus of the home country,            T,   and the trade deficit of the foreign

country,     —    T*.   The positively sloped curves labeled Ti show the trade

where tv1        is    the constant level of the world money supply (measured in units of

foreign money).                  This is consistent with the assumption that the non-reserve

assets of both central banks are constant and that money supply changes occur

only as a consequence of redistributions of a fixed world stock of inter-

national reserves.                  When the distribution of this stock of reserves is such

that money supplies in the two countries are                           M0    and   M,   instantaneous

equilibrium            occurs at the point tJ0 in figure 4.4, with P P                          and
                                                                                0
T =   - T*       =    T0.        At this instantaneous equilibrium position, foreign exchange

reserves are flowing from the foreign country to the home country at a rate

consistent with the trade balances of these countries.                             As the home money

supply rises and the foreign money supply declines due to this flow of

reserves, the instantaneous equilibrium point gradually moves from                                    to U1,

which is the instantaneous equilibrium position that is relevant when the

domestic money supply is M1                      >      and the foreign money supply is

             -       ((M1    -   M0)/S) < M.           This adjustment process continues until reserve

flows have increased the domestic money supply to its long run equilibrium

level            = M        and have decreased the foreign money supply to its long run

equilibrium level                      =   M*.       At this time the instantaneous equilibrium

position is at U2 on the                      P*_axis, the trade balances of both countries are

zero, and the world is in long run equilibrium.                             Similarly, if the initial
•                                            —34—




distribution of international reserves is such that M =                  >   M   and

M* =    M   < M*,     the world starts out at the instantaneous equilibrium point u4

and gradually moves to the right along the UTJ locus, with reserves flowing out

of the home country and into the foreign country, until long run equilibrium

is achieved at U2.

        The behavior of the instantaneous equilibrium nominal price of traded

goods       (p and       =   SP)   reflects a version of the "transfer problem

criterion."         As we move from the instantaneous equilibrium U0 along the flu

locus toward long run equilibrium, the nominal price of trade goods rises, as

illustrated in figure 3.4, if and only if           J
                                                        aT/(M/P)     >   f T*/3(M*/p)   I;


that    is, if and only if at constant nominal prices of the traded good, the

effect of an increase in the domestic real money supply on excess demand for

traded goods in the home country is larger than the effect of an equivalent

reduction inthe foreign money supply on the excess supply of traded goods in

the foreign country.          If so, then at the old nominal prices of traded goods

and the new distribution of the world money supply, there will be an excess

world demand of traded goods, and the nominal prices of traded goods will have

to rise in both countries (reducing the real values of money and bond

holdings) in order to restore equilibrium to the world market for traded

goods.

       While the monetary mechanism of balance of payments adjustment is more

complicated for the two country world than for the small country, the basic

elements of this mechanism are essentially the same.               starting from a

situation in which the domestic nominal money suply is below its long run

equilibrium level and, correspondingly, the foreign money supply is above its

long rim equilibrium level, reserve flows associated with trade imbalances

gradually move the economic system to long run equilibrium by raising the
                                      —35—




domestic money supply and reducing the foreign money supply to their

respective long run equilibrium levels.      As in the case of the small country,

the essential ingredient underlying this adjustment process is the

relationship through which a deficiency in a country's money supply relative

to its long run equilibrium level leads to an excess of domestic income over

domestic expenditure which implies a trade surplus which brings an inflow of

foreign exchange reseves and a gradual restoration of money balances to their

long run equilibrium level.

     In the two country world, it remains true that a given initial divergence

of a country's money supply (and a corresponding divergence with the opposite

sign for the other country) will ultimately lead to a cumulative payments

surplus and change in reserves just equal to this initial divergence (assuming

there is no change in the non—reserve assets of central banks).     The long run

cumulative effect of disturbances that affect money supplies and money

demands, however, are somewhat different in the two country world than they

are for a small country.   For example, in the small country case, an increase

in the fiat issue of the central bank does not alter the long run equilibrium

level of domestic money demand and, hence, ultimately leads to an equal loss

of foreign exchange reserves.   In the large country case, an increase in the

fiat issue of the home country increases the world money supply and thereby

increases the long run equilibrium level of the nominal price of traded goods

in both countries.   This increase in the nominal price of traded goods implies

an increase in the long run equilibrium level of nominal money demand in both

countries, and hence a loss of foreign exchange reserves by the home country

that is smaller than the increase in the fiat issue of its central bank.

Similar reasoning leads to the conclusion that a devaluation by the home

country raises the long run nominal price of traded goods in that country
                                        —36—



while reducing the long run nominal price of traded goods in the foreign

country.    Because part of the effect of devaluation is absorbed by a decline

in the foreign price level, the long run nominal demand for domestic money

rises less as a consequence of devaluation than it would if the home country

were small.    Correspondingly, the cumulative gain in foreign exchange reserves

for the home country due to devaluation is less than it would be if the

country were small [see Dornbusch (1973b)].     Note, however, that these

modifications of the small country results do not alter the basic principle

that the cumulative effect of any disturbance on a country's balance of

payments is equal to the effect of the disturbance on the divergence between

the domestic money supply and the long run equilibrium level of domestic money

demand.

     When two large countries produce and consume only a single traded good,

in addition to their own nontraded goods, the stability of the mechanism of

balance of payments adjustment is not critically affected by the relative

price elasticities of demand or of excess demand for tradable or nontradable

goods.     These elasticities do influence the extent of variations in the

relative price of nontradables as we move along the path of convergence to

long run equilibrium, and they do affect the speed of convergence to long run

equilibrium.    But, low price elasticities of demand do not introduce the

possibility of instability in the mechanism of balance of payments

adjustment.    The reason for this is that the price elasticity that is critical

for the stability of this mechanism is the elasticity of demand for imports of

tradables into a country with respect to the relative price of tradables

between the two countries.     The assumption that tradable goods for the two

countries are perfect substitutes implies that this elasticity is infinite,

and this removes any possibility of instability.
                                         —37—




     When large countries exchange two or more tradable goods, elasticities of

import demands for these countries are important for the stability of the

monetary mechanism of balance of payments adjustment.      In the standard two—

country, two—commodity model of the pure theory of international trade, it is

well known that the Marshall—Lerner condition (the requirement that the sum of

the absolute values of the import demand elasticities of the two countries be

greater than one) is the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence

of a unique equilibrium relative price of the two commodities [see Johnson

(1956)J.     In the monetary extension of this model, in which money supplies,

bond supplies and interest rates affect only the level of spending in each

country but not its distribution among commodities, the Marshall—Lerner

condition becomes the condition for a unique long run equilibrium in which the

trade balance of each country is zero and there is no ongoing redistribution

of the world money supply.      If for each distribution of the world money

supply, the instantaneous equilibrium position of the world economy is unique,

it may be shown that the monetary mechanism of balance of payments adjustment

ultimately   drives   the world economy to this unique long run equilibrium.

Along the path of convergence to this long run equilibrium, spending differs

from income by equal and opposite amounts in the two countries, implying equal

and opposite trade imbalances and an ongoing redistribution of the world money

supply through flows of foreign exchange reserves.     The adjustment of the

relative commodity price along the path of convergence to long run equilibrium

is determined by application of the standard transfer problem analysis to the

endogenously determined magnitude of the transfer corresponding to the trade

imbalances of the two countries [see Dornbusch (1973a)].

     If equilibrium is not unique in the standard two—country, two commodity

trade model, long run equilibrium    will not be unique in the monetary extension
                                           —38—



 of this model.     Corresponding to each real equilibrium, there will he       a

 separate long run monetary equilibrium.          If for each distribution of the world

money supply, there is a unique instantaneous equilibrium in the monetary

model, the monetary mechanism of balance of payments adjustment will still be

well—defined:      That is, there will be a well—defined differential equation

that expresses the rate of change of the distribution of the world money

supply as a function of that distribution.          Moreover, it may be shown (not

without some difficulty) that the stable nodes of this differential equation

describing the monetary mechanism of balance of payments adjustment will

correspond to the real trade equilibria at which the Marshall-Lerner condition

is satisfied, and that the unstable nodes of this differential equation will

correspond to the real trade equilibria where the Marshall-Lerner condition is

not satisfied.      Thus, as suggested by many earlier writers, sufficiently large

elasticities of import demand are essential for stability of the mechanism of

balance of payments adjustment.       While this interpretation reflects different

considerations,     it   rationalizes some of the statements made by proponents of

the   elasticity   approach to the balance of payments" [see Machlup (1939)].



3.2.6    Capital mobility

        Two important modifications of the preceding analysis of the monetary

mechanism of balance of payments adjustment are required when we allow for

international mobility of privately held financial assets.         First, the

official settlements balance is no longer equal to trade balance but to the

sum of the current account balance (which is the trade balance plus the flow

of interest income that domestic residents earn on their net foreign

securities holdings) and the capital account balance (which measures net sales

of privately held financial assets by domestic residents to foreign
                                                   —39—



residents).       Second, we must allow for the possibility of swaps of stocks of

privately held assets between domestic and                 foreign    residents that occur at an

instant of time.       The possibility of asset swaps does not alter the principle

that the current account balance is a flow magnitude, but, it does introduce

the possibility of stock unit changes in a country's international reserves

resulting from private attempts to swap domestic money for financial

securities 16

     The implications of capital mobility for the monetary mechanism of

balance of payments adjustment are most easily illustrated by returning to the

case of a small open economy that produces and consumes only traded goods.

The model presented in section 3.1 is modified by assuming that securities

held by domestic residents, B, are perfect substitutes for securities issued

in the rest of the world, and that the domestic interest rate,                    r,    is equal

to the (fixed) interest rate prevailing in the world capital market,                       r*.   Net

foreign security holdings of domestic residents,                  V    are the excess of

domestic private security holdings over the stock of government debt that is

outside of the domestic central bank,

                                  V =   B —   ( — B g ).                                    (3.44)
Domestic real income,        Y,     is equal to the full employment level of domestic

output,     Y,   plus interest income from net foreign security holdings,                  r*.v/p;

                                  Y =     + r*.V/p.                                         (3.45)

The condition for asset market equilibrium,                 L(Y, r*, A/P) = M/?,       no longer

determines the domestic interest rate, hut rather, the instantaneous

equilibrium size of the domestic real money supply,

                        M/P = rn(A/P,         f (   —   Bg)/P   r*)                        (3.46)

The effect of an increase in real private domestic assets on M/?,

3m/(A/p) =       3L/(A/P)   ÷ r*.(3L/Y){1 —         (3L/(A/P))]        is assumed to be less

than one.
                                                            —40—




       The excess of domestic income over domestic expenditure determines the

current account balance,                    'P = Y —   E,    where       E = E(Y,    r, A/P).           setting

r =   r*     and    taking       account of (3.44), (3.45) and (3.46), we arrive at a

reduced form         expression         for the current account balance,

                                    =   'P(A/P,         ( — B)/P          r*).                                       (3.47)

It is assumed that an increase in real private domestic assets worsens the

current account balance; that is, we assume that

           3'P/B(A/P) =      —    (E/3(A/P))+          r*.[1 —     L/(A/P)][i             —   3E/YJ     < 0.

Given the domestic price level                     p =      Sp,      and holding constant the non

reserve assets of the central bank, the current account balance determines the

rate of change of real private asset holdings;

                           A/P = 'Y(A/P,          , ( — B)/p,            r*).                                        (3.48)

This differential equation characterizes the dynamic process through which the

real stock of privately held assets is adjusted to its long run equilibrium

value,       A/P,     which is determined implicitly by the condition

                                        y, ( — Bg)/P          r*)    =   0.                                          (3.49)

       This adjustment process for private assets is illustrated in the middle

panel of figure 3.5, where the curve labeled                              'P(A/P,    Y,       (B —    B)/P,    r*J     shows

the relationship between                    A/P and A/P.         in the top panel the curve labeled

rn(A/P,     '1.    (B -   Bg)/P     r*)      shows the reduced form relationship between the

level of real private assets and the instantaneous equilibrium level of real

money balances.            Finally, in the bottom panel of figure 3.5, the curve labeled

                          shows the relationship between the level of real private assets

and the rate of change of domestic real money balances,                                        M/P,     determined by

      =     (a/A/P)./P                  =   (m/(A/P))'P(A/P,             Y,   (B —   Bg)/P           r*).            (3.50)

           Three important principles concerning the mechanism of balance of

payments adjustment when we allow for international capital mobility are

reflected   in figure 3.5.    First, the level of money balances in the economy

adjusts immediately to the instantaneous equilibrium level associated with the

actual level of privately held assets:        that is, the economy always operates

at the point on the    m     curve in the top panel of figure 3.5 corresponding to

the actual level of    A/P.     Achievement of such an instantaneous equilibrium

position subsequent to a disturbance that creates a stock unit divergence

between the demand for domestic money and the existing supply requires a stock

unit change in the central bank's holdings of international reserves as

private asset holders buy or sell securities in order to achieve the desired

composition of their assets between money and securities.        Second, the process

of adjustment of the stock of privately held assets that occurs as a

counterpart of current account imbalances, as illustrated in the middle panel

of figure 3.5, is necessarily a gradual adjustment process in which the flow

or net saving determined by the excess of domestic income over domestic

expenditure accumulates over time into changes in the stock of privately held

assets.     Third, as illustrated in the bottom panel of figure 3.5, changes in

the stock of privately held assets resulting from current account imbalances

cause gradual changes in the instantaneous equilibrium level of money balances

and corresponding flows of foreign exchange reserves which are registered as

official settlements surpluses or deficits.        This mechanism of monetary

adjustment    is similar to the monetary mechanism of balance of payments
adjustment that operates in the absence of international capital mobility.           In

the present case however, reserve changes also occur in response to asset
swaps motivated by the desire of domestic residents to adjust the actual level
of   iiney balances within their portfolio of assets to its desired level.

Through reserve changes brought about by the operation of these two

mechanisms, the level of the domestic money supply is ultimately adjusted to
                                                            —42—




the    long run equilibrium level of domestic money demand that is associated

with the long run equilibrium level of privately held domestic assets and with

long run equilibrium of the current account balance.

        These three principles all come into operation when we consider an

increase J in the fiat issue of the domestic central bank.                                Starting from

an initial situation of long run equilibrium, domestic real assets exceed

their long run equilibrium value by the amount                            J/P.    Since the entire

increase        J/P    in real privately held assets comes in the form of domestic

money, the economy is tentatively at the point                            D   in the top panel of figure

3.5 which lies above the                      curve as well as to the right of the long run

equilibrium level of              A/P.        To restore the desired composition of assets

individuals sell money balances and purchase securities sufficient to move the

economy       downward from the point                D     in the top panel of figure 3.5 to the
point     F     that lies along the             in       curve.     The additional securities are
purchased      from foreign residents who convert the domestic money they receive

from their sales of securities into foreign money, with a consequent loss of

foreign exchange reserves by the domestic central bank.                            This immediate, stock

unit    loss of foreign exchange reserves accounts for the reduction in the
domestic money supply implied by the jump from the point                            D   to the point
F.     At the point         F,     the real value of private domestic assets exceeds its
long    run equilibrium value A/P,                       resulting in an excess of domestic real
expenditure over domestic real income and                          in a current account deficit, as

indicated      by the point         F     along the          'Y    curve in the middle panel of figure
3.5.     Over time, downward adjustments in the real stock of privately held
assets gradually reduce                 A/P    to its long         run equilibrium level. The gradual
reductions      in    A/P        gradually reduce the instantaneous equilibrium level of

real money balances, implying, as illustrated in the bottom panel of figure
                                       -.43—




3.5, corresponding losses of foreign exchange reserves by the central bank.

The total loss of reserves that results from this adjustment process, together

with the initial swap of domestic money for foreign securities, exactly

offsets the increase in the fiat issue of the central bank and restores

domestic money balances to their long run equilibrium level (see Frenkel and

Rodriguez (1 975)].

     The general features of this analysis extend to the effects of other

types of disturbances.     If the disturbance creates an incipient divergence

between the actual level of money balances and their new instantaneous

equilibrium level, there will be a swap of domestic money for foreign

securities and a corresponding stock unit change in the central bank's

holdings of international reserves.     If after this asset swap the actual level

of domestic privately held assets differs from the long run equilibrium level,

there will be a gradual process of adjustment of asset holdings through

current account imbalances toward their long run equilibrium level.

Associated with these changes in the level of assets, there will be changes in

the instantaneous equilibrium level of money balances which will induce

changes in the central bank's holdings of foreign exchange reserves.       The

total change in reseves will equal the divergence that the initiating

disturbance creates between the long run equilibrium level of domestic money

balances and the actual level of such balances.

        The introduction of nontraded goods modifies the analysis of mechanism of

balance of payments adjustment with international capital mobility in

essentially the same way as it modifies the analysis of this mechanism for the

case in which capital is immobile.     starting from a level of   A/P   that is

below    A/P,   the domestic relative and nominal prices of rtontradables and the

general domestic price level are all below their respective long run
                                        —44—




equilibrium levels.   As    A/P   rises due to current account surpluses, all of

these prices rise toward their respective long run equilibrium levels.

     A modification that is in the same spirit as the introduction of

nontraded goods is the introduction of a nontradable asset that domestic

residents hold in addition to domestic money, and internationally tradable

securities.   The rate of return and the price of this nontradable asset is

determined by the requirement for equilibrium in the domestic market for this

asset, in much the same way that the relative price of a nontradable good is

determined by the requirement for equilibrium in the domestic market for such

a good.   starting from an initial valQe of     A/P        that is less than its long

run equilibrium value and assuming that asset demands are normal (in the sense

that an increase in   A/P    increases the real demands for all assets), the

instantaneous equilibrium price of the nontraded asset will be lower and the

instantaneous equilibrium rate of return on this asset will be higher than

their respective long run equilibrium values.         As     A/P   rises due to current

account surpluses, the price of the nontraded asset will rise, and the rate of

return on the nontraded asset will fall toward their respective long run

equilibrium values [see Dornbusch (1975) and Branson (1976); on the policy

implications see Frenkel and Mussa (1981)].

     This analysis can be extended to the case of two large countries that

trade a single good and exchange a single internationally mobile security.

The results of this analysis are similar to those in section 3.2.5, modified

to reflect the implications of capital mobility.            Prices of nontraded goods

and yields on nontraded assets adjust to clear domestic markets for these

goods and assets in each country, conditional on the world price of the

tradable good, the world yield on the mobile security, and the prevailing

distribution of world wealth.      Instantaneous equilibrium requires that the
                                      —45—




world price of tradable goods and the world yield on the mobile security clear

the world markets for these goods and securities, conditional on the

distribution of world wealth.   At such an instantaneous equilibrium, one

country will generally spend more than its income and the other country will

spend an equal amount less than its income, implying a corresponding current

account deficit and current account surplus.   The country with the surplus

will be increasing its share of world wealth at the expense of the country

with the deficit.   The redistribution of world wealth that finances the trade

imbalances will be accomplished partly by a flow of privately held securities

and partly by a flow of official reserves (with effects on the money supplies

of the two countries).   If the balance of payments adjustment process is

stable, as it should b€ in such a world, current account imbalances between

the two countries will gradually decline as the wealth of the surplus country

rises and the wealth of the deficit country declines, and the world will

converge to a long run equilibrium in which current account balances are zero

and there is no further redistribution of world wealth [see Frenkel (1976b)].

     in this type of model of the world economy, an increase in the fiat issue

of the central bank of the home country results in an immediate loss of

foreign exchange reserves as domestic asset owners rebalance their portfolios

between money and securities.   Foreign residents will accommodate this

portfolio shift because the increase in the world price of traded goods and

the adjustment of the world yield on internationally mobile securities induces

them to swap securities for money.   At the instantaneous equilibrium

established immediately after the increase in the fiat issue of the home

country's central bank, the wealth of home residents has risen and that of

foreign residents has declined because the entire increase in the world money

supply went initially to home residents while the increase in the world price
                                        —46—



level reduced the real value of the nominal assets of residents of both

countries.     During the process of adjustment subsequent to the establishment

of this instantaneous equilibrium, the wealth of home residents will decline

as they spend in excess of their income, and the wealth of foreign residents

will rise as they spend less than their income.     The central bank of the home

country will suffer a further loss of foreign exchange reserves because the

demand for money by home residents will decline along with their wealth.        In

the end, however, the total loss of foreign exchange reserve by the home

central bank (both from the initial asset swap and from subsequent reserve

flows) will be smaller than the increase in the fiat issue of this central

bank.    As in the case of no private capital mobility (section 3.2.5   ),   this    is

because the increase in the fiat issue of the home central bank has increased

the world money supply, the long run equilibrium level of all nominal prices

and, hence, the long run equilibrium level of the demand for domestic money.

        An increase in the money supply of the home country brought about by an

open market operation has somewhat different effects than an increase in the

fiat issue of the home central bank because the open market operation affects

the supplies of securities available to private asset holders.     Moreover, the

effects of such an open market operation depend on whether the securities

purchased by the central bank are domestic nontradable securities or

internationally tradable securities,     Tinder standard assumptions about

substitutability among assets in private portfolio demands, a purchase of

domestic nontradable securities will decrease the long run equilibrium yield

on such securities both absolutely and relative to the yield on

internationally mobile securities;     whereas an open market purchase of the

internationally mobile security will have a smaller effect in reducing the

long run equilibrium yield on this security and will reduce this yield
                                        —47-.




relative to the yield on the domestic nontradable security.       The differential

effect of these two policies on the long run equilibrium world price level and

on the distribution of international reserves depends on the degrees of

substitution between national monies and different classes of securities

[see Dornbusch (1975, 1977)].

     Substitution relations among assets in portfolio demands are crucial in

large countries models with two or more internationally tradable securities.

Since the analysis of such models is provided by Branson and Henderson in

Chapter 15 of this volume along with an extended list of references, we

conclude the present section by only highlighting one critical feature of

these models——the effects of sterilized intervention in the foreign exchange

market.     If the central bank of the home country intervenes in the foreign

exchange market by selling foreign securities in order to prevent depreciation

of the foreign exchange value of domestic money and sterilizes the monetary

effect of this intervention by buying domestic securities, the overall effect

of the operation will be to increase the outstanding supply of foreign

securities and decrease the outstanding supply of domestic securities while

holding the money supply constant.    Given standard assumptions about portfolio

demands for different securities, this alteration of security supplies will

increase the equilibrium yield on foreign securities and decrease the

equilibrium yield on domestic securities.       If each country's security is a

closer substitute for its money than the security of the other country,      then

this alternation in yields will decrease the demand for home money and

increase the demand for foreign money and, thereby, tends to alleviate the

monetary disequilibrium that was the cause of the drain of foreign exchange

reserves.

4.      Flexible exchange rates

4.1     The monetary model of exchange rate determination
        The monetary model of exchange rate determination emphasizes the role of
money market equilibrium as       well as the interaction between domestic and
foreign    commodity markets.17    An essential element of any montary model is the

assumption of money market equilibrium:

                         (p_p*) = (m_m*) +   (9,*
                                                    —    fl.                        (4.1)

where     2.   denotes the logarithum of the demand for domestic real balances, m
denoted tne logarithm of the nominal money supply, p the logarithm of the

price level and where an asterisk indicates a variable pertaining to the

foreign country.       A second essential element in a monetary model of exchange

rate determination is a link between domestic and foreign prices through some

form of the purchasing power parity, the simplest form of which is expressed

by

                                      p=e+p*                                            (4.2)

 where e denotes the logarithm of the exchange rate, i.e., the price of

foreign money in terms of domestic money.               Using equation (4.2) in (4.1)

yields

                             e = (m_m*) + [* —                                      (4.3)
which expresses the exchange rate in terms of supplies of domestic and foreign

monies and demands to hold these monies.            Anything that increases the supply

of domestic relative to foreign money        or     increases the demand for foreign

relative to domestic money, raises the exchange rate (i.e., depreciates the

domestic currency).

        The assumption that the prices relevant for money market equilibrium are

 the same as those relevant for the purchasing power parities [equation (4.2)]
                                                                   —49—




is easily relaxed by allowing the price level to be a weighted average of the

prices of non-tradeable goods and internationally traded goods:

                                                 p         aPN ÷ (1_c)P
                                                       =   a*p          +       (1_a*)p                           (4.5)

where               and
                            T    denotes, respectively, the logarithm of the prices of non—

tradeable and tradeable goods, and                             a    denotes the weight of nontradable goods

in the price index.               If purchasing power parity holds only for tradeable

goods, we replace equation (4.2) by (4.6):

                                                     = e + PT           •                                         (4.6)
Using (4.4)—(4.6) in (4.1) yields

                  e = (m_m*) +     {*    —   9] +      Ea(PT        —
                                                                                  — a*(p*   —   p*)]              (4.7)

This equation reveals a third important factor determining the exchange

rate:       relative price structures in the two economies.                                      A rise in the domestic

relative price of tradeable goods (a loss of competitiveness), raises the

exchange rate (i.e., depreciates the domestic currency).

           Specification of the determinants of real money demand adds further

content to the general monetary model of exchange rate determination.                                             One

such specification is given by

                                         =   k+ry      — cu.                                                      (4.8)

                                   =    k*   +   n*y*      —                                                      (4.9)
where y and i denote the logarithm of income and the rate of interest and

where         r       and    a   denote the income elasticity and the interest (semi)

elasticity of the demand for money.                            Substituting this specification into

(4.7) and assuming for simplicity of exposition that                                             = fl*,a=c, and   =y*,

we    obtain

     e =    (k*_k)    +   (m_m*)+ (y*..y) +           a(i_i*)               +   aI(PT—PN)   -   (p,—p)]           (4.10)

Other things constant, a rise in the level of domestic relative to foreign
                                                   —50—




income, appreciates the value of domestic currency (reduces e) and an increase

in the domestic nominal interest relative to the foreign nominal interest rate

depreciates the value of domestic currency (increases e).

        The result (4.10) is further refined by incorporating the interest parity

c ond i ti on,


                                       i—it = ii                                           (4.11)
where     it     denotes the forward premium a foreign exchange (i.e., the difference

between the logarithms of the forward and                 the   spot exchange rates).

Substituting         it    for(i_i*)   in equation (4.10) yields the prediction that a

rise    in the forward premium on foreign exchange depreciates the currency

(raises e).8              This dependence of the current exchange rate on expectations

concerning the future (as summarized by the forward premium) is a typical

characteristic of price determination in asset markets.                    Thus, an expected

future depreciation of the currency is reflected immediately in the current

value of the currency.

        In the above model we have not drawn the distinction between "the demand

for domestic money" and "the domestic demand for money."                    Implicitly it has

been assumed that domestic money is demanded only by domestic residents while

foreign money is demanded only by foreign residents.                    Furthermore, the

formulation of the demands for real cash balances [in equations (4.8)—(4.9)]

included the domestic interest rate in the domestic demand, and the foreign

interest rate in the foreign demand; it has been implicitly assumed that the

only relevant alternative for holding domestic money is domestic securities

while the only relevant alternative for holding foreign money is foreign

securities.         In principle, however, the alternatives to holding domestic money

include domestic securities, foreign securities, inventories of domestic and

foreign goods as well as foreign exchange.                  It follows that a richer
                                             —51 —




formulation of the demand for money would recognize that, as an analytical
matter, the spectrum of alternative assets and rates of return that are
relevant    for the specification of the demand for money is rather broad,

including both rates of interest,        i    and i expected domestic and foreign

inflation as well as the forward premium on foreign exchange          r.


Furthermore, to the extent that under flexible exchange rate system

individuals might wish to diversify their currency holdings, the demand for

domestic money would include a foreign component which depends on foreiqri

income, while the demand for foreign money would include a domestic component

which depends on domestic income.19          These characteristics reflect the

phenomenon of currency substitution which is likely to arise when the exchange

rate is not pegged.2°         Under these circumstances the demand function

£   and    £*   will   be richer and, when substituted into equation (4.7), the

predictiOns of the effects of parametric changes in incomes or rates of

interest will depend on the relative sensitivity of the demands for domestic

and foreign monies to these parametric changes, which in turn may depend on

the relative degrees of substitutions among assets in portfolios.          The general

principles which govern the effects of parametric changes on the relative

demands for money are similar to those that govern the effects of inter—

national transfers on relative demands and resemble the "transfer problem

criteria".

      The monetary approach that was summarized in the preceedinq discussion

differs from the elasticities approach to exchange rate determination in that

concepts    like exports, imports, and the like, do      not appear explicitely as

being fundamentally relevant for the understanding of the evolution of the

exchange rate.         Rather, the relevant concepts relate to three groups of

variables:      first are those which are determined by the monetary authorities,
                                           —52—




second are those which affect the demands for domestic and foreign monies, and

third are those which affect the relative price structures.21

        The formulation of the link between domestic and foreign prices in

equation (4.6) assumed that purchasing power parities holds with respect to

internationally traded goods.        Implicitly it was assumed that there are no

barriers to trade.     This formulation can be easily extended so as to

incorporate price differential which stem from commercial policies.               For

example, when the domestic economy has tariffs on imports, equation (4.6)

becomes

                              =    K+e   + p                                          (4.12)

where     K   denotes the logarithm of one plus the proportional tariff rate.

using equation (4.12) instead of (4.6) in the derivation of the exchange rate

equation shows the negative dependence of         e    on   K.    Accordingly,    the

imposition of a tariff results in an appreciation of the currency.               In

explaining this result the monetary approach does not emphasize the effect of

the tariff on the relative price of imports along the lines of the "elasticity

approach" but rather,it is argued that the currency appreciates because.

ceteris paribus, a rise in the tariff rate raises the price level, induces a

rise in the demand for nominal balances and results in a rise in the relative

price of nominal balances.        The monetary approach also provides for a

mechanism by which a tariff may result in a depreciation of the currency.                 If

subsequent increases in tariffs result in distortions which lower real

income,the reduced real income reduces the demand for money and may outweigh

the effect of the rise in the price level.            In that case a rise in the tariff

rate may weaken the currency [for further discussion see Kimbrough (1980)].

        We turn now to a brief illustration of the working of the model under the

assumption that capital is immobile internationally. s shown in equation
                                                  —53—




(4.10),    the equilibrium exchange rate can be expressed in terms of variables

pertaining to the demand and the supply of monies as well as to those which

underlie the relative price structure.The equilibrium relative price structure

is determined by the condition that the demands for traded and non—traded

goods equal the corresponding supplies.                   Panel II of figure 4.1 describes the

determination of the equilibrium relative price
                                                                           =   c(PTN)    for the

domestic economy that is assumed to face a given foreign price of traded

goods.22    The NN and the 'If schedules describe combinations of relative prices

and interest rates that maintain equilibrium in the markets for non—traded and

traded goods, respectively.The NN schedule is positively sloped since a rise

in              creates an excess supply for non—traded goods which can be

eliminated by a higher interest rate.                 The higher interest rate restores the

equilibrium since it lowers demand.               The reduction in the demand in turn is

based on the assumption that aggregate spending depends negatively on the rate

of interest.       The TT schedule is negatively sloped since a rise in the

relative price                   creates an excess supply of traded goods which can be

eliminated by a fall in the rate of interest which induces a rise in

spending.       The equilibrium rate of interest and relative prices is designated

by   point Q.     Panel   I of   figure   4.1 describes the condition for money market

equilibrium.      The horizontal axis represents the real value of cash balances
as a function of the rate of interest. For subsequent use it is noted that,
from equations (4.4)—(4.6), the price level that is used in the computation of
real   balances can be written as

                    p = e + p* + (p*        -   p*)           -   p)   .                      (4.13)
                                                      -

       Consider a rise in spending that falls entirely on traded goods.                       As

shown in panel II of figure 4.1, this induces a rightward shift of the TI'

schedule to T' T' and results in a new equilibrium at point                      Q'   with   a higher

Figure   4.1:   Stock and Flow Equilibruim Under Flexible Exchange Rates:         The
                Effect of a Rise in Spending on Traded Goods

relative price of traded goods and a higher rate of interest.         The higher rate

of interest in turn lowers the demand for real balances and, as shown in panel

I of figure 4.1, results in a new equilibrium at point 13.        Inspection of

equation (4.13) helps to ascertain the effects of the change in spending on

the exchange rate.       Since, given the higher interest rate, the price level

must rise (so as to reduce real balances) and since the rise in         (pT_p)__which

is   induced by the decline in the    nominal price of non-traded goods——con-

       to a fall in the price level, it follows that the exchange rate,
tributes

e, must rise so as to more than offset the price level effect of the relative
price   change.

        Consider now the case where the rise in spending falls entirely on non—

traded goods.     In this case the NN schedule shifts to the left as in figure

4.2 and the new equilibrium (point Q'')      is   characterized by a lower relative

price of traded goods and a higher rate of interest.         As before, the higher

rate of interest induces a decline in the desired quantity of real balances

(point C) and therefore, given the nominal quantity of money, necessitates a

higher price level.       In this case, however, the change in the exchange rate is

ambiguous.     The fall of the relative price              lowers the price level and

therefore, depending on whether this reduction in the price level exceeds or

falls short of the reduction that is necessary for money market equilibrium,

the exchange rate will fall or rise.       We conclude by noting, that in contrast

with the predictions of the "simple absorption" approach one may not conclude

unambiguously that a rise in aggregate spending weakens the currency.         Rather,

the exchange rate effect may depend on whether the rise in spending falls on

traded or non—traded goods.

        The same model   can be used to examine •the effects of other changes like
expenditure    switching for which the rise in spending on one group of goods

 Figure 4.2:   Stock and Flow Equilibrium Under Flexible Exchange Rates:        The
               Effect of a Rise in Spending on Nontraded Goods
                                            —55—                                 -




does not come at the expense of savings but rather corresponds to a decline in

spending on the other group of goods.          Likewise one could analyse the effects

of economic expansion which originates in one of the sectors.          In that case it

can be shown that a rise in output originating in the traded goods sector,

results in a fall in         e   (i.e. in an appreciation of the currency).     On the

other    hand the exchange rate effects of a rise in output originating in the
non—traded sector are ambiguous. As before, this ambiguity stems          from the

fact    that the change in the equilibrium relative prices induces a change in
the    price level which may exceed or fall short of the change required by money

market equilibrium.23

        The above analysis which was intended to illustrate the working of the

model was conducted under the assumption that capital was immobile inter-

nationally.        Under these circumstances the balance of trade had to be

balanced.     The model can be extended to allow for capital mobility.          In that

case, flow equilibrium would require that in addition to a zero excess demand

for non-traded goods, the trade balance surplus must equal the deficit on the

capital account.         The qualitative conclusions of the analysis remain unchanged

except for the fact that the induced change in the rate of interest (and

thereby the required change in the price level) would be smaller the higher

the degree of capital mobility.          In the extreme case, when capital is

perfectly mobile, the interest rate and thus the desired level of real

balances would not change.          As can be seen from equation (4.13), in this case

to    nintain a constant price level, the exchange rate would have to change by
the same amount as the relative price (when both are measured
logarithmically).
        Finally,    it   is noteworthy that the model satisfies the homogeneity
postulate.     A once and for all rise in the domestic money supply results in a
                                        —56-




once and for all rise in the exchange rate and in the nominal price of non—

traded goods while leaving all real variables (like real balances, relative

prices, and the rate of interest) unchanged.     Likewise, a once and for all

equal rise in the domestic and the foreign money raises all nominal prices

while leaving all real variables and the exchange rate unchanged.

     The formulation in equation (4.9)—(4.1O) presumed that money market

equilibrium obtains continuously.     The analytical framework could be modified

easily to allow for a distinction between short—run and long—run demands for

money.     This formulation would imply the dynamics of adjustment.   Likewise,

the formulation in equation (4.16) could be modified to allow for a gradual

adjustment to purchasing power parities [see Bilson (1978a).     While such

modifications of the theoretical model do not introduce severe complexities,

the implications for empirical estimates are much more involved and great care

is required in the specification of the corresponding econometric model.

     Further modifications of the model allow for legal restrictions on

transactions in foreign currency which results in black markets, (Blejer

(1978)1, as well as for government intervention in the determination of

exchange rates which results in a crawling peg [Blejer and Leiderman

(1981)].    An additional modification concerns the choice of the rate of

interest that is included in the demand for money.     The formulation that we

have used included the nominal rate of interest as an argument without drawing

a distinction between the real interest rate and inflationary expectations.

Likewise, the specification assumed some form of purchasing power parities.

This specification can be modified so as to allow for short term price

stickiness.24     In that case a rise in the quantity of money lowers the real

rate of interest for the short—run and induces a depreciation of the currency.

     The discussion of currency substitution suggested the possibility that

the function characterizing the demand for money includes many alternative
                                      —57—




rates of return corresponding to the many alternative assets.     Again, as a

theoretical matter this modification does not introduce severe complexities

but the implications for empirical research may be severe since the various

rates of return may be highly collinear.     The degree of collinearity maybe

very high if the alternative rates of return are linked to each other by

various parity conditions.   Among such parity conditions are the interest

parity——linking the forward premium on foreign exchange to the difference

between domestic and foreign rates of interest, the purchasing power parity——

linking domestic and foreign prices, and the Fisher relations-—linking the

nominal rates of interest to the real rates of interest and to inflationary

expectations.

     The analysis of exchange rate determination within the monetary framework

did not put much explicit emphasis on the stocks of other assets.    According

to the monetary model changes in the stocks of alternative assets results in

exchange rate changes only to the extent that they alter the various rates of

return which affect the demand for money.    In contrast, the portfolio—balance

model emphasizes the limited degree substitutability among alternative

assets.   According to the portfolio—balance model the relative quantities of

the various assets and of the rate of accumulation of these assets excert

profound first order effects on the exchange rate.25    As an empirical matter,

however, the implementation of this approach is made difficult due to limited

availability of data on the various quantities of the assets that would be

relevant for inclusion in the world portfolio model.

     Since the rate of accumulation of assets equals the current account of

the balance of payments, it provides for a dynamic linkage between the current

account and the exchange rate.   As a result, analyses of the portfolio—balance

model have typically linked the exchange rate to the current account.26     It is
                                        —58—



relevant to note, however, that such a linkage is not specific to the

portfolio—balance model.    Rather, it reflects the implications of the budget

constraint by which the current account of the balance of payments equals the

discrepancy between income and spending, and this constraint holds of course

independent of the determinants of portfolio composition.    Consequently, any

model which allows for net savings, must imply a relationship between the

exchange rate and the current account.27

     Prior to concluding this section it might be useful to note that the

monetary approach to the •exchange rate does not claim that the exchange rate

is "determined" only in the money or in the asset—markets and that only stock

rather than flow considerations are relevant for determining the equilibrium

exchange rate.    Obviously, general equilibrium relationships which are

relevant for the determination of exchange rates include both stock and flow

variables.28     In this respect, the money market equilibrium relationship that

has been used, may be viewed as a reduced form relationship.    Furthermore, the

fact that the analysis of the exchange rate has been carried out in terms of

the supplies and the demands for monies, does not imply that "only money

matters" or that the exchange rate is determined only by the supply of

domestic and foreign monies:    on the contrary, in addition to the key role

played by the intersectoral relative price structure, the demand for money

plays a critical role and it depends on real variables like real income as

well as on other real variables which underlie expectations.    The rationale

for concentrating on the relative supplies and demands for money is that they

provide a convenient and a natural framework for organizing thoughts

concerning the determinants of the relative price of monies.    It is the same

principle which has been used by proponents of the monetary approach to the

balance of payments in justifying the use of the money demand-money supply
                                         —59—




framework for the analysis of the money account of the balance of payments

under a pegged exchange rate system.29

       The model that was discussed in this section included anticipatory

variables, like the forward premium on foreign exchange, as one of the

determinants of the current exchange rate.      However, this formulation has not

emphasized sufficiently the critical role that expectations play in affecting

the exchange rate.    This unique role is best exemplified within a more general

framework that views the question of exchange rate determination as part of

the more general theory of the determination of asset prices.



4.2.   Exchange rates as asset prices

       In the models of exchange rate determination examined in the preceding

section, the dynamic behavior of the exchange rate is usually analyzed in

terms of the response of the exchange rate to an exogenous disturbance (such

as a permanent increase in the domestic money supply) and its subsequent path

of convergence to its new long—run equilibrium.      This general view of exchange

rate determination, however, does not fully explain key empirical regularities

that have been characteristic of the behavior of exchange rates during the

1970's and during earlier periods of generalized floating.     As a statistical

matter, the   logarithm   of spot exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other

major currencies (the British pound, the Deutsche mark, the French franc, the

Japanese yen and the Swiss franc) is generally well described as random walks

in which month—to—month and quarter-to—quarter changes are almost entirely

unpredictable.    Changes in spot exchange rates are generally closely

correlated with contemporaneous changes in forward exchange rates (especially

for large changes), indicating that movements in spot rates are closely

related to movements in the market's expectation of future spot rates.
                                            —60—




Monthly and quarterly changes in exchange rates are not, however, closely

related to differentials in national inflation rates, implying that most

short-run changes in nominal exchange rates correspond changes in real

exchange rates (i.e., to deviations from purchasing power parities).

Moreover, monthly and quarterly changes in exchange rates are not closely

related to differentials in rates of monetary expansion or to current account
             30
imbalances

     These facts suggest that exchange rates should be viewed as prices of

durable assets determined in organized markets (like stock and commodity

exchanges) in which current price reflect the market's expectation concerning

present and future economic conditions relevant for determining the

appropriate values of these durable assets, and in which price changes are

largely unpredictable and reflect primarily new information that alters

expectations concerning these present and future economic conditions.                  This

general notion of exchange rates as "asset prices" can be represented in

skeletal model in which the logarithm of the equilibrium exchange rate in

period t, denoted by e(t), is determined by31

                  e(t) =   X(t)   +   aE((e(t+1)    —   e(t));t)];                     (4.14)

where x(t)   represents the basic econqmic conditions that affect the foreign
exchange market in period t, Et(e(t+1) —           e(t));t]     denotes the expected

percentage rate of change of the exchange rate between t and t+1 conditional

on information available at t, and the parameter a measures the sensitivity of

the current exchange rate to its expected rate of change.               To close the model,

it is assumed that expectations are "rational" in the sense that they are

consistent with the application of (4.14) in all future periods (and with a

suitable boundary condition).         By forward iteration, it follows that the

exchange rate that is expected at any t+j, for              j    o,   conditional on
                                              —61--




information available at t, depends on a discounted sum of expected future

X'S, starting at t+j;       specifically,
            E[e(t+j);tJ =(1/(1+a))..           (a/(1+a))1'E[x(t+j+i);t].                         (4.15)

Setting j    = 0,   we obtain the "asset price" expression for the current exchange

rate as a discounted sum of present and expected future X's.

       Using (4.15), we also obtain a convenient decomposition of the change in

the exchange rate, D(e(t))         e(t+1) —      e(t),   into its expected change

component,     De(e(t)) =    E[D(e(t));   t] =    E[(e(t   + 1)     —    e(t));   t)   and its

unexpected change component,         DU(e(t)) =       e(t+1)   —   E[e(t+1);tJ.          The expected

change in the exchange rate is a discounted sum of expected future changes in

the X's;

              De(e(t)) =    (1/(1+a))(a/(1+a))1.E(D(x(t+i));t].                                  (4.16)

Alternatively, the expected change in the exchange rate can be expressed as

proportional to the difference between the discounted sum of all expected

future X's that determines E[e(t+1);t] and the current X;

                    De(e(t)) =   (1/(1+a)).   [E( [e(t+1 );t) -         X(t)].                   (4.17)

The unexpected change in the exchange rate is a discounted sum of changes in

expectations about future X'S based on new information received between t and

t+1;

 D"(e(t))=(1/(1+a))E(a/(1+a)).[E(X(t+j÷1);t+1)—E(x(t+j+1);t)J.                                   (4.18)

       These results provide a general rationale for many of the observed

regularities in the dynamic behavior of exchange rates.                      The expected

component of monthly changes in exchange rates between major industrial

countries should usually be quite small because the factor of proportionality

1/(1+a) that appears in (4.17) is probably of the order of magnitude of 1/100,

implying that only very large differences between the current X and the

discounted sum of all future X's could justify a substantial expected change
                                      —62—




in the exchange rate over a period of a month.32   In contrast, the unexpected

component of the monthly change in the exchange rate,which is necessarily

unpredictable on the basis of information available at t, could be quite

large.    If new information received between t and t+1 leads to a substantial

revision, in the same direction, of expectations, we should observe changes in

expectations concerning future exchange rates that are in the same direction

and are of similar magnitude as the unexpected change in the spot exchange

rate.33   This suggests a rationale for the observed relation between

unexpected movements in spot and forward exchange rates, especially for large

movements.



.3   Balance of payments equilibrium and the real exchange rate

     One procedure for introducing specific economic content into the general

asset price model of exchange rates is to focus on the condition of balance of

payments equilthrium as the fundamental determinant of the equilibrium

exchange rate, and allowing for a suitable channel through which expected

changes in the exchange rate influence the balance of payments.    This

procedure is reminiscent of traditional flow market models of the

determination of excharigerates, and is also similar to a number of more

recent analyses of the interaction between the exchange rate and the current

account balance.34    In implementing this procedure, it is convenient initially

to deal with a real model of the determination of the real exchange rate, and

only subsequently (in the next section) to introduce the monetary

constderations centrally important in determining nominal exchange rates.35

     For a moderate size country, the real exchange rate,    q,   is identified

with the logarithm of the relative price of domestic goods in terms of foreign

goods.    Domestic goods may either be exclusively nontraded goods or may be
                                                                  —63--




goods for which there is a less than infinitely elastic foreign demand.

Consistent with either of these interpretations, it is plausible to assume

that the current account surplus                            b,        (measured in terms of imported good), is

determined by36

                               b =       8    •   (z    —    q) + r*.A,            6 >   0,                       (4.19)

where z summarizes the exogenous real factors that affect domestic excess

demand and foreign excess demand for domestic goods,                                          6   is a parameter that

reflects the relative price elasticities of domestic and foreign excess

demands for domestic goods, r* is the (fixed) foreign real interest rate, and

A is the net stock of foreign assets (denominated in foreign goods) held by

domestic residents.        Absent changes in official holdings of foreign assets,

the current account surplus necessarily determines the rate of change of net

private holdings of foreign assets;

                           D(A) = b =                  8.(z      —    q) ÷ r*.A.                                 (4.20)

     The rest of the world, which is large relative to the home country,

willingly absorbs changes in assets                              A,     in exchange for foreign goods, at the

fixed foreign real interest rate,                           r*.        Hence, the capital account deficit of

the home country (measured in terms of foreign goods), denoted by c, reflects

the desired rate of accumulation of net foreign assets by domestic

residents.   Two    factors     are assumed to influence the desired rate accumulation

of net foreign assets:          the divergence between the current "target level" of

net foreign assets,        A    and their current actual level,                                   A;   and the expected

rate of change of the real exchange rate; formally,

                     c =   ji'(A     —       A) —      a.De(q),              a >    0.                           (4.21)

The effect of      De(q)   on        c        may be thought of either as the influence of

expected changes in the value of foreign assets (measured in terms of domestic

goods) on desired accumulation of such assets, or as the influence of the
                                                               —64—



domestic real interest rate (defined relative to a basket of both domestic and

foreign goods) on desired saving.

        Balance of payments equilibrium requires that the current account

surplus,       b,   is matched by the capital account deficit,                                   c;       that is,

                             —   q) +       rA        =   1i(A    —    A)    —   .De(q).                             (4.22)

This condition, together with (4.20), constitute a simultaneous sytems of

forward looking difference equations that may be solved for the expected

future time paths of the endogenous variables,                                   q   and    A,        conditional on the

current inherited stock of net foreign assets and on the expected future time

paths (based on current information) of the exogenous forcing variables,                                                z


and     A.      In particular, the solution for the current equilibrium real

exchange rate is given by

                             q(t) =     (t)       +       1A(t)        —    A(t))                                    (4.23)

where

                                  q(t) =      z(t)         +    (r*/).A(t)
                                  (t) = (1—0) '.E0E[z(t+j);t1

                                  A(t) = (1—0) ,E0E[A(t+j);t]

                       0 =    (1/(1     +   X))           and         y =    (X/)    —   (1/a)    >   0

              X=(1/2).Nr* +      (/a))÷I(r*+(8/a))Z+4.(1i8/cz)]>(r*+(/a)).
        The result in (4.23) indicates that the current real exchange rate

depends on (i) the current estimate of the long—run equilibrium real exchange

rate,        (t),   that is expected to be consistent with the requirement that on

average (in present and future periods), the current account is balanced

(h =    0),    and (ii) on the divergence between current net foreign asset

holdings and the current estimate of the long—run desired level of such

holdings, (t).           The asset price property of the real exchange rate is

reflected in the dependence of (t)                              on a discounted sum of present and
                                                      —65—



 expected future z's and in the dependence of                    A(t)   on a discounted sum of

present and expected future             A's.          The discount rate,        A,   that is applied
 in determining both            q(t) and A(t),        reflects the sensitivity of the current

account surplus to the level of q and the sensitivity of the capital account

deficit both to expected rate of change of q and to the divergence of net

foreign assets from their target level.

        It is noteworthy that the asset price expression for the real exchange

rate that is embodied in (4.23) is consistent with a sophisticated version of

the traditional flow market model of exchange rate determination.                           As

illustrated in figure 4.3, the current real exchange rate may be thought of as

being determined by the intersection of the                  b    schedule, characterizing the

flow of foreign exchange arising from current account transactions,

b =   •(z    -   q) +   r*.A,    and the    c    schedule, characterizing the flow of

foreign exchange arising from capital account transactions,

c = 1l'(A — A) —        ct(E[q(t+1);   tJ   —   q),    where the expected future real exchange

rate, E[q(t+1);t], is treated as a parameter affecting the position of the c

schedule.37       The element of sophistication that transforms this traditional

model into the asset pricing results expressed by (4.23) is the assumption

that expectations concerning the future real exchange rate are consistent with

the economic forces that will actually determine the future real exchange

rate.

        The present results are also consistent with recent models of the dynamic

interaction between the exchange rate and the current account which view the

current exchange rate as determined by the willingness of asset holders to

hold existing stocks of foreign assets, and which view the rate of change of

the exchange      rate as   determined by rate of change of foreign assets which is

equal   to   the current account       balance,38       In particular,     if   we assume    that the

    levels of net foreign assets                               (the A's)     are constant, then the current real
    exchange rate,                q(t),        determined by (4.23) becomes a function of the

    inherited stock of net foreign assets, as illustrated in left hand
                                                                       panel of
    figure 4.4.                Also, as illustrated in the right hand panel of figure 4.4, the

    current account surplus,                         b,       is determined by this value of                    q(t)         and by the
    interest received on the inherited stock of net foreign assets.                                                 When

    q = z +          (r*/).A,             and the current account surplus is

    b0 =       3.(z — q0)         +       (r*/8)sA0       =   (8y   —   r*).(A   —   A0) =   (   —   (r*/y)).(q          —   q0)   >   0.
    This surplus adds to the stock of net foreign assets, and the
                                                                  new stock,
A1 = A0 + b0,                    determines a new real exchange rate,                          q1,     where
      =            + y.   (A1 — A) = q0 +               y'b0    >   q.       The new real exchange rate, together
with the new stock of net foreign assets, determine a new current account
surplus, b1, where
      =    .(z        —    q1)   +        (r*/).A1      =     (8y   —   r*).(A   —   A1) =   (,8 —   (r*/y)).(q          —


which is still positive but is smaller than                                          b0.     This dynamic process
continues, with ever smaller current account surpluses and ever smaller

increases in q, until                        the   current account is in balance and                          q =   q.
           New       elements         enter into the analysis of exchange rate dynamics when we

consider             either expected changes in the z's and the A's or changes in
expectations               about the future paths of these exogenous forcing variables due

to new information.39                         The general expression for the expected change in the

The first term on the right hand side of (4.24) captures the essential element

of figure 4.4, namely, the effect of divergences between current long—run

desired     level of net foreign assets and the current actual level of net

foreign assets on the expected change in the real exchange rate.                         The second

term on the right hand side of (4.24) represents the effect on                         De(q(t))     of

"temporary expected disturbances to the current account" associated with

differences between the expected discounted sum of all future z's,

E[z(t+1);tJ,     and the current expected value of z.                 The third term on the

right hand side of (4.24) reflects the effect of expected changes in the

target level of net foreign assets, measured by                   E(A(t +   1)   —   A(t));   ti,   on

the expected change in      g.    The general expression for the unexpected change

in the real exchange rate implied by (4.23) is given by
        DU(q(t)) =   y.DU(A(t))   +   DU(z(t))    —   (y   —   (r*/13)).DU(A(t))                (4.25)
where     DU(A(t))   is the unexpected change in net foreign assets associated

with "innovations" in the current account,                 DU(z(t))     measures the effect of

new information in revising expectations about future z's, and                        DU(A(t))

indicates the effect of new information in revising expectations about future

target levels of     A.   The new information that leads to revisions of

expectations about future z's and about future target levels of wealth may

come from a variety of sources, including particularly the possible effect of

innovations in the current account on expectations concerning the 'future

behavior of the exogenous factors affecting the current account.



4.4   Exchange rates and money in the general model                of   exchange rate determination

      Models of the type examined in the preceding section are easily extended

to incorporate monetary phenomena and to deal with the nominal exchange

                                                                           —68—




goods,          p*    denote the logarithm of the foreign money price of foreign goods,

and     e       the logarithm of the domestic money price of foreign exchange.                                                        The

logarithm of the relative price of domestic goods in terms                                                        of   imported goods

is given by

                                                  q = p — (e +                     p*).                                               (4.26)

The logarithm of the general price level in the home country is given by

                         P = a•p + (1 —           ci)'(e          +        p*)    = e    +   p*   +    c.q                           (4.27)

where       c        is the weight of domestic goods in the domestic price index, and

where       P        denotes the price level. The logarithm of the demand for domestic

money is given by

                            = K +   L•P   +       J•e     +       V•q        —    N•i    —   U.De(e          +   WA                  (4.28)

where       K        represents all exogenous factors (such as real income) affecting the

demand for domestic money,                    L       >   0,          J•    > 0 and V             0     are the elasticities of

money demand with respect to the general price level, the nominal exchange

rate and the relative price                       of domestic goods, and                                N > 0, U > 0 and W > 0

are the semi—elasticities of money demand with respect to the domestic nominal

interest rate,             i,   the expected rate of change of the nominal exchange rate,

                and the stock of net foreign assets.                                         The domestic nominal interest

rate is determined by the interest parity condition,

                                                  =           +       De(e)        + p                                               (4.29)

where i is the exogenous foreign nominal interest rate and                                                              p    is an

exogenous risk premium that accounts for differences between the forward

premium on foreign exchange and the expected rate of change of the nominal

exchange rate.41

        The critical equilibrium condition for nominal variables is the

requirement that the logarithm of demand for domestic money,                                                           m',    must equal

the logarithm of the supply of domestic money, m.                                                     Using equations (4.26)-
                                                                     —69—




(4.29), this equilibrium condition may be expressed in terms of the following

"reduced form" condition for monetary equilibrium:

                                    m = k + ç.e             —       fl.De(e)                                            (4.30)

where    t   =L   +    J>   0       and    n       =N   +       U    >   0,    and where            k     summarizes all of the

factors other than              e    and       De(e)            that influence the logarithm of demand for

domestic money, i.e.,

                  k =   K   ÷ L.p* —           N.(i*        ÷ p) + (V +           clL).q       4-   W'A.                (4.31)

If it is assumed that paths of the real variables                                          q        and    A   are determined

independently of the behavior of the domestic money supply, as indicated by

the analysis in the preceding section, then the expected path of the nominal

exchange rate may be determined from the solution of the forward looking

difference equation (4.30).                        As is seen from (4.32), the expected nominal

exchange rate depends on a discounted sum of expected future differences

between m and k;42

   E[e(s);t] =                                                                       -k(s+j));t].                       (4.32)

Setting s =       t,   we find that (the logarithm of) the current nominal exchange

rate, e(t) =       E[e(t);tJ,         depends on a discounted sum of present and expected

future differences between                     m     and            k.

        This result represents the "asset price version" of the simple monetary

model of exchange rate determination discussed in section 4.1.                                                   Its advantage

over this simpler model is that it indcates clearly dependence of the current

exchange rate not only on current money supplies and money demands, but also

on the entire expected future time paths of money supplies and money

demands.43        In accord with the general principles of the asset price view of

exchange rates, the expected rate of change of the exchange rate is a

discounted sum of expected future changes in                                      rn—k's;           and the unexpected

change in the exchange rate is a discounted sum of revisions in expectations
                                                                 -70—



about future               rn—k's       brought about by new information received between                                    t

and      t+i •        In general, these two components of the change in the exchange rate
should reflect the stochastic process generating                                        rn—k       and the information

about this process that is available to economic agents.                                              For example, if

rn—k     is directly observable and is known to follow a random walk, then the

exchange rate,                 e,       should also follow a random walk in which all changes in

e      are unexpected and are proportional to the observed unexpected changes in
rn—k.       Alternatively, if                k       is   unobservable      (to private agents) and is known
to     follow a random walk, and if the monetary authority allows                                          m       to change to

offset changes in                   k    and adds an uncorrelated error to changes in                                   m,   then

e      should still follow a random walk but, following the rules of optimal

forecast, the response of                        e        to observed changes in               m     should depend on the

ratio of the variance of the pure error component of changes in                                                m        to the

variance of changes in                      k.

            In (4.32), the influence of real factors on the expected path of the

nominal             exchange rate comes through their effect on the expected paths of
rn—the money supply variable, and k——the money demand variable.                                                    An

alternative, analytically equivalent expression for E[e(s);t] brings the
influence of these real factors into sharper focus;
                       E[e(s);t] = E[P(s);tJ                —   E[p*(s);t]    —   c.E[q(s);tJ                                (4.33)
where E[P(s);tJ is the expectation of (the logarithm of) the general level of
domestic            prices, as determined by

       E[P(s);tJ =             (1/(ç+)).0(ii/(+1)).E((m(s+j)                        -       (s+j));tJ                        (4.34)

where           £     is a measure of factors affecting (the logarithm of) the demand for

domestic money that is defined by

9. =    K   —       J.p*   —   N.(i*     ÷ p) + (V —         cJ)•q   +   fl.D(p*)       +    fl.De(q) + W.A.                 (4.35)
                                        —71 —




     The results (4.33) to (4.35) represent the asset price version of the

extended monetary model of exchange rate determination considered before.

From these results, we find that a discounted sum of present and expected

future money supplies affects the nominal exchange rate by affecting the

general level of all domestic prices.     Movements in the nominal exchange rate

that are associated with expected or unexpected changes in this discounted sum

of present and future m's are consistent with the maintenance of purchasing

power parity.    By the same token, changes in the foreign price level, which

are not associated with changes in domestic money demand or supply or in the

relative price of domestic goods in terms of foreign goods, induce movements

in the nominal exchange rate that are consistent with purchasing power parity.

Real economic factors influence the exchange rate through two channels:             to

the extent that such factors affect the discounted sum of present and future

levels of demand for domestic money (measured by the        Us),      they induce

movements in the nominal exchange rate that are consistent with purchasing

power parity; however, to the extent that such real factors induce movements

in the relative price of domestic goods in terms of foreign goods, they

require movements in the nominal exchange rate and in prices that constitute

divergences from purchasing power parity.

     When   we combine the model of the nominal exchange rate embodied in
(4.33)- (4.35) with the model of the real exchange rate discussed in          the

preceding section, we arrive at a general model in which the exchange rate

exhibits the essential properties of an "asset price," while, at the same

time, the general model also incorporates       the key ingredients   of both monetary

models that focus on conditions of flow market equilibrium, as the critical

determinants of exchange rates.   This already general model of exchange rate

determination can be further extended by introducing phenomena associated with
                                        —72—




macroeconomic disequilibria.   The two modern approaches to the modelling of

such phenomena are (i) the contracting models and (ii) the incomplete

information models.   I3oth share the common feature that stabilization policy

(especially monetary policy) has no capacity to affect the long—run

equilibrium behavior of national output, but they differ critically in their

implications for the successful short—run use of stabilization policy.      In the

contracting models, changes in the money supply that were unanticipated at the

time when existing nominal contracts were established can temporarily affect

the level of national output, and the government can use its freedom to act

with respect to monetary policy (while private agents are locked into existing

nominal contracts) to improve the performance of national output [see Fischer

(1977), Phelps and Taylor (1977), Taylor (1980)].     In contrast, in the

incomplete information models, unanticipated changes in the money supply can

temporarily affect national output, but stabilization policies linked to past

values o variables observed by private agents have no capacity to improve the

performance of national output, [see Lucas (1972, 1975), Barro (1976)].

     The key implications of these two approaches to modelling macroeconomic

disequilibrium for the behavior of national output carry over from the closed

economy setting in which they were originally developed to an open economy

setting.   In either approach, unanticipated money supply changes temporarily

affect domestic output and, in general, have some effect on foreign output;

but only in the contracting approach can stabilization policy be used

successfully to improve the performance on national output.44     In addition to

these implications with respect to national outputs, models that incorporate

macroeconomic disequilibrium introduce the possibility that monetary

disturbances may induce short—run price and exchange rate movements that

diverge from purchasing power parity.     In the incomplete information approach,
                                         —73—




such divergences are simply one of the manifestations of the real effects of

unanticipated monetary changes, without any policy significance.        In the

contracting approach, stickiness of nominal prices resulting from existing

nominal contracts may necessitate "overshooting" of the nominal exchange rate

in response unanticipated monetary changes and an associated temporary but

persistent change in the real exchange rate.45        This "overshooting" response

to the nominal exchange rate may provide additional leverage for monetary

policy to affect the short-run behavior of national output, and may increase

the usefulness of exchange rates as indcators for the conduct of stabilization

policy.

4.5      Empirical issues in exchange rate analysis

      one of the significant developments characterizing research in

international economics during the last decade has been the prolification of

empirical work.46      In this section we will only highlight some aspects of this

research.

      The empirical methodology followed three general lines.      The first

examined the characteristics of the foreign exchange market, the second

examined the validity of basic parity conditions and the third examined the

performance of speicifc models.

      An example of the first line of research has been an examination of

market efficiency.     For an asset market to be "efficient" prices must

appropriately reflect all available information and thus it should be

impossible to make extra—ordinary profits by exploiting generally available

information.     Tests of foreign exchange market efficiency have focused on (1)

the statistical properties of forward rates as predictors of future spot

rates,    (ii) the time—series properties of exchange rates and of deviations

from forward rates (iii) the relative degree of volatility of spot and forward
                                        —74—




rates,    (iv) the ability to improve on market forecasts of future exchange

rates by using past spot and forward exchange rates and other publicly

available information, and (v) the capacity to make extra—ordinary profits by

employing various trading rules.     Different tests applied to differrent

exchange rates in different time periods have not reached a unanimous

consensus concerning the hypothesis of market efficiency.47

        Tests of the various parity conditions examined the performance of the

interest parity theory and the purchasing power parity doctrine.     Tests of the

interest parity have generally been favorable to the predictions of the theory

at least when account is taken of the costs and timing of transactions in

various markets [see, for example, Frenkel and Levich (1975, 1977)].     In

contrast, tests of the purchasing power parity doctrine have not figured as

well.     The data specifically during the 1970's, suggest that short—run changes

in exchange rates bear little relationship to short—run differentials in

national inflation rates, particularly as measured by consumer price

indices.     Further, changes in exchange rates over longer periods of time have

frequently been associated with large cumulative divergences from relative

purchasing power parities.48    As an analytical matter, purchasing power

parities can be expected to hold in the long run if most of the shocks to the

system are of a monetary origin which do not require changes in relative

prices.     The evidence on the large cumulative deviations from purchasing power

parities are consistent with prominance of "real" shocks.     It is relevant to

note that the short-run deviations from purchasing power parities reflect, in

addition to the effects of real shocks, the intrinsic differences between the

properties of exchange rates and those of national price levels.     Exchange

rates, like other asset prices, are likely to respond promptly to new

information which alters expectations, while national price level exhibits
                                           —75—



 some "stickiness" reflecting the cost of price adjustment which
                                                                 result in
 nominal contracts of finite length.       The resulting difference between the

 time—series properties of exchange rates and        prices   is reflected in the low
 correlation between the practically random month—to—month exchange—rate

 changes and the serially correlated differences between national
                                                                  rates of
inflation.

        The third line of research has tested directly the performance of

specific models.       The monetary model was reasonable successful when applied to

extreme episodes like the German hyperinflation of the 1920's where monetary

shocks dominated the scene.       However, when applied to more regular periods it

yielded mixed results [see, for example, Frenkel (1976), Frenkel and Clements

(1982), Bilson (1978a, 1978b) and Hodrick (1978)].            Modifications of the
simple monetary model which included elements of the term structure of the

interest ra€e and which allowed for a trend in the income velocity have

enjoyed limited success but have faced the difficulties arising from parameter

instability [see, for example, Frankel (1979, 1984), Dornbusch (1978)].

Likewise, tests of the portfolio—balance model yielded occasionally mixed

success but further examination yielded poor results (see, for example,

Branson, Haittunen and Massori (1977) and Frarikel (1984)].         While the various
models might have enjoyed some success in accounting for the variability
                                                                         of
exchange    rates during a specific sample period, all have performed poorly when
applied to out—of— sample data [see, for example, Meese and Rogoff (1983)].
It seems that at the present stage the empirical evidence taken          as a whole,
suggest    the lack   of a satisfactory structural   model accounting for exchange
rate   behavior.

       The analytical framework that was developed in section 4.2 views the

exchange rate as an asset price which is highly sensitive to new information
                                     —76—




that alters expecatations.   This general view implies that empirical research

on the determinats of exchange rate changes should relate these changes to the

"innovations" in the relevant variables.49   The econometric modelling of these

issues are, however, complex since they involve measurements of unanticipated

events.   Therefore, tests of these models are always joint tests of the

specification of the model and of the decomposition of events into their

anticipated and unanticipated components.    Recent work on the relation between

exchange rate and "news" measured "news" in a variety of ways and have

produced evidence consistent with this general analytical view.50    While this

line of research is relatively new in exchange rate analysis, applications in

other areas on economics suggest the potential for considerable promise.

     *
         We   are grateful to Stanley Black, William Branson and Peter Kenen for

helpful comments on an earlier draft of this paper.             The research reported

here is part of the NBER's research program in International Studies and

Economic Fluctuations.           Any opinions expressed are those of the authors and

not necessarily those of the NBER.


     11n figure        1   the FF curve is drawn steeper than the LM curve in order to

emphasize that at this stage of the analysis we rule out private capital

flows.        This assumption is modified below.


     2This result follows from the fact that the horizontal shift of the FF

curve is larger than the corresonding shift of the IS curve since             DE/Dy <   1.


Both curves shift to the right since income must rise to offset the impact of

the fall in        r   on demand.


     3lnterest payments on government bonds outside of the central bank are

assumed to be financed by lump sum taxes so as to avoid issues associated with

changes in the government budget and disposable income.


     4me concept of the "natural distribution" is one of the central

propositions of the classical doctrine.             Accordingly, "A Nation cannot retain

more than its natural proportion of what is in the world, and the balance of

trade must run against it" [Gervaise (1720, p. 12)].             Similar statements were

made by Huine (1752, pp. 62—64), Ricardo (1821, p. 123) and Mill (1893, book

III, p. 194—95).           For further references see Frenkel (1976b) and Frenkel and

Johnson (1976a).

     5The loss of control over the money supply is central to the predictions

of the monetary   approach   to the balance of payments.    For examples see Johnson

(1958), Mundell (1968c, 1971), Mussa (1979).      This loss of control is, of

course, the key message of Hume's (1752) famous experiments of sudden anni-

hilation of four—fifths of the money supply.      For expositions of analyses of

the monetary mechanism of balance of payments adjustment see Ccllery (1971),

(1979) and Craig (1981).      On the role of government debt, future tax

liabilities, and the capital market see Metzler (1951), Mundell (1971) and

Barro (1974).

policies see Mussa (1976a), Johnson (1976b) and Hawtrey (1922).


     9For criticism of the restrictive assumptions see Chipman (1978), Hahn

(1977), Kreinin and Officer (1978), Tsiang (1977).         For a survey of the issues

see Whitman (1975).


     10This analysis of non-clearing of the labor market and gradual

adjustment of the domestic nominal wage rate can be extended to other markets
                                         79




and other prices.   Provided that the adjustment mechanisms that are assumed to

operate in these other markets are specified in a consistent manner, the

essential features of the monetary mechanism of balance of payments adjustment

are preserved.   The exact details of path of convergence of other variables,

however, are likely to be critically affected by the precise forms of these

adjustment mechanisms.

(1968), Swododa (1972).   on empirical aspects see Kouri and Porter (1974),

1974), Mundell (1971), Bergias (1974).


     13The level of income does not appear as a determinant of   M   in (3.36),

while it does in (3.12), only because the transformation curve determining the

economy's production possibilities for traded and nontraded goods has been

assumed fixed.

(1982).


          should be noted that when properly specified other approaches to

exchange rate determination would also yield reduced form equation like (4.10)

with money supplies, incomes, interest rates and relative prices appearing on

the right—hand side.     The virtue of the monetary approach in comparison with

the elasticities approach is in bringing these variables to the foreground

rather than leaving them in the "background".

       27For variety of additional models linking the exchange rate to the

current account see Niehans (1977), Rodriguez (1980), Dornbusch and Fischer

(1980), Mussa (1980, 1982), Kiinbrough (1980), Shafer (1980) and Frenkel and

Rodriguez (1982).


             is noteworthy that the shift of emphasis from flow consideration to

the requirement of stock equilibrium revived issues from the Bullionist

controversy of the early 1800's which led to the competing "Balance of

Payments Theory" and "Inflation Theory" of exchange rate determination; see

Ricardo (1811) and Viner (1937).     For an early modern formulation emphasizing

stock equilibrium see Black (1973).


       29See for example Mussa (1974) and Frenkel and Johnson (1976a); in the

context of flexible exchange rates the same argument is made by Dornbusch

(1976b) and Mussa (1976b).     It should be noted that the money demand—money

supply framework is not employed only for convenience; it reflects the

hypotheses   that money markets clear fast relative to goods markets, that the
demands for real balance are relatively stable and that the supply of nominal
balances is a policy instrument that is controlled by the monetary
authorities.

       30A number of empirical studies   have reported results that are consistent

with   the empirical regularities discussed in this paragraph; see, for example
Mussa (1979b), Frenkel (1981a, 1981b) and, in    particular, Chapter 19 by Levich
in   this volume.   The implications of these regularities for the general

approach to the theory of exchange rate determination are considered in Mussa

(1979b, 1984), Frenkel and Mussa (1980), Frenkel (1981b) and Mussa (1982).
                                           82



      31The present exposition of the "asset price" view of exchange rates

draws on that given in Frerikel and Mussa (1980), Frenkel (1981b) and Mussa

(1982, 1984).      Key elements of this view are also contained in Mussa

(1976b).       It is also relevant to note that while our exposition presents a

specific version of the "asset price" view of exchange rates, there are also

other versions that may be termed as "asset views"; see for example the

version of the portfolio balance model presented by Branson and Henderson in

Criapter 15 of this volume.


      32A value of 1/(1+a) equal to 1/100 means that an adjustment of about one

percent in the annual expected rate of change of the exchange rate will offset

a ten percent divergence between the current month's expected X and the

discounted sum of X's in all future months.


       33The   role of new information in inducing unexpected movements in
exchange rates is emphasized by Dornbusch       (1978), Frenkel (1981b), Frenkel and

Mussa (1980), and      Mussa (1976c, 1977, 197gb, 1980, and 1982).

       34The "traditional approach" is the textbook approach in which the

equilibrium exchange rate is determined by      the intersection of the flow demand
for   foreign exchange arising from trade transactions with the speculative
supply   of foreign exchange provided by capital holders who are prepared to

undertake risks in exchange for expected gains.       More sophisticated versions

of this approach are presented in the work of Black (1973), Stein (1980).         On

the interaction between the exchange rate and the current account see

Dornbusch and Fischer (1980), Rodriguez (1980), Mussa (1980, 1982), Sachs

(1981) and Frenkel and Rodriguez (1982).
                                              83




      35me model considered in this section is developed in greater detail in

 Mussa (1984).      Other models that emphasize the importance of real factors in

 determining the real exchange rate include those presented by Bruno and
                                                                         Sachs
 (1982), Buiter and Miller (1983), Neary and Purvis (1983), and Svennson
                                                                         and
 Razin (1983).


      36The equations of the present model
                                           are all assumed to be linear in the

levels or logarithms of the eridogenous and exogenous variables.         This

assumption allows for the explicit solution of the forward looking difference

equation system that constitutes the reduced form of the model.
                                                                         The

assumption that         >   0   implies that the Marshall—Lerner condition is

satisfied; an increase in the relative price of domestic goods, holding other

factors constant, worsens the current account.


     37me     c     schedule is frequently identified with the activities of

foreign exchange speculators.         From a theoretical perspective, however, there

is no good reason for such an identification; the c schedule represents

desired behavior of all economic agents with respect to acquisition of foreign

assets.    For further discussion of this point,      and of the meaning of the

"balance of payments equilibrium condition" represen.ted by equation (4.22),

see Mussa (1984).


     38Kouri (1976) develops the idea that the current exchange rate, which

depends primarily on the conditions of asset market equilibrium, affects the

current   account                              rate of change of foreign asset
                    balance which determines the

positions;   change of these asset positions, in turn, feedback through the
conditions   of asset market equilibrium to determine the rate of change of the

exchange rate.        similar view of the essential elements in the dynamic

interaction between the exchange rate and the current account is embodied in
                                            84



the   models developed by Branson (1977), Branson, Haltunen and Masson (1977),

Calvo and Rodriguez (1977), Dornbusch and Fischer (1980), Flood (1981),

Niehans (1977), and Rodriguez (1980).


       39me importance of these elements in understanding the dynamic behavior

of the real exchange rate and its relation to the current account is

emphasized in Mussa (1980).       The "accounting framework" for the analysis of

exchange rate dynamics developed by Dooley and Isard (1981) and Isard (1983)

also incorporates these elements.        Models developed by Marion (1981), Obstfeld

(1981), Sachs (1981), and Helpman and Razin (1983) consider the effect of

temporary expected disturbances in the current account of the behavior of the

exchange rate.


       40me analysis in this section is based on Mussa (1984).           A similar

approach to combining real and monetary factors in a model of the real and

nominal exchange rate is adopted by Bruno and Sachs (1981), Buiter and Miller

(1983) and Mussa (1977b).       A different approach for incorporating real and

monetary factors is motivated by a "finance constraint" (which is also being

refered to as the "Clower constraint") requiring goods to be purchased with

currency accumulated in advance of the period in which trade takes place; see

Stockman (1980), Helpman (1981) and Lucas (1982).


       41The   importance of   a risk premium in influencing   the   relationship

between the     domestic and the foreign nominal interest rate is analyzed by

Kouri (1976), Stockman (1978), Fama and Farber (1981), Hansen and Hodrich

(1980, 1983), Frankel (1982) and Frenkel and Razin (1980).            This risk premium

could be allowed to be a function of any of the variables that appear in the

money demand function (4.28) without significantly affecting the formal

analysis carried out in this section.
                                          85



         42   there is no real balance effect on desired spending and   if   their is
 no other source of non—neutrality (such as fixed nominal contracts or

 incomplete information about the behavior of nominal variables),
                                                                  then the
 model of the real exchange rate discussed in the preceding section
                                                                    operates
 independently of the behavior of the domestic money supply.    Even if these
 conditions are not satisfied (4.32) remains valid, but it is
                                                              necessary to
 consider the effect of the behavior of money supply and other nominal

 variables on real exchange rate and the stock of net foreign assets.


        43The reduced-form money market equilibrium
                                                    condition (4.30) is used in
Mussa (1976b) to derive the result (4.32).     The present analysis shows that
this reduced form is consistent with a fairly general model of goods and
                                                                         asset
market equilibrium.


        44For applications of these approaches to modelling macroeconomic

disequilibrium in an open economy setting see Flood (1979), Saidi (1980)
                                                                         and
Stocknian (1980).


        45Exchange rate overshooting in response to a permanent increase in the
money    supply, due to slowness in the adjustment of the domestic price level,
was initially considered by Dornbusch (1976c).
                                                  Generalizations of Dornbusch's
analysis have been considered by Wilson (1979), Rogoff (1979, Obstfeld (1981),

Mussa (1982), Bhandari (1982) and Frenicel and Rodriguez (1982).   For further
analysis and references to the literature on exchange rate dynamics see

chapter 18 by Obstfeld and Stockman in this Handbook.


     46Some of this work is included in Frenke]. (1983).
                                                           A detailed survey of
the empirical studies of exchange rates is provided by Levich in chapter 19
                                                                            of

forward rates are reported by Frenkel (1977, 1978, 1981b), Krugxnan (1977),

Cornell (1977), Hsieh (1982), Bilson (1981), Hakkio (1979), Hansen and Hodrick

(1980) and are surveyed by Levich (1979) and Kolhagen (1978); the relative

degree of volatility of spot and forward rates is analysed by Meese and

Singleton (1980) and Flood (1981).    This is a very partial list of

references.   For a more complete list see Chapter 19 by Levich in this
