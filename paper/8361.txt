1. Introduction

           Financial and economic news reporters frequently include interviews with or quotations

from economists that proclaim a connection between exchange rates and current accounts.

Most economists assert that a J-Curve phenomena characterizes the data: that currency

depreciation leads initially to current account deficits and subsequently to current account

surpluses. Actual empirical studies on this issue, however, have shown a very mixed set of

results.

           Krugman and Baldwin (1987) find evidence of a J-Curve with an initial phase of current

account deficits (following depreciation) that lasts about four quarters. Similarly, Foray and

McMillan (1999) present evidence of a J-Curve. Their VAR results for the U.S. and a European

aggregate, building on work by Eichenbaum and Evans (1995), indicate that a negative

monetary shock reduces real GDP for about 1-1/2 years, generates currency appreciation for

about half a year, and creates a trade balance surplus for about 1 1/2 years, followed by trade

deficits after that. This gives a typical J-Curve.

           On the other hand, Moffett (1989) finds no evidence for the J-Curve for the United

States. Similarly, Rose and Yellin (1989) find no reliable evidence of a J-Curve in 25 years of

American data; in fact they ‚Äúrobustly‚Äù reject the J-Curve hypothesis with U.S. data, finding ‚Äúno

convincing evidence that a currency depreciation causes a trade deficit in the short run either in

bilateral or aggregate U.S. data,‚Äù and ‚Äúlittle evidence of a reliable long run relationship between



                                                     2
the exchange rates and a trade balance.‚Äù

       Backus, Kehoe, and Kydland (1994) take a more general-equilibrium view of the

problem, pointing out that the relation depends critically on the source of fluctuations. Their

empirical results show that the trade balance is counter-cyclical and is generally negatively

correlated with current and future changes in the terms of trade, but positively correlated with

past changes in the terms of trade. Our statistical approach and empirical results complement

theirs and add to the theoretical challenge of finding a model (including sources of distrubances)

that can quantitatively reproduce the relations in the data.

       A standard theoretical explanation has emerged for the (alleged) J-Curve in the data. A

currency depreciation, in the presence of little or no offsetting changes in nominal price levels,

raises the relative price of imports to home buyers and reduces the relative price of home

exports to foreign buyers. In the short run, the quantity of goods imported and exported may be

largely predetermined by previously-signed trade contracts, so the fall in the value of a given

quantity of home exports creates a trade deficit (or smaller surplus). Once new trade contracts

are signed, the fall in the relative price of home goods raises the quantity of home goods

demanded, creating a tendency for a trade surplus. Domestic goods are cheaper, so foreigners

buy more of them and, with sufficiently high elasticities of demand, spend more on them. With

these elasticity conditions satisfied, changes in quantities traded overwhelm the changes in

valuations. Consequently, the currency depreciation leads to an eventual trade surplus. This fall

in the trade surplus, followed by a rise, naturally led to the J-Curve nomenclature.

       The usual approach focuses on a single source of exogenous disturbance: an

exogenous change in the exchange rate, given sluggish nominal prices, leads to changes in

quantities demanded and (with demand-determined quantities), trade flows and GDP. The

standard model also makes questionable assumptions about prices: it relies on an absence of

pricing-to-market (international price discrimination with nominal prices set in buyers‚Äô

currencies). Recent evidence has emphasized the importance of pricing to market in the data,


                                                 3
and a large set of recent theoretical work on exchange rates embodies that assumption. In

addition, the standard J-Curve model has implications for other variables, such as GDP. In that

model, a currency depreciation reduces the relative price of home products, leading to an

(eventual) increase in aggregate demand (by foreigners) for domestic products, eventually

raising exports and raising real GDP. Little empirical work has focused on this additional set of

predictions of the standard model.

         A small literature has developed exploring nonlinearities in exchange-rate data.1 Our

earlier paper, Leonard and Stockman (2000), tests the predictions of a wide class of theoretical

models by examining nonlinearities in the bivariate relationships between exchange rates and

cross-country ratios of GDP. We show that when a country's real GDP rises (relative to another

country) for a sustained period (at least 5 consecutive quarters), that country‚Äôs currency initially

depreciates in real terms, then appreciates significantly above its original level while GDP

remains temporarily high. While the initial response is consistent with the main theoretical

models, the subsequent response of the exchange rate contradicts those models.

         Our current paper employs a similar approach to study bivariate statistical relationships

between current accounts, exchange rates, and cross-country ratios of GDP. The paper differs

from previous empirical work on these issues because we use nonparametric methods to allow

for nonlinearities, employ a minimum of statistical assumptions, and focus on a fundamental

characterization of the data. We present new evidence on the connections between exchange

rates, the current account, and GDP. While the evidence we present loosely supports some

common beliefs about the data, it conflicts with some common theoretical models.

Consequently, our results pose new challenges for theory.

         Specifically, our results show weak evidence of a J-Curve. When a home country

exchange-rate mean reversion, and O'Connell and Wei (1997), Obstfeld sand Taylor (1997), and Michael, Nobay, and
Peel (1997).

experiences real depreciation against a foreign country for a sustained period (at least 5

consecutive quarters), the home country may initially experience a larger current account deficit

than ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù After a lag, however, it tends to experience a current account surplus. The

evidence of the subsequent surplus is stronger than the evidence of an initial deficit.

         Perhaps most interestingly, we find that the evidence is inconsistent with the standard

theoretical model of the J-Curve. Specifically, an increase in the relative current account tends

to be associated with a fall in relative GDP, even after a lag ‚Äì contradicting the implication of

the standard theoretical model that an increase in the current account surplus results from a rise

in foreign demand (due to home currency depreciation), which raises home GDP.

Consequently, our evidence supports the J-Curve in the data but not its common explanation.




2. Data and Normality Tests

         We examine quarterly data on current accounts, nominal exchange rates, consumer

price indexes, and real GDP over the time period 1974:1 to 1997:4, for 18 countries. All data

are taken from the International Financial Statistics CD-ROM and are seasonally adjusted.

         For each pair of countries, we calculate the real exchange rate q ‚â° ln(ep
                                                                                    * ) , the

ratio x ‚â° ln( y     ) . Then we remove means and linear trends in each series, resulting in series
                   y*

for the detrended real exchange rate, q , the detrended relative current account, ca , and

detrended relative (real) GDP, x .

         Nearly all previous empirical work involving the connections between these series relies

upon statistical techniques that assume these series are normally distributed (Gaussian).

Seldom, however, have researchers reported evidence on the appropriateness of that



                                                    5
assumption. We begin by examining the results of three standard statistical tests.

           First, the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality has good power and arguably provides the best

omnibus test for normality. Suppose y = ( y1 , y 2 ,..., y n ) ordered such that y1 < y 2 < ... < y n .

Define m' = (m1 , m 2 ,..., m n ) to be the vector of expected values of the standard normal order

statistics. Finally use an ordered random sample from a standard normal distribution

x1 < x 2 < ... < x n to calculate V = (vij ) where vij = cov( xi , x j ) . The Shapiro-Wilk test statistic

is then:


           W=
                  [‚àë     n
                             a y
                         i =1 i i
                                    ]
                                    2

                     i =1
                            ( yi ‚àí y) 2

where

                                            [
           a' = (a1 , a 2 ,..., a n ) = m'V ‚àí1 (m' V ‚àí1 )(V ‚àí1 m)   ]
                                                                    ‚àí1 / 2
                                                                             .

Tables of values for a‚Äô are readily available2.

           Second, we employ the Shapiro-Francia test, which is similar to the Shapiro-Wilk test

and has the same asymptotic distribution. Third, we perform tests based on skewness and

kurtosis, testing for normality based on the third and fourth moments of the empirical distribution

function.3

           Table 1 presents the results of the normality tests; the results cast strong doubt on the

assumption of normality. The skewness-kurtosis tests reject normality at the 5% level more

than 40% of the time for the real exchange rate, more than half the time for relative real GDP,

and more than 20% of the time for the relative current account. The Shapiro-Wilk tests reject

normality at the 5% level in more than half of the cases for the real exchange rate, almost two-

thirds of the cases for relative real GDP, and more than one-fourth of the time for the relative

current account. The Shapiro-Fancia tests reject normality at the 5% level in almost half of the

cases for the real exchange rate, more than half of the cases for relative real GDP, and 30% of

the time for the relative current account. Because this evidence casts considerable doubt on

the normality assumptions that underlie most analyses of exchange-rate data, the remainder of

the statistical tests in this paper are distribution-free.

3. Evidence Supports a ‚ÄúJ-Curve‚Äù

        Non-normal distributions are not the only factors complicating the statistical connection

between exchange rates and current accounts. In addition, transitory fluctuations can mask

longer-run statistical connections. Consequently, we study episodes in which a bilateral (two-

country) variable of interest exceeds its unconditional mean for at least five consecutive




                                                    7
quarters. This has three benefits. First, it involves time periods that are sufficiently long to

display J-Curves. Second, the time periods are long enough to capture any relevant business-

cycle phenomena. Third, it helps to avoid results based on small, transitory changes.

        Specifically, we define a real depreciation episode between nations A and B as a

sequence of at least five consecutive quarters {t1 , t2 , , tT } for which

q AB , s > 0 ‚àÄ s ‚àà {t1 , t2 , , tT } with T ‚â• 5 . For each bilateral pair of countries in our data set, we

test the null hypothesis that the probability distribution of the detrended relative current account,

ca , during a real-depreciation episode is the same as the probability distribution at other times.

        The J-Curve refers to a change in the current account over the duration of a depreciation

episode. Consequently, we test the null hypotheses that the probability distributions of ca in

various sub-periods of real-depreciation episodes are the same as at other times. We define

quarter t as belonging to the beginning of a real-depreciation episode if (i) that episode started

at t ‚àí 2, t ‚àí 1, or t , and (ii) t + 4 is in the same run. Similarly, we define quarter t as belonging

to the middle of a real-depreciation episode if t ‚àí 2 and t + 2 are in the same episode.

Similarly, we define quarter t as belonging to the end of a real-depreciation episode if (i) the

last quarter of the episode is t, t + 1, or t + 2 , and (ii) t ‚àí 4 is in the same episode.4 Finally, for

additional detail on sub-periods, we define quarter t as belonging to the beginning of the

middle of an episode if it is in the middle but either t ‚àí 3 or t ‚àí 4 (or both) is not in the middle of

the episode. Similarly, we define quarter t as belonging to the end of the middle of an

episode if it is in the middle but either t + 3 or t + 4 (or both) is not in the middle of the episode.

We apply two standard non-parametric tests, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and Komolgorov-

Smirnov tests, to examine the behavior of current accounts over the course of real-depreciation

        3a. Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Tests

        One method of evaluating whether two samples X and Y are drawn from the same

distribution is the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test. The test is based on the idea that if the distributions

from which the samples are drawn differ in their location parameters, then combining and

ordering the samples will yield ranks from one sample above the ranks from the other.

Formally, suppose the two populations have the same form, but the X

sample may be drawn from a distribution with a different central tendency or location than the

distribution producing the Y sample. Thus, we wish to test:



 H 0 : FY ( x) = FX ( x)         for all x
 H A : FY ( x) = FX ( x ‚àí Œ∏ )    for all x and some Œ∏


        Using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, we will accept the one-sided location alternative HA:

Œ∏<0 if the sum of the ranks of the X's is larger than some critical value. Thus, for an X sample of

size m and a Y sample of size n, the test statistic is:


                                               W N = ‚àëi =1 iDi
                                                        N




where m+n=N and Di=1 if the ith variable in the combined ordered arrangement is an X and Di

=0 if the ith variable is a Y.

        If the distribution is continuous so that there are no ties among the values in X and Y,

then under H0 the mean and variance and variance of W N are


                                   m( N + 1)                          mn( N + 1)
                       E[W N ] =                        var(W N ) =
                                       2                                 12


        For samples larger than 12, a normal approximation has been shown to be a practical

alternative to generating the exact small sample probability distribution of WN.

        One advantage of our bilateral approach over the standard VAR approach is that we

take account of changes in both countries in every bilateral pair. One disadvantage, perhaps, is

that our approach does not identify sources of shocks, or condition on such shocks as an

impulse-response function does. However, one can also regard this as an advantage of our

approach. We do not employ assumptions required for identification of shocks. Given the

questionable identifying assumptions often employed in time-series analysis of data that

presumably must be described by a general-equilibrium model, our approach provides evidence

on unconditional moments that pose challenges for theoretical models to explain.5



        3b. Komolgorov-Smirnov Tests

        While the Wilcoxon rank-sum test evaluates differences in the location of probability

distributions from which the two samples are drawn, other techniques can investigate whether

the forms of the probability distributions also differ. The Komolgorov-Smirnov two-sample test

determines whether two distribution functions associated with two samples are identical.

Specifically, we wish to test:



                             H 0 : FY ( x) = FX ( x)          for all x
                             H A : FY ( x) ‚â† FX ( x)           for some x


        To calculate the test statistic for two samples X and Y of sizes m and n drawn from

distributions FX (x) and FY (x) , order the variables in each sample as

                                          X 1 , X 2 ,..., X m and Y1 , Y2 ,..., Yn

  For example, results that condition on monetary shocks are highly questionable, given the difficulty of
identifying such shocks. Much VAR evidence, as in Sims (1995), suggests that monetary shocks do not
play a major role in explaining movements in real GDP. Consequently, there is room for suspicion that
they are a major force explaining changes in exchange rates and the current account. However, using
different identifying assumptions, other work such as Gali (1998) finds considerably larger roles for
monetary shocks.

        The test statistic then becomes


Tm , n = sup S x ( x) ‚àí S Y ( x)
          x




        The small sample distribution of Tm , n can be looked up in available tables. For larger


samples, the asymptotic distribution of             (               )
                                                        mn /(m + n) Tm , n is given by

                             ‚àû              2 2




        The Komolgorov-Smirnov can also be utilized to test the null hypothesis against the one

one-sided alternative:


    H A : FY ( x) ‚â§ FX ( x)             for all x
    H A : FY ( x) < FX ( x)             for some x


        The asymptotic distribution of the test statistic Tm , n now becomes

                             2
         L(t ) = 1 ‚àí e ‚àí2t




                  3c. Results: The Data Show a J Curve

                  Table 2 summarizes the results, for all bilateral pairs in our sample, of the

        Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and Komolgorov-Smirnov tests. It also presents summary

        statistics on the magnitudes of relative current accounts over the course of real-

        depreciation episodes. The first two rows of the table show the number of cases in our

        sample in which the relative current account between two countries shows a surplus

        (first row) or deficit (second row) during various sub-periods of real-depreciation

        episodes. At the beginning of a real-depreciation episode, 117 cases show relative

        current-account surpluses, while 148 show relative current-account deficits, indicating


                                                             12
that there is a slight tendency for current-account deficits when a country‚Äôs currency

initially depreciates. However, only slightly more than 10% of these cases show

statistically significant differences, at the 5% level, in the probability distributions of the

relative current account. Restricting attention to those statistically significant cases, a

current account surplus appears in 12 cases, and a current account deficit appears in 16

cases. The slight predominance of current account deficits at the beginnings of real-

depreciation episodes is (weakly) consistent with the first part of the J Curve.




                     INSERT TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE


        In contrast, countries tend to have current account surpluses around the ends of

depreciation episodes (shown in the last columns). At the end of a depreciation episode,

surpluses appear in 182 cases while deficits appear in only 78 cases. Restricting

attention to cases with statistically-significant differences at the 5% level, surpluses

appear in 44 cases while deficits appear in only 8 cases. This transition from an initial

current account deficit at the beginning of a depreciation episode, to a current account

surplus later in the episode has been recognized many times in the past, and has been

labeled the ‚ÄúJ Curve.‚Äù

        The other columns in the table show the transition from the slight tendency for

deficits at the beginnings of depreciation episodes to the stronger tendency for surpluses

at the ends of those episodes. The initial tendency for deficits vanishes quickly: by the

beginning of the middle of an episode, current account surpluses are more frequent than

deficits. In fact, by that time, statistically-significant cases of surpluses (15) outnumber

statistically-significant cases of deficits (8) by nearly two-to-one. Overall, during the

middle of the episode, one-third of the cases (94 of 271 bilateral country pairs) show

statistically significant current account surpluses at the 5% level.


                                           13
       The Komolgorov-Smirnov tests, in the middle rows of Table 2, show similar

results. At the beginning of a real-depreciation episode, 26 cases show relative current-

account surpluses that are statistically significant at the 10% level in one-sided tests,

while slightly more, 29 cases, show current-account deficits that are statistically

significant at the 10% level in one-sided tests. However, only about 13% of all cases (34

of 267 cases) show statistically significant differences, at the 10% level, in the probability

distributions of current accounts between depreciation episodes and other times (without

depreciation episodes). Consequently, the evidence that current account deficits

accompany the beginnings of depreciation episodes is fairly weak.

       The Komolgorov-Smirnov tests (like the Wilcoxon tests) show evidence of current

account surpluses at the ends of depreciation episodes. The last column in Table 2

shows 63 cases (about one-fourth of the 262 total) with statistically-significant surpluses

(in one-tailed tests, at the 10% level) at the ends of depreciation episodes, and only 19

cases of statistically-significant deficits (7 percent of the total). Overall, the evidence

shows a tendency for a J Curve, in the sense of a (slight) statistical tendency for current

account deficits when currencies initially depreciate, followed later by a (somewhat

stronger) tendency for current account surpluses.

       How large are these changes in current accounts? The bottom rows of Table 2

summarize the magnitudes. Recall that the relative current account equals the

detrended difference, between two countries, in the ratios of their (overall) current

accounts to their GDPs. The table shows that the median relative current account is -

.0002, or minus 2/100 of one percent of GDP at the beginning of a depreciation

episode, and rises to 4/100 of one percent of GDP by the middle of the episode and to

5/100 by the end of the episode. The last two rows of the table show that the 10th and

90th percentiles of the distribution are both rising along with the median. Clearly, the

magnitudes of changes in current accounts (as fractions of GDP) accounted for by


                                          14
       depreciation episodes are small. In summary, while the data show evidence of a J

       Curve, currency depreciation appears to explain only a small fraction of the variation of

       current accounts.



4. Evidence Rejects the Standard Explanation of the J-Curve

       3a. Real GDP and Current Accounts

       While the bilateral data on exchange rates and current accounts show a J-Curve pattern,

other data contradict the standard theoretical explanations of the J Curve. The standard

theoretical explanation of the J-Curve predicts that currency depreciation raises real GDP along

with the current account. By reducing the relative price of home products (to foreign products),

depreciation raising aggregate demand (by foreigners) for domestic products, thereby

increasing exports and GDP together. This relative-price change also leads the home country

to substitute away from imports toward domestically-produced goods, further raising the current-

account surplus, domestic aggregate demand, and domestic GDP. (Previously-signed

international-trade contracts may delay the responses of both GDP and the current account.) In

contrast, Table 3 presents evidence that current account surpluses are associated with

unusually low real GDP.

       Define a relative current-account surplus episode between nations A and B, in

analogy to the real depreciation episodes defined earlier, as a sequence of at least five

consecutive quarters for which the relative current account as a fraction of GDP, caAB, is

positive. Table 3 presents results, like those in Table 2, showing the behavior of relative real

GDP during relative current-account surplus episodes.

       The Wilcoxon rank-sum tests in Table 3 show that nations tend to have unusually low

GDP at the beginning of a current-account surplus episode; that the tendency for low real GDP

continues into the middle of the current-account surplus episode; and that GDP tends to return

to normal only near the end of the episode. At the beginning of a surplus episode, 201 cases


                                                15
(out of 260 bilateral nation-pairs studied) show lower-than-normal GDP, while only 59 cases

show higher-than-normal GDP. Restricting attention to cases that show statistically-significant

differences at the 5% level, 60 cases (nearly one-fourth of the total) show low GDP, while only 8

show high GDP. By the middle of the current-account surplus episode, real GDP is statistically-

significantly below normal (at the 5% level) in 38% of all cases (99 of 262 cases), and

significantly above normal in only 10% of the cases. 6 Only late in the surplus episode does real

GDP return to normal (with a slight tendency for above-normal GDP).




                             INSERT TABLE 3 ABOUT HERE


        The Komolgorov-Smirnov tests, in the middle rows of Table 3, show similar results. The

table reports the number of cases of high GDP and low GDP that are statistically significant at

the 10% level in one-sided tests. At the beginning of a surplus episode, 93 cases (more than1/3

of all cases) show significantly low GDP, while only 22 such cases show high GDP. These tests

also show that GDP tends to recover only near the end of a surplus episode. The bottom rows

of the table show that the magnitudes involved are sizable: median relative GDP is 1.3% below

trend at the beginning of a current-account surplus episode, 2.1% below trend by the beginning

of the middle of the episode, and finally rises above trend (by 0.4%) only at the ends of the

episodes. This tendency for low GDP to accompany current-account surpluses contrasts with

the standard J-Curve model in which changes in exchange rates drive a positive relation

between GDP and the current account.7



6
  "Normal" refers to time-periods outside episodes of current-account-surpluses (for each bilateral pair of
nations).
7
  The standard explanation of J Curve involves the conditional responses of real GDP and the current
account to a change in the exchange rate. In contrast, our evidence refers to the unconditional relation
between real GDP and the current account. Consequently, our evidence does not rule out the possibility
that the standard explanation of the J Curve correctly describes that conditional response, but that this
mechanism is only a minor factor affecting the overall relation between the current account and GDP.

                           INSERT TABLE 4 ABOUT HERE



       Table 4 presents additional evidence on the usual interpretation of the J Curve. It

reverses the roles of the variables in the previous table, and shows relative current accounts

during high relative GDP episodes. These episodes are defined (in analogy to the other

episodes studied above) as sequences of at least 5 consecutive quarters in which x , the log of

the ratio of detrended (and mean-adjusted) GDPs between two countries, exceeds zero. Table

4 shows that there is a slight tendency for current-account surpluses at the beginnings of high-

GDP episodes, but that current-account deficits begin emerging as the high-GDP episode

persists. The Wilcoxon tests show statistically-significant deficits, at the 5% level, in more than

40% of the cases (114 of 271 bilateral nation-pairs) by the middles of the high-GDP episodes.

The Komolgorov-Smirnov tests show statistically-significant deficits, at the 10% level, in almost

one-third of the cases (82 of 268 cases) by the ends of the high-GDP episodes.

       Tables 3 and 4 show that the (unconditional) relationship between the current and

account and real GDP differs substantially from the (conditional) prediction of standard J-Curve

models. High-GDP episodes tend to have current account surpluses initially, which then

become deficits; current-account surplus episodes tend to have low GDP both initially and

throughout the episodes, until those episodes are about to end. Notice that the relationship

between the current account and GDP is more subtle than implied by the common assertion

that the current account is countercyclical.



       3b. Real Exchange Rates during Surplus Episodes

       Table 5 shows the behavior of real exchange rates during episodes of relative-current-




                                                 17
account surpluses. Currencies tend to be depreciated at the beginning of a surplus episode. In

Wilcoxon tests at the 5% level, one-fifth of cases (54 of 259) show statistically-significant

depreciation at the beginnings, and one-third of cases (79 of 253) show statistically-significant

depreciation by the middles of the surplus episodes. However, a slight tendency for appreciated

currency emerges by the ends of the middles of the surplus episodes, with 15% of cases

showing significant appreciation in one-sided Wilcoxon tests at the 5% level, and 25% of cases

showing significant appreciation in one-sided Komolgorov-Smirnov tests at the 10% level. The

magnitudes of these changes in exchange rates are not trivial: the median real exchange rate

shows 2.8% depreciation (relative to normal) at the beginnings of current-account surplus

episodes. The tendency for subsequent appreciation results, by the end of current-account

surplus episodes, in a 5% change in the median real exchange rate, to a level that shows 2.2%

appreciation relative to normal.

4. Conclusions

       This paper ‚Äúgoes back to basics‚Äù in empirical analysis of the J-Curve. First, we

document strong violations in the distributional assumptions that underlie nearly all previous

work on this issue. Second, we employ distribution-free, non-parametric statistical tests to

characterize the data and summarize the key relationships between real exchange rates, the

current account, and real GDP. We find some (weak) evidence of a J-Curve in the data.

Interestingly, however, we document that this evidence is not consistent with the standard

theoretical explanation of the J-Curve. Consequently, our empirical results pose a strong

challenge for international economic theory.
