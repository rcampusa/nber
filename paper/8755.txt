                                              ABSTRACT


         Between 1960 and 1997, life expectancy at birth of Americans increased approximately 10%- -
from 69.7 to 76.5 years - and it has been estimated that the value of life extension during this period
nearly equaled the gains in tangible consumption. We investigate whether an aggregate health production
function can help to explain the substantial fluctuations in the rate of increase in longevity since 1960.
We view longevity as the output of the health production function, and output fluctuations as the
consequence of fluctuations in medical inputs (expenditure) and technology. We estimate longevity
models using annual U.S. time-series data on life expectancy, health expenditure, and medical
innovation. Reliable annual data are available for only one type of innovation - new drugs - but
pharmaceutical R&D accounts for a significant fraction of total biomedical research. The empirical
analysis provides strong support for the hypothesis that both medical innovation (in the form of new drug
approvals) and expenditure on medical care (especially public expenditure) contributed to longevity
increase during the period 1960-1997. The estimates imply that the medical expenditure needed to gain
one life-year is about $11,000, and that the pharmaceutical R&D expenditure needed to gain one life-year
is about $1,345. Previous researchers have estimated that the average value of a life-year is approximately
$150,000.

        Between 1960 and 1997, life expectancy at birth increased approximately 10%,
from 69.7 to 76.5 years. 1 Nordhaus (1999) estimates that the value of life extension
during this period nearly equaled the gains in tangible consumption. 2
        While life expectancy has tended to increase since 1960, as Figure 1 indicates,
there have been substantial fluctuations in the rate of increase. Life expectancy increased

1
  Life expectancy (ex )--the average number of years of life remaining for persons who have
attained a given age (x)--is the most frequently used life table statistic. Calculation of the
complete life table is derived from the probability of death (qx ), which depends on the number of
deaths (Dx ) and the midyear population (Px ) for each single year of age (x) observed during the
calendar year of interest. There are two types of life tables—the generation or cohort life table
and the current life table.
          The generation life table provides a ‘‘longitudinal’’ perspective in that it follows the
mortality experience of a particular cohort, all persons born in the year 1900, for example, from
the moment of birth through consecutive ages in successive calendar years. Based on age-specific
death rates observed through consecutive calendar years, the generation life table reflects the
mortality experience of an actual cohort from birth until no lives remain in the group. To prepare
just a single complete generation life table requires data over many years. It is not feasible to
construct generation life tables entirely on the basis of actual data for cohorts born in this century.
It is necessary to project data for the incomplete period for cohorts whose life spans are not yet
complete.
          The better-known current life table may, in contrast, be characterized as ‘‘cross-
sectional.’’ Unlike the generation life table, the current life table does not represent the mortality
experience of an actual cohort. Rather, the current life table considers a hypothetical cohort and
assumes that it is subject to the age-specific death rates observed for an actual population during a
particular period. Thus, for example, a current life table for 1997 assumes a hypothetical cohort
subject throughout its lifetime to the age-specific death rates prevailing for the actual population
in 1997. The current life table may thus be characterized as rendering a ‘‘snapshot’’ of current
mortality experience, and shows the long-range implications of a set of age-specific death rates
that prevailed in a given year. The life expectancy data analyzed in this paper are based on the
current life table, not on the generation life table.
          2
            Nordhaus (1999), along with Murphy and Topel (1999), offer parallel estimates of the
value of recent increases in longevity. To the casual observer it hardly seems possible – and may
seem morally offensive – to put a dollar value on human life. But modern economics has devised
a credible way around these imponderables, inferring the value people put on life from what they
must be “bribed” in everyday settings to incur small but predictable increases in the risk of death.
Let’s say that moving from a factory line to outdoor construction increases a worker’s chance of a
fatal accident by one in 10,000 each year. In other words, if 10,000 workers made the shift,
expected on-the-job fatalities would rise by one per year. Suppose further that to induce 10,000
workers to play this death lottery voluntarily, an employer would have to pay an extra $500
annually to each worker for a total of $5 million. One of these new construction workers is likely
to die in return for the group gaining $5 million. Thus the value of one life in this example is said
to be $5 million.
          Estimates from the dozen or so work-related studies since the mid-1970s put the value of
a statistical life in the relatively narrow $3 million-to-$7 million range. Using the relatively
conservative estimate of $3 million for the average value of avoiding one death to calculate the
value of extending life, Nordhaus estimates that in the 1975-1995 period the value of life
extension nearly equaled the gains in tangible consumption.
                                                                                                4


at an average annual rate of 0.25%; it increased more than 0.70% in 1961, 1974, and
1975, and declined more than 0.25% in 1963, 1968, 1980, and 1993. Measurement error
is unlikely to account for much of the fluctuations in life expectancy: as noted in
Anderson (1999, p. 34), “the annual life tables are based on a complete count of all
reported deaths,” and there are about 2 million deaths per year.
          Nor does growth in real per capita income (GDP) appear to offer a plausible
explanation for the increase in life expectancy. As Figure 2 indicates, the period in
which life expectancy increased most rapidly (1973-75) was a period of dismal
macroeconomic performance. Indeed, there is a significant negative correlation (p-value
= .04) between the annual rates of life expectancy increase and GDP increase.
          In this paper we investigate whether an aggregate health production function can
help to explain the annual time-series behavior of U.S. life expectancy since 1960. We
view life expectancy as the output of the health production function. In general,
production functions have two types of arguments: inputs and technology. Increases in
input result in movements along the production function. Improvements in technology
result in productivity increases, or shifts of the production function. 3
          We hypothesize that life expectancy in year t is a function of the stock of medical
innovations available in year t and the stock of of real per capita health expenditure in
year t, assumed to be a distributed- lag function of real per capita health expenditure in
year t – i (i = 0, 1, 2,…):

          LEt = f(EXP_STOCKt , INV_STOCKt ) + ut                                        (1)

where

LE = life expectancy at birth
EXP_STOCKt = Σ i = 0 (1 - δ1 )i EXPt-i = the “health expenditure stock”

EXP = real per capita health expenditure

δ1 = the “depreciation” rate of medical expenditure (0 < δ 1 <1)

    output = output * input = productivity * input, and productivity = f(technology).
              input
                                                                                                  5



INV_STOCKt = Σ i = 0 (1 - δ2 )i INVt-I = the “medical innovation stock”

INV = the number of innovations

δ2 = the “depreciation” (or obsolescence) rate of medical innovations (0 < δ 2 <1)4

u = disturbance. 5

        This specification imposes the restriction that the coefficients on lagged
innovations and expenditures decline geometrically with respect to time. As Greene
(1997, pp. 786-96) notes, estimation of the unrestricted finite distributed lag model is
likely to be ineffective because (1) the typical time series is fairly short, so the
unrestricted model will consume an excessive number of degrees of freedom, and (2)
multicollinearity is likely to be quite severe. These considerations have led researchers to
formulate compact parametric models that allow infinite lags, but require only a small
number of parameters. The geometric lag model is a common choice. This model
incorporates infinite lags but assigns arbitrarily small weights to the distant past.
        If equation (1) were linear (LEt = α + β1 EXP_STOCKt + β2 INV_STOCKt + ut ),
and the innovation and expenditure depreciation rates were identical (δ 1 = δ2 = δ), then
one could reformulate equation (1) in autoregressive form as follows6 :

LEt = αδ + (1 - δ) LEt-1 + β1 EXPt + β2 INVt + vt                                          (2)

where vt = ut - (1 - δ) ut-1 . The regression of life expectancy on its own lagged value,
current health expenditure, and the current flow of innovations, will yield estimates of the
parame ters δ, β1 , and β2 . From these one can estimate both the short-run and long-run
impacts on longevity of changes in health expenditure and innovation flows. For

4
   Whether or not medical innovations are subject to depreciation or obsolescence (i.e., whether δ 2
> 0) is an issue discussed below.
5
   In our empirical analysis, we also include per capita income (GDP) and a time trend as control
variables. Unfortunately, annual data on other determinants of longevity, such as smoking,
obesity, and air quality, are not available, but (unlike innovation and health expenditure) these
variables are unlikely to exhibit substantial high-frequency fluctuations, so inclusion of GDP and
time trend should control for their influence.
6
  If the disturbances of eq. (1) are serially independent, the disturbances of eq. (2) are serially
dependent, which has implications for the estimation procedure. When δ 1 ≠ δ2 , the autoregressive
equation also includes LEt-2 , EXP t-1 , and INVt-1 as regressors. See Johnston (1984, p. 347).
                                                                                                6


example, the longevity impact of a sustained unit increase in the number of innovations is
(β2 / δ).
        We don’t really believe that longevity is a linear function of the expenditure and
innovation stocks. It seems more likely that these stocks have diminishing marginal
effects on longevity, i.e. that the relationship is log- linear. However if one specifies eq.
(1) to be log-linear, due to the linear form of the accumulation equations one can no
longer derive a simple autoregressive equation like eq. (2). The theoretically more
appropriate functional form does not yield a tractable estimating equation.
        Instead of estimating eq.(2) using data on the levels of the variables LE, EXP, and
INV, we will estimate it using data on the logarithms of these variables. In this setting,
β2 is the short-run elasticity of longevity with respect to innovation, and (β 2 / δ) is the
long-run elasticity.


Data


        Estimation of the longevity model (2) requires data on health expenditure and
medical innovation as well as on life expectancy. We were able to find annual U.S. time-
series data on each of these variables for the period 1960-1997. We describe the sources
and properties of the data below.
        Longevity. Annual data on life expectancy at birth are given in Anderson (1999,
Table 12). That publication also provides data on life expectancy at ages greater than 0
(1, 5, 10, 15,…,100), but only at decennial frequency. Of course, changes in life
expectancy at ages greater than zero are reflected, to varying degrees, in changes in life
expectancy at birth. Figure 3 reveals that during the sample period, movements in life
expectancy at birth tracked those in life expectancy at age 40 very closely.
        Anderson (1999, Table 12) also provides annual data on life expectancy at birth,
by race (white vs. black). Figure 4 shows data on the life expectancy of blacks at birth as
a percent of the life expectancy of whites at birth. On average, white longevity is about
10% greater. The relative longevity of blacks tended to decline from 1960 to 1970,
increased steadily from 1970 to its peak in 1982, declined steadily from 1982 to 1989,
                                                                                                 7


and increased slightly since then. In addition to estimating an overall longevity model,
we will estimate separate models, by race.
        Health expenditure . Annual data for 1960-97 on national health expenditures, in
current dollars, by source of funds (public vs. private) are produced by the National
Health Statistics Group, Office of the Actuary, Health Care Financing Administration.
To obtain per capita expenditures in constant dollars, we deflated these figures using the
BLS consumer price index for medical care (U.S. city average, base period: 1982-
84=100, Series ID: CUSR0000SAM) and divided by the population.
        Real public and private health expenditure per are shown in Figure 5. Public and
private health expenditure exhibited different, sometimes opposite, behavior during the
1960-97 period. Between 1965 and 1967, there was a 64% increase in real per capita
public health expenditure, due to the establishment of the Medicare 7 and Medicaid 8
programs. For each $100 increase in public spending, there was about a $39 reduction in
private spending. The government’s share of national health expenditure increased from
under 25% to over 37% in two years. Public spending also increased more than private

  As part of the Social Security Amendments of 1965, Title XVIII of the Social Security Act
established a health insurance program, commonly known as "Medicare", for persons 65 and
over, to complement the retirement, survivors and disability insurance benefits under Title II of
the Act. Medicare was first implemented in 1966, and by the end of that year, 3.7 million persons
had received at least some health care services covered by Medicare. Today Medicare is the
nation's largest health insurance program, covering approximately 39 million Americans.
Medicare consists of two primary parts: Hospital Insurance (HI), also known as "Part A," and
Supplementary Medical insurance (SMI), also known as "Part B”. In 1973, other groups became
eligible for Medicare benefits: persons who are entitled to Social Security or Railroad Retirement
disability benefits for at least 24 months; persons with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring
continuing dialysis or kidney transplant; and certain otherwise non-covered aged persons who
elect to buy into Medicare.

  Title XIX of the Social Security Act established a program which provides medical assistance
for certain individuals and families with low incomes and resources. The program, known as
Medicaid, became law in 1965 as a jointly funded cooperative venture between the Federal and
State governments to assist States in the provision of adequate medical care to eligible needy
persons. Medicaid is the largest program providing medical and health-related services to
America's poorest people.
                                                                                                     8


spending since 1967; by 1997, the government was financing almost half (46.2%) of
national health expenditure. 9
        The share of health expenditure that is publicly funded varies across demographic
groups. Data from the 1996 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey indicate that the fraction
of health expenditure that was publicly funded was 32.4% for whites and 50.3% for
blacks. Virtually all of this difference was due to a difference in the proportion of
expenditures paid for by Medicaid: 6.8% for whites and 24.7% for blacks.
        As noted above, we can estimate the longevity model (eq. (2)), by race; we can
also disaggregate the expenditure variable EXP into its public and private components:


LEt = αδ + (1 - δ) LEt-1 + β1G EXP_Gt + β 1P EXP_Pt + β2 INVt + vt                         (3)


where EXP_G = government- funded health expenditure and EXP_P = privately- funded
health expenditure. Given the greater relative importance of publicly- funded health
expenditure to blacks, one would expect the ratio (β 1G / β1P ) to be larger in the black
longevity equation than it is in the white longevity equation.
        We recognize that causality between longevity and average medical expenditure
is likely to run in both directions. In any given year, old people tend to spend more on
medical care than young people. Figure 6 illustrates this tendency using cross-sectional
data from the 1977 National Medical Care Expenditure Survey. In 1977, the average 75-
84 year-old spent 27% more than the average 65-74 year old; the average 85+ year-old
spent 62% more than the average 65-74 year old. 10 As life expectancy increases, the
average age of the population (and the proportion above a high age such as 65) increases,
so per capita medical expenditure increases. 11 To ensure that we are measuring the effect
of expenditure on longevity rather than the effect of longevity (age) on expenditure, we

outcomes of the elderly.
10
   Moreover, the age/medical expenditure profile was steeper in 1996 than it was in 1977.
11
   However, the aging of the population accounts for a very small fraction of the total observed
increase in per capita medical expenditure.
                                                                                                 9


will include only previous health expenditure on the right-hand side of the longevity
equation. 12
        Medical innovation. There are many kinds of medical innovations, including
new drugs, medical devices, and surgical and diagnostic procedures. However drugs is
the only type of innovation for which reliable annual data are available. We obtained
from the FDA a list of all new molecular entities (NMEs) approved during the period
1950-1993. Using data posted on the FDA website, we were able to extend the coverage
of this list to the period 1950-1999.
        Although new drugs represent only one type of medical innovation,
pharmaceutical R&D accounts for a significant fraction of total biomedical research. 13 In
1993, pharmaceutical industry R&D accounted for 61.3% of industry-funded health
R&D, and for 31.0% of total health R&D. Moreover, new drugs are usually thought to
embody knowledge generated by both publicly- and privately- funded research.
        If the rate of introduction of new drugs were very stable from year to year, it
would be hard to discern the effect of pharmaceutical innovation on outcomes and
expenditure. In practice, however, as Figure 7 indicates, the innovation rate fluctuates
considerably. Part of this is due to the inherent randomness of the drug development and
approval process. But major changes in government policy also clearly influence the
number of new drugs approved. Policy- induced and other changes in the rate of new
drug approval facilitate statistical inference about the impact of pharmaceutical
innovation (and the policies themselves) on longevity. We will briefly describe four such
policy changes.
        1962 Kefauver-Harris Amendment. As a result of the thalidomide tragedy, in
1962, Congress passed the Kefauver-Harris Amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act (FDCA), which required extensive animal pharmacological and
toxicological testing before a drug could be tested in humans. The data from these studies
must be submitted in the form of an IND ("Notice of Claimed Investigational Exemption

12
   Since this equation also includes lagged longevity, significance of the lagged expenditure term
would allow us to reject the null hypothesis that expenditure does not Granger-cause longevity.

for a New Drug") and approved by the FDA before clinical studies can begin. The
amendment also required that manufacturers submit to the FDA "substantial evidence" of
the unapproved (investigational) drug's efficacy, as well as safety, in the form of an NDA
(“New Drug Application”). Therefore, in addition to safety, the manufacturer was now
required to demonstrate efficacy (effectiveness), as well. 14 Passage of this amendment
appears to have led to a significant, roughly 10-year decline in the number of new drugs
approved.
        Title XVIII of the Social Security Amendments of 1965 (Medicare). Although
Medicare does not pay for most prescription drugs, Medicare Part B (Supplementary
Medical insurance) pays part of the cost of a service that is complementary with
(necessary to receive) prescription drugs: doctor visits. 15 The data shown in Figure 8
suggests that Medicare had a significant effect on utilization of ambulatory care by the
elderly. Between 1964—immediately before Medicare was established—and 1990, the
probability that a person over 65 had not seen a doctor in the last two years declined from
21.0% to 8.0%. The corresponding probability for people under 65 (who are generally
not covered by Medicare) also declined, but by much less.
        Title XIX of the Social Security Amendments of 1965 (Medicaid).
Prescription drugs are covered under Medicaid. In 1964, less than 4% of national
expenditure on prescription drugs was publicly funded. In 1998, over 20% was publicly
funded, and the Medicaid program accounted for over 80% of this funding.
        1992 Prescription Drug User Fee Act. This act caused a (temporary) increase in
drug approvals due to a 60% reduction in mean drug approval times.
        Recall that the stock of medical innovations was defined as a weighted sum of
past innovations (INV_STOCKt = Σ i = 0 (1 - δ2 )i INVt-i), where the weights depend on the
“depreciation” (or obsolescence) rate of medical innovations, δ 2 . In principle, the


14
   "Substantial evidence" is defined by Section 505 of the FD&C Act as “evidence consisting of
adequate and well-controlled investigations, including clinical investigations, by experts qualified
by scientific training and experience to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug involved, on the
basis of which it could be fairly and responsibly concluded by such experts that the drug will
have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed,
recommended, or suggested in the labeling thereof.” FDCA [505(d)].
15
    At least one prescription drug is prescribed in about 60% of doctor visits; this percentage is
even higher for the Medicare population.
                                                                                           11


depreciation rate might be zero, so that INV_STOCKt = Σ i = 0 INVt-i: the innovation stock
is the unweighted sum of all past innovations. According to that hypothesis, longevity in
year t would depend on the number of drugs ever approved up until year t (regardless of
when they were approved).
          We have evidence, however, that casts doubt on the hypothesis of zero
depreciation. As mentioned above, the FDA provided us with a list of all drugs (new
molecular entities) approved since 1950. We also have a comprehensive database
(Multum’s Lexicon16 ) of all drugs marketed in 1999. By comparing these two lists, we
can determine how many drugs approved in each year beginning in 1950 were no longer
being marketed in 1999. As Figure 9 reveals, about 20% of the drugs approved during
1950-93 were no longer on the market in 1999. The earlier the drug was approved, the
lower the probability of being on the market in 1999: 28.6% of drugs approved in the
1950s had disappeared by 1999.
          If the eventual disappearance of drugs from the market were inevitable—if it
occurred regardless of the pace of subsequent innovation—then the fact that obsolescence
occurs implies that a temporary increase in the number of innovations would have only a
temporary impact on longevity. A permanent increase in the number of new drugs
approved would be required to achieve a permanent longevity increase. However
evidence presented in Lichtenberg and Philipson (2001) suggests that a drug’s eventual
disappearance (or the decline of its sales as it ages) is not automatic or exogenous, but is
the result of “creative destruction”: the entry of new, superior, products. Changes in the
number of innovations will affect the obsolescence rate. Consequently, a temporary
increase in the number of innovations could perhaps have a permanent impact on
longevity.

     The underlying data are presented in Appendix Table 1.
                                                                                                   12


variables are expressed in natural logarithms, and all equations are estimated with a
correction for first-order serial correlation of disturbances.
        The first column presents estimates of the most basic model, the regression of life
expectancy at birth in year t (le) on its own lagged value (le -1 ), the number of new
molecular entities approved in year t (nme), and real per capita health expenditure in year
t (exp). The coefficients on nme and exp are positive and highly statistically significant,
which suggests that longevity is positively affected by current and lagged drug approvals
and health expenditure.
        To guard against the possibility that the positive partial correlation between
longevity and health expenditure may be due to the effect of the former on the latter,
rather than the reverse, in column (2) we substitute lagged health expenditure for current
health expenditure. 18 This substitution has very little effect on the estimates (it actually
increases the expenditure coefficient by about 10%), which seems to cast doubt on the
reverse-causality hypothesis.
        In column (3), we include two additional variables as “controls”: a time trend, and
real per capita income (GDP). Neither of these variables has statistically significant
effects on longevity, and their inclusion scarcely changes the innovation and health
expenditure coefficients.
        In column (4), we disaggregate total health expenditure per person into its two
components, public and private health expenditure per person (exp_g and exp_p,
respectively). If the longevity effect of an additional dollar of public health expenditure
were the same as that of an additional dollar of private expenditure, the ratio of the exp_g
coefficient to the exp_p coefficient should be equal to the average ratio of public to
private expenditure, which is about 61%. The ratio of these two coefficients is higher
than this—79%. This suggests that public health expenditure has a higher marginal effect
on longevity than private health expenditure. The difference between these two ratios is
not statistically significant, however.
        Although the point estimate of the exp_p coefficient is larger than that of the
exp_g coefficient, only the latter is statistically significantly different from zero. Thus,


18
  This specification corresponds to the hypothesis that current longevity depends on last year’s
accumulated stock of health expenditure.
                                                                                               13


the estimates provide strong evidence against the null hypothesis that public health
expenditure has no effect on longevity, but not against the null hypothesis that private
health expenditure has no effect on longevity.
        The exp_g coefficient is estimated much more precisely than the exp_p
coefficient (the standard error of the former is only 29% as large as that of the latter)
because public health expenditure exhibited much greater variability during the sample
period than private health expenditure. The standard deviation of the growth rate of
public health expenditure was 1.7 times as great, and whereas private health expenditure
growth ranged between –7% to +8%, public health expenditure growth ranged from –2%
to +25%.
        Annual growth in the number of new drugs approved exhibited even greater
volatility than growth in public health expenditure: the standard deviation of the growth
rate of the number of new drugs approved was over 7 times as great as the standard
deviation of private health expenditure growth. This volatility (relatively low serial
correlation) of drug approvals suggests that it might be feasible to relax the assumption of
strictly geometric decay of coefficients on lagged drug approvals, by including lagged as
well as current values of nme in the model. Column (5) displays an equation including
nme-1 as well as nme. Both coefficients are highly statistically significant, and their
magnitudes indicate that a new drug approval in year t has about the same impact on
longevity in year t+1 as it has on longevity in year t. 19 However inclusion of nme-1 has
virtually no effect on the estimate of the long-run elasticity of longevity with respect to
new drug approvals, which is about .036.
        The low serial correlation of new drug approvals also provides us with the
opportunity to investigate the direction of causality between approvals and longevity. In
column (6) we include the number of drugs approved in year t+1 in the year-t longevity
equation. If the coefficient on this variable were positive and significant, this would
suggest that (for some reason) increases in longevity this year cause more drugs to be
approved next year, rather than the reverse. But the coefficient on nme+1 , in contrast to



19
  When additional lagged values of nme (nme -2 , nme-3 ,…) are included, the coefficients on them
are not statistically significant.
                                                                                              14


those on nme and nme-1 , is not significantly different from zero, suggesting that causality
runs in only one direction, from new drug approvals to longevity. 20
        All of the estimates presented so far have been of models of longevity of the
entire population, i.e. of whites and blacks. In the last two columns of Table 2, we report
estimates of longevity models estimated separately, by race. The new drug approvals
coefficient is highly statistically significant in both equations, indicating that the
longevity of both races is increased by pharmaceutical innovation. The estimated long-
run elasticity of longevity with respect to new drugs approved is almost three times as
large for blacks as it is for whites, a result we did not expect and do not, at present, have
an explanation for. Another (possibly related) puzzle is the significant negative
coefficient on the time trend in the black longevity equation. This implies that, in the
absence of health expenditure growth and new drug approvals, black longevity would
have declined during this period.
        The point estimates of the private health expenditure coefficient are almost
identical in the white and black longevity equations, but the coefficient is statistically
significant only in the former equation. Thus, we can reject the null hypothesis that
privately- funded health expenditure does not affect longevity in the case of whites, but
not in the case of blacks. The public health expenditure coefficient is significant in both
equations, but its magnitude is over twice as large in the black longevity equation as it is
in the white longevity equation. This is not surprising, given the fact that the proportion
of health expenditures that are publicly funded is larger for blacks than it is for whites.
Indeed, as Figure 10 shows, for both races the ratio of the exp_g coefficient to the exp_p
coefficient is very close to the 1996 ratio of public to private expenditure. This is
consistent with the hypothesis that, for both races, the longevity effect of an additional
dollar of public health expenditure is similar to that of an additional dollar of private
expenditure.

20
   Granger causality testing within a vector autoregression (VAR) framework yields the same
conclusion. When the growth rates of le and nme are both regressed on the first three lagged
growth rates of both variables, the null hypothesis that nme does not Granger-cause le is easily
rejected (p-value = .02), but the null hypothesis that le does not Granger-cause nme cannot be
rejected (p-value = .93). Similar results are obtained when the VAR includes health expenditure
growth and gdp growth. I am grateful to Charles Himmelberg for helping me with the VAR
analysis.
                                                                                            15


       We think that the preceding analysis provides strong support for the hypothesis
that both medical innovation (in the form of new drug approvals) and expenditure on
medical care (especially public expenditure) contributed to longevity increase during the
period 1960-1997. Now we will use these estimates to calculate the “bang per buck”, or
its inverse: the medical care expenditure or pharmaceutical R&D expenditure per life-
year gained.
       These calculations are summarized in Table 3. Medical care expenditure per life-
year gained is calculated in the first column. The starting point is the long-run elasticity
of longevity with respect to total health expenditure, estimated in column (3) of Table 2
to be .0906. This means that a permanent 1% increase in per capita health expenditure
would lead to a .0906% increase in life expectancy at birth. The sample mean value of
per capita health expenditure is $1306 (in 1982-84 dollars), and the sample mean value of
life expectancy is 73.1 years. Evaluating the elasticity at the sample mean implies that a
permanent $1 increase in per capita health expenditure would increase life expectancy at
birth by .0051 years (1.9 days). There are approximately 4 million Americans born each
year, so the total number of life- years gained per year from a permanent $1 increase in
per capita health expenditure is 20,274. The annual cost of a permanent $1 increase in
per capita health expenditure is $1 times the U.S. population, which averaged about 224
million during the sample period. Hence the cost of medical care per life- year gained is
about $11,000.
       In the second column, we calculate pharmaceutical R&D expenditure per life-year
gained. The long-run elasticity of longevity with respect to the number of new drugs
approved is estimated in column (3) of Table 2 to be .0265. The sample mean number of
drugs approved per year is 20.8. Evaluating the elasticity at the sample mean implies
that, if one additional drug were approved every year, life expectancy at birth would
increase by .093 years (just over a month). The total number of life- years gained per year
from a permanent unit increase in new drug approvals is about 372 thousand. The
average cost of obtaining FDA approval of a new drug is generally thought to be in the
neighborhood of $500 million. Hence we estimate pharmaceutical R&D expenditure per
life- year gained to be about $1345.
                                                                                            16


         This suggests that increased development of new drugs may be a more cost-
effective way of increasing life expectancy than increased medical expenditure in
general: pharmaceut ical R&D expenditure per life- year gained is about one eighth of the
cost of medical care per life- year gained. Although overall medical care appears to be
less cost-effective, recent research by Nordhaus and by Topel and Murphy suggests that
the benefits to it greatly exceed the costs. They estimate that the average value of a life-
year is approximately $150,000. This figure implies that the benefit-cost ratio of general
medical expenditure is 13.6, and that the ratio for pharmaceutical R&D is over 100!
(111.5).


Conclusions


         Between 1960 and 1997, life expectancy at birth increased approximately 10%,
from 69.7 to 76.5 years. Nordhaus (1999) estimates that the value of life extension
during this period nearly equaled the gains in tangible consumption.
         While life expectancy has tended to increase since 1960, there have been
substantial fluctuations in the rate of increase. In this paper we investigate whether an
aggregate health production function can help to explain the annual time-series behavior
of U.S. life expectancy since 1960. We view life expectancy as the output of the health
production function. In general, production functions have two types of arguments--
inputs and technology—and output fluctuations are attributable to fluctuations in both of
these.
         We estimate the longevity model using annual U.S. time-series data on life
expectancy, health expenditure, and medical innovation for the period 1960-1997.
Reliable annual data are available for only one type of innovation: new drugs. Although
new drugs represent only one type of medical innovation, pharmaceutical R&D accounts
for a significant fraction of total biomedical research. In 1993, pharmaceutical industry
R&D accounted for 61.3% of industry- funded health R&D, and for 31.0% of total health
R&D.
         The empirical analysis provides strong support for the hypothesis that both
medical innovation (in the form of new drug approvals) and expenditure on medical care
                                                                                              17


(especially public expenditure) contributed to longevity increase during the period 1960-
1997. The estimates provide strong evidence against the null hypothesis that public
health expenditure has no effect on longevity, but not against the null hypothesis that
private health expenditure has no effect on longevity. This is at least partly attributable to
the fact that public health expenditure exhibited much greater variability during the
sample period than private health expenditure. The longevity of both races was increased
by pharmaceutical innovation.
       The cost of medical care per life-year gained is about $11,000. We estimate
pharmaceutical R&D expenditure per life-year gained to be about $1345. This suggests
that increased development of new drugs may be a more cost-effective way of increasing
life expectancy than increased medical expenditure in general: pharmaceutical R&D
expenditure per life- year gained is about one eighth of the cost of medical care per life-
year gained. Topel and Murphy estimate that the average value of a life- year is
approximately $150,000. This figure implies that the benefit-cost ratio of general
medical expenditure is 13.6, and that the ratio for pharmaceutical R&D exceeds 100.
