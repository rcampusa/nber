                                        ABSTRACT

We develop a structural model for bounding welfare effects of policies that alter the design of
differentiated product markets when some consumers may be misinformed about product
characteristics and inertia in consumer behavior reflects a mixture of latent preferences,
information costs, switching costs and psychological biases. We use the model to analyze three
proposals to redesign markets for Medicare prescription drug insurance: (1) reducing the number
of plans, (2) providing personalized information, and (3) defaulting consumers to cheap plans.
First we combine administrative and survey data to determine which consumers make informed
enrollment decisions. Then we analyze the welfare effects of each proposal, using revealed
preferences of informed consumers to proxy for concealed preferences of misinformed
consumers. Results suggest that each policy produces large gains and losses for some consumers,
but the menu reduction would unambiguously harm most consumers whereas personalized
information would unambiguously benefit most consumers.

One of the frontiers in empirical microeconomics is to assess the equity and efficiency of
polices that alter a market’s design and “nudge” consumers toward making certain deci-
sions. Thaler and Sunstein (2008) denoted this approach to policy as “choice architecture”.
Examples of choice architecture include restricting the number of differentiated products
in a market, providing consumers with personalized information about their options, and
making default choices for consumers but letting them opt out. Numerous government or-
ganizations including the United States and the World Bank have begun using choice ar-
chitecture to nudge the beneficiaries of public programs.
  A stated goal of choice architecture is to benefit consumers who do not make fully in-
formed decisions. Such paternalistic policies may also harm some consumers by eliminat-
ing their preferred products, by making it harder to buy those products, and by causing
prices to increase. Despite the potential for important and heterogeneous effects, little work
has predicted the distribution of gains and losses of prospective choice architecture poli-
cies. To do so within a revealed-preference framework requires addressing two challenges.
First, analysts must identify which decisions are misinformed and hence potentially mis-
leading about consumer preferences. Second, analysts must infer the preferences of both
informed and misinformed consumers. In this article, we develop an empirical framework
to address both challenges and use it to evaluate policies that have been proposed to nudge
consumer decision making in health insurance markets.
  We operationalize Bernheim and Rangel’s (2009) conceptual logic for policy analysis
in the presence of latent constraints that undermine revealed preference logic for some
consumers. We envision consumers facing differentiated costs of acquiring information
about their choice sets so that some consumers may choose to purchase products without
becoming fully informed. Analysts often observe the characteristics of consumers, their
choices and their choice sets but typically do not observe how consumers form beliefs or
make decisions. In our context, we observe signals about whether each decision was made
by an informed consumer. First, we have access to the results of survey-based tests of con-
sumers’ knowledge about the products they are choosing. Second, we observe each per-
son’s full menu of choices, their actual choice outcomes, and the counterfactual outcomes



                                                                                            1
under each option available to them. With this information, we develop signals of whether
the choices reveal or conceal preferences, such as whether their survey responses indicate
comprehension of key market institutions and whether their choices are consistent with
axioms of consumer theory. We examine how these signals correspond to proxies for being
informed, such as the presence of Alzheimer’s disease, educational levels, and self-re-
ported efforts to gather information. We use these signals to identify the subset of choices
that we suspect may fail to reveal preferences. We show that welfare analysis is possible
in this setting if the mapping between preferences and consumer demographics is stable
across the groups of consumers making “suspect” and “non-suspect” choices.1 Under this
stability assumption, we estimate a repeated choice multinomial logit model that incorpo-
rates heterogeneity on observed consumer attributes and we derive welfare measures that
characterize how heterogeneous consumers are affected by choice architecture policies.
Our measures are consistent with the idea that consumer inertia may arise from a latent
mixture of preferences, information costs, switching costs, and psychological biases. In the
special case where all consumers are fully informed, freely mobile and immune to biases,
our welfare measures reduce to those derived by Small and Rosen (1981).
    We use our model to study financial decisions among elderly Medicare beneficiaries in
the US. The elderly population is particularly important because they control a large share
of wealth and frequently experience declines in cognitive function (Querfurth and LaFerla,
2010, Fang, Silverman and Keane 2008, Agarwal et al. 2009, Keane and Thorp 2016). We
analyze their choices in markets for Medicare standalone prescription drug insurance plans.
In 2015, these government-designed, taxpayer-subsidized markets annually enrolled 25
million older adults with federal outlays of $75 billion (US Department of Health and Hu-
man Services 2017). Beneficiaries’ enrollment decisions are multifaceted and financially
important. Between 2006 and 2010, the average new enrollee chose among 50 plans that
differed in cost, risk protection and quality. Returning enrollees were automatically reas-
signed to their previously chosen plans unless they opted to switch plans during the annual


1
  The “suspect / non-suspect” terminology is borrowed from Bernheim and Rangel (2009). This language emphasizes that it is virtually
impossible for analysts to determine beyond a doubt whether a consumer is fully informed at the time of her decision. Our framework
requires only that non-suspect choices be fully informed. Suspect choices may or may not be fully informed.



                                                                                                                                  2
open enrollment window. The median enrollee spent approximately 6% of her annual
household income on premiums and out-of-pocket costs.
   Due to concerns about expenditure levels, market complexity and consumer inertia, re-
searchers and federal agencies have proposed several reforms to prescription drug insur-
ance markets (McFadden 2006, Thaler and Sunstein 2008, Federal Register 2014). These
include reducing the number of plans, providing consumers with personalized information
about their options, and auto-assigning people to default plans that are expected to mini-
mize cost. We assess the welfare effects of these proposals by combining administrative
records and survey data on a national panel of enrollees from 2006-2010. Specifically we
link the longitudinal Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) to administrative rec-
ords of the respondents’ annual enrollment decisions, drug claims, and medical conditions.
This novel linkage allows us to combine information on enrollees’ efforts to learn about
the market, their knowledge of how products differ, whether they self-enrolled in plans or
had help from advisors, their demographics, their choices and their choice outcomes, and
their health, including their prescription drug utilization.
   We capitalize on the depth and breadth of these linked data to develop several signals
of consumers’ knowledge given that any one signal is potentially controversial. Our pri-
mary approach is to assume a decision is informed if two conditions are satisfied: (i) the
decision maker’s performance on the MCBS knowledge test demonstrates that she under-
stands that her out-of-pocket prescription drug costs vary across plans and (ii) the plan
choice can be rationalized by a preference ordering that is complete, transitive, monotonic
and weakly risk averse. These two requirements are jointly satisfied for 58% of enrollment
choices. Enrollees in this non-suspect group tend to be better educated and have exerted
more effect to learn about the market. They also tend to be younger, to have fewer drug
claims, and are less likely to be diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of de-
mentia. Our secondary approaches to partitioning decisions include using the knowledge
test alone, using other choice outcomes based on either ex ante or ex post drug consump-
tion, and using other combinations of the two. This variety of measures also allows us to
provide new insights about what specific knowledge consumers may be lacking. While the



                                                                                         3
measures based on choice outcomes incorporate consumers’ knowledge about plans as well
as their individual-specific drug needs, the measure based on the MCBS question isolates
consumers’ knowledge about plan design specifically.
    After dividing choices into suspect and non-suspect groups, we estimate and validate
multinomial logit models for each group, incorporating heterogeneity within each group in
terms of income, education, race, age, sex, prescription drug use, and information-seeking
efforts. We model annual plan choices as a static repeated-choice process with a cost of
switching plans.2 The results show that enrollees in the non-suspect group are sensitive to
price and risk averse at levels consistent with evidence from other insurance markets (Co-
hen and Einav 2007, Handel 2013, Handel and Kolstad 2015). In contrast, enrollees in the
suspect group make choices that seemingly imply they are risk loving, less price sensitive,
and highly averse to switching plans.
    We use our estimates to simulate three prospective choice architecture policies. The first
policy is the government’s proposal to limit each insurer to sell no more than two plans per
market (Federal Register 2014). Second, we calibrate our model to replicate a field exper-
iment by Kling et al. (2012) in which enrollees were told which plan would be cheapest for
them and how much money they could expect to save by switching. In the third experiment,
we simulate the government’s proposal to reassign people to their cost-minimizing plans
(Health and Human Services 2014). Our framework formalizes ways in which each policy
may create winners and losers.3 We simulate each policy under a range of assumptions
about consumer foresight, about the causes of inertia, and about how the policies will affect
consumers’ decisions. Specifically, we report the share of consumers who benefit from
each policy and measures of consumer surplus as bounds on ranges that we obtain by re-
peating our analyses under the extreme assumptions about the efficacy of choice architec-
ture. In our “most effective” scenario we assume that each policy causes consumers in the


2
  A static model is appropriate here because it is difficult for consumers to forecast their own future prescription drug needs, let alone
the drug needs and enrollment decisions of other consumers together with the implications for plan prices and offerings. Our static
approach is similar to other health insurance applications such as Handel (2013) and Handel and Kolstad (2015).

  For example, the menu restrictions may benefit misinformed consumers by reducing their ability to choose low utility plans. The
information treatment and default assignment policies could create losers due to asymmetric information because the government would
only use prior drug claims, and by creating incentives for consumers to choose plans that are cheaper but potentially lower utility due to
lower quality or risk protection.



                                                                                                                                        4
suspect group to behave like their analogs in the non-suspect group. This scenario also
assumes that inertia is caused entirely by misinformation. At the opposite extreme, our
“least effective” scenario assumes the policies would not change consumer behavior and
that inertia in the non-suspect group reflects the hassle cost of switching plans and/or their
utility from latent features of their preferred plans.
   Our results show that each policy would yield different outcomes. Reducing the number
of plans makes at least two thirds of consumers worse off because people are heterogeneous
and no plans are universally poor matches for consumers. This policy also embeds a strong
incentive for regulatory capture as insurers can increase their rents by influencing which
plans are retained. In contrast, we find that at least three quarters of consumers benefit from
personalized information or are unaffected by it, with average welfare gains of 2 to 11
percent of consumers’ out-of-pocket spending. Similarly, defaults benefit over 80 percent
of consumers if they can costlessly opt out. However, average opt out costs of $65 to $198
entirely eliminate these gains.
   To determine whether these results are sensitive to whether and how we divide choices
into suspect and non-suspect groups, we repeat our analysis first without distinguishing
between choice types and second using alternative combinations of signals based on
knowledge tests, preference axiom tests, and the level of potential savings. We demonstrate
that distinguishing between informed and uninformed decisions improves the model’s per-
formance and changes its implications for the welfare effects of prospective policies. Spe-
cifically, when we estimate a standard conditional logit model that does not incorporate
signals about consumers’ knowledge, similar to Lucarelli, Prince and Simon (2012), we
understate welfare gains for the consumers that we assign to the suspect group and over-
state gains for those we assign to the non-suspect group. In contrast, while our choice about
which signals to use to identify suspect choices affects the fraction of choices we assign to
the suspect group (from 17% to 48%), it has relatively little effect on our welfare estimates
for the average consumer. The robustness of our policy conclusions reflects the distribution
of choices in our data. Intuitively, as we assign more choices to the suspect group the ben-
efits of choice architecture policies to the marginally assigned consumers diminish.



                                                                                             5
  Our simulation results are conditional on three maintained assumptions. First, we as-
sume that the demand for prescription drugs is perfectly inelastic. Holding drug consump-
tion constant across all options is a common way of simplifying the empirical specification
of consumers’ indirect utility function, but it may alter the levels and distributions of each
policy’s effects. Second, we omit supply-side responses and hold plan attributes constant,
including premiums. Full general equilibrium outcomes under the prospective policies may
diverge from those we simulate, although regulators have some ability to constrain supply-
side changes. Third, apart from our bounding estimates for the inertia parameters, our anal-
ysis assumes that the conditional differences in behavior between suspect and non-suspect
types are due to differences in information rather than preferences. We discuss the impli-
cations of each assumption in detail after presenting our simulation results.
  Our work adds to the empirical literature that aims to understand heterogeneity in con-
sumers’ decision processes and its implications in markets where frictions may undermine
revealed preference assumptions for some consumers (Harris and Keane 1999, Miravete
2003, Handel 2013, Keane and Wasi 2013, Ambuehl, Bernheim and Lusardi 2014, Mira-
vete and Palacios-Huerta 2014, Allcott and Taubinsky 2015, Bernheim, Fradkin and Popov
2015, Chetty et al. 2015, Handel and Kolstad 2015, Wiswall and Zafar 2015, DeCicca,
Kenkel, Liu and Wang 2016, Houde 2016, Keane and Thorp 2016, Kenkel, Peng, Pesko
and Wang 2017, Arcidiacono et al. 2017). We contribute to this literature in several ways.
From a methodological perspective our study is the first to operationalize Bernheim and
Rangel’s (2009) logic within the workhorse multinomial logit model. This makes our econ-
ometric framework easy to apply to other markets and straightforward to extend to dynamic
decision making. Further, we derive bounds on welfare that are robust to a wide range of
mechanisms that have been suggested as potential explanations for consumer inertia.
  From an empirical perspective, our study is the first to analyze distributional welfare
effects of federal choice architecture policies targeting a financially important decision. By
contrast, prior applications have focused on employees at a small number of firms (Handel
and Kolstad 2015, Bernheim, Fradkin and Popov 2015) or participants in laboratory and
field experiments (Arcidiacono et al. 2014, Allcott and Taubinsky 2015, Wiswall and Zafar



                                                                                            6
2015) or they have abstracted from welfare measurement (Chetty et al. 2015). We also
provide two new insights regarding which choices violate revealed preference assump-
tions. First, we find that knowledge tests and preference axiom tests provide complemen-
tary information about such violations. Some decision makers understand how the market
works but still choose plans that violate the preference axioms; others misunderstand mar-
ket institutions but choose plans that do not violate the axioms. Either way their choices
can fail to reveal preferences. This is relevant because prior studies have sought to identify
violations of revealed preference assumptions using knowledge tests alone (Handel and
Kolstad 2015) or preference axiom tests alone (Bernheim, Fradkin and Popov 2015,
Ketcham, Kuminoff and Powers 2016) but never both together. Second, we find that advi-
sors who make decisions for consumers tend to behave similarly to consumers who make
their own decisions. This finding addresses a limitation with survey-based or experimental
tests of consumer knowledge—they may be uninformative about the decision process when
decisions are influenced by advisors (Giustinelli 2016). We would expect spouses, children
and other advisors to play a significant role in older adults’ retirement planning and housing
decisions, in addition to health insurance. In fact, 38% of enrollees in our data had help
choosing a plan or someone chose a plan for them, in which case we use a test of the
advisors’ knowledge. In our context, controlling for advisors’ input has little effect on our
conclusions.

                          I. Medicare Prescription Drug Insurance Markets

    US citizens typically become eligible for Medicare benefits when they turn 65. In 2006,
Medicare Part D extended these benefits to include prescription drug insurance. A novel
and controversial feature of Part D is that it created quasi-private markets for delivering
insurance.4 Part D created 34 state or multistate markets within which the average enrollee
chose among 50 standalone prescription drug insurance plans (PDPs) sold by 20 private
insurers.5 The default for new beneficiaries is to be uninsured.6 After an enrollee chooses

4
  Prior to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Part D was the largest expansion of public insurance programs since the start
of Medicare.
5
  Subject to CMS approval, insurers can sell multiple PDPs in each market and make annual changes to existing plans.
6
  Enrollees who qualify for low-income subsidies are autoenrolled to certain plans, but we exclude them from our analysis.



                                                                                                                                      7
a plan, she is automatically reassigned to the same plan the following year unless she
switches to a different one during open enrollment. Enrollees pay monthly premiums as
well as out of pocket (OOP) costs for the drugs they purchase and taxpayers subsidize the
total costs of non-poor enrollees by an average of 75.5%.
    PDPs differ in terms of premiums, OOP costs of specific drugs, and quality measures
such as customer service, access to pharmacy networks, the ability to obtain drugs by mail
order, and the prevalence and stringency of prior authorization requirements.7 The novelty
of the market together with the complexity of the product led many analysts to speculate
that consumers would struggle to navigate the market. Liebman and Zeckhauser (2008)
summarize this view when they write, “Health insurance is too complicated a product for
most consumers to purchase intelligently and it is unlikely that most individuals will make
sensible decisions when confronted with these choices.” Some analysts flagged Part D as
a candidate for libertarian paternalism (McFadden 2006, Thaler and Sunstein 2008). More-
over, the government has expressed a desire to simplify health insurance markets and
nudge enrollees toward cheaper plans. In 2014, CMS proposed limiting insurers to selling
no more than two plans per region, which would reduce the average consumer’s choice set
by about 20% (Federal Register 2014). The US Department of Health and Human Services
also announced that it is considering redesigning federal health insurance exchanges to
automatically reassign people to low-cost plans unless they opt out (Health and Human
Services 2014). The welfare effects of these types of policies depends on consumers’ pref-
erences for PDP attributes, the cost of switching plans, and how the policies affect con-
sumers’ decision processes.
    Several prior studies have investigated the role of information and consumer behavior
in Medicare Part D. Over the first five years of the program, the average enrollee could
have reduced annual expenditures (premium + out of pocket) by 25% (or $341) by switch-
ing to their cheapest available plan (Ketcham, Lucarelli and Powers 2015) and more than
75% of consumers chose plans that did not minimize their costs on an ex ante basis (Heiss
et al. 2013). Yet, the implications for consumer welfare remain ambiguous. When enrollees

7
  Many insurers require consumers to have prior authorization from a doctor in order to obtain certain drugs, but the stringency of these
requirements differs from insurer to insurer.



                                                                                                                                       8
are surveyed about their experiences in Part D, most report being satisfied with the plans
they chose (Heiss, McFadden and Winter 2010, Kling et al. 2012). Furthermore, Ketcham,
Kuminoff and Powers (2016) demonstrate that most of the people who could have saved
money by switching chose plans that were either superior in some measure of quality or
provided greater protection from negative health shocks. These consumers could be mak-
ing informed decisions to pay for quality and risk protection. On the other hand, when
Kling et al. (2012) asked 406 Wisconsin enrollees how much they thought they could save
by switching plans, most respondents underestimated the true figure. Kling et al. also found
that sending enrollees a letter with personalized information about their potential savings
increased the rate at which enrollees switched plans by 11.5 percentage points. Overall, the
existing evidence suggests that some consumers are misinformed, but others may be choos-
ing to pay more for plans with higher quality and/or greater risk protection.
  A few prior studies have developed multinomial logit models of Part D enrollment de-
cisions, but none have explored the role of heterogeneity in consumers’ beliefs about the
market or its implications for the distributional effects of choice architecture policies. Lu-
carelli, Prince and Simon (2012) use the fully revealed preference benchmark approach to
assess welfare effects of reducing the number of insurance plans. Under their approach,
they assume that all consumers are fully informed, implying that nobody can be made better
off by restrictions on choice. Ho, Hogan and Scott-Morton (2017), Polyakova (2016) and
Heiss et al. (2016) document the empirical prevalence of inertia among consumers and
explore its implications for adverse selection and insurance company profits. Finally, Aba-
luck and Gruber (2011) and its sequels conclude that the “representative” consumer places
too much weight on premiums relative to out-of-pocket costs and is mistakenly indifferent
to expenditure risk. Then they assess the welfare gains from a hypothetical policy that re-
assigns consumers to their utility maximizing plans. Nobody can be made worse off from
the hypothetical reassignment because the social planner is assumed to be benevolent and
omniscient. Ketcham, Kuminoff and Powers (2016) show that Abaluck and Gruber’s cal-
culation requires them to know the precise parametric form of every consumer’s utility
function, up to and including their individual-specific levels of iid Type I extreme value



                                                                                            9
distributed preference parameters.
   We diverge from all of the prior Medicare Part D studies by developing a model to
investigate heterogeneity in consumers’ beliefs about the market. Importantly, we leverage
novel aspects of our data and utilize revealed preference logic in a way that recognizes for
the first time that policies restricting choice may create both winners and losers. Our para-
metric approximation to utility is similar to the studies cited above, but our econometric
approach is novel in three respects. First and foremost we allow decision makers to have
heterogeneous beliefs about observable plan attributes, conditional on their preferences for
those attributes. Second, we recognize that the decision maker may be someone other than
the consumer—a feature that is especially relevant when studying an aging population
prone to cognitive decline. Third, we allow consumers’ preferences for plan attributes to
vary with a rich set of demographics. While demographic data are commonly used in the
broader discrete choice literature, our paper is the first study of Medicare Part D to obtain
access to data on a rich set of demographics including enrollees’ incomes, educations, mar-
ital status, family structure, and internet use.

     II.   A Parametric Model of Decision Making with Heterogeneity in Beliefs

   We assume that consumer i’s utility from drug plan j in year t depends on the mean and
variance of her potential expenditures in that plan under all possible health states. Expend-
itures equal the plan premium, 𝑝𝑗𝑡 , plus out of pocket costs, 𝑜𝑜𝑝𝑗𝑡 (𝑥𝑖𝑡 ), of an exogenously
given vector of drug quantities, 𝑥𝑖𝑡 . Utility also depends on a vector of measures of plan
quality, 𝑞𝑖𝑗𝑡 , that reflect the time and effort required for an individual to obtain her eligible
benefits under the plan. To keep notation simple we treat the beneficiary and the person
who makes her enrollment decision as being indivisible, using the i subscript for both. The
distinction between the beneficiary and the decision maker is neutral to the structure of our
model, though it potentially influences our estimates by affecting which decisions we treat
as informed—an issue we investigate in sections IV and VII.




                                                                                               10
                                           A. Initial Enrollment Decision

    When a beneficiary first enters the market in year 0, she must actively choose a plan to
obtain insurance. She will choose the plan that maximizes her utility, conditional on her
beliefs about plan attributes.

                             2
(1) 𝑈𝑖𝑗0 = 𝛼𝑖𝑡 𝑐́𝑖𝑗0 + 𝛽𝑖𝑡 𝜎́𝑖𝑗0 + 𝛾𝑖𝑡 𝑞́ 𝑖𝑗0 + 𝜖𝑖𝑗0.

𝑐́𝑖𝑗0 denotes the amount that person i expects to spend under plan j in terms of the premium
plus out of pocket costs for prescription drugs, 𝜎́ 𝑖𝑗0
                                                    2
                                                        is the variance of out of pocket costs,
𝑞́ 𝑖𝑗0 is a vector of quality attributes, and 𝜖𝑖𝑗0 is a person-plan specific preference shock.
The accents indicate that the variables reflect decision maker i’s beliefs about plan attrib-
utes. Heterogeneity in beliefs is discussed below. Beneficiaries may also have heterogene-
ous marginal rates of substitution between expected cost, variance, and quality. We model
this heterogeneity as a function of the beneficiary’s demographics, some of which may
evolve over time: 𝛼𝑖𝑡 = 𝛼0 + 𝛼1 𝑑𝑖𝑡 , and similarly for 𝛽𝑖𝑡 and 𝛾𝑖𝑡 . Finally, people may lose
utility from the time and effort required to learn about a plan and enroll in it. We assume
that this cost is constant across plans so that it cancels out of between-plan comparisons
and can therefore be suppressed in (1).

                                      B. Subsequent Enrollment Decisions

    After an enrollee chooses a plan in year 0 she is automatically reassigned to that plan in
year 1 unless she actively switches to a different plan during the annual open enrollment
window.8 As before, making an active decision may be costly. In contrast, no effort is
required to reenroll in the default plan:

                             2
(2) 𝑈𝑖𝑗1 = 𝛼𝑖𝑡 𝑐́𝑖𝑗1 + 𝛽𝑖𝑡 𝜎́𝑖𝑗1 + 𝛾𝑖𝑡 𝑞́ 𝑖𝑗1 + 𝜂𝑖𝑡 Δ𝐵́𝑖𝑗1 + 𝛿𝑖𝑡 Δ𝑃́𝑖𝑗1 + 𝜖𝑖𝑗1 .

Two terms capture the utility loss from actively switching plans: Δ𝑃́𝑖𝑗𝑡 is an indicator for


8
 Plans are occasionally discontinued, which can force people to make an active choice. In such case, we can revert to equation (1) to
model the new enrollment decision.



                                                                                                                                 11
whether plan j is a non-default plan sold by the same insurer as the default plan, and Δ𝐵́𝑖𝑗𝑡
is an indicator for whether plan j is a non-default plan sold by a different insurer. The
disutility of switching plans is captured by the parameters 𝜂𝑖𝑡 = 𝜂0 + 𝜂1 𝑑𝑖𝑡 and 𝛿𝑖𝑡 = 𝛿0 +
𝛿1 𝑑𝑖𝑡 , which summarize how inertia varies with demographics. We consider how to inter-
pret inertia when we discuss welfare measurement in Section III. After a consumer chooses
a plan in year 1, the decision process is the same in years 2,…,T.

                                             C. Heterogeneity in Information

      We say that a decision maker’s enrollment decision is “informed” if her beliefs about
plan attributes coincide with the empirical measures that we observe as analysts. The as-
sumption that decision makers are informed is ubiquitous (and often implicit) in revealed
preference models because it is typically needed to infer consumers’ preferences from their
observed choices. Revealed preference logic typically fails if decision makers have beliefs
about the objects of choice that diverge from information used by analysts.
      Decision makers’ full beliefs are unknown but we see signals about them in the data.
Some decision makers send signals that cause us to suspect that they are not informed.
Borrowing from Bernheim and Rangel (2009), we label their enrollment decisions as “sus-
pect” because we suspect that they may fail to reveal the beneficiary’s preferences. 9 Other
decision makers send signals that lead us to believe they are informed; we label their deci-
sions as “non-suspect”. As in Bernheim and Rangel’s conceptual model, we assume that
preferences for plan attributes are stable across individuals in the non-suspect (n) and sus-
pect (s) groups conditional on demographics and drug consumption:

     𝑛
(3) 𝑈𝑖𝑗𝑡                   2
         = 𝛼𝑖𝑡 𝑐𝑖𝑗𝑡 + 𝛽𝑖𝑡 𝜎𝑖𝑗𝑡 + 𝛾𝑖𝑡 𝑞𝑗𝑡 + 𝜂𝑖𝑡 Δ𝐵𝑖𝑗𝑡 + 𝛿𝑖𝑡 Δ𝑃𝑖𝑗𝑡 + 𝜖𝑖𝑗𝑡 .

     𝑠
(4) 𝑈𝑖𝑗𝑡                     2
         = 𝛼𝑖𝑡 𝑐́𝑖𝑗𝑡 + 𝛽𝑖𝑡 𝜎́𝑖𝑗𝑡 + 𝛾𝑖𝑡 𝑞́ 𝑖𝑗𝑡 + 𝜂𝑖𝑡 Δ𝐵́𝑖𝑗𝑡 + 𝛿𝑖𝑡 Δ𝑃́𝑖𝑗𝑡 + 𝜖𝑖𝑗𝑡 .

We dropped the accents in (3) to indicate that we are using our empirical measures of plan
attributes for the non-suspect group.


9
    Latent heterogeneity in beliefs is one case of what Bernheim and Rangel refer to as “ancillary conditions” on decision making.



                                                                                                                                     12
   Because we do not observe the beliefs of people making suspect choices, we do not
necessarily identify their preferences from their observed behavior. To see this notice that
if we replace the subjective beliefs about plan attributes in (4) with empirical measures of
plan attributes then, in general, we must also allow the values of the preference parameters
and the error term to change in order to maintain their utility ranking of plans:

     𝑠
(5) 𝑈𝑖𝑗𝑡 = 𝛼𝑖𝑡́ 𝑐𝑖𝑗𝑡 + 𝛽́𝑖𝑡 𝜎𝑖𝑗𝑡
                             2
                                 + 𝛾𝑖𝑡́ 𝑞𝑖𝑗𝑡 + 𝜂𝑖𝑡́ 𝛥𝐵𝑖𝑗𝑡 + 𝛿́𝑖𝑡 𝛥𝑃𝑖𝑗𝑡 + 𝜖́𝑖𝑗𝑡 .

For example, if people make suspect choices because they have downward biased expec-
tations about their drug needs at the time they choose a plan (i.e. 𝑐𝑖𝑗𝑡 > 𝑐́𝑖𝑗𝑡 ) then we would
expect 𝛼𝑖𝑡 < 𝛼𝑖𝑡́ . Likewise, if they have downward biased expectations about their poten-
tial savings from switching plans, then we would expect 𝜂𝑖𝑡 < 𝜂𝑖𝑡́ and 𝛿𝑖𝑡 < 𝛿́𝑖𝑡 .
   To facilitate estimation we assume that the person-plan specific taste shocks in (3) and
(5) are iid draws from type I extreme value distributions. The variances may differ between
the suspect and non-suspect groups because the idiosyncratic shocks in (5) will absorb any
residual utility differences needed to maintain the preference ordering over plans when we
move from (4) to (5). Therefore, when we normalize the model variances to 𝜋 2 ⁄6, the
coefficients estimated for the suspect group will be scaled by the ratio of the group-specific
variances. After making this normalization, we can rewrite the estimating equation for the
suspect group (s) as

metric model identifies the parameters of (3) and (6).

                                           D. Identification

   Once we divide enrollment decisions into suspect and non-suspect groups the identifi-
cation of model parameters for each group is straightforward and analogous to prior studies




                                                                                                  13
that assume consumers have identical beliefs (Lucarelli, Prince and Simon 2012, Polya-
kova 2016). Intuitively, our ability to observe each individual’s plan choice when they first
enter the market allows us to overcome the initial conditions problem. Consider the non-
suspect group. Given the parametric form for utility and the distributional assumption about
𝜖𝑖𝑗𝑡 , we can use a multinomial logit model of initial plan choices to identify the parameters
that describe how marginal rates of substitution between cost, variance, and quality vary
with demographics, 𝛼0 , 𝛼1 , 𝛽0 , 𝛽1 , 𝛾0 , 𝛾1 . Then we can use a model of their subsequent plan
choices to identify the inertia parameters, 𝜂0 , 𝜂1 , 𝛿0 , 𝛿1 , via the rates at which individuals
actively switched out of their initial plans. In practice, we pool data from all plan choices
and estimate the parameters simultaneously using (3). The same arguments can be made to
identify the parameters of (6) for the suspect group. From a policy evaluation perspective,
the novelty of our approach is to estimate separate parameters for suspect and non-suspect
groups. Differentiating their decision processes and allowing those processes to vary with
beneficiaries’ demographics is critical to accurately measuring the heterogeneous welfare
effects of prospective policies.

                         III. Welfare Effects of Choice Architecture Policies

     When some decisions are misinformed, reforms that reduce information costs and/or
simplify the choice process can, in principle, increase some consumers’ welfare. Consider
a policy implemented between periods 0 and 1 that changes the set of available plans from
𝐽 to 𝐾. Consumer welfare may be affected through multiple channels. The policy may
change the menu of options by adding choices, removing choices, and regulating their costs
or quality. The policy may also change how consumers make decisions, e.g. by lowering
the cost of switching plans or by changing default assignment rules.10




10
  In general equilibrium, if the policy induces consumers and firms to adjust their behavior then those adjustments may feed back into
the levels of endogenous attributes such as premiums.



                                                                                                                                  14
                                           A. Non-Suspect Group

   The expected change in welfare for people in the non-suspect group (n) is derived by
integrating over 𝜖𝑖𝑗𝑡 in the standard expression for consumer surplus to generate the log
sum ratio from Small and Rosen (1981).

where 𝑉𝑖𝑗𝑛0 and 𝑉𝑖𝑘𝑛1 denote the observed part of utility in (3) evaluated for PDPs j and k
before and after the policy. The temporal subscript is suppressed for brevity such that
𝑉𝑖𝑗𝑛0 = 𝑉𝑖𝑗𝑡
          𝑛0                 𝑛0
             (𝜃 𝑛 , 𝑑𝑖𝑡 ) = 𝑈𝑖𝑗𝑡 − 𝜖𝑖𝑗𝑡 , where 𝜃 𝑛 = [𝛼 𝑛 , 𝛽 𝑛 , 𝛾 𝑛 , 𝜂𝑛 , 𝛿 𝑛 ] and each letter is a
vector of parameters describing how preferences vary with demographics.

                                              B. Suspect Group

   Welfare calculation is more involved for the suspect group. The observed part of (6)
determines how PDP attributes affect their enrollment decisions, but their ex post realized
utility from those decisions is determined by (3). This follows from our assumption that,
conditional on prescription drug use and demographics, the suspect and non-suspect groups
share the same underlying preference parameters. Therefore, a single plan’s contribution
to expected utility is defined by integrating over the product of (3) and the probability of
choosing that plan based on (6). Aggregating over the PDP menu prior to the policy yields
the following expression

                         ∞

                                                                            + 𝜖𝑖𝑗 )𝑑𝜖𝑖𝑗 ,
                 𝑗∈𝐽 −∞


where 𝐹𝑗 (∙) is the derivative of the joint CDF of the preference shocks with respect to 𝜖𝑖𝑗 .
Subtracting this expression from the post-policy measure of expected utility, dividing by
the marginal utility of income, and integrating over the preference shocks yields the fol-
lowing expression for welfare:

braces in (9) is the standard log sum ratio evaluated at 𝜃 𝑠 . The second and third terms adjust
the log sum ratio to account for the welfare implications of the difference between 𝜃 𝑠 and
𝜃 for each choice, weighted by the predicted probability of making that choice before and
after the policy.11 In the special case where 𝜃 𝑠 = 𝜃, equation (9) reduces to the standard
welfare measure in (7).

                               C. Bounding the Welfare Implications of Inertia

     Equations (7) and (9) treat the non-suspect group’s inertia parameters as being directly
relevant for welfare. This is consistent with interpreting inertia as a mixture of latent pref-
erences and hassle costs of switching plans. Kling et al. (2002) argue that inertia is more
likely to reflect downward biased expectations for the savings from switching plans along
with other psychological factors such as status quo bias, procrastination, and limited atten-
tion or inattention. These mechanisms have no direct effect on consumer welfare; they
affect welfare indirectly by lowering the rate at which consumers switch plans. Our data
do not allow us to distinguish the importance of psychological bias relative to latent pref-
erences and switching costs. One can separate them, in principle, by adding assumptions
on the form of statistical distributions for unobserved preference heterogeneity and switch-
ing costs (e.g. Heckman 1981, Dube et al. 2010, Polyakova 2016, Heiss et al. 2016). We
avoid such assumptions by taking a partial identification approach similar to Handel (2013)
and Bernheim, Fradkin, and Popov (2015). We calculate welfare for two extreme cases that
provide bounds on the share of inertia that is welfare relevant. In the first case, inertia is
assumed to be entirely welfare relevant (as in (7) and (9)) and in the second case it is as-
sumed to be entirely irrelevant, e.g. due to psychological bias.


11
  Leggett (2002) derived a similar expression as a way to describe decision making under misinformation in a static model of recreation
demand without inertia.



                                                                                                                                   16
   To calculate the change in expected welfare when inertia reflects psychological biases
we replace equations (7) and (9) with (7’) and (9’).

These equations differ from (7) and (9) in that 𝑉𝑖𝑘𝑛 1 = 𝑉𝑖𝑘𝑛1 − 𝜂𝑖𝑡
                                                                  𝑛
                                                                     𝛥𝐵𝑖𝑗𝑡 − 𝛿𝑖𝑡𝑛 𝛥𝑃𝑖𝑗𝑡 and

sumer welfare; it only affects welfare indirectly via consumers’ enrollment decisions.

                        D. Bounding the Policy’s Effect on Consumer Behavior

   We may also need to take a stance on whether a counterfactual choice architecture policy
would induce consumers to behave differently. In principle, a policy designed to simplify
the choice process could induce decision makers in the suspect group to update their beliefs
about the market and behave like decision makers in the non-suspect group. Or it could
have no effect at all. In the absence of empirical evidence, we can again take a partial
identification approach and consider two extreme scenarios. One scenario assumes that the
policy has no effect on behavior; the other assumes that the policy induces consumers in
the suspect group to behave like those in the non-suspect group, conditional on de-
mographics and prescription drug utilization. The second case involves replacing 𝑉𝑖𝑘𝑠1 with
  𝑛1
𝑉𝑖𝑘  and 𝜓𝑖𝑘
          𝑠1
             with 𝜓𝑖𝑘

                                                          E. Discussion

       Our welfare framework is consistent with divergent theories of consumer decision mak-
ing. When it is costly for consumers to acquire information, to make a decision, or to ne-
gotiate a transaction they may choose not to become fully informed (Stigler and Becker
1977). Misinformation may also stem from psychological biases (Kahneman, Wakker, and




                                                                                                                      17
Sarin 1997).12 Our framework requires observing which decisions are affected by some
combination of these mechanisms, but it avoids the need to model them or take a stance on
their relative importance. The disadvantage of being unable to disentangle these mecha-
nisms is that we only recover bounds on welfare. Whether the bounds are informative is an
empirical question.
     The bounds that we derive extend Small and Rosen (1981) to recognize that consumers
differ in the information they use to make decisions. Our adjustment for misinformation
implements Bernheim and Rangel’s (2009) proposal for how to measure welfare when the
analyst suspects that some choices will not reveal preferences. This allows us to recognize
that choice architecture may create winners and losers. For example, consider a policy that
automatically assigns each consumer to a plan, but allows them to opt out and choose a
different plan if they prefer. Nobody can be made better off from such a policy within a
standard discrete choice model that assumes all consumers are fully informed and freely
mobile, as in Lucarelli, Prince, and Simon (2012). At the opposite extreme, nobody can be
made worse off within a model that assumes the policy is implemented by a benevolent
and omniscient regulator, as in Abaluck and Gruber (2011). Our framework nests both
extremes as special cases. If we assign all consumers to the non-suspect group, then our
framework reduces to the standard discrete choice model. If we assign all consumers to the
suspect group and let the analyst decide which plans would maximize consumers’ utilities,
then our model reduces to the one in Abaluck and Gruber (2011). Our framework general-
izes these approaches to allow for a middle ground in which we use ancillary information
to determine which consumers are misinformed and use informed consumers’ choices to
reveal preferences. Equation (7) and its analogs recognize that informed consumers can be
made worse off from restrictions on choice. Equation (9) and its analogs recognize that that
misinformed consumers may gain or lose from restrictions on choice. Aggregating the
gains and losses can yield criteria for policy evaluation consistent with the concept of
asymmetric paternalism (Camerer et al. 2003).

  To use the terminology from Kahneman, Wakker, and Sarin (1997), one can think of 𝑉𝑖𝑗𝑛 (𝜃) as approximating the “hedonic utility”
derived by consuming a good and 𝑉𝑖𝑗𝑠 (𝜃 𝑠 ) as approximating the “decision utility” function maximized by people who are misinformed.




                                                                                                                                 18
     Applying our model to a prospective policy involves three steps. First we must use
signals about which decision makers are informed to divide their choices into suspect and
non-suspect groups. Then we must estimate parameters describing how suspect and non-
suspect choice probabilities vary with plan attributes, 𝜃 𝑛 and 𝜃 𝑠 , to calibrate 𝜓𝑖𝑗

we implement each step and evaluate prospective changes to Medicare Part D choice ar-
chitecture using data drawn from beneficiaries’ administrative records together with sur-
veys of the decision makers who made their enrollment choices.

     IV. Linking Administrative Records on Health Insurance to Enrollee Surveys

     We rely on the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) linked to the respondents’
administrative records at the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The
MCBS is a national rotating panel questionnaire that began in 1991 and is administered to
approximately 16,000 people annually.13 It collects information about Medicare benefi-
ciaries and their use of health care services. Each participant is interviewed up to three
times per year for four consecutive years, regardless of whether they stay at the same ad-
dress or move into and out of long-term care facilities. Importantly for our purposes, par-
ticipants are tested on their knowledge of the PDP market. The MCBS also asks partici-
pants if and how they searched for information about Medicare services and it provides
rich demographic data. Also of particular value for our study, the MCBS indicates whether
a proxy responded to the survey, and whether the beneficiary makes health insurance de-
cisions on her own, with help from someone else, or whether the proxy makes decisions

13
   A potential limitation of working with the MCBS sample is that it is not designed to be nationally representative without weighting,
and selecting the appropriate weights is complicated by panel rotation and by our exclusive focus on respondents who participated in
the standalone PDP market without a low-income subsidy. Respondents who do not purchase a standalone PDP can instead obtain
prescription drug insurance through an employer sponsored plan or a Medicare Advantage plan. Further, the MCBS does not sample
individuals from 3 PDP regions: 1(Maine and New Hampshire), 20 (Mississippi), and 31 (Idaho and Utah). To assess whether using
unweighted MCBS data might compromise the external validity of our results, we compared the unweighted demographics of the aver-
age enrollee in our linked sample with a random 20% sample of all Part D enrollees from CMS’s administrative files. Table A2 shows
that the average enrollee in our linked sample is 1 to 2 years older. Otherwise, the two samples are virtually identical in terms of race,
gender, rates of dementia and depression, number of PDP brands and plans available, expenditures on plan premiums and OOP costs,
and the maximum amount of money that the average enrollee could have been saved by enrolling in their cheapest available plan. Given
the strong similarity between the two samples, we expect that our findings from the linked MCBS-administrative sample can be gener-
alized to the broader population of non-poor Part D enrollees.



                                                                                                                                      19
for her.
     For each MCBS respondent who purchased a standalone PDP between 2006 and 2010
we obtained administrative records on the universe of their prescription drug claims, the
set of PDPs available to them, and their annual enrollment decisions. Then we calculated
what each enrollee would have spent had they purchased the same bundle of drugs under
each alternative PDP in their choice set. This was done by combining their actual claims
with the cost calculator developed in Ketcham, Lucarelli and Powers (2015). Briefly, this
calculator incorporates information on each plan’s prices paid and OOP prices for every
drug as determined by their coverage decisions (i.e., formulary design). This allowed us to
determine what each person would have paid for each drug and their total OOP costs for
the year under every plan, as well as what each plan would have spent on each person had
they enrolled in that plan and consumed the same drugs as under the plan they actually
chose. The calculator factors in the non-linearities in benefits design (i.e., changes in OOP
costs depending on the cumulative spending in the coverage year) as people move through
the deductible, “donut hole” coverage gap, and catastrophic coverage phases.14 Like prior
studies of PDP choice, we limit our analysis to enrollees who did not receive a low-income
subsidy.15 Finally, we used administrative data from CMS’s Chronic Condition Data Ware-
house to determine if and when each individual had depression or dementia, which are
associated with diminished cognitive performance (Agarwal et al. 2009).
     Our linked sample includes 3,547 individuals who made 10,867 annual enrollment de-
cisions between 2006 and 2010.16 Table A1 reports annual means of the key variables. The
typical enrollee is a retired high school graduate with living children. Approximately 22%
are college graduates, 55% are married, and 55% have annual pre-tax household incomes
over $25,000. Only 35% report that they ever personally use the internet to get information

14
   The calculator code is available at https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20120651. There is a correlation of .94-.98 each
year between the out of pocket costs predicted for the actual plan and the realized cost observed in the administrative data. Differences
between the calculator’s predictions and realized costs are due to changes in plan design or drug pricing that occur after open enrollment
and are not observable to consumers at the time they make enrollment decisions.
15
   We exclude those receiving low-income subsidies because they are autoenrolled into plans, they receive larger premium subsidies,
and their copayments are much more uniform across plans. Hence, they are less relevant for our evaluation of prospective policies
designed to alter choice architecture. Despite excluding them, our sample has similar income levels to the national average of people
age 65 and above. In our sample 54% of households have annual income over $25,000 (weighted 2006-2010 dollars), compared with
63% (constant 2010 dollars) based on all householders 65 and older in the 2010 Census American Community Survey.
16
   This excludes observations on beneficiaries who reenrolled in plans they had originally chosen prior to joining the MCBS. We drop
these observations because we cannot observe the beneficiaries’ knowledge at the time they first selected their current plans.



                                                                                                                                      20
of any kind. However, among those who do use the internet most have used it to search for
information on Medicare programs (27%). Another 17% report having called 1-800-Med-
icare for information. The average beneficiary’s total expenditures on premiums and out
of pocket costs increased from $1,203 in 2007 to $1,400 in 2010.17 This is a significant
share of income given that 45% of beneficiaries have household incomes below $25,000.
The data also reveal that by the end of our study period significant fractions of enrollees
had been diagnosed with dementia (12%) and depression (11%).
     Given the relatively large amount of money at stake, the age range of the eligible pop-
ulation and the prevalence of cognitive illnesses it is unsurprising to find that 38% of en-
rollees did not make health insurance decisions on their own: 27% had help and 11% relied
on a proxy to make the decision for them. Table 1 shows that beneficiaries who get help
are likely to be older, sicker, lower income, less educated, and use the internet less than
beneficiaries who made decisions on their own. Those getting help are also more likely to
have been diagnosed with depression or dementia. All of these differences are amplified
when we compare beneficiaries who make their own health insurance decisions to those
who rely on proxies to make decisions for them.
     Only 8% of the enrollment decisions in our data minimize ex post expenditures. In 2006,
the average enrollee could have saved $460 by choosing their cheapest available plan.18
This is equivalent to reducing total expenditures by 45%. Potential savings declined to
$349 in 2007 (or 29% of expenditures) and remained similar thereafter. Why are people
leaving money on the table? We hypothesize that the answers differ from person to person.
Some may be making informed decisions to pay more for plans that provide better risk
protection and higher quality. Others may misunderstand how the market works or under-
estimate their potential savings. We must distinguish between these groups to evaluate the
welfare effects of prospective choice architecture policies.


17
   The figure for 2006 is $1,013. It is smaller because during the inaugural year of the program open enrollment extended through May.
Less than half the enrollees in our sample were enrolled for all of 2006. If we limit the sample to full-year enrollees, the 2006 mean
annual consumer expenditure is $1,366.
18
   This figure sums over premiums and out of pocket costs. See Table A1 for details. This average falls below the $520 figure reported
by Ketcham, Lucarelli and Powers (2015) based on CMS’s 20% sample of 2006 full year enrollees because our average also includes
people who only enrolled for part of the year. The primary reason for part-year enrollment in 2006 was the fact that the initial open
enrollment period was extended through May (Heiss, McFadden, and Winter 2010).

                       V.      Identifying Suspect and Non-Suspect Choices

  A central aspect of our model is the need to identify the subset of suspect choices that
will not necessarily reveal the beneficiary’s preferences for plan attributes. This process is
potentially controversial because we do not fully observe decision makers’ beliefs in the
data. We address this by implementing a variety of approaches, finding that the magnitudes
of key results vary across approaches but our qualitative findings do not. Our primary ap-
proach is to classify an enrollment decision as suspect if the decision maker reveals that
she misunderstands the primary source of variation in drug spending across plans, if her
enrollment decision violates basic axioms of consumer theory, or both. After we explain
the nuances of our primary approach, we discuss several alternatives and provide reduced
form evidence on who makes suspect choices.

                                          A. Our Primary Approach

  We focus on the signals that decision makers send about their beliefs at the time they
actively enroll in plans. Similar to Chetty et al. (2015) and Ho, Hogan and Scott-Morton



                                                                                                                         22
(2015) we define an enrollment choice as active if either of the following statements is
true: (i) the person is new to the market and must select a plan to become insured or (ii) the
person switched to a new plan during open enrollment. If neither statement is true, then the
decision maker took no action during open enrollment and was automatically reenrolled in
the plan she chose last year—her default—in which case we define her choice as passive.
After the inaugural enrollment cycle in 2006 between 77% and 80% of enrollees made
passive choices each year. When coding a passive reenrollment decision as suspect or non-
suspect we focus on the signals sent by the decision maker in the period when she actively
enrolled in that plan.19
     The first signal comes from a module of the MCBS survey that was implemented in
2006 to 2010 to test respondents’ knowledge of PDP markets. Most of the test questions
asked about institutional features of the markets that were neutral to the choice among
plans. As described in detail in Table B1, only one of these questions is suitable for iden-
tifying informed choices.20 This single question tested an area of knowledge that is critical
to the choice among plans. It asked decision makers to state whether the following sentence
is true or false.

            “Your OOP costs are the same in all Medicare prescription drug plans.”

For the small subset of beneficiaries with no drug claims, the statement is true. For every
beneficiary with any claims the statement is false due to variation in formularies, deducti-
bles and coinsurance. Understanding that costs vary across plans is key to understanding
how the PDP markets work. Moreover, this variation is financially important: the average
beneficiary’s OOP costs for her purchased drugs vary by over $1,100 across her available
plans. Decision makers who do not understand this may choose plans with higher out of

19
   While we could focus on signals sent at the time of the reenrollment decision, doing so would require taking a stronger stance on the
welfare interpretation of inertia. Deference to active decisions is common in the literature (e.g. Handel 2013, Chetty et al. 2015, Ho,
Hogan and Scott-Morton 2015, Polyakova 2016).
20
   Unlike Handel and Kolstad (2015) who used an index from a range of questions, we had no input into the design of the questions
asked. All other questions in the MCBS were either redundant relative to the question we use, infrequently asked (e.g. for only a single
year, making it non-viable for our study), focused on institutional features of PDP markets that were irrelevant to the choice among
plans, or were about general efforts to collect information about Medicare (e.g. calling the Medicare 1-800 number) rather than
knowledge about Part D specifically as our current measure. Therefore we believe the index approach is inferior to our use of the single
most relevant question because it would be a less informative signal about the areas of knowledge that matter for evaluating choices in
our context.



                                                                                                                                    23
pocket costs and less protection from unexpected health shocks. Moreover, failure to give
a correct answer sends a strong signal that the decision makers’ beliefs deviate from our
empirical measures of plan attributes. Thus, we assign an enrollment choice to the suspect
group if the decision maker did not answer this question correctly.
     We use each beneficiary’s drug claims to determine her correct answer to the MCBS
question. Because respondents may be unsure about which enrollment year the question is
referring to, we code a respondent’s answer for year t as correct if it is correct for either
year t or year t-1. The first row of Table 2 shows that 44% of respondents answered incor-
rectly in the first year of the program when everyone had to actively enroll in a plan. The
table shows gradual improvement over the next four years, consistent with prior evidence
on learning in PDP markets (Ketcham, Lucarelli, and Powers 2015, Ketcham et al. 2012).21
On average, respondents who answered incorrectly could have saved 16% more by switch-
ing to a different plan than those who answered correctly.22

Note: The table reports the share of choices triggering each indicator, by year, and previews the sensitivity of some of our results to the
choice among indicators. The MCBS knowledge test (row 1) determines whether decision makers understand that out of pocket costs
vary across plans. The dominated plan test (row 2) determines whether their chosen plans are dominated on expected costs, variance
and quality based on ex post drug claims during the enrollment year. Row 3 reports our primary indicator—the union of rows 1 and 2.
Row 4 is the same as Row 3 but implements the dominated plan test using ex ante drug claims from the prior year. Row 5 is the union
of Row 3 and an indicator for whether ex post costs could have been lowered by more than 50% by choosing another plan. See the text
for additional details. The last two columns preview the results from two of our policy experiments described below. E[CS] denotes
expected consumer surplus.

  Table A3 reports separate results for active enrollment decisions and passive reenrollment decisions.
22
  Table A4 shows that when we focus on active enrollment decisions, failing to answer the knowledge question correctly is associated
with a 1.3 percentage point increase in the probability of choosing a dominated plan and a $68 increase in the amount of money that
could be saved by switching to the cheapest available plan, even when conditioning on education, income, employment status, presence
of living children, internet use, effort to search for information about CMS programs online or by calling 1-800-Medicare, getting help
making enrollment decisions, the number of available plans, gender, race, age, dementia, depression, number of drug claims, and dum-
mies for year and CMS region. For 11% of our sample the person who responds to the survey and makes the enrollment decision is a
proxy for the beneficiary, such as a spouse or child (Table A1).



                                                                                                                                       24
     Answering the knowledge question correctly is necessary, but not sufficient, for us to
code a choice as non-suspect. A decision maker may understand how the market works in
general but choose not to exert effort to learn about the attributes of her available options.
Therefore, we also test whether decision makers’ active enrollment decisions can be ra-
tionalized as maximizing a well behaved utility function under full information, using the
test from Ketcham, Kuminoff and Powers (2016). Assuming that beneficiaries are weakly
risk averse and have preference orderings that are complete, transitive, and strongly mon-
otonic over expected cost savings, risk protection, and quality, an informed decision maker
will not actively enroll in a plan, j, that is dominated by another, k, in the sense that the
following four conditions hold simultaneously:

(10) 𝐸(𝑐𝑖𝑘𝑡 ) ≤ 𝐸(𝑐𝑖𝑗𝑡 )
(11) 𝑣𝑎𝑟(𝑐𝑖𝑘𝑡 ) ≤ 𝑣𝑎𝑟(𝑐𝑖𝑗𝑡 )
(12) 𝑞𝑖𝑗𝑡 ≤ 𝑞𝑖𝑘𝑡
(13) 𝐴𝑡 𝑙𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑡 𝑜𝑛𝑒 𝑜𝑓 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑠 𝑖𝑠 𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑡.

We refer to choices that satisfy (10)-(13) as being dominated.23 In theory, an individual
may choose a dominated plan if she is risk loving, if she dislikes quality, if she has a neg-
ative marginal utility of income, or, more likely, if she is misinformed about her options.
Hence, if we observe someone actively choosing a dominated plan we assign her choice to
the suspect group.24
     To test whether enrollees chose dominated plans we define cost, variance, and quality
analogously to prior studies of PDP choice (Abaluck and Gruber 2011, Ketcham, Kumi-
noff, and Powers 2016). First we assume that informed consumers have unbiased expecta-
tions of their drug needs for the upcoming year: 𝐸(𝑐𝑖𝑗𝑡 ) = 𝑐𝑖𝑗𝑡 . Next, we use a cohort ap-
proach to calculate variance. We calculate 𝑣𝑎𝑟(𝑐𝑖𝑗𝑡 ) from the distribution of expenditures



23
   By focusing on the first two moments of the cost distribution, our definition of dominance differs from measures of state-by-state
dominance used by studies such as Handel and Kolstad (2015).
24
   Consumers who violate at least one condition are choosing plans on what Lancaster (1966) called the “efficiency frontier” in attribute
space. Every plan on the frontier can be rationalized as maximizing some utility function that satisfies the preference axioms and weak
risk aversion under full information. For example, an informed risk averse consumer may optimally choose a more expensive and lower
quality plan that better insures her against negative health shocks.



                                                                                                                                     25
under plan j for the drugs used in year t by people in consumer i's cohort in terms of year
t-1 drug claims. Specifically, we use CMS’s random 20% sample of all PDP enrollees to
assign each individual in the MCBS sample to 1 of 1000 cells defined by the deciles to
which she belonged in the national distributions of the prior year’s total drug spending,
days’ supply of branded drugs, and days’ supply of generic drugs. 25 Then we calculate
𝑣𝑎𝑟(𝑐𝑖𝑗𝑡 ) for the distribution of drugs used by everyone in consumer i’s cell. Finally, we
allow utility to depend on two measures of plan quality. First is an index measure devel-
oped by CMS and publicized as “star ratings”. This index is based on factors such as cus-
tomer complaints, customer satisfaction, difficulty with appeals and availability of benefits
and pricing information. Second are indicators for insurance companies. These indicators
reflect all aspects of PDP quality that vary across insurers even beyond those omitted from
the star ratings, such as customer service, pharmacy networks, mail order options, and prior
authorization requirements.26 In identifying consumer-specific quality preferences for in-
surance brands, we maintain the revealed preference assumption and infer that they view
their chosen brand as superior to all others. In most cases, the brand-based quality indica-
tors subsume the star ratings because there is no within-brand variation in the star ratings.
However, in some cases CMS generated separate indexes for different plans within a given
brand. In these cases, both quality metrics enter our definition of suspect choices.
     Because we allow utility to depend on insurer dummies, a chosen plan will be dominated
if and only if the enrollee could have chosen a different plan offered by the same insurer
that would have lowered the mean and variance of her drug expenditures, or lowered one
holding the other constant. The second row of Table 2 shows that 19% of beneficiaries
actively enrolled in dominated plans in 2006, declining to 15% in 2010. The decline is
partly due to people switching out of dominated plans and partly due to new enrollees being
less likely to select a dominated plan.
     We base our primary approach to identifying suspect choices on the union of dominated


25
   In cases where CMS did not have the person’s drug claims from the prior year, such as 2006, we predicted their deciles based on
current and future drug claims and past, current and future health.
26
   For example, stringent prior authorization requirements for certain drugs may be unattractive to consumers who believe they have a
high likelihood of purchasing those drugs and irrelevant to consumers who do not. Likewise, consumers differ in their proximity to in-
network pharmacies. These factors vary across insurance brands and consumers but not across plans within a brand.



                                                                                                                                  26
plan choices and knowledge test failures. Between 38% and 54% of choices are assigned
to this group each year, as shown by the middle row of Table 2. This definition recognizes
that decision makers may understand how the market works in general without becoming
informed about their individual choice sets. It also recognizes that decision makers may
enroll in undominated plans even if they do not understand how the market works. In both
cases, we suspect that choices will fail to reveal preferences. Conversely, if a decision
maker passes the knowledge test and her enrollment choice can be explained by a well-
behaved utility function then theory and data provide no basis for rejecting revealed pref-
erence assumptions, and we assign her to the non-suspect group.

                 B. Alternative Approaches to Defining Suspect Choices

  Table 2 previews the sensitivity of our findings to replacing our primary approach with
alternatives that are either more inclusive or more exclusive in how they define suspect
choices. The last two columns report the shares of consumers with expected welfare gains
from counterfactual policies (analyzed in detail in section VII) that would limit insurers to
selling no more than two plans per market (menu restriction) or reassign enrollees to cost
minimizing plans but let them opt out (default assignment). Under our primary approach,
23% of consumers have expected welfare gains from the menu restriction whereas 81%
have expected welfare gains from the assignment rule.
  Rows 1 and 2 define suspect choices using the knowledge test alone and the dominated
plan test alone. Row 4 uses the union of both tests—like our primary approach—but im-
plements the dominated plan test assuming that consumers are myopic in the sense that
they expect their drug needs in the upcoming year to match their actual drug use in the
prior year: 𝐸(𝑐𝑖𝑗𝑡 ) = 𝑐𝑗𝑡 (𝑥𝑖𝑡−1 ). Because drug use is strongly persistent over time, this
yields similar results to Row 3. Comparing across rows, a majority of choices defined as
suspect in our primary definition are due to the consumers’ lack of knowledge about plan
design specifically rather than difficulty in forecasting their individual-specific drug utili-
zation. Row 5 extends our primary approach to include as suspect any enrollment decision
that results in the beneficiary being able to reduce costs by more than 50% by switching



                                                                                            27
plans. This approach is more consistent with Kling et al. (2012), Heiss et al. (2013) and
others who interpret money left on the table as a signal of poor decision making.
     As we expand the suspect group the shares of consumers who benefit from choice ar-
chitecture polices increase. However, the differentials are small. Moving from row 2 to
row 5 more than doubles the number of people in the suspect group but increases the num-
ber who benefit from the policies by less than half. The intuitive reason for this stability is
that when we add more people to the suspect group, the differences in observed behavior
between the average individual in the two groups diminish. Mechanically, |𝑉𝑖𝑗𝑛 0 − 𝑉𝑖𝑗𝑠0 |
                                                                                                                            ∗



tends to decrease for the marginal individual in the suspect group, lowering the probability
that she experiences a welfare gain from choice architecture policies. This feature of the
data makes our qualitative policy conclusions robust to how we define suspect choices
across a wide range of alternatives.

                              C. Who is More Likely to Make Suspect Choices?

     To develop intuition for potential mechanisms driving suspect choices, we estimate lin-
ear probability models in which the dependent variable, 𝑆𝑖𝑟𝑡 , is an indicator for whether
person i in CMS region r made a suspect choice in the year t enrollment cycle,

(14) 𝑆𝑖𝑟𝑡 = 𝜅 + λ𝑑𝑖𝑟𝑡 + ϕ𝑟 + ρ𝑡 + 𝑒𝑖𝑡 .

On the right of the equality 𝑑𝑖𝑟𝑡 is a vector of demographics, some of which change over
time, and ρ𝑡 and ϕ𝑟 are indicators for enrollment year and region.27
     The first column of Table 3 reports results for enrollment decisions from 2006-2010
using our primary approach to defining suspect choices. The omitted indicators define the
reference person as a 65 to 69 year old unmarried and retired white male with no high
school diploma who has not searched for information on CMS programs and makes his
own enrollment decisions. The coefficients imply that obtaining a college degree is asso-
ciated with a 5.8 percentage point reduction in the probability of making a suspect choice.

27
  These indicators capture variation in the complexity of choice sets across space and time. For example, in the first year of the program
the number of available plans per region ranged from 27 to 52. The number of plans also changed over time, increasing noticeably
between 2006 and 2007. This variation allows us to test the choice overload hypothesis that consumers are less likely to make informed
decisions as the number of options grows. Ketcham, Lucarelli and Powers (2015) test choice overload in Part D more extensively,
capitalizing on individual-specific variation in the number of plans available by the person’s relative cost of those plans.



                                                                                                                                      28
The probability is higher for nonwhites (+11.8) which might proxy for unobserved differ-
ences in wealth or education. The probability is lower for enrollees who searched for in-
formation about CMS programs using the internet (-9.0) or calling 1-800-Medicare (-5.8),
but it is not any lower for beneficiaries who had help making enrollment decisions.28

Note: The table reports coefficients and standard errors from linear probability models of individual’s plan choices. The dependent
variable equals one if we suspect the choice was misinformed. See the text for a formal definition. All explanatory variables are binary
except the number of available plans and the number of drug claims, both of which are standardized. The omitted indicators define the
baseline enrollee as a 65 to 69 year old white male who did not finish high school, has income below $25k, does not get help making
insurance decisions, has not searched for CMS information using the internet or 1-800-Medicare, has the mean number of drug claims,
and has not been diagnosed with dementia or depression. All regressions include indicators for enrollment year and region. Robust
standard errors are clustered by enrollee. *,**, and *** indicate the p-value is less than 0.1, 0.05, and 0.01 respectively.



     Looking at the administrative variables, the probability of making a suspect choice is


28
  The lower probability for those calling 1-800-Medicare is consistent with Kling et al.’s (2012) audit of the Medicare help line in which
actors calling the number for information found that customer service representatives consistently identified low-cost plans based on
the actors’ fictional drug needs. The positive (but insignificant) coefficient for those getting help could be driven by principal agent
problems, the helpers’ opportunity costs of time, and/or added complexity in the decision process because those getting help tend to use
more drugs and are more likely to be diagnosed with dementia and depression (Table 1).



                                                                                                                                      29
increasing in age, consistent with prior evidence on the decline in cognitive performance
for individuals over 65 (Agarwal et al. 2009, Tymula et al. 2013). The predicted probability
is approximately 7 percentage points higher for enrollees in their late 70’s and 12 percent-
age points higher for enrollees in their late 80’s. This is after controlling separately for
diagnosed cognitive illnesses normally associated with aging, namely dementia (+4.8), and
conditioning on the increased complexity of decision making associated with greater drug
needs via a measure of total drug claims (+2.7 for a one standard deviation increase in
claims). Having living children, even conditional on receiving help choosing, is associated
with a nearly 6 percent reduction in the probability of making a suspect choice. In compar-
ison, we find that income, gender, and marital status have small and statistically insignifi-
cant effects. We also obtain a precisely estimated zero on the number of available plans,
providing evidence against the hypothesis that choice overload causes suspect choices
(Ketcham, Lucarelli and Powers 2015).
     The second column of Table 3 shows that the results are largely unchanged if we drop
2006. We exclude 2006 enrollment decisions from our main analysis because of the im-
provement in knowledge question responses in 2007. Because consumers appear to have
learned during the inaugural year of the program, their choices in that first year may be less
informative for analyzing prospective policies. That said, we show that our main findings
are invariant to whether we include or exclude 2006 choices. Finally, the last two columns
show that most of the demographic associations are driven by the MCBS knowledge test.

                                        A. Main Multinomial Logit Results

     Table 4 presents the estimates that we use as the basis for policy experiments.29 The
first column reports results for a conventional model that ignores heterogeneity in consum-
ers’ decision-making processes by pooling data on suspect and non-suspect choices. The

  We also estimated more flexible models that interacted PDP attributes with more comprehensive sets of demographic variables.
However the additional interactions tend to have small and statistically insignificant effects (Table A5), which led us to use the more
parsimonious specification in Table 4. A notable result from the more comprehensive model is that enrollees who do and do not get help
making health insurance decisions make choices that imply virtually identical marginal rates of substitution between cost, variance, and
quality. The main difference between the two groups is that those who get help exhibit less inertia, as shown in Table 4.



                                                                                                                                    30
main effects have the expected signs and are precisely estimated, with the exception of
variance. Its insignificant coefficient mirrors the finding from Abaluck and Gruber (2011)
and Ketcham, Kuminoff and Powers (2016) that if we ignore heterogeneity in decision
making, then the representative enrollee appears to ignore risk protection.

no college degree and annual income below $25,000. This person is in the middle tercile of the distribution of total drug claims, did not
get help making an enrollment decision, and did not use the internet or 1-800-Medicare to search for information. Robust standard errors
are clustered by enrollee. *,**, and *** indicate that the p-value is less than 0.1, 0.05, and 0.01 respectively.

rately. Comparing main effects across the three columns reveals that the insignificant co-
efficient on variance in the pooled model is driven by aggregating over heterogeneous de-
cision making processes for the suspect and non-suspect groups. Taken literally, the coef-
ficient on variance for the suspect group implies they are risk loving. In contrast, the non-
suspect group is risk averse at levels consistent with findings from prior studies (Cohen
and Einav 2007, Handel 2013, Handel and Kolstad 2015). For example, our results imply
that enrollees in the non-suspect group would be indifferent between a 50-50 bet of winning
$1,000 and losing between $854.7 and $937.3.30 Further, the non-suspect group is more
sensitive to price with the implication that the monetary value of inertia—defined by di-
viding the switching indicators by the expected cost coefficient—is nearly three times
larger for the suspect group.
     Focusing on non-suspect choices in column 2, the interaction coefficients are consistent
with intuition. Interactions between cost and indicators for whether the beneficiary is in the
top or bottom terciles of the claims distribution imply that the marginal utility of income
declines as people become sicker. People who have previously taken the time to search for
information about Medicare programs on the internet or by calling 1-800-Medicare tend to
be more sensitive to price and to have stronger preferences for CMS’s “star rating” index
of overall plan quality which is based, in part, on customer satisfaction. Preferences for
plan quality are also higher among higher income enrollees. One explanation is that the
opportunity cost of time is increasing in income and that choosing a higher quality plan
reduces the time and effort required to interact with the insurer.
     Inertia tends to be lower for people who get help choosing a plan and who searched for
information about CMS programs, whereas it tends to be higher for people who are older,
nonwhite and who have higher incomes, though some of these effects are imprecisely es-
timated. The income effect could again be due to heterogeneity in the opportunity cost of
time. The directions of these effects are mostly consistent across the suspect and non-sus-
pect groups, but the monetary implications are larger for the suspect group. The average
non-suspect enrollee would have to be paid $846 to hold their utility constant if they were

30
  These calculations are based on the fact that our specification for utility provides a 1st order approximation to a CARA model. Our
calculations are additional discussion are provided in Table A6 and associated discussion in the supplemental appendix.



                                                                                                                                 32
randomly reassigned to a different plan offered by the same insurer or $1,292 if they were
reassigned to a plan offered by a different insurer. Comparable figures for the suspect group
are $1,888 and $2,958. The fact that we see greater inertia for between-insurer switches
compared to within-insurer switches is consistent with the inertia parameters reflecting la-
tent preferences and hassle costs. Between-insurer switches are likely to require more time
and effort than within-insurer switches as different plans offered by the same insurer tend
to have the same formularies, pharmacy networks, customer service, and so on. In contrast,
insurers typically differ along these dimensions, so that switching insurers may require new
prior authorization requests, transferring prescriptions to new pharmacies, and becoming
familiar with new formulary and customer service systems. Psychological biases might
also be greater for between-brand switches.

                                                    B. Validation Tests

     A potential concern with our approach to modeling heterogeneity in consumer decision
making is that it could be overfitting the data and consequently yielding less accurate pre-
dictions for how consumers will respond to prospective policies. We assess the model’s
predictive power by using validation tests similar to Keane and Wolpin (2007) and Galiani,
Murphy, and Pantano (2015). The idea is to compare the out of sample predictions from
our model with the standard pooled model that assumes a homogeneous decision process.
Our validation test is powered by the largest year-to-year change in the PDP choice set that
occurred during our study period. Between 2008 and 2009, the number of plans fell by
10%. We use data from 2008 to estimate the standard and refined models and then use each
set of estimates to predict how consumers would adapt to their new choice sets in 2009.31
Table A7 shows that among suspect choosers the refined model more accurately predicts
the share that chose dominated plans; the share that chose the least expensive plans offered
by their insurers; mean expenditures; the average amount that consumers who chose dom-
inated plans could save by switching; and the share who chose to switch plans and the share
who chose plans with gap coverage. The refined model likewise outperforms the pooled

31
  We exclude indicators for insurance brand because some new insurers joined the market in 2009 so we are unable to estimate indicators
for them in 2008.



                                                                                                                                   33
model in making out-of-sample predictions for the choices of non-suspect choosers for all
but two of these measures. Overall, this exercise suggests that distinguishing between sus-
pect and non-suspect choice processes improves the model’s predictive power out of sam-
ple.
       As an indirect test of our maintained assumption that people in the suspect and non-
suspect groups share the same underlying utility parameters, conditional on demographics
and prescription drug use, we leverage the panel structure of our data to repeat the estima-
tion for four mutually exclusive sets of enrollment decisions: (1) choices made by enrollees
who always make suspect choices (n=3,311); (2) suspect choices made by enrollees who
sometimes make non-suspect choices (n=560); (3) non-suspect choices made by enrollees
who sometimes make suspect choices (n=634); and (4) choices made by enrollees who
always make non-suspect choices (n=4,616). The results, shown in Tables A8-A9, reveal
that the estimated marginal rates of substitution between cost, variance, and quality are
similar between groups 1 and 2, and between groups 3 and 4, despite some reduction in
statistical precision. In other words, when people who switch between the suspect and non-
suspect groups make non-suspect choices they behave in similar ways to the people who
always make non-suspect choices. This supports the assumptions underlying our approach
of using non-suspect preference parameters to predict welfare effects for people in the sus-
pect group.


                   VII.    Evaluating Prospective Choice Architecture Policies

         A. Bounding the Estimated Outcomes using Signals of Consumers’ Information

       Section III explained our approach to bounding the welfare effect of inertia and the
policy’s effect on consumer behavior. We use these bounds to report results for two ex-
treme cases. At one extreme is the case where the policy is “most effective” as a nudge in
the sense that it causes the suspect group to start behaving like the non-suspect group and
the inertia parameters estimated for the non-suspect group reflect psychological bias and
hence have no direct effect on welfare, i.e. using equation 7’ and 9’ with 𝑉𝑖𝑘𝑛1 and 𝜓𝑖𝑘
                                                                                      𝑛1
                                                                                         . At
the other extreme is the case where the policy is “least effective” as a nudge in that it does



                                                                                           34
not change the suspect group’s behavior and the inertia parameters for the non-suspect
group reflect the hassle cost of switching plans and/or preferences for latent plan attributes
and hence are welfare relevant (i.e. using equations 7 and 9).32 To provide statistical bounds
on our estimates, we report the 2.5th percentile from a 100 replication bootstrap for the least
effective scenario and the 97.5th percentile for the most effective scenario.

                       B. The Distributional Effects of a Particular Menu Restriction
     In early 2014, CMS proposed a series of changes to Medicare Part D that included a
provision to limit each parent organization to offering no more than one basic and one
enhanced plan per region (Department of Health and Human Services 2014).33,34 This
would have forced some current enrollees to switch plans. While the proposal was contro-
versial and has yet to be implemented, it provides an opportunity to investigate the effects
of a realistic menu restriction.
     CMS must approve each PDP that an insurer offers, but the proposed regulation did not
specify how, exactly, CMS would determine which plans to retain. Therefore, we start by
assuming that CMS would require each sponsor to continue to offer their most popular
plans; i.e. the single basic plan and the single enhanced plan with the highest enrollments.35
Then we consider alternative rules as robustness checks. The menu restriction reduces the
number of plans on the average enrollee’s menu from 47 to 31.
     The menu restriction affects consumer welfare in several ways. First, people will be
made worse off if their utility maximizing plans are eliminated. Second, individuals who
switch plans may incur utility costs of switching. Third, individuals in the suspect group
may be made better off if the policy forces them to switch out of a dominated plan or if
contracting their choice sets reduces their inertia and nudges them to switch to plans that



32
   Alternatively, one could solve jointly for a continuous fraction of inertia that is welfare relevant and a continuous fraction of suspect
group consumers who start behaving like their analogs in the non-suspect group in order to minimize and maximize particular moments
of the distribution of welfare effects.
33
   “Parent organizations” or “sponsors” are entities that contract with CMS to sell PDPs. They may include multiple brand names. Basic
plans may differ in design but must be deemed actuarially equivalent to the standard benefits package for some representative enrollee(s).
Enhanced plans offer supplemental benefits.
34
   The proposal included the rationale to “…ensure that beneficiaries can choose from a less confusing number of plans that represent
the best value each sponsor can offer” (Federal Register 2014).
35
   This is consistent with our interpretation of CMS’ impact analysis (Federal Register 2014).



                                                                                                                                        35
are cheaper, higher quality, and provide better insurance against health shocks. The mag-
nitude of each of these gains or losses depends on which plans are eliminated and the rel-
ative benefits of switching.

Note: The figure shows CDFs of the expected change in welfare from limiting each insurer to selling one basic plan and one enhanced
plan, assuming that CMS requires insurers to keep the plans with the highest current enrollment. The small dotted lines represent the
nonparametric 95% upper bound on the most effective nudge and the 95% lower bound on the least effective nudge based on a 100
replication bootstrap. The bar graphs show the fractions of consumers with welfare gains by demographic group and the numbers above
or below each bar report average consumer surplus within the groups.



    To summarize results we start by focusing on the case in which CMS requires each
insurer to retain their basic and enhanced plans with the highest numbers of enrollees. Fig-
ure 1 summarizes the distributional effects on the beneficiary population. It shows CDFs
of the expected consumer surplus under the “most effective” and “least effective” scenarios
for the efficacy of the policy in nudging consumers (henceforth ME and LE). The bar charts
in the lower half of the figure summarize the average changes in expected consumer surplus
and the shares of consumers with expected welfare gains under the ME scenario for several
types of people who might be of interest to policymakers: (i) those making suspect choices,


                                                                                                                                             36
or not, (ii) those in the top quartile of the distribution of total drug claims, or not, (iii) those
with dementia or depression, or not, (iv) those with income over $25,000, or not, and (v)
those with a college degree, or not.36 In both the ME and LE scenarios fewer than 25% of
consumers are made better off by the menu restriction. Further, the median consumer in
every one of the 10 demographic groups is made worse off. While those in the suspect
group have larger average gains and a higher probability of gains than those in the non-
suspect group (the bootstrap confidence intervals show these are significantly different at
1%) even the median consumer in the suspect group is expected to lose from menu re-
strictions.
     Figure 2 summarizes the mechanisms that drive welfare effects in the ME and LE sce-
narios. It reports the shares of winners and losers who are forced to switch because the
policy eliminates their default plans, followed by the expected reductions in their premiums
and OOP expenditures, the expected reductions in their expenditure variances, and the ex-
pected increases in plan quality (both the CMS quality index and the index of latent quality
defined by the insurer dummy variables). Changes in variance and quality are converted to
dollar equivalents using the non-suspect group’s marginal utility of income.
     In the ME scenario just under 25% of consumers are made better off.37 Nearly half of
those winners are forced to switch plans. Many of the people who are forced to switch,
particularly those in the suspect group, are better off from switching because their new
plans provide more generous coverage and there is no utility cost of switching in the ME
scenario. Furthermore, by assumption, people in the suspect group now place more empha-
sis on cost and risk protection when selecting plans. As a result, the average winner pays
$21 less in expected premiums and $41 less in expected out of pocket costs after the policy.
Their expected risk exposure declines by an amount equivalent to a certain payment of $4
and they have an expected improvement in plan quality worth just over $10 (summing the
effects of the CMS index and insurer dummies). Nevertheless, most people experience
welfare losses because they become enrolled in plans with higher costs and they have more


36
  This comparison is less interesting in the LE scenario because in that scenario virtually all consumers have welfare losses.
37
  We code anyone with changes in welfare of |$0.01| or less as having no change. In tables 5, 6, and 7 the percentages of consumers
with no change in welfare equal 100 minus the reported percentages with welfare gains and losses.



                                                                                                                               37
desirable plans eliminated. A small number of consumers, particularly those in the non-
suspect group, experience relatively large losses because the policy eliminates their chosen
plans, resulting in substantially higher expected premiums and lower expected quality.

Note: The table shows the sensitivity of outcomes to the menu restriction rule. Max enrollment is the baseline that corresponds to figures
1 and 2. Max frontier retains the basic and enhanced plans with the highest shares of enrollees on the efficiency frontier. Min expenditure
retains plans with the lowest average expenditures. Max profit allows insurers to retain the plans with the highest average profit per
enrollee. Standard errors from a 100 replication bootstrap are in parentheses.



    In the LE scenario, only 2% of consumers are made better off. For most people, the
utility loss from being forced to switch plans more than offsets the cost savings, risk re-
duction, and improvements in plan quality experienced by switchers. The small fraction of
winners is comprised entirely of individuals in the suspect group who have large reductions
in expected premiums and expected OOP costs. Hence, if we think that inertia primarily
reflects hassle costs and consumer preferences, then the menu restriction significantly


                                                                                                                                          38
harms the vast majority of consumers in exchange for small benefits for a small share of
people in the suspect group who become less able to choose inferior plans.
     The first two columns of Table 5 summarize the shares of people who have their default
plans eliminated by the policy, the average changes in expected welfare per enrollee, the
shares of winners and losers and the changes in insurer revenue per enrollee. The ME sce-
nario predicts a net effect on consumer welfare that is statistically indistinguishable from
zero, as large gains for a small fraction of consumers offset smaller losses for the majority.
The LE scenario predicts a statistically significant mean welfare reduction of -$107, as 99
percent of consumers are made worse off. The last six columns show comparable results
for three other hypothetical rules for how CMS could determine which plans to keep on
the menu: the plans that are on the efficiency frontier for the greatest number of people;
the plans with the minimum average cost to the enrollee; and the plans with the highest net
revenue per enrollee.38 Our results on consumer welfare are qualitatively robust across
these scenarios. The most striking differences are the reductions in consumer welfare that
occurs when insurers are allowed to retain their highest profit plans. Under the LE scenario,
welfare is expected to fall by $219, amounting to 15.6% of enrollees’ average spending.

                         C. Distributional Effects of Personalized Decision Support

     Our second policy experiment is a hypothetical decision support tool modeled on a ran-
domized field experiment conducted by Kling, Mullainathan, Shafir, Vermeulen, and
Wrobel (2012) [henceforth KMSVW]. Their study is motivated by the observation that
while Medicare enrollees can learn about their PDP options and potential savings by calling
1-800-Medicare or using various online cost calculators, a minority of enrollees report do-
ing so, as seen in Table A1. KMSVW attribute this to “comparison friction” which they
define as the wedge between available information and consumers’ use of it. KMSVW
tested an intervention in which several hundred treatment group enrollees were sent a de-
cision support letter containing personalized information about their potential personal cost
savings from switching to their lowest cost available plan. The letter also identified the

38
  For profitability, we assume that there is sufficiently little variation in costs of plan operations and management per enrollee within
the set of plans offered by each insurer that it does not affect the ranking of plans by revenue per enrollee.



                                                                                                                                     39
name of the low cost insurer and contact information to initiate a switch. KMSVW estimate
a 7 percentage point increase in the rate at which the treatment group switched to the plan
identified in the letter relative to a control group that received a general letter with no per-
sonalized decision support, and an 11.5 percentage point increase in the overall switching
rate for the treatment group.
     We estimate the welfare effects of a prospective national rollout of the decision support
tool in which the government mails letters to all existing enrollees that would be worded
similarly to the one sent to KMSVW’s treatment group. Because the information relies on
prior drug claims, the policy would not affect new enrollees. Such a policy may affect
welfare via several pathways. First, providing enrollees with personalized information may
make them better off by mitigating psychological biases and/or reducing information costs.
In our model, this would be realized as increases in the switch rate and cost savings. Be-
cause KMSVW’s decision support tool does not embed information about risk protection
and quality, however, the net effect on welfare is ambiguous. Second, an important feature
of the information campaign—if it were implemented by the government—is that it would
necessarily be based on incomplete information about enrollees’ drug needs. While CMS
has full information about existing enrollees’ individual claims over their prior years in the
PDP market, individuals may have private information about their own drug needs over
the upcoming year. If enrollees with private information about changes in their drug needs
choose to switch plans based on outdated information provided by CMS then these misin-
formed individuals could experience welfare losses.39
     We cannot perfectly anticipate how much or which consumers will respond to infor-
mation treatments, and such effects are likely to depend on specific aspects of the imple-
mentation of the policy. Given this limitation, we use the point estimates and confidence
intervals of the information experiment in KMSVW to calibrate 𝑉𝑖𝑗𝑛1 and 𝑉𝑖𝑗𝑠1 . Specifically,
in the ME scenario we multiply the estimated inertia parameters by 𝜔1 (1 + 𝜔2 1{𝑗 = 𝑗 ∗ })




39
  In principle such a phenomenon could occur if the free but imperfect information from CMS reduces individuals’ efforts to acquire
private information about their own future drug needs. Carlin, Gervais, and Manso (2013) explore these ideas more generally.



                                                                                                                               40
as shown in (15) and (16), where 1{𝑗 = 𝑗 ∗ } is an indicator for whether plan j is the individ-
ual’s minimum cost plan that would be featured in the letter. We calibrate 𝜔1 to generate
a 7 percentage point increase in the rate at which the treatment group switches to their
lowest cost plan relative to the baseline we observe in the data, and we calibrate 𝜔2 to
simultaneously generate an 11.5 percentage point increase in the overall switch rate subject
to the constraints that 0 ≤ 𝜔1 , 𝜔2 , 𝜔1 + 𝜔2 ≤ 1.

   In the LE scenario, there is assumed to be no change in the behavior of the suspect group
so we use (15) and (17), in which case 𝜔1 and 𝜔2 will have to be larger than in the ME
scenario in order to induce sufficient switching among the non-suspect group to replicate
the treatment effects estimated by KSMVW.
   Figure 3 summarizes the distributional effects of the decision support tool using
KMSVW’s point estimates. In the ME scenario 81 percent of consumers are made better
off by the policy. As shown in the bar charts in Figure 3, those who made suspect choices
under the status quo policy are more likely to win and experience larger gains than those
who did not (significant at 1%) and those with the highest number of drug claims are ex-
pected to have larger average gains than those with fewer claims (significant at 1%), but
we do not find any other notable differences across demographic groups. In the LE sce-
nario, the share of consumers with welfare gains declines to 48 percent because the suspect
group is assumed to ignore the information treatment. Thus, they are unaffected by the
policy.

Note: The figure shows CDFs of the expected change in welfare from a personalized decision support tool that is based on the field
experiments of Kling et al. (2012). The model is calibrated to reproduce their estimated treatment effects on the rates at which people
switch plans. The small dotted lines represent the nonparametric 95% upper bound on the most effective nudge and the 95% lower
bound on the least effective nudge based on a 100 replication bootstrap. The bar charts show the fractions of consumers with welfare
gains by demographic group and the numbers above or below each bar report average consumer surplus within the groups.



    To reveal the mechanisms underlying the welfare losses, Table A10 shows that under
both scenarios, those with welfare losses had much larger changes in actual OOP drug
spending between 2009 and 2010. This is because the low cost plan featured in the infor-
mation treatment is the one that minimizes their expenditures based on their 2009 drug
claims. Some of the people who experience significant health shocks would have spent
substantially more in their government recommended minimum cost plans than in the plans
that they actually chose for themselves in 2010. These individuals are more likely to have
made non-suspect choices. This illustrates the potential welfare losses that can arise from
a nudge based on incomplete information. More broadly, this suggests a tradeoff between
the potential benefits of simplifying the presentation of information and the potential costs
of deemphasizing important details about the assumptions underlying that information.




                                                                                                                                                                                              42
This tradeoff may occur in many settings. For instance, in work subsequent to ours, Aba-
luck and Gruber (2016) describe a decision support tool that was intended to help Oregon
school district employees choose health insurance plans but actually failed to correctly
identify cost-minimizing plans for many employees because the tool relied on simplifying
assumptions that failed to capture the complexity of plan benefit rules.

Note: The table shows the sensitivity of outcomes to the assumed form of decision makers’ expectations for their own drug needs in the
upcoming year. The baseline scenario that corresponds to figures 3 and 4 (perfect foresight) assumes that decision makers accurately
forecast changes in their drug needs. The myopia scenario assumes that decision makers expect their future drug needs to be identical
to the prior year. Standard errors from a 100 replication bootstrap are in parentheses.



    The first two columns of Table 6 provide summary statistics for the outcomes under the
ME and LE scenarios while maintaining our model’s assumption that consumers have un-
biased expectations of their actual drug use in the upcoming year. The average welfare
gains range from $28 to $103. The unbiased expectations assumption could cause us to
understate the policy’s benefits. If consumers are myopic in the sense that they expect their
drug use to be the same as the prior year then the information treatment has less scope to
reduce some consumers’ welfare. The last two columns of Table 6 demonstrate this and
show that when we repeat the estimation and simulation based on the assumption that con-
sumers are myopic when they enroll in insurance plans, then between 54% and 92% of
consumers benefit from the policy and the average change in welfare is an increase of



                                                                                                                                  43
between $62 and $158. This scenario replaces our primary suspect choice indicator (Table
2, row 3) with the alternative one based on ex ante costs (Table 2, row 4).
  Finally, while KMSVW provide the only empirical evidence available to calibrate the
amount of plan switching that would be triggered by the decision support tool, we need not
focus exclusively on their point estimates. Appendix Table A11 shows that the results in
Table 6 are qualitatively unchanged if we instead calibrate our model to upper or lower
bounds on a 90% confidence interval on KMSVW’s reported point estimates.

             D. Distributional Effects of Default Assignment to a Low Cost Plan

  Our final policy experiment replaces CMS’s current approach to defining each person’s
default plan for reenrollment as the plan they previously chose for themselves with a policy
that would set the default plan to be the one that minimizes CMS’s expectation for each
enrollee’s costs. We envision the policy being implemented as a stronger version of the
decision support tool. Instead of informing enrollees of their minimum cost options, the
enrollees would be automatically assigned to those options unless they chose to opt out by
overriding the reassignment and choosing a different plan. As before, we assume that CMS
would predict each enrollee’s minimum cost plan using their drug claims from the prior
year. Consistent with CMS’s current approach, first-time enrollees would still be required
to make active decisions.
  In the ME scenario, the policy completely erases inertia for enrollment in the new low-
cost default. Nevertheless, some consumers may still prefer their original plans if those
plans provide greater quality or variance reduction. Assuming it is costless for enrollees to
opt out and continue in their old plans, under ME assumptions the policy could reduce
consumer welfare from (mis)assignment to plans requiring higher expenditureS due to
changes in drug needs or by reducing the probability of switching to higher cost plans that
also provide higher utility due to superior risk protection and/or quality. Figure 4 shows
that for a large share of consumers the net change is dominated by the aggregate effect of
lower expenditures and the elimination of inertia. Overall, just over 80% of consumers
have gains in expected welfare in both scenarios, and this is accompanied by reductions in




                                                                                          44
insurer revenue of $42 to $128 as shown in Table 7.40

     FIGURE 4: DISTRIBUTION OF WELFARE EFFECTS FROM ASSIGNMENT TO A DEFAULT PLAN




Note: The figure shows CDFs of the expected change in welfare from automatically assigning people to default plans, assuming it is
costless to opt out. People are automatically assigned to the plan that would minimize their expenditures based on their prior year of
drug use. The small dotted lines represent the nonparametric 95% upper bound on the most effective nudge and the 95% lower bound
on the least effective nudge based on a 100 replication bootstrap.


      In the LE scenario, being assigned to a default plan does not eliminate the hassle cost of
learning to navigate a plan offered by a different insurer (e.g. prior authorization paper-
work, new pharmacy networks, new customer service protocols). To account for this we
recalibrate the model so that the policy reduces the cost of switching to the low-cost default
from 𝜂̂ 𝑖𝑡 Δ𝐵𝑖𝑗𝑡 + 𝛿̂𝑖𝑡 Δ𝑃𝑖𝑗𝑡 to (𝜂̂ 𝑖𝑡 − 𝛿̂𝑖𝑡 )Δ𝐵𝑖𝑗𝑡 . Under this interpretation, the welfare-rele-
vant hassle costs are the difference in the estimated cost of switching between brands rel-
ative to switching within brands. The continued presence of navigation costs reduces the
share of enrollees choosing their assigned default to 14%.41 The right half of Table 7 shows

40
   We do not find any differences in average gains or the probability of gain across observed consumer attributes, so we suppress the
complementary bar chart for brevity.
41
   This approach may still overstate benefits to the extent that 𝜂̂ and 𝛿̂ represent latent preferences. As we increase the post-policy cost
of switching to the new default option to 𝜂̂ Δ𝐵𝑖𝑗𝑡 + 𝛿̂ Δ𝑃𝑖𝑗𝑡 the benefits to consumers approach zero. The extreme case in which 𝜂̂ and 𝛿̂
are entirely latent preferences is equivalent to reverting to the pre-policy equilibrium in which case the policy has no effect on consumer
welfare.



                                                                                                                                        45
that the share of consumers who benefit, their average welfare gain, and the implications
for government spending and insurer revenue are virtually unchanged if we repeat the es-
timation and simulation under the assumption that consumers have myopic expectations of
their own drug needs for the upcoming year.

    Table 7 also illustrates the importance of the design of the opt-out feature. People may
incur some disutility from the time and effort required to pay attention to the new policy,
learn how the opt-out feature works, determine whether they prefer their newly assigned
default to their old plan and, if not, to exercise their opt out option. Under the assumption
that everyone faces the same disutility parameter from opting out we solve for the mean
opt-out cost needed to set the average change in expected welfare to zero. It ranges from a
low of $65 in the LE scenario with unbiased expectations to a high of $198 in the ME
scenario under myopia. When people incur such utility losses from opting out, some of
them choose the newly assigned default even when it is welfare reducing relative to their
prior plan in the absence of opt out costs.

                                  E. Robustness of the Policy Experiment Results




                                                                                                                                        46
  The validation section demonstrates that incorporating signals of consumers’ knowledge
to stratify the sample into suspect and non-suspect choices substantially improves the
model’s performance. To explore how this stratification affects predictions for the welfare
effects of counterfactual policies, we repeat each policy experiment using a conventional
“pooled” model in which we make no distinction between choice types, similar to Lu-
carelli, Prince and Simon (2012). We use the parameters shown in the first columns of
Table 4 for the welfare calculations. For consistency, we continue to define the least effec-
tive scenario as the case where inertia represents welfare-relevant factors, and the most
effective scenario as the case when inertia is irrelevant for welfare. Likewise, for the deci-
sion support tool, we calibrate the inertia discount factors in the pooled model to reproduce
the point estimates for switching rates from KMSVW.
  The first two rows of Table 8 contrast the pooled model’s predictions for changes in
consumer welfare with the predictions based our primary approach to defining suspect
choices (repeated from Tables 5-7). Panel A reports the change in expected welfare per
enrollee and Panel B reports the fraction of enrollees with expected welfare gains. The
columns match the policy scenarios summarized in prior tables and figures. In four out of
six scenarios, the pooled model understates the average welfare gain relative to the strati-
fied model. The difference is especially large in the least effective scenario for the decision
support tool. In this case, the conventional pooled model presumes that nobody can be
made better off by being nudged to switch plans, whereas the stratified model recognizes
that the decision support tool may be welfare improving for those in the suspect group who
are induced to switch.
  Differences in the models’ average predictions mask even larger differences in their
expected distributional implications. Table 9 reports the changes in expected welfare per
enrollee for the average individual in the suspect and non-suspect groups using estimates
from the pooled model (first column of Table 4) and stratified model (last two columns of
Table 4). Averaging over both groups, conditional on model, yields the mean welfare
changes reported in the first two rows of Table 8. The results show that the stratified model
tends to predict larger welfare gains for the consumers that we assign to the suspect group



                                                                                            47
and smaller gains for those we assign to the non-suspect group. For instance, the stratified
model predicts $6 increase in expected welfare in the most effective scenario for the menu
restriction. This small average change obscures the expected $75 gain for the mean suspect
consumer and a $37 loss for the mean non-suspect consumer. In contrast, the pooled
model’s predicted $11 reduction in average welfare reflects mean losses of $6 and $14 for
consumers in the suspect and non-suspect groups. These differences illustrate how gener-
alizing the conventional model to allow for heterogeneity in the decision process may im-
prove our ability to characterize distributional welfare effects of policies.
  Next, to assess the importance of our choice among the available signals that could be
used to identify suspect choices, Table 8 rows (3) through (6) repeat our analysis using
alternative combinations of suspect choice indicators from Table 2. Row (3) modifies our
primary approach (row 2) by replacing the ex post measure of costs with the ex ante meas-
ure. Row (4) uses a more inclusive definition of suspect choices based on the union of
dominated plan choices, the knowledge question, and being able to reduce expenditures by
more than 50%. Row (5) defines suspect choices based solely on dominated plans whereas
row (6) defines suspect choices based solely on the MCBS knowledge question. These
results collectively show that altering how suspect choices are defined has little effect on
our main qualitative results. The reason is that when we classify a greater share of choices
as suspect, the difference between 𝜃 𝑠 and 𝜃 𝑛 declines. More people benefit from certain
simplifications to choice architecture, but the average gain among those who benefit is
smaller. These effects offset each other in a way that leads to small increases in expected
welfare in some scenarios and small decreases in expected welfare in others.
  For our final set of robustness checks, we refine the sample in multiple ways and report
results using our primary definition of suspect choices. In Row (7) we exclude 3,358
choices made by enrollees who first entered the market mid-year. A potential concern in
that they may have been forward looking with respect to the following year’s drug needs
at the time they made their enrollment decisions, especially as they neared or entered the
open enrollment period for the following year. Dropping them has little effect on our re-
sults. In Row (8) we drop 4,044 choices made by enrollees (44% of our sample) who had



                                                                                         48
help choosing a plan or relied on a proxy to choose a plan for them. The logit estimates and
subsequent policy implications are similar to the full sample. This suggests that while the
research value of having access to better information on how family, friends, and advisors
influence decision making is self-evident, in our context of Medicare Part D it does not
alter the predicted effects of policy reforms. Finally, in Row (9) we include data from 2006,
the inaugural year of the Medicare Part D program. Again, this only produces minimal
changes in our estimates relative to our primary results in Row (2).

                 VIII. Caveats and Opportunities for Future Research

  Our analysis relies on three important maintained assumptions. First, our assessment of
counterfactual choice outcomes embeds the assumption that the demand for prescription
drugs is perfectly inelastic, ignoring moral hazard. Second, we have abstracted from sys-
tematic unobserved preference heterogeneity within the suspect and non-suspect groups.
Third, we do not model supply-side adjustments to the set of plans and plan attributes,
including premiums. These assumptions are common in the literature and serve as caveats
to our policy conclusions and opportunities for further research.

                                      A. Moral Hazard

  Several articles have estimated how changes in insurance generosity due to Part D al-
tered peoples’ subsequent drug consumption under varying assumptions about consumers’
information (Einav, Finkelstein and Schrimpf 2015, Dalton, Gowrisankaran and Town
2018). Incorporating such moral hazard into models of consumers’ PDP choices is com-
plex. Heterogeneity in demand elasticities exist across people as well as across drugs
(Einav, Finkelstein and Polyakova 2017) and even within a person across health states.
Modeling such heterogeneity could potentially change the distributional effects of the pol-
icies that we analyze. Further complicating the implications for consumer surplus is the
fact that taxpayer subsidies pay for a substantial share of the cost of higher drug consump-
tion that occurs under more generous plans. This implies that, unlike Erickson and Starc



                                                                                                            50
(2016), we cannot a priori sign the average bias in our prospective consumer surplus esti-
mates that occurs due to our assumption of no moral hazard for prescription drugs.
     Embedding moral hazard in drug consumption into a model of PDP choice is a poten-
tially important direction for future research. We are unaware of any model of consumer
choice among health insurance plans in general or Part D specifically that has incorporated
moral hazard to allow the discrete bundle of medical care products consumed to vary
within-person across plans in a way that would affect utility through expenditures and
health.42 Excluding such moral hazard has been a standard maintained assumption in re-
search on consumer decision making in Part D (e.g. Abaluck and Gruber 2011, Ketcham,
Kuminoff and Powers 2016, Ho, Hogan and Scott-Morton 2017) and in other health insur-
ance markets (e.g. Erickson and Starc 2016). Handel and Kolstad (2015) perhaps come
closest to relaxing this assumption. While they also excluded medical consumption from
their empirical model of plan choice they performed an ex post analysis of how much moral
hazard must exist to rationalize a person’s plan choice.
     The omission of within-person variation in drug consumption across plans is one spe-
cific example of a more general concern about the endogeneity of plan premiums due to
unobserved quality differences. This is a common but typically unaddressed concern about
empirical models of consumers’ choices of insurance plans including prior work on Part
D. While imperfect, our approach mitigates such concerns by its incorporation of hetero-
geneity by observed consumer attributes, the use of individual-specific drug claims, the
inertia parameters and the brand dummies. Together these account for what might other-
wise be omitted quality. The general concern in insurance markets is that the estimated
parameters on premiums (included here in the total cost measure) would be biased upward
(that is, toward zero or even positive) if higher premium plans have higher unobserved
quality. In this case, our estimate of the average welfare changes under the prospective
policies will be biased toward zero. The effects of such bias on the distribution of winners
and losers, however, is uncertain a priori.



42
  Prior reduced form analysis of spending in Part D by two of the authors incorporated estimates of the average price elasticity of
demand for prescription drugs (Ketcham, Lucarelli, Miravete, and Roebuck 2012, Ketcham, Lucarelli, and Powers 2015).



                                                                                                                               51
                            B. Latent Preference Heterogeneity

  Although we utilize rich demographic data to characterize heterogeneity in preferences
for PDP attributes, our model excludes unobserved heterogeneity aside from the Type I EV
preference shocks. To investigate the scope for additional forms of latent preference heter-
ogeneity to affect our results, we repeated estimation of the models in Table 4 after adding
independent, normally distributed random coefficients for variance and plan quality. These
coefficients allow for latent heterogeneity in the marginal rates of substitution between
observable measures of plan cost, variance and quality. The results are reported in Appen-
dix Table A12. For the suspect group, the standard deviations for the random coefficients
are statistically indistinguishable from zero. We find evidence that the quality coefficient
varies within the non-suspect group even after conditioning on their observable de-
mographics, but its mean is nearly identical to our main specification, as are all of the other
model parameters. Because the quality coefficient is relatively unimportant in explaining
welfare effects of counterfactual policies (e.g. Figure 2) this heterogeneity has little scope
to change our conclusions. Further, the random coefficients yield virtually no improvement
in model fit. The decline in the log-likelihood function value from adding MCBS demo-
graphic variables is approximately 50 times larger than the subsequent decline from adding
random coefficients for the non-suspect group. Our findings suggest that in the context of
Part D, the incremental benefit of accounting for unobserved preference heterogeneity is
low when our models already embed heterogeneity on a wide set of observed de-
mographics.
  In contrast with these low benefits of extending the model to allow for heterogeneity on
unobserved preferences, the complexity from doing so is high. With such a model, welfare
analysis for individuals in the suspect group would require us to define welfare-relevant
reference points within the joint distribution of random parameters estimated for the non-
suspect group. For instance, the welfare measures in (9) and (9’) could be evaluated at the
mean non-suspect parameter values, or at other moments of the distribution of non-suspect
parameters, or by integrating over the distribution of non-suspect parameters. Keane et al.
(2018) extend our framework to implement this approach, using a finite mixture of mixed



                                                                                            52
logit models (with normal mixing) that allows for estimation of preference parameter vec-
tors for a finite set of latent decision-making types. Such approaches are likely to be espe-
cially useful in settings where rich data on consumer demographics are not available.

                                             C. Supply-Side Adjustments

     A full equilibrium approach to simulating counterfactual equilibria would allow for dy-
namic interactions between consumers’ plan choices and insurers’ decisions regarding en-
try and exit and plan design.43 Others have modeled how Part D insurers may alter premi-
ums, but not other plan attributes, in response to prospective changes in the subsidy struc-
ture (Decarolis, Polyakova and Ryan 2015), switching costs (Polyakova 2016), inertia
(Fleitas 2017) and consumer inattention (Ho, Hogan and Scott Morton 2015).44 None have
modeled changes to choice architecture in Part D per se. Handel (2013) evaluated changes
in choice architecture in health insurance offerings at a single firm. He concluded that forc-
ing active choices by eliminating the ability to default to the same plan led to higher switch-
ing rates but worsened consumer welfare as greater adverse selection led to changes in
premiums. In his approach, consumers are myopic regarding premium adjustments: con-
sumers choose plans, then insurers adjust their premiums in response to the average cost
of their enrollees, and welfare is calculated. In practice, however, the dynamics of premium
setting are more complex: insurers forecast their costs based on their expected enrollees’
health care utilization, they set premiums, and then consumers enroll in plans based on the
posted premiums. The strong but imperfect link between premiums and enrollment deci-
sions is difficult to model without knowing which types of information consumers and
insurers incorporate into their choices for each plan year. Furthermore, even given any
assumption about such information, the equilibrium outcome is unlikely to be unique, if it



43
   A related limitation is that we do not model people’s decisions to participate in the PDP market. Choice architecture policies may
influence which people enroll in PDPs versus choosing a Medicare Advantage plan, an employer-sponsored plan, or being uninsured.
Such decisions may affect not only the individuals’ welfare, but also have important average and distributional effects on other PDP
enrollees as premiums and other plan attributes adjust, e.g. due to adverse selection.
44
   Polyakova (2016) found that eliminating switching costs would lower adverse selection and increase consumer surplus primarily
through lower premiums. Fleitas (2017) underscored the welfare gains from reducing inertia in Part D given insurers’ dynamic price
setting by firms. Similarly Ho, Hogan and Scott Morton (2015) concluded that eliminating consumer inattention would lead to lower
levels and lower growth of prescription drug insurance premiums.



                                                                                                                                 53
exists (Stiglitz, Yun, and Kosenko 2018), and different outcomes will yield different wel-
fare implications.
     Due to these complexities, we do not attempt a full equilibrium analysis. Instead we
leverage our data and our demand model to yield descriptive evidence about the precursors
that plans respond to in their coverage and pricing decisions. To accomplish this, we cal-
culate changes in insurer revenue per enrollee, holding premiums fixed, after we estimate
each consumers’ probabilities of choosing each plan under each prospective policy. This
metric provides insights about the strength of insurers’ incentives to respond to prospective
government policies by adjusting premiums and other PDP attributes without having to
assume a parametric form for the PDP production function or having to model how it arises
from interactions between competing insurers, drug companies and the government. Our
expectation is that policies that reduce insurers’ revenues at the status quo premiums are
likely to lead to premium increases, reducing consumers’ surplus. Conversely, policies that
increase insurers’ revenues are likely to be eroded due to the competitive design of the
CMS bidding process or otherwise targeted by regulators. In fact, prior work found that
plan premiums are set near their marginal costs (Decarolis, Polyakova and Ryan 2015),
     Equation (18) defines the change in insurer revenue per enrollee:

                 1                               1

          and 𝜋𝑖𝑘
               1
                  measure insurer revenue per enrollee before and after the policy. 45 The
change in revenue per enrollee is determined by whether the policy mitigates or exacerbates
adverse selection based on predicted changes to choice probabilities (Handel 2013). As an
additional metric, we report the expected change in the amount of within-plan variation
across people’s total drug costs under each prospective policy. This provides additional
insights about the expected effects of each policy on adverse selection and subsequent
pooling or separating equilibria.


45
  Empirically, we define insurer revenue per enrollee as the total premium (paid partly by enrollees and partly by the government) less
residual drug expenditures, defined as total expenditures less the sum of consumers’ OOP costs and government payments for consumers
who exceed the threshold for catastrophic spending. We assume the average cost of plan management and operations per enrollee is
unchanged by the policy so that it cancels out of the difference in (15).

      Table 10 shows the results.46 In the case of the menu restriction in which CMS retains
the plans with the largest enrollment, more than three quarters of the remaining plans ex-
perience increased variation in drug expenditures. This is consistent with the hypothesis
that eliminating a third of all plans would lead to increased risk pooling by reducing the
scope for adverse selection. At the same time, the change in insurers’ net revenue per en-
rollee is $10 or less. These small changes lead us to expect small changes in average plan
premiums under this policy. Together these results suggest that even when supply-side re-
sponses are taken into account we should expect that the median consumer overall, and
within each of the subgroups considered above, would experience welfare losses from the
particular menu restriction we considered despite the improved risk pooling.
      The metrics for decision support suggest a different outcome. As with a menu restriction,
insurers’ average net revenues even holding premiums constant remain nearly unchanged,
so we expect small changes in average plan premiums. However, decision support pro-
motes adverse selection, substantially reducing the amount of within-plan variation in drug
costs across enrollees for a large majority of plans. The distributional implications of this
are that we should expect that people with higher drug costs end up in plans with higher
premiums under decision support while those with lower cost end up in plans with lower
premiums. Because our partial equilibrium welfare calculations account for these changes,



46
  Appendix Table A14 shows that the signs and magnitudes of the changes in insurer revenue per enrollee summarized in Table 9 are
robust to the range of alternative estimation samples and alternative suspect choice definitions summarized in Table 8.



                                                                                                                                       55
we expect that the median consumer would benefit from decision support even after sup-
ply-side changes are taken into account.
  The results for default assignment, holding premiums constant, show that it would sub-
stantially reduce insurers’ net revenue and increase adverse selection, with more than three
quarters of plans experiencing a reduction in the variance of enrollee expenditures, leading
to a more substantial reduction in insurer revenue of between $42 and $128 per enrollee.
Under the ME scenario, 40% to 44% of enrollees remain in their new default plans. These
plans transfer enough of consumers’ OOP costs to the insurance companies that expected
revenue per enrollee declines by more than the increase in expected consumer welfare.
Hence, the policy exacerbates adverse selection as in Handel (2013). Those making non-
suspect choices would be more likely to lose from the policy once supply-side adjustments
are taken into account. For those in the non-suspect group, the average reduction in insur-
ers’ net revenues is about twice as large as the enrollees’ partial equilibrium gains under
the ME scenarios. Hence we expect that premium adjustments could more than offset the
other welfare gains. For those in the suspect group, we also observe that the reduction in
insurers’ net revenue amounts to about 40 to 80 percent of the magnitude of the gain in
consumer welfare. As a result, adjustments to premiums or other plan attributes to prevent
insurers’ losses would partly offset the gains to those in the suspect group. Taken together,
these results suggest that once we account for premium adjustments, the gains from default
assignment are likely to be smaller than what is expected under our partial equilibrium
results above, but qualitatively similar.


                                     IX.    Summary

  We developed a repeated choice multinomial logit model for analyzing the equity and
efficiency of choice architecture policies in a differentiated product market where some
consumers’ choices may not reveal their preferences. Specifically we used administrative
and survey data to first identify which consumers appear to make informed and informative
decisions. We then estimated separate models of decision making for the informed and




                                                                                          56
misinformed groups. Model validation showed that this approach improved model perfor-
mance. We then used parameters from the former to assess the partial equilibrium distri-
butions of the welfare effects of prospective policies for the latter. Finally, we reported
bounds on welfare that are robust to extreme assumptions about the latent mechanisms
underlying consumer inertia and the effects of counterfactual polices on consumer behav-
ior. A comparison against a pooled logit model showed that our approach that incorporates
signals of consumers’ knowledge yields different expectations about the distributions of
the welfare effects than standard approaches that exclude such signals.
  The results from our policy experiments show that the US government’s 2014 proposal
to simplify the choice process in prescription drug insurance markets by reducing the num-
ber of drug plans would reduce welfare for the median consumer by up to 16% of consumer
expenditures and potentially increase transfers to insurers. In contrast, our results suggest
that providing personalized information about the potential savings from switching plans
or assigning people to low-cost default plans would benefit the median consumer. Under
the most optimistic scenario and holding plan premiums and other attributes constant, these
gains are 11% of consumer expenditures. Comparing the decision support and default as-
signment policies suggests that defaults have higher downside risk for consumers due to
opt-out costs and larger losses in insurer revenue. These factors have the potential to erode
the consumer welfare gains observed in our partial equilibrium approach. More generally,
because both of these policies emphasize cost minimization, insurers may respond by sim-
ultaneously lowering plans’ costs, quality and risk protection in ways that have ambiguous
effects on consumer welfare. Importantly, these qualitative findings persist across a range
of approaches to identifying choices that we believe may not reveal consumers’ preferences
to us as analysts. However, the results are conditional on our assumptions of preference
stability across consumers who make choices identified as suspect versus non-suspect, of
no moral hazard in prescription drug consumption, of no responses of suppliers in terms of
entry or exit or plan design, and of no changes in the composition of people participating
in the PDP markets.

Note: The table reports the share of choices triggering each indicator, by year. The MCBS knowledge question asks whether the enrollee’s out of
pocket costs are the same under every available drug plan. The correct answer is coded as yes for enrollees who filed drug claims in both the prior
and current years if their out of pocket costs did in fact vary across plans in both years. The last row reports the share of enrollees satisfying the
criteria in either of the first two rows.

     Table A4 reports the percentages of enrollees in dominated plans and their mean potential
savings, conditional on the accuracy of answers to the MCBS knowledge question. The first six
columns report results for all choices. Columns 1-3 show that potential savings is $49 higher for
the average enrollee who answers the knowledge question incorrectly ($363 compared to $314)
and that this difference is statistically significant at the 2% level. In contrast, there is virtually no
difference in the probability of choosing a dominated plan. To isolate the association between
knowledge and decision making separately from demographics, we repeat the comparison using
residuals from regressions of the percent choosing dominated plans and mean potential savings on
indicators for high school degree, college degree, income over $25,000, current working, married,
living children, has used the internet to get information on Medicare programs, has used 1-800-
Medicare to get information, gets help making health insurance decisions, the number of plans
available, female, 70 ≤ 𝑎𝑔𝑒 ≤ 74, 75 ≤ 𝑎𝑔𝑒 ≤ 79, 80 ≤ 𝑎𝑔𝑒 ≤ 84, 85 ≤ 𝑎𝑔𝑒, has dementia,
has depression, number of claims, year dummies and region dummies. Columns 4-6 show that
after removing the variation in outcomes associated with a linear function of demographics, the
percent choosing dominated plans is 1.2 percentage points higher for those answering the
knowledge question incorrectly, potential savings is $48 higher, and both differences are statisti-
cally significant at the 0.1% level. Columns 7-12 show that the association between knowledge
and decision making is stronger if we focus exclusively on active choices. Conditioning on de-
mographics, the probability of actively choosing a dominated plan is 1.3 percentage points higher
for the uninformed group and potential savings is $68 higher.

   To assess the estimates from the logit model for non-suspect choices, we compare its implied
risk premiums in a manner comparable with prior literature. Specifically, deriving the risk pre-
mium from the logit model as a 1st order approximation to a CARA model yields the following
expression for the risk aversion coefficient:

            −2𝛽𝑖𝑡 ⁄1,000,000
    𝜌𝑖𝑡 =                   ,   where 𝑈𝑖𝑗𝑡 = 𝛼𝑖𝑡 𝑐́𝑖𝑗𝑡 + 𝛽𝑖𝑡 𝜎́ 𝑖𝑗𝑡
                                                                2
                                                                    + 𝛾𝑖𝑡 𝑞́ 𝑖𝑗𝑡 + 𝜂𝑖𝑡 Δ𝐵́𝑖𝑗𝑡 + 𝛿𝑖𝑡 Δ𝑃́𝑖𝑗𝑡 + 𝜖𝑖𝑗1.
               𝛼𝑖𝑡 ⁄100


   The estimates in Table 4 for the reference individual in the non-suspect group yields 𝜌 =
.000217. Table A6 translates this into a risk premium for various 50-50 bets. These results are
broadly consistent with the range of prior results, e.g. as reported in Table 5 of Cohen and Einav
(2007). Cohen and Einav find the mean consumer would be indifferent between a 50-50 bet of
winning $100 and losing $76.5, whereas the median consumer is virtually risk neutral. In contrast,
our results imply the mean non-suspect consumer is indifferent between a 50-50 bet of winning
$100 and losing $98.9 although Cohen and Einav argue that preferences likely differ between their
automobile insurance context other contexts like drug insurance. In the health insurance context,
Handel (2013) finds that the median individual is indifferent between a 50-50 bet of winning $100
and losing $94.6. In the model preferred by Handel and Kolstad (2015), the mean consumer is
indifferent between a 50-50 bet of winning $1,000 and losing $913. This controls for friction and
inertia. In comparison, our results imply indifference between winning $1,000 and losing $892.

   Table A7 reports results from a logit model validation exercise. The purpose is to determine whether the models estimated separately
by suspect and non-suspect choices outperform the pooled model, and whether the suspect model better predicts suspect choices than
the non-suspect model does and vice versa. For this exercise the estimation sample is 2008 while the prediction sample is 2009. We
chose these two years because they incorporate the largest year-to-year change in the choice set in our data—a central aspect to out-of-
sample validation methods (Keane and Wolpin 2007). In particular, the number of plans available fell by 10%, although three new
brands entered the market, precluding our use of brand indicators in the models. The results show that both in-sample and out-of-sample
predictions are closer to the data along a number of policy-relevant outcomes when we base the predictions on separate models for the
given type of choice. Blue shading is used to indicate the moments where our preferred model that distinguishes between suspect and
non-suspect choices outperforms the pooled model. Red shading indicates moments where the pooled model performs better. We sum-
marize the results in the main text.

Table A10 shows that enrollees with welfare losses are more likely to come from the non-suspect
group and to have larger changes in OOP drug spending between the policy year and the prior year
used to determine the minimum cost plan. The text accompanying Figure 3 provides additional
details.

Table A11 summarizes the sensitivity of predicted outcomes from the personalized decision sup-
port tool to different assumptions about the rate of plan switching that would be triggered by the
policy. Each scenario reports results for the case of unbiased expectations. The first two columns
match results reported in Table 6, in which the reductions in inertia parameters were calibrated to
match the switching rates observed in a randomized field experiment conducted by Kling, Mul-
lainathan, Shafir, Vermeulen, and Wrobel (2012) [henceforth KMSVW]. The remaining columns
report comparable results from calibrating the model at higher and lower switching rates that cor-
respond to bounds on a 90% confidence interval around KMSVW’s estimate for the rate of overall
plan switching. Because they do not report confidence intervals on the rate of switching to the
featured plan we scale this parameter up or down in proportion to the overall switch rate.
