Does Fiscal Policy Matter? Blinder and Solow Revisited

                                             ABSTRACT

This paper uses the old-Keynesian representative agent model developed in Farmer (2010b) to answer
two questions: 1) do increased government purchases crowd out private consumption? 2) do increased
government purchases reduce unemployment? Farmer compared permanent tax financed expenditure
paths and showed that the answer to 1) was yes and the answer to 2) was no. We generalize his result
to temporary bond-financed paths of government purchases that are similar to the actual path that occurred
during WWII. We find that a temporary increase in government purchases does crowd out private
consumption expenditure as in Farmer (2010b). However, in contrast to Farmer's experiment we find
that a temporary increase in government purchases can also reduce unemployment.

1       Introduction
On Monday October 28th 1929 the stock market fell 13% in one day. That
event ushered in the Great Depression, a period when unemployment climbed
to 25% and remained above 10% for ten years in a row. Keynes argued that
the drop in the stock market in 1929 caused the Great Depression. Some
empirical evidence for this view can be found in the work of Romer (1990)
and a theory of how it can be consistent with rational behavior by individuals
can be found in Farmer (2010b). Economists are still debating the causes of
the Great Depression seventy years later.1
    For thirty years following the publication of Keynes book, The General
Theory of Employment Interest and Money (1936), the concept of involun-
tary unemployment was widely used to characterize the ineﬃciencies that
were thought to characterize the loss of output that occurs during major
recessions. In the 1970s the tide changed. Following the work of Lucas and
Rapping (1969), it became accepted practice by macroeconomists to model
the labor market as an equilibrium between demand and supply. Part of the
reason that the profession gave up on Keynesian economics was empirical;
the disappearance of the Phillips curve in the 1970s discredited Keynesian
theory. But that is only part of the story. A second important reason for the
abandonment of Keynesian ideas was Keynes’s failure to provide a theory of
the labor market that was consistent with an established body of microeco-
nomic theory.
    Most contemporary interpretations of Keynes are based on the idea that
unemployment occurs because prices and wages adjust slowly in response to
    1
    Monetary explanations of the Great Depression include the work of Friedman and
Schwartz (1963) who blame the Fed for failing to prevent a collapse of the money supply
and Bernanke (1983) who points to the eﬀects of banking panics. Real explanations include
the work of Temin (1978) who cites an autonomous drop in consumption, Ohanian (2009)
who blames Herbert Hoover’s labor policies and Cole and Ohanian (2004) who argue,
using a neo-classical model, that the industrial policy of President Roosevelt’s New Deal
made an ordinary recession much worse. McGrattan and Ohanian (2011, Forthcoming)
have used the same model to study the role of fiscal policy in aiding the recovery.


                                           1
monetary shocks (Clarida, Galí, and Gertler, 1999; Galí, 2008; Woodford,
2003). In a series of books and papers, Farmer (2008a,b, 2009, 2010b,c,d)
develops an alternative interpretation of Keynesian economics that does not
rely on sticky prices. In (2010b) he raises the possibility, in a representative
agent model with Keynesian unemployment, that a permanent increase in
government expenditure will be ineﬀective at restoring full employment.
    Farmer’s (2010d) paper compared two steady state policies within the
context of the old-Keynesian model. In that model, confidence is an inde-
pendent driving variable that determines the amount that households are
willing to pay for assets. Farmer studied what would happen if an exogenous
drop in confidence were to shift the economy from an equilibrium with full
employment to a new equilibrium with high unemployment. By assumption,
confidence would remain low for all future periods. He showed, in the con-
text of that model, that a class of stationary balanced budget fiscal policies
cannot restore full employment.
    In this paper we revisit that result by studying temporary increases in gov-
ernment purchases. Our work is motivated by US experience during WWII
when government purchases increased from 16% of GDP to 52% and govern-
ment debt climbed from 40% of GDP to 120% in the space of three years.
    In the paper we prove two propositions. First, we generalize the crowding
out result of Farmer (2010b, Proposition 6.3, page 103) to non-stationary
sequences of government expenditures. Second, we study a stylized class of
policies in which there is a temporary boost to government expenditure of
fixed duration. This class mimics the experience of the US during WWII. We
prove, for this class of policies, that unemployment falls temporarily during
the period of fiscal expansion. At the end of the boost it falls back to the
level that would have occurred in the absence of the expansion.
    We show that our model can quantitatively explain the movements in the
unemployment rate and consumption during WWII by feeding into the model
the actual paths of stock market wealth and government expenditures that


                                       2
occurred during this period. In the conclusion, we discuss the implications
of our results for current economic policy.


2      Comparing 2008 with the Great Depres-
     sion
Figures 1 and 2 give some evidence in support of the fact that stock market
wealth and unemployment are related at medium frequencies. Figure 1 covers
the period from January 1929 to December of 1939 and Figure 2 covers the
period from January 2000 through October of 2010. Both figures plot the
S&P 500 deflated by the CPI on the left axis and the unemployment rate as
a percentage of the labor force on the right axis . Unemployment is measured
on an inverted scale.

   We realize that correlation is not causation and these graphs do not prove
that the stock market crash caused the Great Depression. However, they do
suggest to us that a theory that does make that causal link deserves further
consideration. Old-Keynesian economics is one such theory.


3    The Wartime Recovery
Even if one were to accept that the Great Crash caused the Great Depression,
one would still be left with the puzzle of what generated the remarkable
recovery that occurred with the onset of WWII.

       Figure 3: Unemployment and the Stock Market During WWI


    Figure 3 replicates figures 1 and 2 for the period from January 1939
through December 1949. The figure shows that the stock market and un-
employment were unrelated during this period. Something else must have
caused the unemployment rate to fall from 20% in June 1938 to 1.2% in
February 1944. An obvious candidate is the huge increase in the size of
government that occurred as the economy geared up for and entered WWII.
    In textbook Keynesian analysis, fiscal policy works because consump-
tion depends on income. But research on the consumption function after
WWII (Dusenberry, 1949; Friedman, 1957) found that consumption is bet-
ter explained by wealth. Milton Friedman developed the permanent income
theory in which he explained how long-lived agents would plan to smooth
out their consumption over time. His theory predicts that households will
expect an increase in government borrowing to lead to future tax increases.
    The permanent income theory predicts that increased government pur-
chases will crowd out private consumption expenditure. Crowding out re-
duces the stimulative eﬀect of increased government purchases and, in the


                                                           5
extreme case, every dollar spent by government may cause households to
consume one dollar less. In this extreme case fiscal policy will have no eﬀect
on output or employment.

       Figure 4 plots government purchases measured on the left axis and unem-
ployment measured on the right axis for the period from 1939 through 1949.
Unemployment is measured on an inverted scale. The interesting feature of
this graph is the correlation between the rise in government purchases and
the reduction in the unemployment rate that begins in 1939 and ends in
1944.2
    This paper asks a simple question in the framework of the old-Keynesian
model: Can the reduction of unemployment be explained by a temporary
increase in government purchases in a representative agent version of the
model?
   2
    This is the evidence that led Keynesians to hope that fiscal stimulus would jump-
start the economy in the 2008 recession. It is also this evidence that Keynesians point
to when they argue that Obama’s 2008 stimulus was too small. The 2008 US stimulus
caused government purchases to increase from 20% to 25% of GDP. In WWII government
purchases went from 16% to 52% of GDP.

4    The Old-Keynesian Model
We assume that utility is logarithmic and that households have access to
one period nominal bonds. Since there is no aggregate uncertainty, markets
are complete. The assumption that utility is logarithmic implies that the
following Euler equation holds in nominal terms,

where  is the dollar value of consumption expenditure and  is the nominal
interest rate.
    Households’ assets are the liabilities of a competitive financial sector
which holds capital and government bonds. We assume that capital is non-
reproducible and that it is valued at the price  . Capital is rented to the
firms for the rental rent  . The no arbitrage condition between investing
in government bonds and investing in capital implies

                                      +1 + +1
                           1 +  =                                       (2)
                                            
The price of capital is not equal to the price of the consumption good because
capital and consumption are diﬀerent goods. We assume that there is one
unit of non-reproducible capital.
   We define  to be the money value of GDP. From the national income
accounting identity this is equal to the sum of nominal consumption  and
nominal government expenditure  ,

                                 =  +                               (3)

   The structure of the labor market is explained in Farmer (2010b). Briefly,
we assume two technologies; one for producing goods and one for matching
workers with jobs. Firms take wages and prices as given and they allocate
workers between production and recruiting to maximize profit. Farmer shows

                                        7
that this leads to a reduced form technology

                                = 1−

where  is an externality that depends on the number of workers being
hired in the aggregate economy and  is the real value of output measured
in physical units.3
    This economy has the same two first order conditions as a standard neo-
classical economy. These are represented by equations (5) and (6),

                               (1 − )  =                              (5)

                                    =                                  (6)

where  =   is nominal GDP as defined above.


5       Wages and the Labor Market
The model we have developed looks a lot like a one good representative agent
model with a fixed labor supply. It behaves very diﬀerently. We assume that
every household sends a measure 1 of workers to look for a job every period
and that  of them find a job. To keep the labor market dynamics simple,
we assume that the entire work force is fired every period and the process
starts again next period.
    Since this is a general equilibrium model without money, we are free to
pick the numeraire. As in Farmer (2009) we choose the money wage to be
the numeraire by setting
                                      = 1                             (7)

To map our model economy into the data we will normalize nominal variables
    3
    This assumption generalizes to an economy with many diﬀerent consumption goods
and multiple capital goods. See Farmer (2010b).



                                        8
by a measure of the money wage. The money wage grows because of inflation
and because of productivity improvements. By deflating GDP, consumption
and government purchases by the money wage we are able to generate data
series that are stationary.


6     What the Government Does
Households each supply one unit of labor and pay a labor income tax    .
Since labor is inelastically supplied, this tax is non distortionary. We abstract
from capital taxes and sales taxes. We assume that government purchases 
dollars worth of goods in period  and that the service flow provided by these
goods is separable from private consumption in utility. Government chooses
sequences {      } that satisfy the intertemporal budget constraint

Here,  is nominal government debt,  is nominal government expenditure
and   is the tax rate on labor income.


7     Closing the Model with Beliefs
Most models of search are closed by assuming that firms and workers bargain
to determine the wage. Following Farmer (2010b), we assume instead that
workers and firms take the wage and the price as given. This leads to a labor
market with one less equation than unknown. To close the model we assume
that households form a sequence of self-fulfilling beliefs about the value of
assets. We operationalize this assumption by taking the sequence { }∞ =




                                            9
to be chosen exogenously.4 We call this sequence the state of expectations.
   For any given state of expectations, our model contains the following four
equations,

together with the initial condition,

                                        = ̄                                    (13)

    A fiscal policy is a set of sequences {+1      }∞    = . If there exists
a solution to equations (9)—(13) that remains bounded for all  we say that
the fiscal policy is feasible. A perfect foresight equilibrium given the state of
expectations { }∞   = is a feasible fiscal policy and a bounded set of sequences
{     } that satisfy equations (9)—(13).


8       Steady State Solution
Farmer (2010b) showed that a stationary equilibrium of the model for a
given state of expectations { }∞
                                   = and a stationary sequence of government
expenditures  =  for  =  · · · ∞ implies

     Farmer (2010a) shows how to operationalize the idea of animal spirits by defining a
belief function. He estimates a three equation old-Keynesian model and shows that it fits
the US data better than a three equation new-Keynesian model.



                                           10
    Two interesting facts follow from Equation (14). First, one additional
dollar of government expenditure decreases private consumption by one dol-
lar. This follows because the RHS of Equation (14) does not depend on
government expenditure,  . Second, the stationary equilibrium value of
GDP depends on the state of expectations,  . Farmer (2010b) shows that
 can taken any value in a bounded set and it follows from this fact that
there is a continuum of stationary equilibria, each supported by a diﬀerent
stationary value of  and each associated with a diﬀerent stationary unem-
ployment rate.
    Now consider the following experiment. Let the state of expectations fall
from 1 to 2 where
                                 2  1                           (15)

In the new stationary equilibrium, GDP will be lower and the unemployment
rate will be higher. If expectations about the future prices of the assets in
the economy never recover, the economy will be in a new equilibrium with a
higher unemployment rate for ever. But how does the economy behave if 
and  are not constant sequences? Will the above result about crowding
out hold? We turn to that question next.


9         Main Results
This section presents the main results of the paper. First, we show that
increased government spending lowers consumption. Second, we show that
a temporary increase in government purchases can increase employment in
the short-run.
    The following proposition compares two economies: one with and one
without government intervention. We hold the state of expectations fixed.
The proposition states that there is a crowding out eﬀect: private consump-
tion will be lower in the economy with government spending.5

        It is easy to extend this result to the case where expenditure is positive in the second

consumption in the second economy then ̃   for all    .

Proof. See Appendix A.

  A statement about the exact eﬀect of a government expansion on un-
employment is more diﬃcult to prove. Ideally one would want to have a
economy but lower than in the first economy in every period. The extension of the proof
is straightforward and is omitted.

condition for each sequence of government expenditures that would tell us,
depending on parameter values and the state of expectations, whether such a
policy will decrease or increase employment in the current and the following
periods. We have not been able to prove a statement with this degree of
generality.
    Instead, we focus on a specific class of non-stationary fiscal policies, in-
spired by the experience of actual fiscal policy before and after WWII.

           Figure 6: Government Purchases as a Fraction of GDP

   Figure 6 shows that government purchases were approximately 16% of
GDP before WWII. During the war they peaked at 52% and at the end of
WWII they increased permanently to a new higher level of 23% of GDP.
   We characterize this policy by studying the class of fiscal expansions
depicted in Figure 7. We compare two economies with the same state of
expectations but diﬀerent fiscal policies. In the control economy there is a
predetermined sequence of government expenditures ̃ . In the treatment
economy government expenditure increases by a fixed factor, ∆  1 at time

 = 1 6 and remains at ∆ · ̃ for 2 − 1 periods. After period 2 , expenditure
reverts
n   o to the sequence ̃ . Figure 7 depicts a special case of this class where
 ̃     is constant for   2 and increases to a new higher level after date 2 .

Figure 7: Government Purchases in the Treatment and Control Economies

    Given these policies we prove that the change in fiscal policy reduces un-
employment during the expansion period at the cost of higher unemployment
before the expansion. If the policy is unanticipated, it reduces unemploy-
ment during the expansion period with no cost. This corresponds to the case
1 = 0

 pansion during the time interval {1 2 }  Let { ≡ 1 −  } and ̃ ≡ 1 − ̃
 be the unemployment rates in each economy. There exists an integer  ≥ 1
 where 2 ≡ 1 +  , such that,

Part 1  = ̃ for   2

Part 2   ̃ for   1

Part 3   ̃ for 1 ≤  ≤ 2 where ∆  1 is a constant.

 Proof. See Appendix B.
     Part 3 of Proposition 2 implies that a temporary fiscal policy expansion
 will reduce unemployment and it provides a basis for understanding why the
 boost in government purchases that occurred in 1941-1945 resulted in the end
 of the Depression. This proposition implies that a boost to fiscal spending
 will be eﬀective at increasing employment for a finite time.
     Our next proposition discusses the eﬀect of changing the length of the
 expansion period on the eﬀectiveness of fiscal policy. One might think that
 government would want to increase the length of the fiscal expansion in or-
 der to exploit the benefit of an increase in government expenditure on the
 unemployment rate. Proposition 3 implies that a permanent increase in gov-
 ernment expenditure at time  = 1 will have no eﬀect on the unemployment
 rate. Moreover, the positive eﬀect on the unemployment rate at the beginning
 of the expansion becomes smaller at an exponential rate as the anticipated
 length of the expansion increases.
     Because we are interested in the asymptotic behavior of GDP, we need
 to specify what happens to government expenditure in the limit. We will
 focus our analysis on the case when the share of government expenditure to
 GDP is constant as 2 → ∞. We distinguish two cases. As 2 → ∞:

    The first inequality that is common
                                    n o to Condition A and Condition B is
necessary for the expenditure plan ̃ to be feasible given that households
hold expectations { }  The second inequality of Condition A will be
satisfied if the increase in government purchases, represented by ∆, is large
enough. In this case Proposition 3 implies that a boost to fiscal spending
will only be eﬀective at increasing employment for a limited time.
    The second inequality of Condition B implies that the fiscal expansion
is relatively small. Proposition 3 states that in this case an expansion in
government spending, that is known to end at a some future date, will
lower unemployment for an arbitrarily long period of time. But the longer
the policy is expected to last, the less eﬀective it will be when it is first
implemented. Moreover, eﬀectiveness at date 1 , decreases exponentially as

expansion has no eﬀect on the unemployment rate.


10     An Application to the Data
Our theory predicts that movements in the unemployment rate are caused
by movements in aggregate demand. In the model, demand consists of gov-
ernment purchases and consumption since we are ignoring fluctuations in




                                      17
investment. To address the plausibility of our explanation, we took the ob-
served movements in wealth and government purchases from the data and we
used them to infer the implied movements in consumption from the model.
    Equations (1), (2) and (6) imply that consumption is related to wealth
and government purchases by the following expression,

                                                 +1
                                 =                                                 (16)
                                        (+1 + +1 + +1 )

    We used government purchases from the NIPA accounts and the S&P 500
and we deflated both series by a measure of the nominal wage. The wage
series was also constructed from NIPA data using the methodology described
in Farmer (2010b). Using these series we fixed  where  = 1947 and we
calculated the implied consumption series by setting  = 033  = 096
and using the actual values of the series on government expenditure and the
stock market {   }1947
                         =1929 , by solving Equation (16). The result of this
experiment is graphed in Figure 8.

    Since the S&P is an index number, the units of our real wealth variable
are only defined up to a scalar multiple where the weight attached to each
data point reflects money prices at the inception date of the index. We
normalized the value of the index by scaling the S&P series by 579, a value
that implies that the economy was in a steady state in 1929. This scaling
factor,  , is defined by the steady state relationship

          Figure 9: Unemployment in the Data and in the Model

   The model predicts that consumption is related to wealth. Since the
S&P is only a partial measure of all tangible assets, our model is unlikely to
capture all of the movements in employment and consumption in the data.
We would hope, however, the model is capable of capturing the movements in
the consumption series implied by changes in government expenditure and in
stock market wealth. The fact the actual and model series for consumption

                                                   19
move relatively closely gives us some encouragement that the theory is on
the right track.
    In Figure 9 we plot the unemployment rate in the data and the unemploy-
ment rate implied by our model using Equation (11) where  is the sum of
the actual government expenditure series and the consumption series implied
by our model.
    We have more confidence in the movements of this series than in its level
which is sensitive to a normalization constant that defines the supply of labor.
Notice that our model is able to capture the reduction in the unemployment
rate as the US economy gears up for WWII which occurs as a result of the
huge increase in government purchases that began in 1941.
    We can also use our model to ask a second question. What would have
happened to the unemployment rate in the early 1940s if the government had
not increased expenditures from 16% to 52% of the economy and if the stock
market had followed the same path that we observed during this period? To
answer this question we took the same series for  , but we fed in a diﬀerent
series for government expenditures for the years 1941−1945 by assuming that
government spending during these years remained at the 1940 level. Since
we are treating the state of expectations as an independent variable, that is
a legitimate question within the context of the model. Figure 10 presents
results of this experiment. The actual unemployment rate is plotted on the
left axis and the model unemployment rate on the right.

      Figure 10: Predicted Unemployment without a Fiscal Stimulus


    The model predicts that without a large fiscal stimulus, and conditional
on the actual path of the stock market, the unemployment rate would have
increased dramatically in the early 1940s. These findings are consistent with
propositions 1 and 2 which show that a temporary increase in government
expenditure is predicted to crowd out consumption and reduce unemploy-
ment.


11     Conclusion
To summarize, the paper studies the eﬀect of an expansionary fiscal pol-
icy on output and employment in the economy using Farmer’s (2010b) old-
Keynesian framework. We find that expansionary fiscal policy increases eco-
nomic activity and reduces unemployment in the short-run at the cost of
reduced consumption. If the stimulus is foreseen, there will be an addi-
tional cost of reduced employment in the years leading up to the increase in
government purchases.


                                                     21
    Given its simplicity, the model does a good job of fitting actual data
for the period of the Great Depression and the early years of WWII. It is
encouraging that the dynamic version of the model can explain why a fiscal
stimulus increased employment in the 1940s since the steady state version of
the same model implies 100% crowding out of consumption and no eﬀect on
the unemployment rate.
    But the fact that a temporary fiscal stimulus can be shown to increase
employment does not mean that it is the right policy to cure a depression.
The crowding out of consumption that occurs in the model implies a sub-
stantial welfare loss associated with increased government expenditure unless
the government purchases goods that have a significant social value. That
clearly was the case in WWII since the US was fighting for its survival. Most
of the newly employed people were directed to the war eﬀort either directly
by enlisting in the army or indirectly by producing munitions.
    The case for fiscal stimulus in the current crisis is less clear. If the
economy is not self-correcting as Keynes believed, a large fiscal expenditure
may not be the best way to restore full employment. In the model we have
outlined in this paper, it is critical to increase the value of confidence in the
value of private wealth in order to permanently restore jobs.

Appendix B: Proof of Proposition 2
Proof. It follows from Equation (11) and the definitions of  and ̃ that

Thus, instead of proving a statement about a relationship between unem-
ployment rates, we can prove an equivalent statement about GDP.
   Combining (1) and (3) gives the following expressions that must hold in
each economy

   Proof of Part 1: By assumption, the sequence of government expendi-
tures is the same in both economies for   2 . It follows that

   Combining Equation (B4) with the national accounting identity for   2
we obtain that  = ̃ ∀  2 . This proves Part 1.

economy during the period [1  2 ]. It follows from Proposition 1, that

                               ̃     ∀  2                      (B5)

But  = ̃ if   1 . It follows from the national income accounting


                                     24
identity that   ̃  ∀  1 . This proves Part 2.
   Proof of Part 3.
   We must show that if |2 − 1 | ≤  where  is a fixed number then

                       +   ̃ + ̃      ∀1 ≤  ≤ 2                 (B6)

Suppose first that  = |2 − 1 | = 1. Since  = ̃  and   ̃ , it follows
immediately that   ̃ and hence a one period increase in government
expenditure increases GDP. To establish that  may be greater than 1,
consider the following change of variables. Divide both sides of Equation
(B6) by ̃ and define ̃ and  

                                      ̃        
                              ̃ ≡         ≡                            (B7)
                                      ̃        

Since we assume that, for 1 ≤  ≤ 2 ,

                                  
                                      ≡ ∆  1                               (B8)
                                  ̃

some simple algebra establishes that inequality (B6) is equivalent to the
statement
                          1
                         ˜
                             +1     1 + ̃
                    ∆ 1        ≡             ≡  ()               (B9)
                         
                             +1    () + ̃

for all 1 ≤  ≤ 2 where  () ≡ ̃  To establish (B9), we will show (1) that
̃ and  each satisfy a non-autonomous quasi-linear diﬀerence equation
(2) that ̃ =  for   2 (3)  (2 + 1) = 1 and (4)  ()   ( + 1) for
1    2 . Together, these statements imply that  (2 + 1) = 1  ∆ and
that  () is increasing as we move backwards in time from 2 . Since
(B9) is equivalent to (B6), for all  for which  ()  ∆, a fiscal expansion
increases GDP and reduces unemployment. We now turn to the properties
of  () by showing that (1)—(4) hold.

                                    ̃+1
Using these definitions, it follows from equations (B2) and (B3) that { }
and {̃ } are characterized by the following simple recursions:

                                     =  +1 +                         (B13)

and
                                    ̃ = ̃ ̃+1 + ̃                    (B14)

This establishes (1).
   (2) Notice that from date 2 + 1 onwards both economies are identical
and hence
                              ̃2 +1 = 2 +1                   (B15)

This establishes (2).
   (3) Since ̃2 +1 = 2 +1 it follows from the definition of  () that  (2 + 1) =
1. This establishes (3).
   (4) Notice that for 1 ≤  ≤ 2

                         = ∆̃   ̃  and ̃                        (B16)

For  = 2
                                      = ∆˜  ˜                         (B17)

Moving backwards in time from 2 , it follows from (B13)—(B18) that for
1 ≤  ≤ 2 ,

This establishes (4).
   We have established that  (2 ) = 1  ∆ and that  () is increasing as
 moves back in time from 2 . It follows that there exists a  ≥ 1 such
that  () | ∈ {2 −  2 }  ∆. QED.


Appendix C: Proof of Proposition 3
Proof. Using the notation from the proof of Proposition 2, there are two
possible cases: either at some  = 2 −  ()  ∆ or  () → ∆ as  → −∞.
The first case correspond to Condition A and the second corresponds to
Condition B. It follows from Condition A that for suﬃciently small ,
                                    µ                   ¶
                                          ̃

                                        ̃+1

and                                  µ                  ¶
                                           ̃
                           ̃ ≡              + ̃        1       (C2)
                                         ̃+1
    These inequalities imply that the gap between ̃ and  will grow as
 decreases from 2 and hence there must be a  such that at  = 2 −  ,
 ()  ∆. At this point the fiscal expansion will lower output and increase
unemployment. This establishes that  is finite if Condition A holds.

                                            27
   Now suppose that Condition B holds. Recall (B9), which we restate
below
                        1
                       ˜
                           +1     1 + ̃
                  ∆ 1        ≡             ≡  ()           (C3)
                       
                           +1    () + ̃
We established in the proof of Proposition 2 that  and ̃ satisfy the
recursions
                           =  +1 +  

and
                                 ̃ = ̃ ̃+1 + ̃ 

and since we restrict ourselves to the case where  →  as  → −∞,7 it
follows from Condition B that   ̃    and ̃ are constants in the limit
and that  and ̃ are both positive and less than one. Hence as  → −∞

                                                
                                  →  =                                      (C4)
                                               1−

and
                                                 ̃
                                  ̃ = ̃ =                                   (C5)
                                               1 − ̃
From the definitions of   ̃   and ̃ and the definition of  () one can
establish that as  → −∞
                                           1−
                                            ̃
                                () →     1−
                                                   = ∆                         (C6)
                                          ∆·̃


Since establishing that  () = ∆ is equivalent to showing that (B6) holds as
an equality we have shown that a fiscal expansion that is expected to persist
for an arbitrarily long period will have an arbitrarily small eﬀect on GDP
and employment. QED
  7
    This is identical to the statement that government purchases constitute a constant
share of GDP since in the long-run GDP itself is proportional to  
