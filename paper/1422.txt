                  The Open Economy: Implications for
                      Monetary and Fiscal Policy

                                  ABSTRACT


     The exchange rate has by 1984 become as central to United States economic

policy discussions as it has long been in the rest of the world. In this paper

we show how the standard closed—economy macroeconomic model——the Phillips curve

augmented IS—LM analysis-—has to be modified for the United States to take

account of the economy's international interactions. The only key structural

equation that goes unamended is the money demand equation. Foreign prices,

foreign activity, and foreign asset yields in the goods and asset markets appear

as important determinants of domestic activity, prices, and interest rates.

     We show that international interactions exert an important effect on the

manner in which monetary and fiscal policies operate. The Phillips curve is much

steeper under flexible than fixed interest rates. A tight money policy leads to

appreciation under flexible rates, and thus to more rapid disinflation. Fiscal

expansion, because it induces currency appreciation, is less inflationary under

flexible than fixed exchange rates, but it also involves more crowding out. We

show that these effects are in practice significantly large for the United States

economy.

     The exchange rate has by 1984 become as central in United States economic

policy discussions as it has long been in the rest of the world. The rapid

dollar appreciation in the current disinflation is argued to have contributed

powerfully to the speed of the disinflation. The 1984 Economic Report of the

President fears that the "overvalued" dollar creates an unbalanced recovery by

curtailing export growth, and fears also that large current account deficits will

lead to a depreciation of the exchange rate which will contribute to a resurgence

of inflation.

     As the Bretton Woods system came under increasing pressure in the 1960's,

economic policymaking became more constrained by balance of payments and exchange

rate considerations. Supporters of a shift to flexible exchange rates——and by

the end this was most economists——believed that a shift to floating rates would

enable countries to insulate themselves from foreign disturbances. That did not

happen. One reason is that the dominance of supply shocks in the 1970's was

certainly not foreseen: real shocks will be transmitted between countries under

both fixed and felxible rates. A second reason is that with different speeds of

adjustment of assets and goods markets, shifts in monetary policy produce real

rather than merely nominal exchange rate changes.

     We start by describing trends and cycles in United States' international

linkages, in goods, factor, and asset markets. We then develop the analysis of

the operation of fiscal and monetary policy in the current flexible rate

environment.

I.   The External Linkages: Trends and Cycles

     The U.S. economy is linked to the rest of the world through goods, factor,

and assets markets. The linkages are reflected in the flows of goods and

services in international trade; in the relationships between goods and factor

prices at home and abroad; and in the asset pricing and capital flow

relationships between domestic and foreign asset markets. This section documents

trends and cycles in these linkages.

     We start with summary measures of the degree of coordination of business

cycles in different periods. Morgenstern calculated the percentage of months

that business cycles in the United States, France, Germany, and the United Kigdom

were in the same phase in the periods 1879—1914 and 1919_1932.1 In the pre—Worid

War I period business cycles in the four countries were in the same phase 54% of

the time; in the inter—War period the phases coincided only 36% of the time.

Working with the same four countries, over the period 1953 to 1980 we find

business cycle phases coinciding 35% of the time. 2 There is no substantial

difference in the measure of co-incidence between the fixed and flexible exchange

rate periods after World War ii. Thus business cycles seem to have been more

co-ordinated internationally during the vintage gold standard period than

subsequently. But the data are too crude and the differences too small to

provide strong support for the view that the truly fixed exchange rates provided

by the gold standard linked countries together more closely than the less

reliable exchange rate arrangements of subsequent periods.

plus net services exports constitute net exports in the national income accounts,

shown   as the fourth column in Table 1. The current account is not shown in the
table. The main difference between net exports (NIPA) and the current account is
the inclusion in the latter of unilateral     transfers and of government interest

payments to the rest of the world.

     The most striking point is the extent to which the U.S. economy has, from
the viewpoint of trade in goods and services, been closed. Even back into the

nineteenth centrury, neither exports nor imports exceeded ten percent of GNP for

any substantial period. Merchandise exports peaked as a percentage of GNP during

World War I, falling in the 1920's to lower levels than ever before, and then in

the thirties and well into the sixties remaining even below 4 of GNP. The

merchandise trade balance was for long in surplus, but has in the last decade

moved into a large and growing deficit. Despite the doubling in the shares of

both imports and exports in GNP since the fifties, the United States remains the

most closed of all industrialized countries.

        The average rate of tariffs has fallen substantially over the past century.

But the decline was not monotonic: tariff acts punctuated the generally

declining trend, notably in this century the Pordney—McCumber tariff of 1922, and

the Smoot—Hawley tariff of 1930. The effect of the Smoot—Hawley tariff on the

domestic economy will be discussed below.

        The cyclical behavior of imports and exports (goods and services) is

summarized in Table 2, which presents correlations among: the growth rate of

real GNP, the growth rates of (real) exports and imports, and the change in the

share of net exports in GNP, over different periods. The consistent result is

that imports are, as would be expected from the effects of aggregate demand on

imports, pro—cyclical. The cyclical behavior of exports varies over the

different periods shown in Table 2. There is no expectation of a consistent

cyclical pattern in the case of exports: the correlation depends on the co-

ordination of domestic and foreign business cycles, and on whether a particular

expansion is domestically or export led. Net exports tend to move in an anti—

cyclical direction, driven by the positive relationship between imports and the

cycle. However, in periods in which export growth is positively correlated with

GNP growth as for 1954—1983, net exports can on balance move pro—cyclically.

     The correlation results of Table 2 agree with the findings of Mintz, who

examined the cyclical behavior of exports, imports, and the trade balance over

periods extending back to 1879. Mintz shows imports peaking at business cycles

peaks and at their lowest at the trough.5 Exports, by contrast are shown by

Mintz not to have a consistent cyclical pattern, being strongly pro—cyclical in

the inter-World War period but peaking well after the business cycle peak in the

pre-Worid War I era. The trade balance was on average countercyclical.

     Figure 1 shows the trade balance and the current account as a percent of GNP

over the period since 1946. The eye may see a generally deteriorating

current account in Figure 1, but more careful examination suggests that the

enormous surpluses of the World War II era had been worked off by the end of the

Korean War, and that the current account then fluctuated around a basic surplus

of about 1 of GNP until a marked deterioration took place at the end of the

period. The absence of any strong cyclical behavior of net exports in Table 2 is

reflected in the differing behavior of the trade balance (and the current

account) from cycle to cycle. The trade balance improved during the recessions

in 1954, 1960, 1970, and 1980, and worsened during the recessions of 1957, 1973-

75, and 1982.

     Although the United States is, by the criterion of the shares of exports and

imports in GNP, the most closed of the Western economies, it is not closed at the

margin. Tariffs have declined to very low levels and leave only a few areas in

which domestic industries are sheltered from foreign competition, except where

quotas or their equivalent in the form of voluntary export restraints

(automobiles, steel, textiles, etc.) have been imposed. Estimates of the income

elasticity of aggregate imports are typically in the range of 1 .5 to 2. Export

shares in GNP have also fluctuated substantially.

     Table 3 presents a measure of the variability of components of GNP over the

period 1954 to 1983. The underlying data are year to year changes in the ratio

of each category of spending to GNP, expressed in percent.6 The data in Table 3

are the variances of those changes. Exports and imports each vary less than the

other components of GNP in absolute terms, but despite the low average ratios of

imports and exports to GNP, their year to year variability is of the same order

of magnitude as that of the remaining expenditure categories.

     Shifts in the competitiveness of the United States relative to its trading

partners are one of major determinants of merchandise trade. Competitiveness is

shown in Figure 2 by an index of the U.S. value added deflator in manufacturing

compared to the exchange rate—adjusted, trade—weighted deflators of partner

countries in international trade.7 Note in Figure 2 the large adjustment in the

measure of competitiveness in the 1971—73 period, in the transition to flexible

exchange rates. The magnitude of the adjustment and its persistence demonstrate

that the Bretton Woods system had led to a cumulative overvaluation of the

dollar. Even after the rapid appreciation of the dollar in the early 1980's the

real exchange rate is still well above its 1970 level.

     Tables 4 and 5 show long—term shifts in the composition and direction of

U.S. merchandise trade. The long—term shifts are, on the side of exports,

entirely as expected. The United States shifted from exporting primarily food

and crude materials in the last century to manufactures in the twentieth century.

Even so, there is some tendency for the share of manufactures to fall in the post

World War II period. On the import side, crude materials are as significant a

share of imports now as they were in the World Wars; food imports are currently

extremely low. The reorientation in the direction of trade is also simple: away

from Europe, especially the United Kingdom, and towards Asia.

    We conclude the review of trade patterns with a comment on the importance of

the U.S. in world trade. The share of the U.S. in world trade has steadily

declined over the post—World War II period. In 1951—53 the U.S. share of world

exports was 21%, in the early 1960's and 1970's respectively 17.2% and 13.5%. By

1981—82 the U.S. share of world exports had declined to 12.5%, despite the

increase in the share of exports in U.S. GNP. Germany and Japan are becoming

near equals of the U.S. in world trade as their share of exports approaches 10%

in the early 1980's.

Digression: The Smoot-Hawley Tariff and the Great Depression.

     The tariff changes shown in Table 1 have been receiving increasing attention

as a macroeconomic phenomenon. In particular, the Smoot—Hawley tariff of 1930 is

argued to have played an important role in the Great Depression. This view is

certainly not found in the classic Friedman—Schwartz account of the Depression: 8

the Hawley—Smoot Tariff Act does not appear in the index; when it does appear, in

a footnote on p.342, it is only as a contributor to the gold inflow of late 1930;

and it is not featured in the discussion (pp.359—363) of the international

character of the Depression. Kindleberger gives the Tariff Act a substantial

role, but on symbolic grounds: its signing represented United States abdication

of its responsibility to take charge of the world economy.9

     The modern interest in the Smoot—Hawley tariff traces mainly to Meltzer's

brief analysis.10 The argument "assigns a large role to the Hawley-Sinoot tariff

and subsequent tariff retaliation in explaining why the 1929 recession did not

follow the path of previous monetary contractions but became the Great
                                      —7-




Depression", (p.460). The detailed explanation gives considerable weight to the

reductions in imports of semi—finished goods and exports of agricultural goods

following the tariff, suggesting that the fact that bank failures in 1930 and

1931 were concentrated in agricultural regions was in part a consequence of the

tariff. But it is important to note that Meltzer is mainly discussing the

question of the onset and rapid worsening of the recession, rather than the

responsibility of macroeconomic policy for the Depression becoming Great. There

is no implication that intelligent macroeconomic, and particularly monetary,

policy could not have prevented the disasters of 1932—33.

     In Table 6 we present summary data on trade and GNP in the periods 1918-1923

and 1928-1923. Each of these periods saw a major recession and a major increase

in tariffs. Indeed, the 1922 Fordney—McCumnber tariff increased tariff rates

(calculated as the ratio of duties to either total imports, or dutiable imports)

as much as the Sinoot—Hawley tariff.11 In light of the increases in tariffs shown

in Table 5, it is difficult to accept Haberler's "skyscraper" description of

Sinoot-Hawley (op.cit.., p.8 and p.33). Fordney—McCumber would on the same scale

qualify as a "rocket" tariff. Further, as a matter of arithmetic, part of the

blame for the increase in tariffs between 1929 and 1933 goes to the drop in price

levels, since many tariffs were specific, i.e. specified in dollar terms, rather

than ad valorem. 12

     Fordney—McCuinber was imposed in 1921—22 and was followed by an increase in

imports and decrease in exports. The economic expansion was responsible for the

import increase; the decrease in exports was a deflationary impulse, outweighed

by the start of the expansion of the 1920's. A recession did begin in May 1923

but it was brief; 1924 real GNP was unchanged from that of 1923, and imports fell

very little. Smoot—Hawley was also followed by a reduction in exports, but this

time by a reduction in imports. These were primarily the result of the

recession. The declines in agricultural exports following Smoot—Hawley was

large, but so was the decline following Fordney—McCumber.

    From either a Keynesian or monetarist perspective, the tariff by itself

would have been an expansionary impulse in the absence of retaliation. In the

Keynesian view, the reduction in imports diverts demand to domestic goods; in the

monetarist view the gold inflow increases the domestic money stock if bit

sterilized.   In the event, the balance on goods and services fell after the

imposition of the tariff. The behavior of net exports suggests the emphasis on

recession abroad and retaliation, rather than the direct effect of the tariff, as

a force contributing to recession. Exports were 7% of GNP in 1929. Between 1929

and 1931, they fell by 1.5% of 1929 GNP. Attributing the entire fall to the

tariff retaliation, and assuming a multiplier of two real GNP would have fallen

3% on this account. The fall in real GNP between 1929 and 1931 was over 15%,

thus indicating that the tariff could not have played the major role in creating

the recession by affecting the demand for goods. Further, the 3% of GNP estimate

is surely a high estimate of the effects of the tariff on exports.

     In addition to the tariff US net exports were, of course, affected by the

extensive competitive depreciation on the part of foreign countries. This

consideration further reduces the significance to be attached to the tariff as a

cause precipitating the Great Depression.

     On the monetary side, gold inflows increased at the end of 1930, but 1931

saw a reduction back to close the 1929 proportion to NNP. 13 These inflows were

an inflationary force. To the extent that the tariffs, via foreign retaliation,

 worked by creating distress in agricultural areas, and thereby setting off early

 bank collapses, they had an adverse monetary effect. But this only emphasizes

 the perversity of the Fed's bank closing policy. Further, it is not clear that a

 U.S. tariff on agricultural imports that sheltered domestic producers from the
                                     —9—



collapse of world commodity prices would adversely affect those producers.

Rather it was likely to have raised their incomes (given inelastic supply) above

the free trade level.

     We can summarize our argument briefly: Fordney-McCumber increased tariffs

substantially when the United States economy was in a deep recession that was

                                                                  at the start of a
followed by a rapid recovery. Smoot—Hawley increased tariffs

deep recession that was followed by the Great Depression.      Neither should receive

prime credit or blame for what followed:    macroeconomic policies are far more

significant. 14




2.   Goods and Factor Price Links.

     The strict purchasing parity          theory   of the exchange rate holds that

exchange rates move proportionately with national price levels.        PPP thus

implies a one—for—one link between domestic and foreign prices. Figure 3 and

much other evidence shows that PPP does not hold in any relevant sense. Relative

national price levels, adjusted through exchange rates, can and do move for

                    16
 lengthy periods.

      Despite the absence of any strong relationship between national price

 levels, exchange rate and foreign price level changes do affect domestic prices.

 Changes in the dollar prices of imports directly affect goods and raw material

 input prices in the United States, and thus affect the prices of final goods.

 The pressure of international competition on the prices of traded goods also

 affects domestic prices and the wage settlements reached in the affected

 industries. Links of these types, to be reviewed in the next section, change the

 dynamics of inflation between fixed and flexible exchange rate systems.

3. Asset market linkages and capital flows.

    The international integration of assets markets is in the 1980's an accepted

fact. Interest rates are linked internationally (adjusted for anticipated

depreciation) and capital flows are highly, and perhaps excessively, responsive

to anticipated return differentials.

     Asset market integration was of course a well-known feature of the pre—World

War I and inter-War world economies. The thrust of careful empirical work is

however to suggest that the linkages were less tight than simple accounts of the

gold standard imply. IIorgenstern calculated correlation coefficients among short

term interest rates in London, New York, Paris and Berlin. For the period 1876—

1914 the correlation between the New York commercial paper rate and the London

private discount rate is only 0.45; for the period 1925—1938 the correlation is

0.93.17 The correlation between monthly U.K. and U.S. treasury bill rates for

the flexible rate period, January 1974 to November 1983 is 0.583, 18 above the

correlation for short—term rates for the earlier gold standard period calculated

by Morgenstern. During the adjustable peg period, January 1964 to July 1971, the

correlation between monthly British and U.S. treasury bill rates was 0.794, below

the correlation for the inter—War period calculated by Morgenstern. While the

Morgenstern data give the impression that short—term interest rates had

considerable latitude to move independently in the pre—World War I period, the

economic significance of the low correlation depends on the absolute variability

of the rates as well as their correlation.

     Interest rate differentials during the gold standard period were

substantiel. Morgenstern (p. 335) calculates that the degree of flexibility of

the exchange rate implied by the gold points allowed an interest differential on

90—day bills of 3.73 between London and New York.'9 In the period 1876—1914

the commercial paper rate in New York was on average 2.17% higher than the
                                      —11—




private discount rate in London. Risk and transaction costs of course permit

differences in mean rates of return on apparently similar short—term assets. 20

But there was also considerable variability in the interest rate differential:

the standard deviation of the difference between the London and New York rates

was 1 .21%. The differential exceeded 4% in more than 7% of the months in the

pre—Worid War I period, and in July 1893, during a United States banking panic in

which convertibility was suspended, was 9.63%. In the flexible exchange rate

period, 1974 to 1983, the standard deviation of the difference between treasury

bill rates in the United States and United Kingdom, 2.66%, was substantially

larger than in the early gold standard period.

     The asset market linkages were closer in the inter—War period and in the

fixed exchange rate period 1964—1971. In the period 1925—1938 the mean London —

New York differential was only 0.24% with a standard deviation of 0.71%. The

mean differential in the 1964—1971 period was 1.33%, with the standard deviation

of the difference, 0.72%, almost identical to that for the inter—War period.

     There appear to be no reliable data on the size of short—term capital flows

during the gold standard periods, but the presumption is that they were both

large and an essential part of the mechanism that tied capital markets together.

The extent to which disturbances to United States financial markets originated

abroad rather than domestically has not to our knowledge been documented,

although there are discussions of the national origins of international financial

crises.2' Morgenstern (pp 548—549) shows the United States as more frequently

the originator than the recipient of (stock market) panics. Of the eleven first

and second order United States panics recorded for the period 1873—1932, the

United States transmits panic abroad in nine episodes and is the recipient of

foreign shocks in only two (1890 and 1907). On other occasions, including 1914,

foreign disturbances are transmitted to the United States without causing a
                                         —12—




panic.

     There are estimates of aggregate capital flows, long— plus short—term, which

are consistent with the net export data presented in Table 1 above.22 These show

the United States as primarily an importer of capital (averaging 0.8% of NNP)

over the period until 1896; an exporter of capital (average equal to 1.1% of NNP)

over the next nine years; once more an importer on a small scale until 1914;

exporting capital on a large scale during World War I (average of 4.8% per year

of NNP for the years 1914—1919) and continuing to do so until 1933; reverting to
                                                                     until the most
the role of importer until 1941; and thereafter exporting capital

recent period.



4.   Adjustment under the Gold Standard

     We now briefly pull together the strands in the above discussion of the

mechanisms linking the United States and foreign economies under the gold

 standard, as background for our analysis in the next section of the operation of

 the current flexible exchange rate system.

         The earliest analysis of the operation of the gold standard, the Hume price-

 specie flow mechanism, focussed on the goods markets and on movements in relative

 national price levels. These mechanisms should be expected to produce slow

 adjustment to disturbances. Consider for example the response of the economy to

 an upward shift in the domestic demand for money.     Under the price—specie flow

 mechanism, the reduced demand for goods tends to reduce domestic prices and the

 demand for imports. The current account goes into surplus and gold flows in to

 satisfy t}'e increase in money demand. The mechanism can operate successfully

 through real balance effects on the demand for imports even if PPP holds exactly.

                                                               the process will have
 In the event the disturbance to money demand is temporary,

 to be reversed when the disturbance disappears.
                                     —13—



     Subsequent analysis described a system with more rapid adjustment in which

asset market linkages allowed capital flows in response to incipient interest

rate movements, perhaps caused by active central bank (or in the case of the

United States, Treasury) intervention, to help equilibrate the system.23 We

continue with the example of an upward shift in the demand for money. The impact

of such a shift, which might be associated with a financial panic, is to increase

domestic interest rates. There is a capital inflow that equilibrates interest

rates at home and abroad, and helps meet the increased demand for money. If the

demand shift is temporary, there need be no major disruptions to the goods

markets. Thus in this case the capital markets facilitate more rapid adjustment

to a domestic disturbance. If the demand shift is permanent, goods market

adjustments are needed to pay the interest on the capital inflow.

     This example is chosen as a case in which capital flows ease domestic

adjustment. But of course from the viewpoint of the foreign country the asset

market linkages permit transmission of a disturbance that would otherwise have

been much slower in appearing. Further, as we know from the downfall of the

Bretton Woods system, international capital flows in fixed exchange rate systems

are not always regarded as an unmitigated blessing. There are thus two

questions: first, how did the gold standard system survive during the period

1879—1914 when capital flows were not restricted; and second, did capital flows

on average ease the adjustment processes of the system to disturbances?

     Bloomfield argues that because there was no serious belief, even during the

silver agitation in the United States, that exchange rates would change, capital

flows under the pre—World War I gold standard while substantial and sensitive to

 interest rate movements, were not destabilizing. He argues also that over the

period, the discount rate actions needed for external balance typically coincided

with those needed for internal stabilization, so that capital flows were on
                                     -14-



balance stabilizing. The latter argument is vitiated by the well—known fact that

central banks did not even during the heyday of the gold standard conform to the

rules of the game, and frequently sterilized gold flows.2

     The issues of the stabilizing or destabilizing roles and relative importance

of the goods market, price—specie flow, and asset market linkages, and of

intervention, under the gold standard have not been settled, despite the

extensive literature. Friedman and Schwartz emphasize the importance of relative

national price level adjustments in response to money flows.25 Nurkse (op.cit.)

argues that adjustment was typically more rapid than the price—specie flow

mechanism implies, and credits multiplier effects of the trade balance for part

of the speed—up. The capital account tended to move procyclically, apparently

offsetting the stabilizing effects on the system of the money stock movements

implied by the anti-cyclical current account. Such capital flows might appear to

have been destabilizing from the viewpoint of the cycle, but that would not be

the case if they were accommodating temporary disturbances.26 And the issue of

whether central bank sterilization had and can have any real effects, and if so

whether the effects are stabilizing, is still alive.




II. Open Economy Macroeconomic Linkages.

     In this section we study the ties between U.S. macroeconomic variables and

 the world economy, and discuss how the openness of the economy affects

 stabilization policy. The analysis relies on the theoretical model sketched in

 the appendix, which embodies the main channels and effects that are given

 emphasis in open economy macroeconomics.27 As in the previous section, we start

with goods market linkages between the United States and other economies.
                                           —15—




1. Goods Markets.

    The channels of transmission in the goods market are described by equations

(1) and (2) below. (For notation, and other arguments of the demand function,

see the appendix; time subscripts are omitted when there is no risk of

confusion).



(1) Y =   D(eP*/P,Yd,q,V,...)   +   NX(eP*/P,Yd,Y*d,V,V*,...)


     Equation (1), the goods market equilibrium condition, describes the

contribution of net exports to aggregate demand. The demand for domestic goods

is determined by real disposable income, the profitability of investment, the

real exchange rate eP*/P, and real wealth. Exports depend on the real exchange

rate, and on domestic and foreign income and wealth.

     Equation (2) is the price equation:



(2) P = C(W,Pm,eP*,Y/K)




In (2) the materials price term, Pm, changes as the prices of imported inputs

change. The term in foreign prices, eP*, represents the effects of foreign

competitiveness on domestic prices. Equation (2) can be thought of either as a

mark—up equation, or as the description of equilibrium price determination in a

competitive economy.

     Several channels of transmission, which can be described in aggregate supply

and demand terms, emerge from equations (1) and (2).28 We confine ourselves for

the moment to impact effects, thus taking into account only shortrun cyclical

flexibility of prices and wages. The channels are:

(i) Most familiar, a rise in foreign income and spending raises the demand for
                                      —16—




our goods, shifts the aggregate demand curve   up,   and thus leads to an increase in

output and home goods. An example is an increase in foreign import demand as a

result of expansion abroad. This channel is of course present under both fixed

and flexible exchange rates. Such multipliers should be close in size to

government spending multipliers.29

(ii) A rise in import prices, induced by exchange depreciation or increased

foreign prices, shifts both aggregate demand and supply curves. On the demand

side, assuming a sufficiently large price elasticity, there is a shift toward

domestic goods, and therefore a tendency for output and prices to rise. On the

supply side, the increase in competitors' prices leads to an increase in home

prices as domestic firms increase their mark—up. 30 Domestic prices certainly

rise; we would expect output to increase.

     The effects of an import price increase in practice depend on the extent to

which other endogenous and policy variables react to the disturbance. In

particular, it is important to know whether wages rise in response to higher

import prices, and whether the monetary authorities accommodate the disturbance.

The more wages rise with import prices, and the more accommodating is money, the

smaller the real effects and the larger the impact of the import price change on

prices. Results of simulations of econometric models, such as the OECD Interlink

model, the Japanese EPA model, or the Federal Reserve's MCM model will differ in

 their assumptions about the nominal feedbacks resulting from an import price

increase, and conclusions about the effects of disturbances are likely to differ.

     Even leaving aside feedbacks from wages and money, there are effects of

 import price changes on aggregate demand. To the extent that higher import

 prices raise the price level, without there being offsetting reductions in

 domestic prices, the real money stock falls and the equilibrium interest rate

 that clears the assets markets will rise. Higher interest rates in turn imply a
                                     -17-



reduction in income and spending, and reduced aggregate demand and employment.

     It is well known from the literature on trade equations31 that higher import

prices can in the short run lead to increased import spending and a decline in

net exports. The fall in net demand may imply a reduction in demand for domestic

goods, or possibiy a reduction in saving.32 If increased import spending is

financed by a reduction in domestic saving, output will expand. If it has as its

counterpart reduced spending on domestic goods, output will fall. Theoretical

analyses show that in this context it matters whether the disturbance is

permanent or transitory, and whether consumers strongly prefer smooth consumption

streams and do not react to changes in the intertemporal terms of trade. The

case most favorable to expansion of employment occurs if a disturbance is

believed to be temporary and consumption smoothing dominates real interest rate—

induced effects.

(iii) Increased materials prices imply increased costs and therefore cause the

aggregate supply curve to shift up. But there are also demand side effects.

Increased prices of imported materials imply a reduction in real disposable

income since there is a reduction in value added at a given level of output.

Domestic real disposable income falls because with real output unchanged, the

higher real price of imported intermediate products implies that real income

available for domestic factors of production is reduced. Aggregate demand

therefore declines. Bruno and Sachs (1983) have discussed the relative

importance of the supply and demand shifts and the resulting ambiguity for the

net effects.33 There is no question that output will decline, but the price

level may rise or fall. We assume the net effect is an increase in prices.

     Materials prices are determined by supply and demand conditions in the world

market. Equation (3) describes the price of materials:
                                         -18-




(3) pm =   v(Y,Y*,...,P,eP*)


We assume v( )   is   degree one homogeneous in the domestic and foreign price

levels. Accordingly, we can rewrite (3) as



(3a) Pm/P =   v(Y,Y*,...,eP*/P)


Equations (3) and (3a) make the important point that exchange rate disturbances

unrelated to price level movements directly change commodity prices, both in

dollars and in real (u.s. goods) terms. In addition, of course, the real price

of commodities is affected by short and longrun supply conditions, such as OPEC

shocks.

(iv) The wealth and disposable income terms in (1) point to a further channel of

international linkage. Changes in the world real interest rate redistribute

wealth and income internationally between net creditors and net debtors. A rise

in the real interest rate is an intertemporal terms of trade change that benefits

 lenders whose real income rises, and hurts borrowers. At the same time, higher

 real interest rates affect the valuation of existing assets. The values of real

 capital and longterm debt decline, thereby reducing world wealth. The net impact

 of these changes on aggregate demand for United States goods is not obvious.

 (v) Wealth effects are important also in the context of persistent international

 capital movements, for instance arising from persistent public sector deficits.

                                                                international
 With marginal spending patterns differing internationally,

 redistributions of wealth associated with capital account imbalances shift the

 pattern of world demand toward the goods demanded by persistent lenders and away

 from those demanded by persistent borrowers.

2. Goods and Factor Price Linkages.

      Equations (2) and (3) show the external sector affecting domestic prices

directly, both through the effects of competitive import prices on domestic mark-

ups, and because import prices affect costs and thus prices. Equation (2) also

points to two indirect routes through which the foreign sector affects domestic

prices., Exposure to foreign competition may affect wage settlements in

industries substantially involved in the international economy. Further, demand

pressures from abroad affect domestic prices through their impact on aggregate

demand.

      Tables 7—9 report evidence on the impact of the external sector on domestic

inflation.35 For simplicity, and to avoid "overfitting", we did not allow

ourselves the use of dummy variables, nor did we experiment much with lag

lengths. The basic approach was to enter four lagged value5 of each of the right

hand side variables, but not to restrict the shape of the lag distribution. The

coefficients on the wage change variable were still increasing up to the

fourth lag, so we extended that lag length to six quarters. Contemporaneous

values of the right hand side variables are generally excluded; ordinary least

squares regressions suggested that the omission was serious only in regressions 3

(and 6), where a contemporaneous value of the rate of change of the import price

deflator is accordingly entered.36

       The exchange rate variables in each case affect the inflation rate in the

expected direction, and for the most part significantly. Further, the mean lag

by which the exchange rate affects the inflation rate is always shorter than that

by which wage changes affect inflation.37 Equation (1) gives the most direct

relationship between the rate of change of the exchange rate and the inflation

rate of the GNP deflator. According to (1), a 1O change in the exchange rate

directly changes the GNP deflator by only O.6. Even the largest effect, in
                                       -20-




regression (3), would change the GNP   deflator   by only 1.3% in response to a 10%

change in import prices.38 The direct effects are not, however, the end of the

story, because we shall see in discussing Table 8 that changes in the exchange

rate affect wages.

     Comparing Tables 7 and 8 we find a generally more powerful effect of the

exchange rate variables on consumer prices than on the GNP deflator. The

feedthrough to consumer price inflation is particularly rapid in the case of

changes of import prices. Even in this case, though, the sum      of   the lag

coefficients is only 0.14: a 10% change in import prices changes the personal

consumption deflator by 1 .4%, with most of the effect taking place contemporan-

eously.

     Table 9 examines the impact of the exchange rate on the rate of change of

wages.39 The results across the three equations show a consistent effect of

exchange rate movements on the rate of change of manufacturing wages: a 10% rate

of change of the exchange rate reduces the rate of wage change by between 1% and

1 .5%. The mean lags are however longer than in the price equations.

     Taking the price and wage equations together, and at a given unemployment

rate, an appreciation of the currency affects the domestic price level first

through direct price effects and then through indirect effects on wages. The

direct effects are relatively quick, and imply that a 10% change in the exchange

rate affects the price level within a year by about 1%. There is then a second,

more slow—working, effect on prices, working through wages, amounting to somewhat

under 1% for each 10% change in the exchange rate. We take the latter effect to

 represent the impact of foreign competition on domestic wages.

      The results of Table 7-9 thus support the argument that exchange rate

 changes affect the domestic price level, and during the adjustment period, the

rates, a flexible exchange rate regime provides an extra channel of influence of

policy on prices.

     Table 10 summarizes the channels and lags with which a 10% real depreciation

translates into an increased consumption deflator. The Table highlights the fact

that for given unemployment and expected inflation rates, real depreciation

exerts a significant impact on prices and does so quite rapidly The exchange

rate must play a part in explaining U.S. inflation, and in assessing the impact

of policy changes on the price level.

     Figure 4 shows the actual inflation rate and also an estimate of the

inflation rate purged of exchange rate effects. The latter series is constructed

using the estimated coefficients of the real depreciation variable in equations 5

and 8 in Table 8 and 9 respectively. The adjusted series is an estimate of what

inflation would have been had there been no effect of real depreciation on

prices, either directly or indirectly via wages. Figure 4 brings out the role of

exchange rate changes in the major episodes of inflation acceleration and

deceleration: 1973—74, 1978—80 and 1981—83. In the acceleration periods exchange

depreciation increases inflation substantially while in 1981—83 exchange

appreciation strongly reinforces the deceleration of inflation. This role of

exchange rates in the wage—price sector of the economy is accepted as obvious in

small countries. In the U.S. it is already part of macroeconometric models, but

is not yet accpeted by mainline macroeconomics.41.

    We now turn to the asset markets to explore further the effects of monetary

and fiscal policy on the exchange rate.



3. Asset Markets.

     International capital mobility is a fact, but the appropriate specification

of asset markets remains an open issue.42 There are three chief questions.

First, are domestic and foreign bonds perfect or imperfect substitutes? Second,

should stock markets be given a prominent role in modelling interntional asset

markets, or is the traditional money—bonds model adequate for understanding the

linkages? Third, does the international redistribution of wealth through the

current account play a significant role in the determination of the exchange rate

and macroeconomic equilibrium? The answers to these questions help analyze the

implications of sustained fiscal deficits and of longterni current account

deficits——for instance, whether sustained deficits build up a "dollar overhang"

that will force exchange depreciation.

     We have to preface this section by noting that empirical exchange rate

models perform poorly. Meese and Rogoff (1983) show that a random walk model

typically predicts exchange rates as well as standard structural models, even

when the forecasts of the latter are based on realized values of future

explanatory variables.3 The exchange rate is like the stock market in that

price movements are dominated by unforecastable changes; accordingly the

extraction of the systematic components of price movements is difficult in

samples of the length currently available. The absence of decisive empirical

 evidence forces a greater reliance on theorizing, and on snippets of evidence

 rather than a complete empirical model, in discussing exchange rate and

 international economics.

     We start with the basic model in which foreign and domestic bonds are

 perfect substitutes. The domestic nominal interest rate is therefore equal to

 the foreign nominal rate plus the anticipated rate of depreciation:



 (4) i =   i   + e




 (A over a variable denotes its proportional rate of change.) Subtracting
                                        —23—



national inflation rates from both sides gives the equivalent equation in real

interest rate form:



(5) r     r* +   (e   +   p -   p41)




Real interest rates can diverge internationally so long as the real exchange rate

is changing, but in longrun equilibrium real interest rates are equalized. The

assumptions of perfect asset substitutability, in combination with a

specification of goods markets in which output determines demand and prices

adjust slowly to excess demands and supplies, leads to the following results:5

1. An increase in the money stock leads under flexible rates to an immediate

depreciation of the exchange rate. The exchange rate initially overshoots its

long run equilibrium because prices are sticky, real balances increase, and

output expands while the real and nominal interest rate fall. In the adjustment

process following the initial overshooting, inflation is accompanied by currency

appreciation as the real exchange rate returns to its long run equilibrium



     Monetary and fiscal policy thus work in good part through the real exchange

rate as well as the real interest rate channel. This was of course the

fundamental insight of the Mundell—Fleming model. In 1964 Mundell'7 noted


        It is important to notice too that budgetary policy, like monetary policy,
        has a different role in a flexible exchange rate system       An increased
        budget deficit without monetary expansion would raise interest rates,
        attract capital, appreciate the exchange rate, and worsen the trade balance
        with little benefit to employment. With sufficient monetary expansion a
        budget deficit would be unnecessary.


4. Monetary Policy.

     The results of any policy change are quite sensitive to policies followed

in the rest of the world. Specifically it matters whether the authorities in
                                              —24-




the rest of the world stabilize interest rates, output, or monetary aggregates.

                                                        rates in the context of a
 For instance, if they attempt to stabilize interest

foreign budget deficit, they create a monetary expansion in attempting to fight

rising domestic rates.48

      The combination of rapidly clearing assets markets and prices that adjust

sluggishly implies a relation between real interest differentials and real

exchange rates. In the course of adjustment to a monetary disturbance, the real

exchange rate will adjust gradually to its longrun equilibrium value, R. Let

  =   log(eP*/P)    denote the logarithm of the real exchange rate. Then the model

implies that:49



                           + aR
(6) Rt =        (1_a)Rti

Combining the equation with the relation between real interest rates in (5),

r =   r*   +   R, we obtain:



 (7) Rt =         — b(r_r*),      b=(1—a)/a



       Equation (7) states that if our interest rates exceed those abroad, then the

 real exchange rate will be below its long run euqilibrium value. In other words,

 a positive real interest differential implies real appreciation. The extent of

 such appreciation depends on the speed of adjustment in the economy.     The term

 b is the mean lag, which under rational expectations is a compound of the

 structural coefficients in the model. If the mean lag is three years, then a 3

 percentage point real interest differential implies that the exchange rate

 deviates from its longrun equilibrium by 9%. The asymmetry ir adjustment speeds
                                      —25—



between goods and assets markets thus establishes a link between tight money and

significant, transitory, exchange rate overvaluation.50

     The implications of flexible exchange rates for disinflation in a sticky

price world (the real world) are quite apparent: because tight monetary policy

works rapidly and strongly on the exchange rate, disinflation can take place

more rapidly. The Phillips curve becomes steeper under flexible exchange

rates. 51




5. Fiscal Policy The analysis of fiscal policy under assumptions of perfect

asset substitutability is straightforward: a sustained fiscal expansion raises

longrun aggregate demand and therefore must bring about crowding out. The

crowding out occurs through two channels. The first is a real appreciation in

the expanding country due to the relative increase in demand for that country's

goods. The other is an increase in the world real interest rate. In a small

country, crowding out will work entirely through the real exchange rate, implying

that the current account deteriorates by the full amount of the fiscal

expansion.

     What are the implications for the exchange rate? Given the nominal money

stock and full employment, higher real interest rates imply reduced real money

demand and hence a higher price level in each country. For the real exchange

rate to appreciate, we, therefore, require a nominal appreciation of the

expanding country.

      This analysis of the effects of a fiscal expansion is incomplete in that it

does not take into account complications arising from the debt—financing of the

deficit in the short term and the ultimate need to raise taxes to service the

larger debt. Nor have we taken into consideration the implications of sustained

current account imbalances that redistribute wealth away from the expanding
                                          —26—




country.   What are the implications of these additional channels?

     As noted above, the redistribution of wealth via current account imbalances

will affect the goods markets because marginal spending patterns differ.

Therefore, demand for the expanding country's goods would decline over time, due

to redistribution; the need for real appreciation is therefore dampened. But,

this effect is offset, to some extent, by the stimulus due to deficit finance.52

     The portfolio effects associated with debt finance remain an unsettled area

of research. Once we depart from the assumption of perfect asset

substitutability, we must reckon with the asset market implications of debt

finance. These effects occur through two channels. First, there is a direct

effect of debt finance on the relative supplies of assets. Debt finance implies

that the relative supply of the expanding country's
                                                        debt rises. Asset holders

have to be compensated to hold an increasing fraction of their wealth in the form

of the expanding country's debt either through an increased nominal interest

 differential or through anticipated appreciation. But, it is also possible that
                                                      country reduces the value of her
 a once and for all depreciation of the expanding
                                                                    share and
 debts in terms of foreign exchange, thus reducing the portfolio

 eliminating the need for higher interest rates or appreciation.

      The discussion is clarified in equation (8) where we present the

 interational interest rate relation taking into account the risk premium that

 results from imperfect asset substitut1on.5' The equation states that the

 nominal interest differential equals the expected rate of depreciation plus a

 risk premium, K, which depends on the relative supply of domestic debt relative

 to world wealth and on the domestic share in world wealth.




 (8) i =   i*   +   e + K(B/eV*,V/eV*), K1 >O,K2 <0
                                     -27—




where V is world wealth measured in terms   of   foreign exchange. Equation (8)

shows that the exchange rate or the rate of depreciation must adjust to maintain

portfolio balance in the face of a rise in the domestic bond supply, given

interest rates. The possibility of exchange depreciation to clear asset markets

runs counter to the analysis for the goods markets, where crowding out leads to

expect an appreciation. What then will happen? As the discussion here already

makes clear, this is not an area where we expect unambiguous results.

     Research on the implications of debt finance has used simulation to attempt

to assess the relative importance of portfolio effects——relative asset supplies

and risk prernia-—and aggregate demand effects.55 The quantitative finding that

emerges is that in the longrun a fiscal expansion will lead to depreciation,

rather than appreciation, if the portfolio effects are relatively important.

Specifically, if debt issue forces a large increase in our interest rates to

maintain portfolio balance, and if demand reacts to the interest rate increase by

more than full crowding out, then a real depreciation is required to restore

goods market equilibrium. If, by contrast, assets are very highly substitutable,

then risk premia do not play a significant role, and as a result, the longrun

crowding out must take place via real appreciation.

     In concluding the discussion of the portfolio effects of fiscal policy, we

note that these effects are entirely due to the assumption that budget deficits

are financed by issuing bonds denominated in terms of the expanding country's

currency. The risk premium effects can be avoided by financing deficits in a way

that keeps the currency composition of world outside assets unchanged. For

instance, in the present circumstances, the U.S. would finance part of the

deficit in Yen and DM bonds. We also note that our analysis has not taken into

account effects of fiscal policy on the stock market. These effects have not

 conclusions about the effects of monetary and fiscal policies. Tight money, for

 example, may not lead to appreciation if foreign governments are inflation-

 contraction to avoid currency depreciation.      In other instances "synchronized

     International   interactions exert an important effect on the manner in whcih

monetary and fiscal policies operate.    The exchange rate system determines the

extent to which asynchronized policies are possible and the channels through

which they exert their effects on the economy.    The Mundell—Fleming model of

twenty years ago introduced these ideas and they remain valid today. For the U.S

economy policy limitations becase apparent in the late 1960s when capital

outflows on a large scale signalled that even a large country could not set the

tone for the world economy. But under flexible exchange rates these

interdependence effects have become much more dramatic. They immediately affect

the key trade—off——the Phillips curve. Theory suggests and empirical evidence

supports the notion that under flexible rates the Phillips curve is much steeper.

A tight money policy leads to appreciation and thus allows rapid disinflation.
                                                    is that crowding out takes
The traditional idea, appropriate to fixed rates,

place chiefly via higher interest rates depressing interest sensitive components

of spending, particularly housing. Under flexible rates the crowding out takes

place also at another margin, reduced net exports due to appreciation.

     Thinking on fiscal policy, too, must be modified.     Fiscal expansion via its

 impact on interest rates induces currency appreciation, at least in the short

 rim. Therefore fiscal expansion is less inflationary than the closed economy

 Phillips curve would suggest, but it also involves more crowding out. This is

 because net exports decline under the impact of appreciation.

      Several unsettled areas of research require attention.    One is to determine

 the importance of relative aset supplies for risk premia and hence for longrun

 interest differentials and/or equilibrium real exchange
                                                           rates. The literature,

 as yet, gives no quidance to these issues.    To make the point concretely, we do

 not have in domestic macroeconomics any empirical evidence that suggests that the

 maturity of the debt affects the term structure of interest rates. Long term and
                                        —31—



short term debt, for macroeconomics, is much the same.   Is   this also true when we

ask whether it makes a difference whether our U.S. deficits are financed in DM or

$US bonds? If the answer is affirmative an entire popular range of ideas about

budget and exchange rates becomes irrelevant.

     The second issue on which we know very little, indeed even less, is the open

economy role of the stock market. If asset markets are important via their

impact on exchange rates and hence on aggregate demand and prices, then surely

the stock market must take a particularly important place. The stock market

would play an important role because it is forward looking and because of its

size relative to other asset markets.

     The third issue, closely linked to the previous point, concerns the open

economy linkages to investment. What is the impact of real exchange rates on

investment spending and how important are long swings in real exchange rates in

affecting investment and hence productivity growth and employment. This question

connects, of course, with the crowding out issue raised above. The current view

expressed in policy discussions is that there is less crowding out under flexible

than under fixed exchange rates. But perhaps, taking into account the open

economy channels, we get as much crowding out of investment, but with real

appreciation rather than increased real interest rates as the channels and with

manufacturing rather than housing as the affected sector. Such effects, if they

do exist, would have significant longer run implications for the performance of

the economy.

                                       Appendix

        In this appendix we set out and briefly analyze a simple model that includes

the three chief links between the domestic and international economies: the
                                                            analysis; asset market
demand for goods, corresponding to Keynesian multiplier

linkages, emphasis on which at one time led to the claim that exchange rates are

determined in the assets markets; and the supply side, which has received

emphasis in the recent disinflation. The model guides our discussions in the

text of the effects of exchange rate changes and foreign shocks.



I. The Model

A. The Assets Markets: There are four assets: domestic money, domestic bonds,

foreign bonds, and capital. Domestic money is held entirely by domestic

residents. Domestic bonds and capital may be held by foreigners as well; foreign

bonds may be held by domestic residents.

        Equilibrium conditions in the markets for domestic assets are:




 (Al) Mt— = L(Yt, R)                                 L1 > 0, L2 < 0
         Pt

                                                     H4 < 0, H5 < 0, H6 > 0, H>0

                                                                    0, 6> 0, J7> 0
                                                     J4> 0,

                                                              domestic bonds,
Symbols are defined in Table Al. The expected real returns on
capital (equity) and foreign bonds are given by:




(A4) (1+y) =      (1+R)t(p)

                  F (K Y )
                      K   t' t
                                 + tqt+1
(A5) (1+y) =




(A6) (1+y) =      (l+R)t(ettp
                         t+l t+1
                                         )




The pre—subscript t, indicates the expectation formed on the basis of information

available at time t. In writing (A2) and (A3) as functions not only of expected

real returns, but also of                the expected inflation rate, we use the first order

approximation:



(A4)' (1÷R) =         (1+y)
                                  t+ 1




                            B tt+l
                 '-
                      (i+   t P
                            )




                 =
                      (l+y)(1+rI)

A similar approximation applies for the return on foreign bonds.

     Real domestic wealth, V., consists of holdings of the four assets by

Because foreign residents may hold both domestic bonds and domestic equity, the

amounts of these assets held by domestic residents are not xsually equal to the

outstanding stocks.

       The assumption in (Al) is that money is held for transactions purposes, at

an opportunity cost equal to the return on bonds.1

The assets are assumed to be gross substitutes. Demand functions by domestic

residents have the same general forms as LC( ), H(                 ),   and J( ),   but   are not

dependent on foreign wealth, V. In addition, the demand by domestic residents

for foreign bonds is:



           d*
        etBt =
(A8)              G(Yt, Y,    fl'   •4'        v)            G1
                                                                   0, G2 < 0, G3          0,


                                                                  < 0, G > o         > 0




B. The Goods Market: We start by specifying the demand for domestic output.



                  eP*                                  eP*
 (A9) Y =    D(         yd    0, V,
                                               + NX(         d          V(q,q*,P/P))
                                          —35—




              D.   >0, i= 1,?                                         <0
                                   NX1 >0, NX2 <0, NX3 >0, NX4


Prices are based on costs and the level of output relative to capacity:



          =                                       C1 > 0, C2 > 0, C3 > 0, C4 ) 0
(Ala)          c(w, P,           Yt/Kt)



The function (AlO) permits an interpretation as a supply function with output on

increasing function of the price level and a decreasing function of the wage,

materials prices, and the prices of imported inputs.2



C. Wages: Wages are predetermined, based on the level of output (and thus

employment) and expected price level:



                                                                                      > 0
(All) w =      ((Y/K)i,       t_1(Y/K)t, t_;t, wt_i); l > o
                                                                       > 0,    > 0,




D. Accumulation Equations: The wage equation provides the first explicit

dynamic equation. Asset accumulation equations add further essential dynamics.




(A12) Kt = (1_o)Kt_1      +




(Al3)                                     +

                                              —

            etB+i -         Bt+i_Bt+i       Kt+i_Kt+i


(A12) is the capital accumulation equation, (A13) the government budget

constraint, where it is implicitly assumed that all debt is one—period, and (A14)

is the balance of payments constraint.

        The openess of the economy is reflected in the asset market equilibrium

conditions, the goods market, and in the asset accumulation equations. In the

assets markets, movements in foreign interest rates, or in foreign wealth, affect

U.S. rates of return and asset prices: Foreign influences appear on both the

demand and supply sides in the goods market; on the supply side, external

disturbances may affect both the prices of material inputs and, directly, the

costs of imported inputs. Equation (A14) describes the link between the current

account and net ownership of foreign assets.

        We now analyze the short and long-run equilibria of the model, emphasizing

open—economy aspects, before turning to the dynamics of adjustment.



II. Short Run Equilibrium

        To start we examine short—run asset market equilibrium. We wish to obtain

functions:




                    R(Xt)

(A15)          = q(X)
          et/Pt= e(Xt)



where         [Mi, Bt, Kt, P' Y'                        y, B, K, B*]
Several of the variables in X. will themselves be determined in the full
                                        -37-


equilibrium   of the model. The asset holdings, B, K, B are to be understood

as beginning of period stocks.

     The properties of the functions in (Al5) are implied by the equilibrium

conditions (Al) —   (A3).   (Al) directly implies




(A16) R =     R(,   Yt)
                                    R1 < 0, R > o




We are thus making the strong assumption that money market conditions alone

determine the short term interest rate. Inclusion of wealth in the demand

function for money would modify this latter conclusion without affecting the

signs of the derivatives indicated in (A16).

     The properties of the q( ) and e( )    functions   are obtained using (A2) and

 (A3). Suppose there is an increase in the expected real return on foreign bonds,

     with other variables in      held fixed. (Thus both the nominal and real

 returns on foreign bonds increase.) Figure Al shows asset market equilibrium

 loci, JJ representing capital market equilibrium and HI-I bond market equilibrium.
                                                           in q creates an excess
 The JJ curve is positively sloped because an increase

 supply Ic capital that is offset by the wealth effect arising from an increase in

 the real exchange rate (depreciation). The I-rH curve slopes down because an

 increase in q creates excess demand for bonds through both rate of return and

 wealth effects, which is offset by the wealth effect of an appreciation.

      An increase in the foreign interest rate creates an excess supply of both

 bonds and capital in the U.S. The curves shift as shown in Figure Al to maintain

 asset market equilibrium. The real exchange rate unambiguously rises——the

 currency depreciates. The effects on q depend on the relative substitutability

of domestic bonds and capital for foreign bonds. If the substitution is mainly

between domestic and foreign bonds, then q will rise. This occurs because with

the domestic interest rate given, the increase in e/P that equilibrates the bond

market is large and creates excess demand in the capital market. If substitution

between foreign bonds and domestic real assets is high, a rise in interest rates

abroad will reduce U.S. stock values. An increase in the expected rate of

depreciation of the dollar (i.e. a rise in tet+i/et) will have the same effects

on the exchange rate and q as a change in the foreign interest rate.

     An open market purchase, in Figure A2, reduces the domestic interest rate,

creating an excess demand for capital and-—it can be shown-—an excess supply of

bonds. Equity prices rise while the effects on the exchange rate are ambiguous.

The more substitutable are bonds and capital the more likely is it that the open

market purchase causes the currency to depreciate.

         The properties of the functions q( ) and e( )   in    (A15), which can be derived


using similar analysis, are:



                                                                                   >0

Appendix: Data and Definitions

1. The Wage equations in Table 5 use the following data:

W: hourly earnings of produciton workers, total private non-farm

Wman: hourly earnings of produciton workers in manufacturing

Wser: hourly earnings of production workers, services
                                              to quarter change at an annual rate in
Wage inflation is measured by the quarter

each equation. The unmeploytnent variables in the three equations are

respectively the unemployment rate of wage and salary workers in manufacturing,

the unemployment rate of wage and salary workers in finance and services, and the

conclusion that business cycles have been more co—ordinated in the flexible rate

4. Column 5 gives the ratio of tariff revenues to imports of goods, dutiable and

non—dutiable. Such measures are imperfect indicators of the level of tariffs, as

exemplified by the fact that a prohibitive tariff would have no weight in an

index of this type.

described in terms of its effects on protection: "Prom the middle of 1929, the

steady deepening of depression, particularly in the raw material producing

countries, greatly reinforced the pressure for higher tariffs...The whole

movement was undoubtedly accentuated both by the alarm and resentment felt in

many countries as the discussions of the new Hawley—Smoot tariff dragged on in

the United States Congress from May 1929 to June 1930, and by the real effects of

that tariff when it went into operation." There is no suggestion that the tariff

is the or even a chief cause of the depression.

Edition, 1964, pp.518—519 presents the results of a Tariff Commission calculation

of what tariff revenues would have been in 1922 and 1930 for imports at the level

of 1928. This index thus holds the composition of imports and their prices

constant: tariffs increase for all categories, but the increases are small. The

largest increase is from 19.9% to 33.6% for agricultural products and provisions.

Other examples are chemicals, oils, and paints, from 29.22% to 31 .4%, metals and

manufactures from 33.7% to 35.0%, manufactures of cotton from 40.3% to 46.4%.

as a way either into or out of recessions. Exchange rate changes that can be

made to stick achieve most of the same purposes.

and then set the exchange rate as the ratio of price levels, broke down.

Incidentally, one of Morgenstern's findings is that the gold points were on many

occasions violated by actual exchange rates.

similar assets in the same national market, as a benchmark for the international

comparisons.

conclusion on the propensity to sterilize is noteworthy (p.50). "By an amazing

coincidence, these overall percentages [frequency of offsetting] are virtually

influence of the current account on the money stock. He concludes that while

capital flows moved in a procyclical direction, thus offsetting the effects on

money supply of the anti—cyclical current account, the current account effects

dominate.

28. To derive the aggregate demand schedule we assume away complications in the

model presented in the appendix that result from the multiplicity of assets and

direct links between exchange rates and asset markets.

29. Multiplier assumptions or estimates in large scale trade models range

between one and two. For instance, the OECD International Linkage Model assumes

a first year government spending multiplier for the United States of 1.5. See

"International Economic Linkages," in OECD Economic Studies, No. 1, (Autumn

1983), pp43—92. The EPA model has an implied first year multiplier closer to

one. See Akihiro Amano, Akira Sadahiro, and Takahiro Sasaki, "Structure and

Application of the EPA World Econometric Model," Economic Planning Agency,

Tokyo, August 1981, p. 50. (Calculation based on the elasticity of U.S. GNP with

respect to world imports in the EPA model.) However, Michael Darby and Alan C.

Stockman find very weak multiplier effects in their international model. See

Chapters 5-7 in Michael Darby et.al., The International Transmission of

Inflation, National Bureau of Economic Research, 1983.

34.   Ideally   we would want to quantify each of the five channels isolated in the

above discussion. However since in practice they all operate at the same time,

it is not easy to separate them. Nor are we aware of attempts to do so. Large

scale econometric models typically explicitly embody some but not all of these

channels; for instance the EPA model (op.cit.) includes the multiplier, relative

price, oil (equivalent to raw materials in our discussion) and some wealth

redistribution effects.

35.   Inclusion   of external variables in the Phillips curve, particularly import

prices, has a long tradition in open economies such as the United Kingdom.

Without serious loss of generality, we confined our search of the United States

literature to the Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, (BPEA). Foreign

variables first appeared in a United States Phillips curve in BPEA in William

Nordhaus, "The Worldwide Wage Explosion," BPEA, 2, 1972, pp.431—464. Robert J.

Gordon reported on a re—estimate of his basic Phillips curve to include import

prices in "The Response of Wages and Prices to the First Two Years of Controls,"

BPEA, 3, 1973, pp 765—778. Interestingly, at that time import prices fed through

only slowly into domestic prices. James L. Pierce and Jared J. Enzler used the

MPS   model to examine the effects of foreign disturbances in "The Effects of

External Inflationary Shocks," BPEA, 1, 1974, pp.13—54. More recent empirical

work that emphasizes external effects includes Robert J. Gordon, "Inflation,

Flexible Exchange Rates, and the Natural Rate of Unemployment," pp.89-153 in

Martin N. Baily (ed.), Workers, Jobs, and Inflation, Brookings Institution,

1982.

36. Here are futher details of and comments on our estimation or search

procedure. (1) We also experimented with the addition of the rate of change of

 the food price deflator, omitting that variable because of collinearity with
                                         -48-



included variables. (ii) The theoretical specification of the mark—up equation

in equation (2) includes the level of output, but we did not find output measures

or the unemployment rate entering the regressions of Table 6 significantly.

(iii) Given the serial correlation, the endogeneity problem remains even when

the right hand side contains only lagged variables. However, the problem is

limited because the serial correlation coefficient in most of the equations is

low, and because the lag coefficients in the most problematic case——that of

wages-—typically peak only at the third lag and are small at the first lag.

Instrumental variable techniques are used in equations (3), (6) and (7)—(9). We

did not use the technique more extensively because we were unable to persuade

ourselves that the instruments we used——the monetary base, full employment budget

surplus, and military spending--were indeed exogenous, except perhaps the last.

In the cases where we used instrumental variable estimation, the ordinary least

squares and two stage least square estimates were quite similar.

37. This is not a reflection of the fact that we allow six lags for the wage

variable and only four for the exchange rate variables; when we allowed only

four lags for wages, the mean lag for this variable was still longer than that

for exchange rates. The mean lag is easy to interpret when all lag coefficients

are of the same sign. In all but one case, the coefficients on wage change are

all positive. In the case of exchange rate changes, though, either the first or

the last lag coefficient is usually of a different sign (though statistically

insignificant) than the remaining coefficients. To avoid prejudicing the

comparison of mean lags in favor of the exchange rate, we define the mean lag as
 i!aj
    1
          , where the a.1 are the estimated coefficients.
  (Za.)

38.   It is noticeable in both Tables 7 and 8 that the coefficient on DEX is

larger than that on DWAX. The reason is probably that DEX, the rate of change of

the real exchange rate, is approximately equal to DWAX plus the foreign inflation
                                        -49-.




rate minus the domestic inflation rate. Since DEX enters negatively, it

essentially includes positive lagged values of the dependent variable. Its

coefficient is therefore increased as a result of serial correlation of the

dependent variable. This interpretation is strengthened by the fact that the

coefficient of serial correlation in regression (2) is lower than that in (1),

and similarly comparing regressions (5) and (4).

39. In Table 9 we use a simple adaptive expectations formulation to generate

expected inflation. We have also re-estimated equation (7) using a three period

distributed lag on the predicted inflation rates from equation (4) as the

expectations variable. This change reduces the coefficient on the unemployment

rate, and also reduces the coefficient on the exchange rate to —.11 with a t—

statistic of 2.43. The sum   of   the coefficients on the expected inflation rate is

0.93.

40. Our direct coefficients are typically smaller    than   those of Gordon (1982,

.cit.) This may be a result of our choosing not to use dummy variables to

account for episodes such as wage—price controls. Nonetheless, the sum of the

direct and indirect effects is quite smaller to the coefficients obtained by

Gordon, whose sample period was 1952 to 1980.

significantly different from that for the closed economy. However, discussion

of that issue and its implications would take us too far afield.

46. Overshooting is not inevitable: if dynamics are such that output initially

expands sufficiently to raise the nominal interest rate when the money stock is

raised, the exchange rate will not overshoot. The presumption is though that the

nominal interest rate absorbs most of the initial impact of the money shock.

52. Olivier Blanchard, "Debt, Deficits, and Finite Horizons," unpublished

manuscript, M.I.T., 1983, has shown that fiscal expansion will have additional

expansionary effects associated with debt issue, when future taxes are discounted

at more than market rates. This effect continues, though dampened, in the open

economy. Unless the entire debt finance translates into current account

deficits, so that the rest of the world acquires all the debt, there will be some

net expansion of demand from debt creation.

version of the model.

59. We have not included cost of capital measures in (MO) though the rental

rate on capital and inventory holding costs do provide a supply side channel for

interest rates to affect prices.
