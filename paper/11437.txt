Our paper uses institutional-level panel data to test whether an increase in the number of

institutionally funded National Merit Scholarship (NMS) winners at an institution is associated with

a reduction in the number of Pell Grant recipients at the institution. We find that, other factors held

constant, an increase in the share of institutionally funded NMS winners in an institution's first-year

class is associated with a reduction in the share of Pell Grant recipients among the institution's

undergraduate student body and that the magnitude of this relationship is larges at the institutions

that enroll the greatest number of NMS students.

    I.       Introduction

    One of the strengths of the American higher education system is its competitive

nature. Colleges and universities compete for faculty, for students, for external research

funding and on the athletic fields. Given the wide publicity that the U.S. News & World

Reports annual rankings of colleges and universities receives and the importance of

student selectivity in these rankings, increasingly American colleges and universities are

using merit aid as a vehicle to attract higher test score students and to improve their

rankings.1

    It is well-known that test scores are correlated with students’ socio-economic

backgrounds. Hence to the extent that colleges are successful in “buying” higher test

score students, one should expect that their enrollment of students from families in the

lower tails of the family income distribution should decline. However, somewhat

surprisingly, there have been no efforts to test if this is occurring.

    Our paper presents such a test. While institutional level data on the dollar amounts of

merit scholarships offered by colleges and universities are not available, data are

available on the number of National Merit Scholarship (henceforth NMS) winners

attending an institution on scholarships that have been funded by the institution itself,

rather than the National Merit Scholarship Corporation (henceforth NMSC). These

institutional scholarships are awarded to high test score students only if they attend the

institution. Our research strategy is to estimate if an increase in the number of recipients

of these scholarships at an institution is associated with a decline in the number of

students from lower and lower middle income families attending the institution, other

factors held constant. We measure the number of these students by the number of Pell

Grant recipients attending the institution.

      Section II of our paper briefly describes the National Merit Scholarship and the

federal Pell Grant programs. In section III, we describe our analytical approach and

section IV presents our empirical findings. Section V provides some brief concluding

remarks.

      II.      The National Merit Scholarship and Pell Grant Programs2

      The National Merit Scholarship Program began in 1955. High school students

qualify for awards based upon their scores on the PSAT examination, high school

records, letters of recommendation, information about the students’ activities and

leadership, and personal essays.

      Three types of NMS awards exist. The first is a set of scholarships awarded to top

students independent of family financial circumstances by the NMSC itself; these awards

currently are $2,500 scholarships for one year of college and winners are free to choose

the institution that they wish to attend. The second is a set of scholarships awarded by

corporations to top students who are employees of the corporations, children of

employees, residents of a community in which the corporations have operations, or

students pursuing college majors or careers in which the corporations have a special

interest. These scholarships may be for one year of study or renewable for four years.

Again there is no restriction on the college or university that the student may attend.

      The final type, and the focus of our attention, is the NMS awards funded by colleges

and universities. Finalists in the NMS competition notify the NMSC of their first choice

college or university and the NSMC in turn notifies the institution. Each institution that

offers this type of award makes awards to a subset of the finalists that have indicated that

they wish to attend the institution. Crucially, an award is cancelled if the student decides

not to attend the institution. Hence, these awards are contingent on attending the

institution.

      These college and university funded awards are renewable for up to four years of

undergraduate study and provide stipends that range from $500 to $2,000 a year. Awards

of this amount pale when compared to the $30,000 tuition and fee levels that are now

common at the nation’s most selective private colleges and universities. However,

previous research has indicated that offering a top student a named scholarship enhances

the likelihood that a student will attend an institution.3 In addition, it is likely that

institutions that offer NMS awards offer additional merit aid to students and hence that

the dollar amount of the NMS awards likely understates the amount of merit aid that the

recipients receive from the institution.

      Table 1 provides information on the total number of NMS awards and the number of

these awards funded by colleges and universities for selected academic years between

1983 and 2003.4 The total number of NMS awards grew from 5,566 in 1983 to 8,244 in

2003. As the third column indicates the percentage of these awards funded by colleges

and universities increased from 42.8% in 1983 to 56.5% in 1995 and has remained at

about that percentage since then.

      NMS awards are heavily concentrated among a small number of our nation’s over

3,500 colleges and universities. Our econometric research will involve analyzing panel

data for the 100 colleges and universities that had the most new NMS winners attending

them in 2003. The names of the institutions and their number of NMS winners in 2003

appear in the appendix.5

     These top 100 institutions enrolled about 84% of all of the NMS winners in 2003

with somewhat lower percentages in the earlier years.6 Many of these institutions are

among the small number of colleges and universities that still pursue need blind

admissions and need-based financial aid policies and a number of them accordingly offer

no college and university funded NMS awards. However, even in this group of 100

institutions, the percentage of NMS awards that were funded by the institutions

themselves rose from 41.5% in 1983 to about 55.5% at the turn of the 21st century.

    Table 2 provide information for each year during our sample period on the numbers

of institution funded and non-institution funded NMS students at these institutions at the

25th percentile, 50th percentile (median), 75th percentile and mean institution in our top

100 sample. The total number of NMS students increases at each point in the distribution;

this increase is at least partially due to the way the institutions were selected (top 100 in

2003). What stands out, however, is that virtually all of the growth in the number of NMS

winners occurred in the institution funded category. For example, the mean number of

institutional funded awards in the sample rose from 17 in 1983 to 37 in 2003. As late as

1995-96, the 25th percentile institution (in terms of total number of NMS awards in 2003)

offered no institutional funded NMS awards. By 2003-2004, however, the 25th percentile

institution in the group offered 12 institutionally funded NMS awards.

    Our interest is in how the growth of merit scholarships has influenced the proportion

of students from lower and lower middle income families attending selective institutions.

5
 There actually are 103 institutions in the sample because of a tie for 100th place.
6
 The lower enrollment shares in earlier years are an artifact of the way the panel was constructed. This
occurs because there is some variation in the institutions that appear in the top 100 list from year to year.


                                                       4
While institutional level data on the family income distribution of students are not

collected by the U.S. Department of Education, data on the number of Pell Grant

recipients at each institution are collected annually.

     The Pell Grant program is the largest need-based financial aid program, in the United

States; it provided about $12.6 billion dollars in funding to 5.1 million undergraduate

students in 2003-2004.7 Eligibility for Pell Grants for a dependent student is based upon a

dependent student’s family income and wealth, the number of siblings in college and the

expected costs of attending the institution; for independent students eligibility is based

upon the income of the student and his or her spouse.8 Prior to 1993, awards were also

constrained to be less than 60% of the costs of attending an institution; some students

who attended low-cost institutions were excluded from participating in the Pell Grant

program for this reason.

    Data from the 2002-2003 Title IV/Federal Pell Grant Program End-of-Year Report

indicate that in that year 87% of all Pell Grant recipients at 4-year public institutions

came from families with family incomes of $40,000 or less; the comparable figure at 4-

year private institutions was 86.6%.9 Hence the share of Pell Grant recipients among an

institution’s undergraduate student body is a good proxy for the share of its students

coming from lower and lower middle income families.10

  Trends in Student Aid 2004 (2004), tables 1 and 3
8
  Seftor and Turner (2002) indicate that throughout the 1990s, over one-half of Pell Grant recipients were
independent students, although this fraction is likely to be much lower in the selective institutions that are
in our sample where most students are full-time students

10
   Tebbs and Turner (2004) caution that the Pell Grant recipient data refer to students attending an
institution anytime during a year, while IPEDs enrollment data refer to a point of time in the fall. Hence,
other factors held constant, if turnover of students is high at an institution during the year, this will
artificially make the “share” of Pell Grant recipients at the institution appear to be high. We control for this
in the empirical work that follows by including institutional fixed effects in our estimation methods.


                                                       5
     Table 3 presents information, by year, on the mean ratio of the number of Pell Grant

recipients at an institution to the number of full-time undergraduates attending the

institution for the 100 institutions in our sample during the 1983 to 2000 period. The

column headed “unweighted” presents information on the average percentage across

institution, while the column headed “weighted” is a weighted average, with the

enrollments used as weights. These data suggest that the percentage of Pell Grant

recipients among the undergraduate students at these institutions fluctuated, but gradually

increased during the period. 11

     This increase tells us little about the impact of the growth of institutionally funded

NMS at these institutions on the number of Pell Grant recipients at the institutions during

the period; the share of Pell Grant recipients at these institutions will vary over time as

the income distribution of the populations changes, as eligibility rules change, as

maximum award levels change and as tuition levels at the institutions change. Hence to

analyze the impact of changes in the number of NMS recipients on the number of Pell

Grant recipients, we must control for these other factors in our analyses

     III.    Analytic Approach

     Our goal is to see how the number of institutionally financed new NMS winners (Mt)

at an institution influence the number of Pell Grant recipients (Pt) at the institution, other

factors held constant). A problem that immediately presents itself is that the number of


11
  We caution the reader that part-time students attending at least half-time are eligible for Pell Grants.
However, the 2002-2003 Title IV/Federal Pell Grant Program End-of-Year Report (table 13) indicates that
86.9% of the Pell Grant recipients attending public 4-year institutions and 87.8% of the Pell Grant
recipients attending private 4-year institutions were full-time students that year For the institutions in our
sample, part-time students represent only 12.6 percent of all students and using total undergraduate students
in the denominator of our ratio does not change the trends reported above or any of the econometric results
that follow. We also should caution that only U.S. Citizens and permanent residents are eligible for Pell
Grants. Thus if an institution enrolls a high fraction of foreign students, its Pell Grant ratio will, other
factors held constant, appear to be low.


                                                      6
NMS winners refers to entering first-year students, while the number of Pell Grant

recipients refers to all enrolled undergraduates. If we had data on the number of Pell

Grant recipients that were first-year students at an institution, we would use this

information and information on the number of new first-year students at the institution to

construct the fraction of first-year students that were Pell Grant recipients at the

institution and then estimate how changes in the number of NMS winners affects that

ratio. However, Pell Grant data is not available at the institutional level by the year that

the student is enrolled in college.

    A solution to this problem is possible if we make some very strong and admittedly

unrealistic assumptions. Specifically, if one is willing to assume for simplicity that all

students at the institution enter as first-year students, that no students drop out before

graduation, that students’ Pell Grant eligibility does not change during the years that they

are enrolled in college and that all students who graduate do so in four years, then the

following relationship holds

(1) Pit = pit + pit-1 + pit-2 + pit-3.

         Here pit is the number of new first-year Pell Grant recipients that enroll at the

institution in year t. Put simply, the total number of Pell Grant recipients at the institution

in year t is the sum of the number of new first-year Pell grant recipients that enrolled at

the institution in year t and in each of the three preceding years. If one writes down the

equivalent expression for Pit-1 and then subtracts this from Pit, one finds that

(2) Pit – Pit-1 = pit – pit-4.

         Given the assumptions that we have made, the difference between the number of

Pell Grant recipients at an institution in year t and year t-1 is the difference between the




                                               7
numbers of first-year Pell Grant recipients in year t and year t-4. Hence if we want to

estimate how changes in the number of NMS influence changes in the number of Pell

Grant recipients at the institution between years t and t-1, the correct change in the

number of NMS winners to use is the difference between Mt and Mt-4 . So the dependent

variable in our econometric analyses will be based upon one year changes in the numbers

of Pell Grant recipients, while our explanatory variable will be based upon four year

changes in the number of institutionally funded NMS winners.

         Our empirical approach is to use our institutional level panel data to estimate

equations in which the one year change in the ratio of the number of Pell Grant recipients

to the number of full-time undergraduate students at an institutions is specified to be a

linear function of the four year change in the share of first-year full-time undergraduate

students that receive institutionally financed NMS awards at the institution, institutional

fixed effects, year fixed effects, and a random error term.

(3) (Pit/Fit) – (Pit-1/Fit-1) = a0 + a1 ((Mit/Nit) – (Mit-4/Nit-4)) + ui + vt + eit

         Here Fit is the number of full-time enrolled undergraduates at institution i in year

t, Nit is the number of full-time first-year students enrolled at institution i in year t, the aj

are parameters, the ui are the institutional fixed effects, the vt are the year fixed effects

and the eit is a random error term. The institutional fixed effects are included in the model

to control for institution specific factors other than changes in the number of NMS award

winners that might affect the change in the share of Pell Grant recipients at an institution.

The year fixed effects are included to control for changes in national factors that might

affect the share of Pell Grant recipients over time; these factors include changes in the




                                                     8
distribution of family income of college-age students, changes in Pell Grant eligibility

and generosity rules, and changes in Pell Grant funding levels.

          The Pell Grant and NMS variables have each been deflated by a relevant size

variable (total full-time undergraduate students or total full-time first year students) to

control for changes in the size of each institution over time. Because part-time students

enrolled for at least one-half of a normal full-time load are eligible to receive Pell Grants,

in the empirical work in the next section, we also experiment with deflating the Pell grant

and NMS variables by the total number of undergraduate students and the total number of

first-year students at the institution.

          Finally, we should note that our use of the one year change in the number of Pell

Grant recipients at institution to measure the four year change in the number of freshman

Pell Grant recipients at an institution is likely to be subject to substantial measurement

error because of the set of strict assumptions that we had to make to derive this

equivalence. However, if the measurement error is random, it will serve only to increase

the imprecision of our estimates; it will not bias the coefficient of the NMS variable.

    IV.      Empirical Findings

    Table 4 summarizes our initial estimates of equation (3). The coefficients in the table

are estimates of the parameter a1 that come from four different model specifications. The

first is based upon the total number of new NMS recipients at an institution, regardless of

the source of funding. The second is based upon the number of institutionally funded

NMS recipients. The third is based upon the number of NMS recipients at the institution

that are not funded by the institution. The final specification includes both the number of

institutionally funded NMS and the number of NMS recipients funded in other ways as




                                              9
explanatory variables. For each specification, we present estimated coefficients for

models that excluded and included year fixed effects; the estimates are not very sensitive

to these variables. The panel used in this estimation makes use of four years of NMS

recipient data – 1983, 1987, 1991 and 1995, so we have three change observations for

each institution in the sample.12

         The coefficients in row 1 suggest that increasing the ratio of new NMS award

winners, irrespective of source of funding, at an institution to the size of the institution’s

first-year full-time student body reduces the ratio of the institution’s number of Pell Grant

recipients to its full-time undergraduate enrollments. If the sizes of the institution’s first-

year full-time student body and its full-time undergraduate enrollments remain constant,

the interpretation of the coefficients are that an increase in NMS awards of ten at an

institution is associated with a reduction in the number of Pell Grant recipients at the

institution of about two.

         When we restrict our attention to the number of institutional funded NMS, the

magnitude of the reduction is doubled to a reduction of four Pell Grant recipients for

every ten additional institutionally funded NMS award winners, again holding constant

full-time freshman and full-time total undergraduate enrollment levels. Indeed, when we

restrict our attention to NMS winners not funded by the institution in row 3, an increase in

the number of these winners at an institution has no statistically significant effect on the

number of Pell Grant recipients at the institution. This finding is confirmed in the

coefficients from the last model (row 4); when both the number of institutionally

12
  The 2003 data could not be used because IPEDs data are not yet available for full-time first year students
and total full time undergraduate enrollment for 2002 or 2003. We exclude the 1999 data because IPED
enrollment data were not collected for that year. However, we report below our efforts to include data for
1999 by using the average of the institution’s enrollment in 1998 and 2000 as a proxy for its 1999
enrollment level.


                                                    10
financed and other NMS award recipients are included as explanatory variables only

increases in the former have a negative effect on the number of Pell Grant recipients at

the institution. Put simply, in our sample of institutions, other factors held constant

including the total full-time undergraduate and first-year enrollment levels, offering more

institutionally funded NMS awards is associated with fewer Pell Grant recipients

attending the institution and the magnitude of the reduction is roughly four less Pell Grant

recipients for each ten additional institutional NMS recipients enrolled at the institution.

        Table 5 presents estimates of coefficients from the models in table 4 that included

year fixed effects, in which the models were estimated for various subgroups of our

sample. In particular, we present estimates for the entire sample (the same as in table 4),

for the top 80 institutions in terms of the number of Pell Grant recipients in 2003, for the

top 60 institutions, for the top 40 institutions, for the top 20 institutions and for the top 10

institutions. These analyses confirm that only the institutionally financed and awarded

NMS adversely influence the number of Pell Grant recipients at an institution. However,

the magnitude of this displacement effect varies across institution. In particular, the

magnitude of the displacement effect increases as we move from the top 100 institutions,

to the top 80, down to the top 10 (in terms of total number of Pell Grant recipients in

2003). It is at the institutions with the largest number of Pell Grant recipients that the

displacement of Pell Grant recipients by institutionally funded NMS recipients is the

largest. Indeed, we cannot reject the hypothesis that, other factors held constant, at the top

10 institutions, every additional institutionally financed NMS recipient that attends the




                                              11
institution is associated with a reduction of one Pell Grant recipient attending the

institution.13

         Several extensions of our analyses warrant brief mention. First, we replicated the

analyses found in table 5 separately for public and private institutions. The pattern of

displacement effects for the privates was very similar to those for the entire sample; the

coefficients of the institutional NMS variable were indistinguishable for each subgroup

between private institutions and for the overall sample (reported in table 5). In contrast,

the displacement effects of increasing institutional NMS awards at public institutions

were not significantly different from zero when we used the top 80 and top 100 samples.

This says that at those public institutions which lie below number 60 in terms of total

NMS recipients in 2003, we find no evidence of a displacement of Pell Grant recipients

by institutionally funded NMS recipients.

         Second, we replicated the analyses found in table 5, adding data for 1999 to the

sample. Because 1999 enrollment data was not collected by IPEDs, this required us to

estimate the 1999 number of full-time first year students for each institution by the

average of the 1998 and 2000 values of this variable for each institution. We found that

even with the measurement error that is induced by doing this, our estimates of the

displacement effects of increasing the number of institutionally sponsored NMS recipients

at an institution on the number of Pell Grant recipients at the institution were roughly of

the same order of magnitude as those found in table 5.

         Third, part-time students attending an institution at least half-time are eligible to

receive Pell Grants. While we do not know the number of part-time students at each


13
  Four of the top 10 institutions are selective private universities that have no institutionally financed NMS
recipients. Four of the other six are flagship public universities (appendix table A)


                                                     12
institution each year that meet this criteria, we experimented with either including part-

time students in the total enrollment figures that are in the denominator of the dependent

variable in equation (3), including part-time first-year students in the total first-year

enrollment figure that is in the denominator of the explanatory variables in equation (3),

or doing both simultaneously. None of these changes substantially affected the findings

that we have reported so far.

        Finally, we divided our sample into institutions that experienced increases in total

full-time enrollments during both the 1987-1991 and 1991-1995 periods and all other

institutions. We estimated variants of the models that underlie table 4 for both groups.

We found that a strong statistically significant negative relationship exists between the

change in the ratio of institutionally funded NMS to the number of full-time first-year

students and the change in the ratio of the number of Pell Grant recipients to the total

full-time undergraduates enrolled at the institution existed only at the “growing”

institutions. Thus, the displacement of Pell Grant recipients by institutionally awarded

NMS recipients in our sample appears to occur only at institutions with growing

enrollments and largely reflects a change in the share of Pell Grant recipients in the

student body, not always an absolute decline in the number of Pell grant recipients.

   V.      Concluding Remarks

   Our study has provided the evidence that, other factors held constant, an increase in

the share of institutionally funded NMS students in a college or university’s first-year

class is associated with a reduction in the share of Pell Grant recipients among the

undergraduate student body at the institution. The magnitude of this displacement effect

is largest at the institutions in our sample that enroll the greatest number of NMS students




                                              13
and it occurs primarily in institutions whose enrollment is growing. We stress that we

have observed this displacement effect, as we expected, only for institutionally sponsored

NMS; we do not observe any displacement of Pell Grant recipients if an institution is able

to increase the number of NMSC or company sponsored recipients that it enrolls. Those

NMS winners, who receive their awards regardless of at which institution they choose to

enroll, do not appear to displace any student from lower-income families when they

enroll at an institution.

       While our research has focused only on NMS awards, it highlights the tradeoff that

may exist more broadly between using institutional grant aid to craft a more selective

student body than would otherwise occur and using institutional grant aid to attract more

students from families from the lower tail of the family income distribution. If selective

institutions, especially public ones, are committed to serving students from all

socioeconomic backgrounds, these institutions must track the share of their students that

receive Pell grants and focus on socioeconomic diversity as well as on student selectivity

as goals. Absent concerted efforts by these institutions to increase the representation of

students from lower and lower middle income families in their student ranks, current

inequalities in the distribution of students attending these institutions by family income

class are likely to persist or worsen over time.14

 Data on the number of National Merit Scholarship students by institution are provided by the
National Merit Scholarship Corporation. A complete list of these institutions was made available
to us for 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1991, 1995, 1999, and 2003. The Chronicle of Higher
Education publishes the top X institutions (where X varies across years from 30 to 100) that
enroll the most National Merit Scholarship students in many years. Because of the changing
coverage, we have not used the Chronicle’s data.
b
 The top 100 institutions are determined by the total number of merit NMS students in an
institution in 2003; these institutions are not necessarily the top 100 in earlier years. These
institutions enroll about 80% of all NMS (ranging from 78% in 1983 to 84% in 2003).

 The Pell Grant data are from the Federal Pell Grant Program administrated by the
Department of Education. We received data from the Department of Education for
academic years 1983-84 to 2003-04 on the number of students receiving Pell Grants and
total amount of Pell Grants received at each Title IV institution each year during the
period. Data on the number of full-time undergraduates enrolled at each institution and
the number of full-time first-time freshman at each institution are from Webcaspar
(http://caspar.nsf.gov). The percentage of Pell Grant recipients at an institution in a year
is 100 times the number of Pell Grant recipients at the institution in the year divided by
the number of full-time undergraduates enrolled at the institution in a year.
b
 Enrollment data were not provided by Webcaspar for 1999, so we used the average of
the 1998 and 1999 figures for that year.
