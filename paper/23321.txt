Summary

We revisit recent empirical evidence about the rise in top income inequality in the United
States, drawing attention to four key issues that we believe are critical for an informed
discussion about changing inequality since 1980. Our goal is to inform researchers, policy
makers, and journalists who are interested in top income inequality. Our analysis is based
on a reexamination of publicly available detailed statistics from two administrative data
sources: (i) Internal Revenue Service (IRS) data on total incomes (labor income plus capital
income), reported in Saez (2012), and (ii) individual-level micro data on labor income
(wage plus self-employment income) from the U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA),
reported in Guvenen et al. (2014). Reexamining these statistics reveals four findings:

In the final two decades of the 20th century (1981–2000):

  1. The rise in top income inequality revealed in SSA and IRS data track each other
     very closely, except for the two-year period between 1986 and 1988 (see point 2).
     This is despite non-trivial diﬀerences between the two data sources in the definition
     of income (labor vs total) and the unit of analysis (individual vs. tax unit).

  2. Between 1986 and 1988, IRS data show a large jump in top income shares, which is
     not evident in SSA data. This jump has been previously noted by researchers and

          is likely a consequence of income shifting from the corporate sectors to pass-through
          entities in the wake of the Tax Reform Act of 1986.

So far in the 21st century (2001–2012):

    3. IRS and SSA data reveal diverging patterns in top income shares – the IRS data
       show a steady increase, whereas the SSA data show no increase at all. The diﬀerence
       is due to the increasing importance of income accruing to pass-through entities (part-
       nerships and S-corporations), which is included in the IRS measure of total income
       but not in either the IRS or SSA measure of labor income.

    4. Moreover, the bulk of this growth in income from pass-through entities was concen-
       trated at the very top of the distribution – above the 99.99th percentile, a group
       that contains only about 12,000 households. The share of incomes above the 99th
       percentile (around $372,000 in 2012) but below the 99.99th percentile (around $7.2
       million in 2012) has barely changed in the last two decades.



1         Background

Top income inequality in the United States, as measured by the share of incomes accruing
to individuals in the top percentiles of the income distribution, has risen dramatically in
the last half century. Figure 1, which is based on data from Saez (2012) is a typical example
of the evidence that is used to illustrate this trend. The figure shows that after bottoming
out in the 1960s, the top 1 percent and top 0.1 percent shares of total income (excluding
capital gains) have been rising steadily for the last 40 years.1 This trend has motivated
research on top income inequality to a phenomenal extent; a vast number of recent papers,
too numerous to list, study its policy implications, theoretical underpinnings and statistical
deconstruction. That top income inequality is increasing in the United States has become
almost gospel in academic and policy debate on the topic of income distribution.

Our goal in this note is to highlight some features of the recent evidence on top incomes that
researchers, journalists, and policy analysts should bear in mind as the discussion of this
issue evolves. We do not deny that dramatic changes have taken place in the distribution
of incomes; the evidence in Figure 1 is indisputable. Instead, in typical economist fashion,
we want to emphasize some caveats that we think are particularly important for guiding
    1
        Throughout the paper, we exclude capital gains from our definition of total income.

the search for useful theories of changes in top inequality, for framing further empirical
investigation of top incomes, and for contextualizing the debate over the appropriate policy
response. The caveats that we emphasize pertain to subtleties in both words of the phrase
“top incomes”.

First, the precise definition of “income” is critical for the inferences one makes about recent
trends in top inequality. Much of the remainder of this note focuses on illustrating the dif-
ferences in trends for alternative measures of income. We start in Section 2 by highlighting
the diﬀerent trends in top income shares calculated from Social Security Administration
(SSA) data on wage, salary, and self-employment income versus those calculated from In-
ternal Revenue Service (IRS) data on total incomes as in Figure 1. The SSA data show a
much smaller increase in top income shares relative to the IRS data and no increase at all
since 2000. We then show in Section 3 that the diﬀerence in the trends in the two series
is due to the diﬀerent definition of income. The increase in top income shares observed
in the IRS data since 1981 is mostly a reflection of an increase in entrepreneurial income,
and most of that increase is due to income accruing to flow-through entities, such as S-
corporations and partnerships. This is important because the income accruing to these
entities is sensitive to changes in tax policy, such as the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA86)
(Feenberg and Poterba (1993); Gordon and Slemrod (2002)). Indeed, the increase in top


                                                         3
income shares in the two years immediately following TRA86 is larger than the entire
increase in top income shares over the period from 1981 to 2000. It is thus diﬃcult to
know how much of the increase in measured income of flow-through entities reflects a true
increase in incomes versus income shifting between the corporate and personal sectors.

Second, the precise definition of the “top” of the income distribution is critical for the
discussion of top income inequality. Researchers variously adopt the top 10 percent, 1
percent, 0.1 percent, or 0.01 percent as their preferred definition of the top of the income
distribution. This choice is often determined primarily by which of the definitions produces
statistics that better highlight the points they wish to make. In Section 4, we show that
almost all of the post-2000 increase in the top 1 percent income share is due to an increase
in the income of the top 0.01 percent income share. This means that the recent increase in
top income inequality is primarily a phenomenon that is about incomes above the 99.99th
percentile, rather than a phenomenon that is about incomes between the 99th and 99.99th
percentiles.

To put these diﬀerences in perspective, observe that in 2012, the 90th percentile of the total
income distribution was $112,000, the 99th percentile was $372,000, the 99.9th percentile
was $1.55 million, and the 99.99th percentile was $7.2 million. This is a wide range of
income levels even within the top 1 percent. Households with earnings at each of these
income levels come from diﬀerent backgrounds, work in diﬀerent occupations, obtain their
income from diﬀerent sources, face diﬀerent investment opportunities, and are subject to
diﬀerent types of risk. It is unlikely that a single mechanism simultaneously describes the
evolution of incomes at this wide range of levels.

A simple but often underemphasized point is that changes in top income shares can be
driven by changes in incomes at either the top or the bottom of the distribution. In
Section 5, we undertake a decomposition to better understand which of these changes are
more important for the observed trends. We find that both slower than normal income
growth in the bottom percentiles, as well as faster than normal income growth in the top
percentiles, contribute to the rise in top income shares over the past 30 years. The relative
contributions depend on assumptions about what constitutes “normal” income growth, but
with assumed normal growth rates in the range of observed average income growth over
the last century, stagnation of incomes in the bottom percentiles plays an important role
in explaining the growth in top income shares.

We end in Section 6 with some thoughts about the relative benefits of alternative sources
of data on top incomes as well as issues facing research on top income inequality.

                    dash-dot blue line is wage and salary income from W-2 plus self-employment income from
                    Schedule SE.



2                   Two Data Sources for Top Income Shares

We will frame our discussion of these issues by comparing two empirical time series for
top income shares, shown in Figure 2 (top 1 percent in the left panel, top 0.1 percent in
the right panel). The solid black line is the top income share from Saez (2012), defined as
the share of aggregate household income (including all types of labor and capital income,
but excluding capital gains) that is earned by the top 1 or 0.1 percent of households. The
series is constructed using data provided by the IRS. This is the same series as in Figure 1,
displayed from 1981 onward. The dashed red line is a closely related measure of top income
shares from Guvenen et al. (2014), which is defined as the share of aggregate individual
income from wages and salaries that is earned by the top 1 or 0.1 percent of individuals.
The series is constructed using data provided by the SSA.2

The series in Figure 2 are plotted starting in 1981 because the SSA data are only reliably
available from 1981 onward. For this reason, we will focus our remaining analysis on the
period from 1981 to the present. Although this is a much shorter time span than what
       2
    The IRS data come from Table A1 from Saez (2012). The SSA data are based on data from a 10
percent random sample from the Master Earnings File. See main text and Guvenen et al. (2014) for more
details of the data. Neither series includes non-wage (fringe) benefits that have been growing over this
period.


                                                                                    5
is displayed in Figure 1, almost all of the increase in top income shares has taken place
during these three most recent decades.

From 1981 to 1987 the two series show similar levels and trends for top income shares, for
both the top 1 percent and the top 0.1 percent. After 1987, however, striking diﬀerences
between the two series emerge. The IRS series show a distinct jump between 1987 and
1988, followed by a steady, almost linear, increase in the income shares of both top groups.
But the SSA data show only a very small increase in the income shares of these groups,
almost all of which took place during a brief period in the late 1990s. Since 2000, if there
is any trend at all in the SSA data, it is downward.

The diﬀerent trends in these two series for top income shares post-2000 have important
implications, particularly with regard to appropriate policy responses. With this in mind,
the remainder of this note focuses on understanding why and where these two measures of
top income inequality diﬀer in recent years. We delay our thoughts on the relative merits
of the two data sources and the implications of the diﬀerent trends until Section 6, at
which point the likely reasons for the discrepancy will be clearer.

Two main diﬀerences between the IRS and SSA income data could account for the diﬀerent
recent trends in Figure 2: the unit of observation and the definition of income.

In the IRS data, the unit of observation is a tax unit, whereas in the SSA data, the unit
of observation is an individual. Moreover, the two series in Figure 2 are each based on
selected subsamples from the respective data sources. The SSA series in Figure 2 comes
from Guvenen et al. (2014), which is based on a subsample of individuals who meet the
following two criteria: (i) the individual must be between 25 and 60 years old, and (ii) the
individual must have annual earnings that exceed a time-varying minimum threshold that
is equal to the earnings one would obtain by working for 520 hours (13 weeks at 40 hours
per week) at one-half of the federal minimum wage of that year.3 Excluding individuals
with low annual earnings is common practice in empirical analyses of earnings inequality.
The IRS series is constructed by Saez (2012) by scaling the number of tax units up to the
total population using U.S. Census Bureau population estimates and setting income for
non-filers equal to 20 percent of average income.

A consequence of the diﬀerent units of observation is that the two data sources deal with
the very bottom of the income distribution in diﬀerent ways. As shown in Figure 3, the
trends in these two alternative units of observation diﬀer substantially over the period
1981-2012. Trends in top income shares are determined by trends in incomes at both the

top and bottom of the distribution, so one might be concerned that the diﬀerent unit of
analysis drives some of the diﬀerences between the IRS and SSA series. Indeed, in the
context of comparing measures of income and wealth derived from IRS data with those
derived from Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) data, Bricker et al. (2016) conduct a
comprehensive investigation of the importance of using tax units versus families as the
unit of analysis for top income and wealth shares. They find that these diﬀerences in
the unit of analysis can explain virtually all of the diﬀerence in trends in top income and
wealth shares between the SCF and IRS data. However Bakija et al. (2012) and Smith et
al. (2017) compute top income shares in the IRS data with diﬀerent assumptions about
the bottom of the distribution to Saez (2012) and find a trend similar to the black line in
Figure 2.

So although in principle, diﬀerent units of analysis can aﬀect measured trends in top income
shares, we do not think this is a particularly important factor in reconciling the IRS and
SSA trends in Figure 2. Rather, it is the second diﬀerence between the two series – the
definition of income – that explains the diﬀerent trends in top income shares. The IRS
series is based on a broad measure of total income reported on tax returns, whereas the
SSA series is based on labor income reported on W-2 forms. The labor income reported
on W-2 forms includes wages, salaries, tips, bonuses, overtime, commissions, realized stock

options and taxable fringe benefits. After 1994, a broader measure of labor income that
includes both W-2 income as well as self-employment (sole proprietors’) income reported
on Schedule SE forms is also available in the SSA data. The top income shares based on
this expanded measure of labor income is shown by the blue dash-dot line in Figure 2.
The series closely tracks those based only on W-2 income. The main categories of income
that are included in the IRS total income measure but excluded from the SSA measure of
labor income are interest, dividends, rents, and all income that is reported on Schedule E
(income from royalties, partnerships, S-corporations, estates, and trusts). In the following
section, we investigate the importance of these diﬀerences in the definition of income.



3                   Wage Income versus Total Income

A useful starting point to help clarify the role of the broader definition of income in the IRS
data compared with the SSA data is to restrict the IRS definition of income to include only
wage and salary income, so that it coincides with the SSA definition. Using data reported
in Saez (2012), Figure 4 plots this series (green dash-dot line) alongside the corresponding
series based on total income from the IRS data (black solid line) and wage and salary
income from the SSA data (red dashed line), for the top 1 percent share (left panel) and

                                                                                      8
top 0.1 percent share (right panel). From the mid 1990s onward the IRS and SSA series
for wage and salary income follow very similar trends. For the top 0.1 percent share, the
two series lie almost on top of each other.

The data in Figure 4 are strong evidence that the absence of a trend in top income shares
in the SSA data is not due to anything particular about SSA data per se, since the same
conclusion is evident in the corresponding series from the IRS data. Rather, it appears
that the steady increase in top income shares in the IRS data is due to sources of income
other than those that are reported on W-2 forms (or Schedule SE forms, given the findings
reported in Figure 2). There is, however, a small diﬀerence in the trends in the two series
for top wage and salary income shares before 1995, which is likely attributable to the
aforementioned diﬀerences in the way that low-income individuals are treated in the two
series (see Figure 3).

Thus, the large and widening gap between the commonly reported IRS measure of top
income shares and the SSA measure we report here is due to diﬀerences between the wage,
salary, and self-employment income measured in the SSA data, and the broader measure
of income measured in the IRS data. Given that the recent rise in top income shares is
not from labor income, which components of income are driving this increase?
Four main components of income are included in the total income measure but are ex-
cluded from the wage and salaries measure: (i) entrepreneurial income, (ii) dividends, (iii)
interest, and (iv) rents. Figure 5 shows the share of total income that is accounted for by
each of these categories of income accruing to the top 1 percent (left panel) and top 0.1
percent (right panel). Over this period, the category that has shown the biggest increase
is entrepreneurial income (solid red line). With the exception of the mid-2000s, which saw
a brief rise in interest and dividend income, essentially all of the diﬀerential trend in top
shares between wage and salary income and total income can be attributed to the sharp
rise in the share of entrepreneurial income of top earners in total income.

So what exactly is “entrepreneurial” income? The series for entrepreneurial income comes
from Saez (2012) and is defined as the sum of profits from S-corporations, profits from
partnerships, profits from sole proprietorship businesses (Schedule C income), and farm in-
come. Profits from S-corporations and partnerships constitute income that is generated by
entities referred to as “pass-through” businesses. Cooper et al. (2016) undertake a compre-
hensive investigation in order to trace the pass-through income to its ultimate originators
and conclude that at least half of the post-1980 rise in the top 1 percent income share can
be accounted for by pass-through entities. Precisely because S-corporation income is the
largest category and largest driver of income growth among the top percentiles, Smith et

al. (2017) conduct a detailed investigation of recent trends in ownership of S-corporations.
Their findings, together with the trends in Figure 4 and Figure 5, strongly suggest that
pass-through entities account for almost all of the rise in entrepreneurial incomes in the
top percentiles.

Moreover, it is clear from Figure 5 that the period from 1986 to 1988 is particularly im-
portant in accounting for the overall change in entrepreneurial income among the top
percentiles over the last three decades. This is concerning because these are the years im-
mediately following TRA86. It is well documented that because of the significant reduction
in personal income tax rates that were part of TRA86, non-corporate pass-through enti-
ties such as S-corporations became a more attractive corporate structure than corporate
entities such as C-corporations (see Auerbach and Poterba (1987), Auerbach and Slemrod
(1997), and Gordon and Slemrod (2002)). For example, Auerbach and Slemrod (1997)
provide a comprehensive overview of TRA86 and note the sharp increase in S-corporations
in the immediate wake of the reform.

This raises the question of how much of the increase in top incomes from 1986 to 1988
reflects an actual increase in income versus how much is simply a shift of income that
was previously labeled as corporate income to personal income – a concern that has been
previously raised by Feenberg and Poterba (1993) and Gordon and Slemrod (2002). A
back-of-the-envelope, but not unreasonable, upper bound on the eﬀects of TRA86 on top
income shares is to assume that all of the 1987-88 increase in top shares was due to income

                                                                           10
shifting. The blue dashed line in Figure 4 shows how the IRS series for top shares based
on total income would look under this assumption. With the 1987-88 jump removed, both
the top 1 percent and top 0.1 percent shares from the IRS total income data (blue dashed
line) lie essentially on top of the corresponding shares from the SSA wage and salaries data
(red dashed line) all the way up to 2000. The diﬀerence in the 1987-88 growth in the top
1 percent income share between the IRS data and the SSA data accounts for 91 percent of
the diﬀerence in the growth of the top 1 percent share over the period 1981 to 2000. For
the top 0.1 percent share, the diﬀerence between the two series in the 1987-88 change is
larger than the diﬀerence in the change in the top 0.1 percent share over the entire period
1981-2000. For the entire period 1981 to 2012, the 1987-88 change accounts for 35 percent
and 37 percent of the diﬀerence between the two series in top the 1 and top 0.1 percent
share growth, respectively.
In summary, essentially all of the increase in top income shares in IRS data over the last
30 years is due to an increase in entrepreneurial income, in particular income earned by
pass-through entities such as S-corporations. For the period from 1981 to 2000, the eﬀects
of income shifting due to TRA86 likely explain the majority of the additional top share
growth observed in the IRS total income data compared with the SSA wage and salary
data. For the period post-2000, top income shares computed using only wage, salary, and
Schedule SE income are either flat or declining, whereas top shares based on a broader
measure of income show a continued increase. Almost all of this recent increase is due to
an increase in the share of income accruing to S-corporations, whereas capital income such
as interest and dividends have played a very minor role.



4    The Top versus the Very Top

The previous section showed that the post-2000 increase in the top 1 percent and top 0.1
percent shares of total income is mostly attributable to an increase in income earned by
pass-through businesses such as S-corporations and partnerships. In this section, we show
that this increase in top shares is primarily due to an increase in average incomes at the
very top, above the 99.99th percentile, of the distribution and is not due to a broad-based
increase in average incomes among the top 1 percent. For perspective, recall that in 2012
the 99.99th percentile of the total income distribution was $7.2 million, with about 12,000
households earning above this threshold in the entire U.S. economy.
The contribution of this very small group to rising top income shares is most easily seen
by recomputing the trends by excluding these households. As seen in Figure 6, when we

exclude households with income exceeding the 99.99th percentile (green dashed lines), the
income shares of the top 1 percent and top 0.1 percent display a much smaller increase.
From 2000 to 2012, the top 1 percent share grew by 2.8 percentage points, and the top
0.1 percent share grew by 1.7 percentage points. With the top 0.01 percent of households
excluded from the analysis, the top 1 percent share grew by 1.9 percentage points, and the
top 0.1 percent share grew by only 0.5 percentage point over this period.

Alternatively, we can decompose top income shares to quantify the relative importance of
changes at the very top of the distribution. Let total incomes be denoted by Y , and let
yp be the pth percentile of the income distribution. Then the share of income accruing to
the top pth percentile, sp , is given by

                                                                      E [Y |Y > yp ] p

If q > p is a higher percentile in the distribution, then we can decompose the top pth
income share sp as

                                       E [Y |Y > yq ] q E [Y |yp < Y  yq ] (p q)

majority of the increase in top income shares is concentrated in incomes above the 99.99th
percentile of the income distribution. In 1981, income earned by the top 0.01 percent
accounted for less than 30 percent of the income earned by the top 0.1 percent. In 2012,
the top 0.01 percent accounted for over 45 percent of the income earned by the top 0.1
percent. This shift in the composition of income among the top 0.1 percent has meant that
although there has been a continued increase in the top 0.01 percent share of total income
since 2000, the increase in the share of incomes accruing to the second 0.09 percent has
been much smaller over this period.



5             The Bottom 99 Percent

Often overlooked is that the evolution of top income shares reflects changes at both the
top of the income distribution and the bottom of the income distribution. An increase in
the top 1 percent share could be due to either faster than normal income growth among

                                                                    13
the top 1 percent or to slower than normal income growth among the bottom 99 percent.
Since each of these possibilities suggests diﬀerent policy responses and diﬀerent avenues
for theoretical investigations, in this section we suggest a decomposition to quantify the
relative importance of average income dynamics in the top and bottom of the distribution.
Of course, any decomposition of this type is sensitive to the definition of “normal income
growth”, so we present results for various alternatives.

We start by defining rp as the following monotonic transformation of the share of income
accruing to the top pth percentile, sp ,
                                                                        p
                       qp ⌘ log (sp )     log (1       sp )   log
                                                                    1       p
                                                   p
                          = log E [Y |Y > Y ]            log E [Y |Y < Y p ] .


These transformed top income shares follow a trend similar to the top income shares in
Figure 2. We can decompose the change in the transformed top income shares as

                qp = ( log E [Y |Y > Y p ]         g) + (g          log E [Y |Y < Y p ]) .
                     |          {z                  } |                  {z            }
                          fast growth above Y p                slow growth below Y p


The first term is the component of the change in the top income share that is due to
faster than normal income growth among the top pth percent, and the second term is the
component of the change in the top income share that is due to slower than normal income
growth among the bottom (1 p)th percent. Normal income growth is denoted by g.

Table 1 reports the results of this decomposition for the period 1981 to 2012 under alter-
native assumptions about normal income growth g. With assumed normal income growth
over this period of 2 percent, the decomposition suggests that around half of the increase
in the top 1 percent income share is due to faster than normal income growth among the
top 1 percent, and the other half is due to slower than normal growth among the bottom
99 percent. For the top 0.1 percent income share, approximately 70 percent of the increase
is due to faster than normal income growth among the top 0.1 percent, and the remaining
30 percent is due to slower than normal income growth among the bottom 99.9 percent.

Assuming faster normal annual income growth than 2 percent delivers a decomposition in
which stagnation in the bottom percentiles contributes more to the increase in top income
shares, whereas assuming slower normal income growth leads to a decomposition in which
acceleration in the top percentiles contributes more. Annual growth rates in average total
incomes (excluding capital gains) have fluctuated a lot over the last century. Over the 30

years immediately prior to 1981, average annual income growth was around 1.7 percent,
from 1933 to 1981 average growth was 2.8 percent and from 1913 to 1981 average growth
was 1.5 percent. With assumed normal growth rates anywhere in this range, stagnation of
incomes in the bottom percentiles plays an important role in explaining the growth in top
income shares.



6    Taking Stock

Since 2000, diﬀerent measures of top income inequality have exhibited very diﬀerent trends.
Top income shares based on measures of total income show a continued rise, whereas top
income shares based on wage and salary income show no increase in inequality post-2000.
The most important diﬀerence between these two measures of income is the income that
accrues to S-corporations. Moreover, the majority of the recent increase in top income
shares is due to an increase in average earnings at very high income levels, much higher
than that assumed in typical discussions of top income inequality. Once incomes above the
99.99th percentile are excluded (around $7 million in 2012), we see that little continued
growth in top income shares has taken place in the last 20 years. Put simply, so far in the
21st century, all the action in top income shares has been S-corporation income at very,
very high income levels.
What does this all mean for researchers and policy makers who are interested in the causes
and consequences of changes in inequality?
First, when we discuss inequality, even inequality at the top, we must be clear about
exactly which part of the distribution we are talking about. Diﬀerent data sets and diﬀerent
income concepts are appropriate for diﬀerent parts of the distribution. For example, when

                                            15
discussing individuals with the very highest incomes, it is crucial to use data that include
S-corporation and partnership income; these are available in IRS data but not in SSA
data. At the same time, it is important to not lump all individuals in the top 1 percent
or top decile in with these very, very high earners. Individuals above the 90th or 99th
percentile, but below the 99.99th or 99.9th percentile, have seen trends in income growth
that are very diﬀerent from those of individuals at the very top, and their incomes tend to
be driven mostly by wage, salary, and Schedule SE income.

Second, in discussions of income inequality, we should always be aware of the unit of
analysis. The unit of analysis in the IRS data is fundamentally a tax unit, which is not
necessarily a unit that we care about for welfare and policy purposes. Tax units are a
legal construct that respond strongly to changes in incentives, individual incomes, and
aggregate economic conditions, and many individuals in the United States are not part of
any tax unit since they do not file tax returns. On the other hand, the unit of observation
in the SSA data is an individual, which is essentially exogenous to tax policy and economic
conditions. This distinction is particularly important for the bottom of the distribution.
Hence, for discussions of inequality that compare individuals with high (but not super-
high) incomes to individuals in the bottom half of the distribution, the SSA data may be
more appropriate than the IRS data.

Third, we need to be careful about the impact that tax incentives have on the allocation
of incomes to diﬀerent sources. We have seen that the most important component of
income that is included in the IRS total income measure but missing from the SSA labor
income measure is S-corporation income. But interpreting trends in the S-corporation
component is extremely diﬃcult. Feenberg and Poterba (1993), Gordon and Slemrod
(2002), and Cooper et al. (2016) warn that much of the recent increase in S-corporation
income is income that previously accrued to C-corporations. Such income is not “new”
income earned by top earners but is simply income that was previously labeled as corporate
income rather than household income. A large amount of this relabeling occurred in the
wake of the reductions in personal income tax rates that were part of the TRA86. This
income shifting potentially accounts for all of the increase in S-corporation income at the
top of the distribution prior to 2000.

Focusing on W-2 income largely avoids the issue of income moving between the corporate
and personal sectors but misses the income sources where all the action at the top of the
distribution has been so far in the 21st century. Moreover, W-2 income is not completely
immune from income-shifting activities. When an entity switches from a C-corporation to
an S-corporation, some of the income that was previously paid to owners as W-2 income

                                            16
will be reclassified as S-corporation income. This could lead to a fall in W-2 income that
may partly account for the slight downward trend (or lack of an upward trend) post-2000
in top wage and salary income shares. We think that further investigation of these issues
– for example the ongoing work by Smith et al. (2017) – is tremendously important for
understanding the trends in top income shares in the 21st century.
