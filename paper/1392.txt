                        Are Business Cycles All Alike?

                                   ABSTRACT




     This paper examines two   questions. The first is whether   economic
 fluctuations—business cycles—are due to an accumulation of nall shocks or
instead mostly to infrequent large shocks. The paper concles that neither
of these two extreme views accurately characterize fluctuations. The second
question   is whether fluctuations are due mostly to one source of shocks, for

example monetary, or instead to many sources. The paper concludes that

evidence strongly supports the hypothesis of many, about equally important,

sources of shocks.

     To analyze the empirical evidence and to reach these conclusions, the

paper uses two different statistical approaches. The first is estimation of

a structural model, using a set of just identifying restrictions. The second

is non—structural and may be described as a formalization of the Burns

Mitchell techniques. Both approaches are somewhat novel and should be of

independent interest.

Introduct ion




     The propagation—impulse framework, which was introduced in economics by

Frisch (19331 and Slutsky [19271, has come to dominate the analysis of

economic fluctuations. Fluctuations in economic activity are seen as the

result of small, white noise, shocks——impulses——which affect the economy

through a complex dynamic propagation system.1'2 Much, if not most, of empiri-

cal macroeconomic investigations have focused on the propagation mechanism.

In this paper we focus on the characteristics of the impulses, and the impli—

cations of these characteristics for business cycles.


     It is convenient, if not completely accurate, to summarize existing

research on impulses as centered on two independent but related questions.

The first question concerns the number of sources of impulses. It asks

whether there is one or many sources of shocks to the economy. Monetarists

often single out monetary shocks as the main source of fluctuations;3 this

theme has been echoed recently by Lucas [1977] and examined empirically by the

estimation of index or dynamic factor analysis models. The alternative view,

that there are many, equally important, sources of shocks seems to dominate

most of the day—to—day discussions of economic fluctuations.


    The second question concerns the way in which the shocks lead to large

fluctuations. It asks whether fluctuations in economic activity are caused by

an accumulation of small shocks, where each shock is unimportant if viewed in

isolation, or rather whether fluctuations are due to infrequent large shocks.

The first view derives theoretical support from Slutsky, who demonstrated that

the accumulation of small shocks could generate data which mimicked the

behavior of macroeconomic time series. It has been forcefully restated by
                                         —2—

Lucas [1977]. The     alternative   view is less articulated but clearly underlies

many descriptions and policy discussions. It is that there are Infrequent,

large, identifiable shocks which dominate all others. Particular economic

fluctuations can be ascribed to particular large shocks followed by periods

during which the economy returns to equilibrium. Such a view is implicit in

the description of specific periods as the Vietnam War expansion, the oil

price recession, or the Volcker disinflation.


     The answers to both questions have important implications for economic

theory, economic policy, and econometric practice. We cite three examples.

The role of monetary policy is quite different if shocks are predominantly

monetary or arise partly from policy and partly from the behavior of private

agents. The discussion of rules versus discretion is also affected by the

nature   of   shocks. If shocks are small and frequent, policy riles are clearly

appropriate. If shocks are instead one of a kind, discretion appears more

reasonable.4 Finally, if infrequent large shocks are present in economic time

series, then standard asymptotic approximations to the distribution of estima—

tors may be poor, and robust methods of estimation may be useful.


     This paper examines both questions, using two different approaches to

analyze the empirical evidence. The      first   approach is the natural, direct

approach, in which we specify and estimate a structural model.        This allows

us to examine the characteristics of the shocks and to calculate their contri—

butions to economic fluctuations. In Section I we discuss the structural

model, the data, and the methodology in detail. In Section II we present the

empirical results. We conclude that fluctuations are due, in roughly equal

proportions to fiscal, money, demand, and supply shocks. We find substantial

evidence against the small shock hypothesis. What emerges however is not an
                                        —3—


economy characterized by large shocks and a gradual return to equilibrium, but

rather an economy with a mixture of large and small shocks.


       Our second approach to analyzing the data is an indirect one, which tests

one of the implications of the small shock hypothesis. If economic fluctua-

tions arise from an accumulation of small shocks, business cycles must then

be, in some precise sense, alike. We therefore look at how "alike" they are.

The comparative advantage of the indirect approach is that it does not require

specification of the structural model; its comparative disadvantage is that it

may have low power against the large shock hypothesis. It is very similar to

the study by Burns and Mitchell [1947] of commonality and differences of busi-

ness cycles. Instead of focusing on graphs, we focus on correlation coeffi-

cients between variables and an aggregate activity index. While these corre-

lation coefficients are less revealing than the Burns and Mitchell graphs they

do allow us to precisely state hypotheses and carry out statistical tests.

Our   conclusions   are somewhat surprising: Business cycles are not at all

alike. This, however, is not inconsistent with the small shock hypothesis,

and provides only mild support in favor of the view that large specific events

dominate individual cycles. These results cast doubt on the usefulness of

using "the business cycle" as a reference frame in the analysis of economic

time series. These results are developed in Section III.

Section I. The Direct At,t,roach. Methodolo2y


1. The Structural Model


     Let        be the vector of variables of interest.           We assume that the

dynamic behavior of             is given by the structural model:5



                                         n
                                   X =         A,X    +                                (1)
                                    t
                                         i=O
                                                    .
                                                a t—i      t
                                       c') = D if t=r
                                    E( tt

                                               0 otherwise


where D is a diagonal matrix.


     Our vector          includes four variables. Two are the basic macroeconomic

variables, the variables of ultimate interest; they are output and the price

level. The other two are policy variables. The first is a monetary aggre-

gate, M1 , the second is an index of fiscal policy. We shall describe them

more precisely below.


     The structural model is composed of four equations. The first two are

aggregate demand and aggregate supply. The other two are equations describing

policy; they are policy feedback rules. The vector                 is the vector of four

structural disturbances. It includes aggregate supply and demand distur-

bances, as well as the disturbances in fiscal and monetary policy. The

matrices A. ,     i=   O,...n    represent the propagation mechanism.


     We assume that the structural disturbances are contemporaneously uncorre—

lated, that their covariance matrix, D ,           is   diagonal. Rowever, we do allow

the matrix A0 to differ from zero, so that each structural disturbance is
allowed to affect all four variables contemporaneously.


     Leaving •side, for the roment, the issue of identification and estima-

tion of (1), we now see how we can formalize the different hypotheses about

the nature of the disturbances.


2. Is there a dominant source of disturbances?


     There may be no single yes or no answer to this question. A specific

source may dominate short—run movements in output but have little effect on

medium—run and long—run movements. One source may dominate prices movements,

another may dominate output movements.


     Variance decompositions are a natural set of statistics to use for shed-

ding light on these questions. These decompositions show the proportion of

the K—step ahead forecast error variance of each variable which can be attri-

buted to each of the four shocks. By choosing different values of K , we can

look at the effects of each structural disturbance on each variable in the

short, medium and long runs.


3. Are there infrequent larRe shocks?


     A first, straightforward, way of answering this question is to look at

the distribution of disturbances —   or more precisely the distribution of
estimated residuals. The statement that there are infrequent large shocks can

be interpreted as saying that the probability density function of each shock

has thick tails. A convenient measure of the thickness of tails is the kur—

tosis coefficient of the marginal distribution of each disturbance,

E[tejt/aj)4]. We shall compute these kurtosis coefficients. In addition we

shall see whether we can relate the large realizations to specific historical
                                        —6—

events and fluctuations.


     This first approach may, however, be too crude for at least two reasons.

The first is that a particular source of shocks may dominate a given time

period, not because of a particular large realization but because of a

sequence of medium—sized realizations of the same sign. The second reason is

similar but more subtle. The system characterized by (1) in a highly aggre-

gated system. Unless it can be derived by exact aggregation — and this is

unlikely —   it   should be thought of as a low dimension representation of the

joint behavior of the four variables        .   in   this case the "structural" dis-

turbances c will be linear combinations of current and lagged values of the

underlying disturbances. An underlying "oil shock" may therefore appear as a

sequence of negative realizations of the supply disturbance in (1). For both

reasons, we go beyond the computation of kurtosis coefficients. For each time

period we decompose the difference between each variable and its forecast con-

structed K periods before, into components due to realizations of each struc-

tural disturbance.      If we choose K large enough, forecast errors mirror

        major fluctuations in output as identified by NBER. We can then see

whether each of these fluctuations can be attributed to realizations of a

specific structural disturbance, for example whether the 73—75 recession is

mostly due to adverse supply shocks.


4. Identification and Estimation


    0ux approach to identification is to avoid as much as is possible oven—

dentifying but controversial restrictions. We impose no restrictions on the

lag structure, that is on Ai=1...9n .           W   achieve identification by res-

trictions on A0 , the matrix characterizing contemporaneous relations between
                                                       —7—

 variables, and by assuming that the covariance matrix of structural distur-

bances, D ,           is   diagonal. We now describe our approach and the data in more

detail.


Choice            variables


        We use quarterly data for the period 1947—1 to 1982—4. Output, the price

level, monetary and fiscal variables are denoted Y,                       P, M and C respectively.
Output, the price level and the monetary variable are the logarithms of real

GNP.    of   the GM' deflator and of nominal M1                   The price and money variables

are    multiplied          by four so that all structural disturbances have the interpre-

tations of rates of change, at annual rates. The                       fiscal   variable C is an

index which attempts to measure the effect of fiscal policy, that is, of

government spending, deficits and debt, on aggregate demand. It is derived

from other work (Blanchard [19841) and is described in detail in Appendix B.


Reducing form estimation


       As we impose no restrictions on the lag structure, A,, I =                     1,...,n   ,   we

can proceed in two steps. The                   reduced   form associated with (1) is given by:



                  n
       X =
        t     .
              1=1
                           i
                       B.X t—i     +xt                                                              (2)



       E(xx)
                      =             If   tr
                      =    0         ift-
       B. = (I—A0
        1
                           )1A. ;
                               i
                                     0        [(I—A0 )11D[(I—A0 )1)#


We first estimate the unconstrained reduced form (2). Under the large shock

hypothesis,        some of the realizations of the e and thus of x may be

large; we use therefore a method of estimation which may be more efficient
                                                   —8-

than OLS in this case. We use the bounded influence method developed by

Irasker and Welsch [1982], which in effect decreases the weight given to

observations with large realizations.6 We choose a lag length. n ,                    equal to

4•7


            is the vector of unexpected movements in Y, P, M and G .                   Let   lower

case letters denote unexpected movements in these variables. so that this

first step in estimation gives us estimated time series for y, p. m and g


Structural estimation


      The second step takes us from x to                    e .   Note that (1) and (2) imply:



                                             x =        x + a                                    (3)
                                                   A0



      Thus, to go from x to c we need to specify and estimate A0 , the set

of contemporaneous relations between the variables. We specify the following

set of relations:



      y =   bp                        +8 S              (aggregate supply)                       (4)


      y b2m — b3p           +
                                b4g   +8d               (aggregate demand)                       (5)


      8 =         +                   +                 (fiscal role)                            (6)
            C1Y       c2p
      m c3y + c4p                     +8m               (money role)                             (7)




      We have chosen standard specifications for aggregate supply and demand.

Output supplied is a function of the price level.8 Output demanded is a func-

tion of nominal money, the price level and fiscal policy; this should be

viewed as the reduced form of an IS—LM model, so that                         is a linear combi—
                                             —9—

nation of the IS and LM disturbances. The last two equations are                      policy
rules, which allow the fiscal index and money to respond contemporaneously to

output and the price level.9


     Even with the zero restrictions on A0 implicit in the above equations,

the system of equations (4) to (7) is not identified. The model contains 8

coefficients and 4 variances which must be estimated from the 10 unique ele-

ments in 0 .      To achieve identification we use a priori information on two of

the parameters.


     Within a quarter, there is little or no discretionary response of fiscal

policy to changes in prices and output. Most of the response depends on

institutional arrangements, such as the structure of income tax rates, the

degree and timing in the indexation of transfer payments and so on. Thus the

coefficients c1 and c2 can be constructed directly; the details of the

computations are given in appendix B. Using these coefficients, we obtain

    from (6).


     Given the two constructed coefficients c1 and c2 we now have six

unknown coefficients and four variances to estimate using the ten unique ele-

ments in 0 .      The model is just identified. Estimation proceeds as follows:

    is used as an instrument in (4) to obtain                        and         are used as

                                    Am                  A       As         Afl
instruments   in (7) to obtain c         .   Finally,   e   ,   e    and c       are used as

instruments in (5)    to   obtain


     The validity of these instruments at each stage depends on the plausibil-

ity of the assumption that the relevant disturbances are uncorrelated.

Although we do not believe that this is exactly the case, we find it plausible
                                      — 10 —


that   they have low correlation, so that our identification is approximately

correct.


       It may be useful to compare our method for the identification and estima-

tion of shocks to the more common method used in the vector autoregression

literature. A common practice in that literature is to decompose, as we do,

the forecast errors into a set of uncorrelated shocks. There the identifica-

tion problem is solved by assuming that the matrix (I—A0)    is triangular or

can be made triangular by rearranging its rows. This yields a recursive

structure that is efficiently estimated by OLS. We do not assume a recursive

structure but rather impose four zero restrictions in addition to constructing

two coefficients c1 and c2 .     Our method produces estimated disturbances

much closer to true structural disturbances than would be obtained by imposing

a recursive structure on the model.

Section II. The Direct AD1,roach. Resujts

1. Reduced form evidence


        The first step is the estimation of the reduced form given by (2), The

estimated B.,i1,...,4 are of no particular interest. The estimated time

series corresponding to unexpected movements of x ,     that   is of y, m, p and g

are of more interest. Table 1 gives, for y, m, p and g , the value of resi-

duals larger than 1.5 standard deviations in absolute value, as well as the

associated standard deviation and estimated kurtosis.


        The kurtosis coefficient of a normally distributed random variable is

equal to 3. The 99% significance level of the kurtosis coefficient, for a

sample of 120 observations drawn from a normal distribution is 4.34. Thus,

ignoring the fact that these are estimated residuals rather than actual reali-

zations, three of the four disturbances have significantly fat tails. As

linear combinations of independent random variables have kurtosis smaller than

the maximum kurtosis of the variables themselves, this strongly suggests large

kurtosis of the structural disturbances.10 We now turn to structural estima-

tion.


2. The structural coefficients


        The second step is estimation of A0 , from equations (4) to (7). We use

constructed values for c1 and c2 of —.34 and —1.1 respectively. Unex-

pected increases in output increase taxes more than expenditures and lead to

fiscal contraction. Unexpected inflation increases real taxes but decreases

real expenditures, leading also to fiscal contraction. We are less confident

of c2, the effect of inflation than we are of c1. In Appendix A we report

     The results of estimating (4) — (7) are reported in Table 2. All coeffi-

cients except one are of the expected sign. Nominal money has a negative con-

temporaneous effect on output; this is consistent with a positive correlation

between unexpected movements in money and output because of the positive

effect of output on money supply. Indeed the correlation m and y is .32.

(Anticipating results below, we find that the effect of nominal money on out-

put is positive after one quarter.) Aggregate supply is upward sloping; a

comparison with the results of Table Al suggest that the slope of aggregate

supply is sensitive to the value of c2


     Given our estimates of the reduced form and of A0 , we can now decompose

each variable (Y P, M, G) as the sum of four distributed lags of each of the

structural disturbances d,€s,€m, and         .   Technically,   we can compute the

structural moving average representation of the system characterized by (1).


3. One or many sources of shocks. Variance decomposition.


     Does one source of shocks dominate? We have seen that a natural way of

answering this question is to characterize the contribution of each distur-

bance to the unexpected movement in each variable. We define unexpected move-

ment as the difference between the actual value of a variable and the forecast

constructed K periods earlier using equation (1). We use 3 values of K.

The first case, K = 1   •   decomposes the variance of y, p, m, and g into their

4 components, the variances of ed,es,em and         .   The other 2 values, K = 4

and K = 20    correspond to the medium run and the long run respectively.

4. Are there infrequent large shç? I


     Table 4 reports values and dates for all estimated realizations of

           and 5g larger than 1.5    times   their respective standard deviation.

We can compare these to traditional, informal, accounts of the history of

economic fluctuations since 1948 and see whether specific events which have

been emphasized there correspond to large realizations. A useful, concise

summary of the events associated with large post—war fluctuations is contained

in Table 1 in the paper by Eckstein and Sinai in some volume.


     The   first   major expansion in our sample, from 1949—4 to 1953—2 is usually

explained by both fiscal shocks associated with the Korean War and a sharp

increase in private spending. We find evidence of both in 1951 as well as in

1952. From 1955 to the early 70's, large shocks are few in number and not

easily interpretable. There are, for example, no large shocks to either fis-

cal policy or private spending corresponding to either the Kennedy tax cut or

to the Vietnam War. In the 1970's, major fluctuations are usually explained

by the two oil shocks. There is some evidence in favor of this description.

We find two large supply shocks in 1974—4 and 1975—1; we also find large fis-

cal and large demand shocks during the same period. The two recessions of the

early 1980's are usually ascribed to monetary policy. We find substantial

evidence in favor of this description. There are large shocks to money supply

for most of the period 1979—2 to 1982—4, and two very large negative shocks in

     The overall impression is therefore one of infrequent large shocks, but

not so large as to dominate all others, and the behavior of aggregate vari-

ables for long periods of time. To confirm this impression, we report the

kurtosis coefficients of the structural disturbances in Table 5*; in all cases

we can reject normality with high confidence. in Table 5b we use another

descriptive device. We assume that each structural disturbance is an indepen-

dent draw from a mixed normal distribution, that is for x = g, d, a or m:



           =          with   probability 1 — P

        a =          with    probability P


where

        The realization of each disturbance is drawn from either a normal distri-

bution with large variance, with probability P , or from a normal distribu-

tion with small variance, with probability 1 — P       .   The estimated values of

a1, a2, I'1 ,
                  estimated by maximum likelihood are reported in Table 5b. The
results suggest large, but not very large, ratios of the standard deviation of

large to the standard deviation of small shocks; they also suggest infrequent,

but not very infrequent large shocks. The estimated probabilities imply that

one out of six fiscal or money shocks, and one out of three supply or demand

shocks came from the large variance distributions.

    The dating of the large shocks in Table 4 suggests two more characteris-

tics of shocks. First, large shocks tend to be followed by large shocks, sug-

gesting some form of autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity as dis-

cussed in Engle (1982). Second, there seems to be some tendency for large

shocks to happen in unison. In 50:1 for example we find large fiscal, supply,

and demand shocks, while in 80:3 we find large supply, money, and demand

shocks. To confirm these impressions we present in Table 6 the correlations

and first autocorrelations between the squares of the structural shocks.1'

The table shows a large positive contemporaneous correlation between the

square of the supply shock and the square of the demand shock. A weaker con-

temporaneous relationship between supply and the fiscal shock is present. The

squares of all shocks are positively correlated with their own lagged values;

there is also significant correlation between demand, the lagged fiscal and

supply shocks, and between the fiscal shock and lagged supply shock.   All in

all these results suggest an economy characterized by active, volatile periods

followed by quiet, calm periods both of varied duration.



5. Are.there infrequent jg shocks? fl


     We discussed in Section 1 the possibility that a specific source of

shocks may dominate some episode of economic fluctuations, even if there are

no large realizations of the shock. To explore this possibility, we construct

an unexpected output series, where the expectations are the forecasts of out-

put based on the estimated model corresponding to (1), 8 quarters before. We

chose $ quarters because the troughs and peaks in this unexpected output

series correspond closely to NBER troughs and peaks. We then decompose this

forecast error for GNP into components due to each of the four structural dis—

turbances.   This decomposition is represented graphically in Figure 1; the

corresponding time series are given in Table A2, in Appendix A.


     No single recession can be attributed to only one source of shock. Post

war recessions appear to be due to the combination of two or three shocks.

The 1960—4 trough for example, where the GNP forecast error is —6.7% is attri-

buted to a fiscal shock component (—2.4%), a supply shock component (—1.1%), a

money shock component (—1,7%) and a demand shock component (—1.4%). The

1975—1 trough, where the GNP forecast error is also —6.7% seems to have a

large suppiy shock component (—3.6%) and a demand shock component (—2.9%).

The 1982—4 trough, where the GNP forecast error if —4.5%   is   decomposed as

—1.4% (fiscal), 1.1% (supply), —1.4% (money) and —2.8% (demand).


     To summarize the results of this section, we find substantial evidence

against the single source of shock hypothesis. We find some evidence of large

infrequent shocks; however they do not seem to dominate economic fluctua-

tions.

Sect ion III. Ih!   indirect   !ich.

     If   economic fluctuations are due to an accumulation of small shocks, then

in some sense, business cycles should be all alike. In this section, we make

precise the sense in which cycles should be alike and examine the empirical

evidence.


     The most influential contributions to the position that cycles are alike

is the empirical work carried out by Burns and Mitchell on pre—Worid War II

data. Their work was not only focused on the characteristic cyclical behavior

of many economic variables but also on how, in specific cycles, the behavior

of these variables differed from their characteristic cyclical behavior. When

looking at their graphs, one is impressed at how similar the behavior of most

variables is across different cycles; this is true of quantities, for which it

may not be too surprising but also, for example, of interest rates.


     We considered extending the Burns—Mitchell (B—M) graph method to the

eight post War cycles but decided against it. Many steps of the method, and

in particular their time deformation, are judgemental rather than mechanical.

As a result, it is impossible to derive the statistical properties of their

results. When comparing for example the graphs of short rates across two

cycles, we have no statistical yardstick to decide whether they are similar or

significantly different. As a result also, we do not know which details, in

the wealth of details provided in these graphs, should be thought of as signi-

ficant.


     Therefore, we use an approach which is in the spirit of Burns    and

Mitchell but allows us to derive the statistical properties of the estimators

we use. The trade off is that the statistics we give are much less revealing
                                       — 18 —


than the B—M graphs. Our approach is to compute the cross correlations at
different leads and lags between various variables and a reference variable

such as GNP,   across different cycles.


The construction of correlation coefficients


     The   first   step is to divide the sample into subsamples. We adopt the

standard division into cycles, with trough points determined by the NBFR chro-

nology. ThIs division may not be, under the large shock hypothesis, the most

appropriate as a large shock may well dominate parts of two cycles. It is,

however, the most uncontroversial. Defining the trough—to—trough period as a

cycle, there are seven complete cycles for which we have data; their dates are

given in Table 7. This gives us seven snbsainples.


     For each subsample, we compute cross—correlations at various leads and

lags between the reference variable and the variable considered. Deterministic

seasonality is removed from all variables before the calculation of the corre—

1st ions. A more difficult issue is that of the time trend: the series may be

generated either by a deterministic time trend or a stochastic time trend or

by both. In the previous two sections, this issue was unimportant in the

sense that inclusion or exclusion of a deterministic trend together with

unconstrained lag structures in the reduced form made little difference to

estimated realizations of the disturbances. Here, the issue is much more

important. Computing deviations from a single deterministic trend for the

whole sample may be very misleading if the trend is stochastic. On the other

hand taking first or second differences of the time series probably removes

non—stationarities associated with a stochastic trend but correlations between

first or second differences of the time series are difficult to interpret.
                                       — 19 —


     In   their work, Burns and Mitchell adopt an agnostic and flexible solution

to that problem. They compute deviations of the variables from subsample

means. Thus they proxy   the   time trend by a step function:   although this

does not capture the time trend within each subsample, it does imply that

across subsamples, the estimated time trend will track the underlying one. We

initially followed B—M in their formalization but found this procedure to be

misleading for variables with strong time trends. During each subsample, both

the reference and the other variable are below their means at the beginning

and above their means at the end; this generates spuriously high correlation

between the variables. We modify the B—M procedure as follows: for each sub-

sample, we allow both for a level and a time trend; the time trend is given by

the slope of the line going from trough to trough. This should be thought of

as a flexible (perhaps too flexible) parameterisation of the time trend,

allowing for six level and slope changes over the complete sample.


     The cross—correlations are then computed for deviations of each of the

two series from its trend. We compute correlations of the reference variable

and of the other variable, up to two leads and lags.


jç. construction of confidence levels


     For each variable we calculate cross—correlations with our reference

variable, GNP, for each of the seven cycles. We then want to answer the fol-

lowing questions: should we be surprised by the differences in estimated

correlation across cycles? More precisely, under the null hypothesis that

fluctuations are due to the accumulation of small shocks, how large are these

differences in the correlation coefficients likely to be? Thus, we must

derive the distribution of the differences between the largest and smallest
                                         — 20 —


correlation   coefficients, at   each   lag or lead for each variable. This distri—

bution is far too difficult to derive analytically; instead we rely on Monte

Carlo simulations.


      The first step is to estimate, for each variable, the bivariate process

generating the reference variable and the variable under consideration. We

allow for four lags of each variable and a linear time trend, for the period

1947:1 to 1982:4. The method of estimation is, for the same reasons as in

Section I, Irasker—Welach.


      The second step is to simulate the bivariate process, using disturbances

drawn from a normal distribution for disturbances. (Thus we implicitly

characterize the "small shock" hypothesis as a hypothesis that this joint dis—

tributión is normal.) We generate 1000 samples of 147 observations each. We

then divide each sample into cycles by identifying troughs in the GNP series.

Let    denote the log of real GNP at time t. Time t is a trough if two condi-

tions are satisfied. The first is that




                         Xti ) t < 't+l < 't+2 < 't+3

and the second that     be at least 1/2 % below the previous peak value of x.

The first insures that expansions are longer than 3 periods and the second

eliminates minor downturns. (When applied to the actual sample, this rule

correctly identifies NBER troughs, except for two which differ from the NBE

trough by one quarter.) Given this division into cycles, we compute, as in the

actual sample, cycle specific correlations, and obtain, for each of the 1000

samples, the difference between the largest and the smallest correlation.

Finally, by looking at the 1000 samples, we get an empirical distribution for
                                        21 —


the differences.

     What we report in Table 7 for each variable and for correlations at    each
lead and lag are probabilities that in the corresponding empirical distribu-

tions, the difference between the largest and smallest correlation exceeds the

value of this difference in the actual sample. This probability is denoted P.

A very small value 21 P indicates that.        difference observed   jbi. actual

jjmple is       risl.nli large iii the small shock yuothesis. It would

therefore be evidence against the small shock hypothesis.


The choice 21   variables

     Most quantity variables such as consumption or investment appear highly

correlated with real GNP. Most of the models we have imply that it should be

so, nearly irrespective of the source of shocks. Most models imply that

correlations of prices and interest rates with GNP will be of different signs

depending on the source of shocks. We report results for various prices,

interest rates, policy variables, and quantities.


     We look at three real wages. In all three cases, the numerator is the

same, the index of average hourly earnings of production and non—supervisory

workers, adjusted for overtime and interindustry shifts, in manufacturing. In

Table 7a, the wage is deflated by the GNP deflator. in Table 7b, it is

deflated by the CPI and is therefore a consumption real wage. In Table 7c, it

is deflated by the producer price index for manufacturers and is therefore a

product wage. In all three cases, we take the logarithm of the real wage so

constructed.


     We then look at        jgflve LjQj,. Both are relative prices of materi—
                                       — 22 —


als     in terms of finished goods. Because of the two oil shocks, we consider two

different prices. The first is the ratio of the price of crude fuels to the

producer price index for finished goods and is studied in Tible 7d. Table 7e

gives the behavior of the price of non—food, non—fuel materials in terms of

finished goods.


        We then look at the behavior of interest rates. Table 7f characterizes

the behavior of the nominal three month treasury bill rate. Table 7g gives

the behavior of Moody's AAA corporate bond yield.


        We consider the two rolicv variables: the fiscal index defined in the

first section, and nominal M1 •     The results are given in Tables 7h and 7i.


        Finally, we consider three quantity variables. Table 7j shows the

behavior of real consumption expenditures. Tables 7k and 71 show the behavior

of non—residential and residential investment.


General results.


        In looking at Table 7, there are two types of questions we want to

answer. The first is not directly the subject of the paper but is clearly of

interest. It is about the typical behavior of each variable in the cycle.

The answer is given, for each variable by the sequence of average correlation

coefficients at the different lags and leads. How do these sequences relate

to B—M graphs? The relation is roughly the following: If the sequence is flat

and close to zero, the variable has little cyclical behavior. If the sequence

is flat and positive, the variable is procyclical, peaking at the cycle peak:

if flat and negative, it is countercyclical, reaching its trough at the cycle

peak.
                                       — 23 —


       If   the sequence is not flat, the variable has cyclical behavior but

reaches its peak, or its trough if countercyclical, before or after the cycli-

cal peak. If for example, p_1 is large and negative, this suggests that the

variable is countercyclical, reaching its trough one quarter before the cycli-

cal peak. As expected the quantity variables are pro—cyclical; there seems to

be a tendency for non—residential investment to lag GNP by one quarter and

residential investment to lead GNP by one quarter. We find little average

cyclical behavior of real wages. Relative fuel prices and long—term interest

rates are countercyclical and lead GNP by at least two quarters. Relative

non—food/non—fuel materials and short—term rates appear to be pro—cyclical.

We now turn to the second question. which is one of the subjects of this

paper. Row different are the correlations and are these differences surpris-

ing?


       The first part of the answer is that correlations are vy different

across cycles. This is true both for variables with little cyclical behavior

such as the real wage, or for variables which vary cyclically, such as nominal

rates. These differences suggest that business cycles are indeed not all

alike. The second part of the answer may however also be surprising: it is

that under         small shock j.!jjs, such differences j unusual. For
most correlations and most variables, the P values are not particularly small.

Thus, the tentative conclusion of this section is that, although business

cycles are not very much alike, their differences are not inconsistent with

the hypothesis of the accumulation of small shocks through an invariant propa-

gation mechanism.

Section IV. Conclusions


     In Sections I and II we specified and estimated a structural model which

allowed us to directly investigate the properties of shocks and their role in

economic fluctuations. From this analysis we conclude that fluctuations are

due, in roughly equal proportions to fiscal, money, demand, and supply shocks.

We find substantial evidence against the small shock hypothesis. What

emerges, however, is not an economy characterized by large shocks and a gra-

dual return to equilibritmi, but rather an economy with a mixture of large and

small shocks.


     In Section III we investigated the influence of shocks on economic fluc-

tuations in an indirect way by examining stability of correlations between

different economic variables across all of the post—war business cycles. Here

we fouDd that correlations were very unstable——that business cycles were not

at all alike. This, however, is not inconsistent with the small shock

hypothesis, and provides only mild support in favor of the view that large

specific events dominate the characteristics of individual cycles. These

results cast doubt on the usefulness of using "the business cycle" as a refer-

ence frame in the analysis of economic time series.

                                 Footnotes




1. This framework is only one of many which can generate fluctuations.

   Another one, which clearly underlies much of the early NBER work on

    cycles is based on floor—ceiling dynamics, with a much smaller role for

    impulses. There are probably two reasons why the white noise impulse—

    linear propagation framework is now widely used. It

    is convenient to use both analytically and empirically, because of its

    close relation to linear time series analysis. Statistical evidence

    which would allow to choose between the different frameworks has been

    hard to come by.

                                                                  arise from
2. In the standard dynamic simultaneous equation model impulses

    the exogenous variables and the noise in the system.    In the model we

    employ we do not distinguish between endogenous and exogenous variables.

    The entire system is driven by the innovations (the one step ahead fore-

    cast errors) in the variables. A portion of whalt we call "innovations"

    would be explained by current movements of exogenous variables in large

    macroeconomic models. For example, we find large negative "supply" inno-

    vations in late 1974. In a large model these would be explained by oil

    import prices.


3. A supplement to the Journal     Monetary Economics was devoted to the

    analysis of the sources of impulses in different countries, using the

    Brunner—Meltzer approach. Conclusions vary somewhat across countries but

   "measures expressing an unanticipated or accelerating monetary inpulse

    figure foremost" [Brunner and Me].tzer, p. 14, 19781.
                                              — 26 —


 4.    A good example of the importance of the nature of the shocks for the

       rules versus discretion debate is given by the answers of Lucas and Solow

       to the question, "What should policy have been in 1973—1975?" in Fischer

       [19801.


5.     We   assume that the propagation mechanism is linear and time invariant.

      Violation of either of these assumptions would likely lead to estimated

       shocks whose distributions have tails thicker than the distribution of

      the true shocks.


6. LAD or other robust M estimators, could also have been used. in some

      circumstances OLS may be more efficient than the robust estimators

      because of the presence of lagged values.


7. Each equation in the vector autoregression included a constant and a

      linear time trend. When the vector autoregression was estimated without

      a time trend the estimated residuals. x , were essentially unchanged.


8. A more detailed specification of aggregate supply, recognizing the

      effects of the price of materials would be:



      y =         —              +   a
                                         ys
            d1p       d2(p—p)

            Pmd3P+d4y
      where supply depend on the price of materials,   p , and   the price level,

      and where in turn the nominal price of materials depends on the price

      level and the level of output. The two equations have, however, the same

      specification, and it is therefore impossible to identify separately the

      shocks to the price of materials and to supply, lm and c       .   Equation
                                            — 27 —


      (4) is therefore the solved—out version of this two—equations system, and
       S
           is       a linear combination of these two shocks.


 9.   If money supply responds to interest rates directly rather than to output

      and prices, €m and d will both depend partly on money demand ahocks

      and thus will be correlated. Our estimation method will then attribute

      as much of the variance as possible to m and incorporate the residual
                d
      in    e




10. A more precise statement is the following: Let               and      be indepen-

      dent variables with kurtosis             and K2 , one of which is greater than

      or equal to 3. Then if Z is a linear combination of X1 and X2

           < max (K11K2)         We do not, however, assume independence but only zero

      correlation of the structural disturbances.


11. While the contemporaneous correlation between the levels of the shock is

      zero by construction, the same is not true of the squares of the shocks.

                      Appendix B. Construct ion of the fiscal index C.




        The index is derived and discussed in Blanchard [1984]. Its empirical

counterpart is derived and discussed in Blanchard [1983]. This is a short

summary.


1. The theoretical index


        The index measures the effect of fiscal policy on aggregate demand at

given interest rates. It is given by:



                                             —   I   T   e   r+ (s—t)dS) +



where


ZtIBtZTt are government spending, debt and taxes. 't,s denotes the antici-

pation, as of t         ,   of    a variable x at time s,


    The       first   term measures the effect of fiscal policy on consumption.               is

the propensity to consume out of wealth. B is part of wealth and increases

consumption. The present value of taxes, however, decreases human wealth and

consumption; taxes are discounted at a rate (r + p)                    higher than the interest

rate r .       The second term captures the direct effect of government spending.


    The index can be rewritten as:




    G = (Z
     t    t
                  —   ). f   Z
                                 t,s
                                       e+(t5)ds

          +   X(B t —   f (T     t,s
                                       — Z

        We calculated 02 using elasticities and tax proportions for 1959, 1969,

1979. The       results    were very close. A plausible range for 2 (depending on

which T1T.y.       are used) is .1 to .3. We choose .2 for computations in the

text.


        Our   fiscal    policy rule is therefore:

       This shows that fiscal policy affects aggregate demand through the devia-

debt and the sequence of anticipated deficits, net of interest payments,

       We assume that at any time t , D                        and Z are anticipated to return at

as   the effect of unexpected price movements on actual and full employment

taxes is approximately the same.


      Let                  be the elasticities of movements in government spending with

respect to unexpected movements in the level of output and in the price level

respectively. Let                              be similar elasticities for taxes. Then:

     We assume that, within a quarter, there is no discretionary response of

g to either y or p .              The response depends only on institutional arrange-

ments. We therefore use the results of deLeeuw et al. [1980] and deLceuw and

Holloway [1982] (hereafter dL8O and dL82) to construct a.,
                                                                  a2, 0, and 02




     From Table 19 of dL8O a one percentage point increase in the unemployment

rate increases spending in the first quarter by .6% at an annual rate. From

Okun's Law it is reasonable to assume that a 1% innovation in output reduces

unemployment by roughly .1 percentage point in the first quarter. Putting

these together we have a1 = —.06.


a2


     G is composed of (1) purchases of goods and services, (2) wage payments

to government employees, and (3) transfer payments. There is little or no

effect of unexpected inflation on nominal purchases within a quarter.

Although parts of (2) and (3) are indexed, indexation is not contemporaneous.

Nominal payments for some transfer programs (Medicare, Medicaid) increase with

inflation. A plausible range for a2 is —.8 to —1.0.            We choose —.9 for the

computations in the text.




     We considered four categories of taxes and income tax bases:

We calculated O using elasticities and tax proportions for 1959 and 1979.

The results were very close and yielded O 1.4.




    We considered the same four categories of taxes. In the same way as

before, we have
