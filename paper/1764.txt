                  Testing Long—Run Productivity Models for the
                     Canadian and U.S. Agricultural Sectors




                                   ABSTRACT



     This paper discusses a portion of our work linking data on the agriculture
sector in the United States and Canada. The purpose of this work is to explore
the evolution of gains in agricultural productivity in the two countries during
the post-WWII period. Comparable data has been developed for each country and a
series of tests have been applied about the nature of the long—run production
sector. These tests are designed to evaluate the alternate possible structures
of shifts in the long-run technology over time.
     There is considerable evidence in both countries that the long—run shifts
have been Hicks Neutral in models that use gross, not net, output measures. The
reverse is true for the net output models. The use of the conventional net out-
put measures is strongly rejected. However there is evidence, in both
countries, in support of the hypothesis that separability of a type that is
similar to, but weaker, than real-value added is not rejected.

                     CANADIAN AND U.S. AGRICULTURAL SECTORS


 Introduction*

        Much debate has   surfaced   over   the use   of gross versus net productivity

measures to characterize the 'owth in the agricultural sectors. The AAEA

Task Force on .ieasuring Agricultural Productivity concluded that "the best

approacn Etc productivity measurement is the 'oss output/total input

concept that the USDA currently uses in terms of clearness of meaning and

applicability to concerns that people have when they ask about agricultural

productivity." (USDA (1980), page 27). However the issue is much deeper

than what appears to afford the most easily understood yardstick, and

relates to what each measure implies concerning the underlying structure of

the agricultural sectors. There is a clearly defined linkage between the

type of measure of productivity growth and the production structure.

Furthermore to suggest that one measure is preferred over another is to

implicitly assume that the structure implied by the preferred measure more

accurately reflects the "true" structure of the sector. Alternatively, one

can offer the following rationale: if we can statistically accept the

underlying structural restrictions implied by either a ross or net index

measure,   then we can    rely on the simple nonparametric total productivity

index   associated   with that structure to characterize productivity 'owth.

However,   one cannot know    a priori which measure is better without

econometrically testing the various production structures.

     The   primary objective of this paper is to develop the linkages between
the 'oss and net productivity indexes and the implied production
structures. We proceed to test the various parameter restrictions for the
U. S. and Canadian agricultural sectors that are appropriate for
                                           2



 a'icujtural     productivity measurent, i.e., test in direct and sequential

 manners the hypotheses associated with 'oss and       net   productivity indexes.

         An additional motivation for writing this paper is interest in

 Canadian and U.S. agricultural productivity comparisons, and in the

 relative biases in technical change. For both countries, export markets

 for   agricultural products are    increasingly important as an outlet for

 domestic production. Tne attractiveness of       a country's exports depends, in
 part,                         agricultural sector vis a vis other
          on the productivity of its

 countries. With a valid measure of relative a'icultural productivity,              we
 can   begin to investigate the sources of the differences in the owth rates
 in the two countries and the effects of government policies which may be
 altering the rates of owth.
         Productivity   measurement implicitly assumes a very   simple   economic
model of production with technical change. These models are delineated

into two variants of the total factor productivity models. :<endrick (1961)

and Jorgensen and Griliches (1967) have used the net output or real—value

added approach; Star (197), Gollop and Jorgensen (1977), and Gardner

(USDA, 1980) have chosen a broader -oss output measure.

       Beginning with a general production function with time as an argument,
wetest the restrictiveness of conventional 'oss and net productivity
models. In order to be consistent with the underlying structure for index
numbers    which are linearly hornogenous functions of their components, we
restrict the production structure to be linearly homogenous. It           is not    our
intent to pursue the Issue of what is the most appropriate economic model

of technical change. However, within the confines of our "time—drift"

specification of technical change, the empirical results do provide

information on the biases and rates of change in technology.
                                            3



         Section   one begins with a description of our basic long run model of
 production that changes with time. Restrictions on this general model are
 derived   which conform to the two primary models of total factor
 productivity——gross and     net   output measures. These restrictions take the
 form of separability restrictions on various subgroups of inputs and time.
 These   restricted models are arranged in sequences that form the bases for

 nested hypothesis testing.

      In   order to   compare our productivity models with explicit structural

models of the technology, we rely on the theoretical results developed y

Diewert (1976) and others. These are briefly reviewed in section two.

Section three uses the translog production technology with technical change

 to provide the set of parameter restrictions for testing alternative

models.

     Estimation of the models and nonpararnetric index number calculations

utilize comparable agricultural data for the U.S. and Canada      for the last
two decades. In section four the growth rates in agricultural productivity

using index ni.bers are presented. In general, TFP grew faster       in Canadian

aiculture      than in U.S. agriculture. In        countries, capital and
                                                both

material inputs     were being rapidly substituted for labor.
     The parameter estimates and test results are given in section five.

The net output total factor productivity model is rejected in both the U.S.

and Canada; the gross output TFP model is accepted in both countries. The

sequential tests provide additional information for alternative hypotheses

regarding the biases of technical change.

1. Technical Change and Productivity

     Consider a production process that uses three inputs to produce one

output represented by the production function,
 (1.1)        Q     f(K,L,M,T)



with inputs (K), labor (L) and materials (M). Technical progress is

specified     in very general form in (1.1) and we proceed to restrict its form

to yield productivity indexes. To be comparable to index nbers, we impose

the   restriction that the production function is linearly homogenous.
         Our testable   restrictions take the form of imposing a variety of
separability conditions on (1.1). Weak separability will be used wherever
possible. Weak and strong separability are equivalent in certain cases and
in a few places we are concerned explicitly with strong separability.
        As indicated in the introduction, there       are   two basic forms of
productivity       indexes. Both   cases are   measures   of total factor productivity.
The first is gross output productivity and the second is net output

productivity. We define these more explicitly below as the final steps in a

sequence    of restrictions on the general production technology.
        Consider   some very weak restrictions on    the form of technical change.
The two weakest conditions are called partial materials separability and

partial    technical    separability. Under partial materials separately, M is

separable    from capital and labor, but not from the        time trend:



(1.2)        partial materials: Q       f(g(K,L,T), M,T)

Under partial technical separability, T is separable from capital and

labor,    but not from materials:


(1.3)        partial technical: Q       f(g(K,L,M), N1,T)
                                                5




 These rather odd forms of separability are not immediately important in

 themselves. However, they are          the   weakest links in the two chains that lead

 to productivity indexes.1          In each case, either technical change (1.3) or

 materials (1.2) is weakly separable from capital and labor. Adding further

 restrictions to (1.2) arid (1.3) respectively, we have,



 (1.14)        materials: Q =      f(g(K,L,T),M)
 (1.5)         technical: Q =      f(g(K,L,M),T)

 It is easy to show that materials separability (1.4) is a more restrictive

form of partial materials separability. The same is true for (1.5) relative

to (1.3). Materials separability can be further constrained to result in

meures of net output factor productivity. Similarly, technical

separacility is part of a series of restrictions that are related to 'oss

total   factor productivity. The steps leading to these two major sequences
——   net total factor productivity and -oss total factor productivity —— are
portrayed in Figure 1.
          If technical change is Hicks Neutral, we can rewrite (1.5),

(1.6)         Q   = A(t)f(K,L,M)

It   is   possible to test sequentially (1.3), (1.5) and (1.6).2 If the first

test is rejected, there is no need to proceed. e have included a

description of the sequence in the lefthand side of figure one, in order to

inform the reader of the possibilities.

       The simple measure of technical change in (1.6) can be directly related

to   measures of &'oss output factor productivity. Let
                  =
               f(Kt,Lt,M)
be   a measure of agegate input. Productivity P is defined as
                                                  0




(1.7)

This    total factor productivity measure can be compared to the Hicks               Neutral

measure of technical change A(t) given                in (i.6).
        It   is common to see measures of net total factor -oductivity.

Beginning with (1.4), materials separability, further restrict the function

so that,



(1.8)          Q =   f(A(t)g(<,L),M)

Net total factor productivity measures assume that technical change effects

only the primary inputs and            is Hicks   Neutral with respect to    the primary
inputs. Equation (1.8) exhibits Hicks Neutral technical change in the

primary inputs only. These additional restrictions                are   required in order to

specify      the structure implied by the net total factor productivity measure.
The sequence of restrictions from (1.1) through               (1.2) and (1.14) to   (1.8) can
be tested to evaluate the appropriateness of net total factor productivity

measure. This sequence forms the right—hand side in figure one.

        While one can estimate or measure real value—added productivity using

(1.8), the usual practice is not to do this.1 National Accountants have

developed     a notion of real value added based on the method of
"double—deflation." Taken literally, this requires that the production
technology     be    separable in the form,5


(1.9)         Q =    f(K,L,T)   +   h(M)


This additional restriction will also be tested.
                                                 7




         We bring together the two sequences of restrictions depicted in

 Figure 1 by advancing the argument that the technical change that occurs in

 the world may be both materials and technical separable. It would                      have    the
 form,



 (1.13)       Q=f(g(K,L),M,T).


 "Primary input jelly," represented by g(K,L) in (1.10), is combined with

materials to produce output and           the   technology for      doing   this   changes
through time in     an unrestricted fashion. This "primary input jelly"                      option
is   the only   link   between the two sequences that we test in this               paper.
        To summarize, we    have selected for testing a subset of all               possible
separability tests on       the   three   inputs     and   the   time trend. The basis for

utilizing this subset of tests is the direct comparability with gross                        and
net productivity measures.



2. Functional Forms and Index Numbers

        This section relates Diewert's (1976) theoretical results to our

particular problem. Diewert defined the notions of exact and superlative

index numbers. A quantity index formula is exact for a particular

functional form if the ratio of           the outputs      between any two periods is

identically     equal to the index of' outputs. Among the set of all exact index
numbers, the superlative index number formulas are exact for a functional
form that is a second order approximation to an arbitrary linear homogeneous
function.

        These results are                analysis of productivity models.
                            important to our

Since   we do not know the true functional form for the production technologj,
                                        8




we begin with a second order approximation to our        production technology. We
must also choose a functional form for our index        of inputs, Ft required for
our   productivity   measure. Diewert's results suggest that we choose an index
number formula that is superlative for the functional form that is used          in

our estimation of the production technology.
        The Translog form will be used to estimate the production technology.

In order to limit the disparities in our results that arise due to the

selection of functional forms, the index number formula for the direct

measurement of productivity must be superlative for the Translog. Diewert

has shown that the Tornqvist discrete approximation to the Divisia index is

superlative    for the linearly homogeneous Translog function. The empirical

work that follows will make use of    this relationship.
        Quantity indexes are functions of   the   prices and quantities of the

components. Implicit in Diewert's theorems that relate index numbers to

functional forms is the assumption of competitive behavior. This is

necessary in order to eliminate prices in moving from the index numbers to

the functional forms which do not contain the prices.6

        Both econometric estimates and the index numbers reported later in the

paper are based on the competitive behavior assumption. Any differences in

the results from the measurement of productivity and technical change will

arise  directly fri behavioral assumptions. It is the difference in
statistical assumptions that will lead to differences in the estimates.
3.    Technical Change and the Translog Production Function
      The Translog production function is a second order approximation to an

unknown production function. Suppose we have a production function that

changes with    time, T,
                                                            9




 (3.1)          Q    f(K,LM,T).


 The Translog approximation to this                       function    may be written:


 (3.2)          log Q              +

                                                                    clogK   +
                                                                                logM     +
                                                                                             1/2111(logL)2
                           +                      +                                            +

y     assumption, the production function is linear homogeneous in the inputs.

This condition implies a number of constraints on the Translog form.

         The representation of technical change in (3.2) is not constrained by

any limitations on the form of technical change. In section one a series

of separability restrictions were discussed. Fran the perspective of

testing    there are      two non—tested sequences which were depicted in Figure 1

The   specific restrictions on the Translog function will now be discussed.
        We are interested in linking technical change to productivity. Our
testing    procedure will invoke the developments discussed in Denny                               and Fuss
(1977)    and   Jorgenson      and Lau (1975). The Translog form is an approximation

to a true underlying function. Since it is an approximation about a points

the hypothesis tests will require that                          the hypothesis holds only at the
point of    approximation.7 For almost                     all of    our tests    the exact form      of the
                                                 10




test     invokes spurious constraints. In general, it            is possible to test for

exact separability only           as   a joint test with some other hypothesis.8

         The first test in the 'oss output sequence requires that the

production     technology be       separable of the form,



(3.14)       log     Q=   f(g(iog K, log L, log M), log M, log T)

This was called partial technical separability. This case will e developed
more completely than the tests for the other hypotheses.
         Viewed as    a second order approximation at        the point of expansion, the

parameters of the Translog function (3.2) correspond to the first and second

order partial derivatives of the true function. To test the hypothesis of

partial technical separability the following procedure is followed. The

restricted function (3.24) must be expanded and the first and second order

derivatives calculated. Since these derivatives correspond to the

parameters of the Translog form, any relationships among the derivatives

implies restrictions on the Translog function.

         The relevant first and second order partial derivatives of the

expansion of       (3.24) are:9

         These   equations (3.5) indicate that the parameters of the Translog

 must    have the following restriction,

 (3.6)        ak&l      10kt
 for approximate partial technical separability.

         The next step in the sequence requires technical separability (1.5).

 This may be written,



 (3.7)       log Q     f(g(log K, log L, log M), log T).


It  may be shown that the restrictions on the parameters of the Translog for
 technical separability are


 (3.8)                         and

Two parameter restrictions are required for separability of the form (3.7).

Only one additional restriction for technical separability is     required in
addition to the one for partial technical separability.

     It is not possible to impose the restrictions for technica.
separability on the system of equations that we are estimating without
imposing Hicks neutrality. The condition that the factor shares add up to
one plus the constraints (3.8) for technical separability imply the

constraints for Hicks neutrality (Denny and May (1975)).
       The final step   in the gross output sequence imposes the restrictions
required   for multiplicative separability (1.6) necessary for Hicks Neutral

technical change. The expansion of
                                                         12




(3.9)          log   Q    log A(t) +            log   F(K,L,M),


implies the constraints,


(3.10)               =
                         kt   =
                                  emt
                                        =   0


The last restriction for the maintained hypothesis (3.3)                         implies   that there

are   only    two additional restrictions required for (3.10). These two

restrictions are only one more than is required for (3.6). Consequently,

given the nesting of (3.6), (3.8) and (3.10), there is no independent set of

restrictions for (3.8) as we noted above.

        The   sequence presented in coln two results in real value—added or net
output productivity measures. The tests and specific restrictions on (3.2)
for this second sequence are:


partial materials: log Q                     f(g(log K, log L, log        T), log T, log M)
(3.11)                    1 krn
materials: log Q              f(g(log K, log L, log T). log M)

(3.12)                    °1 'kui and i e t''1m
               k11m

net productivity: log Q =                   f(log     A(t) +   log   g(K,L), log M)

(3.13)         k01t = 1SktektY1m = 81t1km

               8tlkm


        The gross output and net output sequences can be joined in the common

hypothesis



primary input        jelly: log Q            =   f(g(log K,log       L), log M, log T)

with restrictions,

                                           13




 These constraints (3.114) involve the joint imposition of partial technical

 (3.6) and partial materials (3.11) separability. One might also note that

the constraints for net output productivity (3.13) add one additional

constraint to those required for primary input jelly hypothesis (3.114).

There are obviously other links between these chains which we do not explore

in this paper.

       There is one further    test   that was   discussed   in section one.   It   was
noted that the double—deflation or common method            of net total factor

productivity requires further restrictions on (3.13). Denny and 1ay (1975)

have   shown that this requires at least one of the following constraints,

14.   Productivity Growth in U.S. and Canadian riculture



       In this section we discuss the 'owth in agricultural          productivity    for

the U.S. and Canada for the years 1962—78 using index nunbers. The

Canadian data are   based on   a recent study by BrinQnan and       Prentice   (1983);

the U.S. data are taken from     Capalbo and co—authors (1985).10 Table 1
provides   estimates of labor productivity and total factor productivity for
two sub—periods (1962—1970 and 1970—1973) and for the 1962—1978 period.
Note that labor productivity and total factor productivity are measured
using gross, not   net, output, and using        the   usual Tornqvist approximation

to the Divisia index.

       For the years 1962—73, both labor productivity and TFP grew more

quickly in Canada than in the U. S. During the sixties, labor productivity
                                          114




growth   was similar   in   the two countries.   Average U.S. labor productivity

growth   fell by two percent during the seventies while the Canadian rate
renamed roughly the same. In both countries TFP growth was substantially
less than labor productivity growth. Capital and        material   inputs were
being   substituted for labor. The difference between the growth in labor

productivity and TFP growth equals the growth in factor intensity. The

latter is a weighted sum of the growth in the capital—labor and

materials—labor ratio. In both periods, the growth in Canadian TF?

exceeded the American growth by roughly one percent.

     In Canada labor productivity growth was being driven by the

contribution of TFP growth which was roughly fifty percent. In the U.S.,

labor productivity growth was more heavily driven by factor substitution,

i.e. the growth in factor intensity. This is particularly true in the

1960s. The U.S. decline in labor productivity growth during the 19705 was

entirely due to the decline in the growth in factor intensity, as evidenced

by U.S. TFP growth     being   higher in the 1970s than in the 1960s.

     The growth in productivity is due to many factors but may be measured

by the difference in the rates of growth of outputs and inputs. Table 2

provides information on the average annual growth rates of outputs and

inputs. In both countries, aggregate agriculture output has grown slowly.

This was particularly true during the 1960s. During the        second period,
Canada's   output grew at a much faster rate than in the U.S.

     In both countries, aggregate agriculture inputs have been fairly

stable during the 1962—1978 period. However, this constant aggregate input

level disguises the large shifts in particular inputs. Labor inputs have

been declining rapidly in both countries. This decline was         very   rapid in
                                             15



 the   sixties and slowed during the seventies. Capital     inputs   have been
 'owing modestly in the U.S. compared to Canada. Likewise, material inputs
 have also grown at a faster pace in Canada.
        As we previously noted, the nonparametric index calculations       are

 closely linked to structural restrictions and thus      validity to depict
                                                         their

 productivity 'owth is linked to statistical acceptance of the structural
models.

        We   turn now to a discussion of the alternative estimates of tne
changes in technology based on the production relations described in
sections 1 and 3.


5.     Estimation of    the Translog Production Technology and Tests for
       Restrictions    on Technical Change

        The translog production function (3.2) and the corresponding share

equations for capital and labor were estimated as a system of three

equations, subject to the linear homogeneity constraints (3.3). The

estimation technique is described in Berndt and coauthors (19714). The

parameter estimates for this unconstrained model are provided in Table 3i1

In subsequent discussions this model is referred to as the maintained

hypothesis model.

       Since the paper is primarily concerned with productivity comparisons,

only the parameters that relate to technical change are discussed. In

Canada, the share of labor has decreased due to technical change, while the

share of capital has increased. A similar pattern is observed for the U.S.

For both countries the effect of technical change on the share of materials

is imprecisely estimated. Thus the hypothesis of neutral technical bias

for materials could not be rejected. One might also note the lack of a
                                      16




significant relationship between materials and the other primary inputs


'lm' km
     The two parameters,       and     indicate   the inward shifting of the

isaquants. This is occurring at a substantially faster pace in Canada

compared to the U.S. Furthermore, the rate of change, 8 is four—times

'eater in Canada.

   The tests for tne alternative forms of technical change are based on

the likelihood ratio test. Defining A as the ratio of the maximum of the

likelihood function in the constrained and unconstrained models, the test

statistic, —2 log A, has an asympotic      distribution. The deees of

freedom equal the number of restrictions. The critical values of the

test statistic for various levels of significance and number of

restrictions are given in Table 4.

    In section 1, we discussed two major sequences which     theoretically
leads to measures of 'oss and net total factor productivity. We proceed

to test each sequence independently, as well as testing each hypothesis

independently. Our rationale is as follows. Consider the 'oss output

Hicks neutral technical change hypothesis (1.6). This can be tested as

part of our nested sequence.     If we reject partial technical separability

this implies that we would also' reject Hick neutrality since it is part of

the nested sequence. However, there may be other testing sequences that

would theoretically lead to (1.6), and would not reject Hicks neutrality.

Thus we will present the sequential test results as well as the direct test

results for both types of Hicks neutrality. Following the analyses for the

two major sequences, we proceed to test the primary input jelly sequences,

and the real value added hypothesis.12

Gross Output Hicks Neutrality sequence:

       The direct test for gross output Hicks neutrality yielded the following

test statistics:



 (5.1)             Q =   A(t)   f(K,L,M):          = 14.818


                                            X2ca        5.296


         There are two restrictions imposed on the maintained hypothesis.

Using the             values in Table 14, (5.1) is accepted in both the U.S. and

Canada at the .05 level of significance.

         For the sequential tests, the overall level of significance is .05.

Thus     if         is the significance level of the th test in the sequence, the

          .05. For a sequence of three tests,                          2    .015, and

.025. Thus for the second test in this                   sequence,   the significance level is

   +          or    .025.

         For partial technical separability, the test statistics are:



(5.2)           Q        f(g(K,L,M),M,T): X25           14.718


                                            X2ca        5.290


Since    only one additional restriction is required to those given in (3.3),
the hyootheses is accepted in the U.S. and marginally rejected in Canada.
         In   earlier       discussions, we noted the impossibility of       imposing   the
restrictions for            technical separability without simultaneously imposing the

stronger structure for Hicks neutrality on the translog model. Conditional

on (5.2) the test statistic for the second test in the sequence, Hicks

neutrality, are
                                              18



(5.3)        Q      A(t)f(,L,M):               =   0.100
                                        X2ca = 0.001


with one additional restriction to those already imposed for partial

technical separability, the hypothesis is accepted for the U.S. conditional

on (5.2); the hypothesis is also accepted for Canada. However, given the

rejection of (5.2) for Canada,         this   result is not directly relevant.



Net Output Hicks Neutrality sequence:

         The direct test for net output Hicks neutrality resulted in the

following test statistics:



(5.14)        Q =   f(A(t)g(K,L),M):    x23 = 9.1412

                                        X2ca = 6.854


The hypothesis is rejected in both countries at the .05 level of

siiificance.

         For the second major sequence, there are three nested tests leading to

net output Hicks neutrality. The first hypothesis is partial materials

separability.        The appropriate test statistics for this hypothesis     are:



(5.5)        Q      f(g(K,L,T),M,T): x25 = 2.876

                                        X2ca =     0.1814


With one restriction, and          =   .01,   the hypotheses is strongly not rejected
in   either country.

         For the second nested test, materials separability, the test statistics

are:
                                           19




 (5.6)        Q    f(g(iK,L,T),M):          =   2.248
                                           =    1.562

 The hypothesis is accepted in both the U.S. and Canada.

         The final hypothesis in the second sequence inposes net output Hicks

 neutrality,



 (5.7)        Q   f(A(t)g(K,L),>j): X2 4.288
                                     2
                                     Xca

Net output Hicks neutrality is rejected in Canada and the U.S. There is one

          restriction to that required for materials separability, and the
 additional

appropriate level of significance is .05.

         To summarize our results so far, the direct and sequential tests for
net output Hicks neutrality do not conflict. Hicks neutrality with respect
to   the primary inputs only is rejected        in   both   the U.S. and Canada. The
results    for oss output Hicks neutrality are less consistent. The direct

tests (5.1) were not rejected for either country. The sequential test

results do not conflict for the U.S., but do conflict for Canada (although

the rejection is weak). To have an invariant index of productivity, some

version of Hicks neutrality is required (Hulten, 1973). Since we do not

reject gross output Hicks neutrality f or either Canada or the U.S., this

suggests placing some reliance on the gross output productivity indexes for

the U.S. and Canadian agricultural sectors reported in Table 1.

Primary Input Jelly:

        As   indicated   in section 3,   the   primary input jelly hypothesis links the

net and 'oss output sequences. It requires the joint imposition of the
restrictions for partial materials and partial technical separability. We
test the hypothesis of primary input jelly               directly against the maintained

hypothesis, and sequentially as          shown in figure 2.
        The direct test of primary input jelly hypothesis for the U.S. and

Canada yielded the following results.



(5.8)            =   f(g(K,L),M,T):      X2u3 =      6.836

                                         X2ca        6.132

The hypotheses is reject in both countries, at the .05 level                    of


si&iificance.

        The sequential testing leads to somewhat different results. For U.S.,

our earlier results lead to acceptance of both partial technical separ-

ability and partial materials separability. Conditional on eacn of these

hypotheses, we test for primary input jelly. The appropriate test

statistics are:



(5.9)           Q     f(g(K,L),M,T)       (a) Conditional on partial technical
                                               separability (5.2):

                                                         —   2.118
                                          (b) Conditional on partial materials
                                               separability (5.5):

                                                    X2us =   3.960

For one restriction, (5.9a) is not rejected at the 0.05 levels of
sigr.ificance; (5.9b)       is not    rejected at the 0.025          level of significance.
                                          21




 Thus    the   sequential tests conflict with the direct test of primary input

 jelly for the U.S.

        For Canada, the appropriate test statistics are:



 (5.10)          Q   f(g(K,L),M,T)    (a) Conditional on partial technical
                                           separability (5.2):

                                           X2ca   0.8142

                                      (b) Conditional on partial materials
                                           separability (5.5):

                                           X2ca   5.9146


Although       (5.lOa) is accepted at the 0.05 level of significance, partial

technical      separability (5.2) w marginally    rejected, which implies

rejection  of primary input jelly in this sequence of nested tests. In the
alternative sequence, partial materials separability was accepted, but
(5.1Db) is rejected. Thus the rejection of the sequential tests is

consistent with the direct test results (5.8) for Canadian aicultural
sector.


Real Value Added:
        Although real value added functions are not the bases for productivity
measurement      in the agricultural sectors, they are important for comparisons
of productivitj rates with other sectors of the U.S. and Canadian
economies. Our final set of tests for the long run production structure
deals with the real value added function.
     The strong nonrejection of flartial materials separability (5.5) in
both countries lends some support for a real value added function that
includes   technical change, T. Furthermore, the acceptance of materials
                                                       22




separability        (5:6) in both countries supports the argument that technical
change     has only affected real—value added, or the                           primary inputs, K and L.
The results of (5.9b) and (510b) provide weaker support for real                                 value
added    models that exclude technical change.
        The direct test of double—deflation real value added (1.9) against the
maintained hypothesis yielded the following test statistics:


(5.11)         Q=     f(K,L,T)     + h(M)                                        96.07

                                                                   X2ca
                                                                                1 6005

Thus the      double—deflation real value added is soundly                         rejected.   If a net

total     factor productivity measure is                desired, one should           use an   alternative

specification:          One suggestion might be to calculate the 'owth in real
value added and net productivity as the rate of 'owth of 'oss output
productivity divided by the share of capital and labor. This can be done
using the information provided in section 4
6.    Summary



        As we noted in the introduction, the purpose of this paper is to test

alternative models of productivity. The long run models more closely

replicate      the underlying economic structure for                     index nuber measures of

total    factor productivity. We do not wish to argue that these models can
provide anything but limited ex post information about technical change.
      Utilizing the long run production function franework, we failed to
reject the hypotheses of gross output Hicks neutrality in both Canada and
the   United States. The sequential test results for Canada, however, did
                                          23


 lead    to rejecting prtial technical separability and tnereoy rejecting

 gross output Hicks neutrality. The net output Hicks neutrality hypothesis

is rejected in both countries. These results lend support to the use of

productivity indexes to measure                 total factor productivity.
                                      gross output
The   direct tests for the "primary input jelly" and the real value added
hypotheses are also rejected for the U.S. and Canada.
        The sequential test results support a number of alternative
hypotheses.     Partial materials separability and materials separability are
not   rejected. The latter hypotheses relate technical change to the primary

inputs, in a norineutral manner. Models that ignore tecnnical change

(partial technical separability and      the   sequential tests for gross output
Hicks neutrality and for primary input jelly) are supported by the U.S.
data. These sequential results lend support for the variety of partial
production models that have been used in agricultural studies.
        The results presented here,                       of particular
                                      although preliminary, are

interest at a time when the U.S. government is preparing legislation for
the 1985 Farm   Bill. Hopefully, these resultscan contribute to a better
understanding of the sources of variations in the patterns of productivity
growth   and technical change in Canadian and U.S.     agricultural   sectors.

       The     agricultural database developed by Capalbo and Vo (1985) is the
basis for the U.S. analysis. However, to maintain consistency between the
Brincnan       and Prentice data on Canadian                                   agriculture, we    have made the

following changes to the Capalbo/Vo database. First, labor is non—quality

adjusted       and is ag'egated into family labor and hired labor and further
          L.

excluded        in calculating the service prices for capital. Third, animal
Capital        is excluded fr the capital component and land has been agegated
with structure and                   equipment          using a divisia indexing 'ocedure. Thus,                             we

have   three InputS: capital (land, non—residential structure, and durable
equipment), labor, and intermediate inputs. It should be noted that the
intermediate input category includes both purchased and non—purchased
material inputs.
       The Canadian a'iculture data have been taken from a recent
productivity              study by Brinan and Prentice (1983). There are three basic

changes that we have made to maintain consistency with the U.S. database.

First, the stock of inventories is not treated as part of the production

process. That is, we have taken a narrow flow basis for the production

process. Brjncaan and Prentice include inventories as an input. Second,

we have ag'egated the data using Divisia indexes with service prices as

the weights. As for the U.S. data, the service prices do not include

capital gains. Finally, we have re—allocated some of the inputs so that

the Brininan/Prentice ag'egate input                                       categories are   not identical to the

ones   used in this paper.

        Canadian   labor data are available by farm operators, unpaid family
labor and hired labor. These have been ag'egated using the farm hired
wage rate for unpaid family labor and hired labor. The wage rate for farm
operators is roughly equivalent to the industrial wage rate for 'oductiOfl
workers. These data have not been quality—adjusted. The materials data
are   an   agegate of inputs of feed, seed, pesticides, fertilizer, fencing,
lime,    twine, livestock services, irrigation, fuel, electricity, telephone

and   iellaneous material      inputs. The capital inputs include land,

buildings    and machinery. The quantities are taken   directly fran    Brinkman

and   Prentice, but reag'egated using service prices.
       The output data for both the U.S. and Canada reflect      quantities

produced and    are taken   directly from Capalbo/Vo and   Brinkrnan/Prentice,
respectively.
