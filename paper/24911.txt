                                           ABSTRACT

In low-income countries, educators often encourage weak primary students to drop out before
reaching the end of primary school in order to avoid the negative attention they receive when
their students perform poorly on primary leaving exams. We conducted an experiment in rural
Uganda that sought to reduce dropout rates in grade six and seven by rewarding teachers for the
performance of each of their students. Teachers responded to this Pay for Percentile (PFP)
incentive system in ways that raised attendance rates two school years later from .56 to .60. These
attendance gains were driven primarily by outcomes in treatment schools that provide textbooks
for grade six math students, where two-year attendance rates rose from .57 to .64. In these same
schools, students whose initial skills levels prepared them to use grade six math texts enjoyed
significant gains in math achievement. We find little evidence that PFP improved attendance or
achievement in schools without books even though PFP had the same impact on reported teacher
effort in schools with and without books. We document several results that are consistent with the
hypothesis that teacher effort and books are complements in education production.

Introduction

During the past three decades, low-income countries have made great strides toward providing
universal access to primary education. However, in many countries, universal primary access has
not produced universal primary education. According to a recent World Bank report, primary
achievement levels remain low and primary dropout rates remain high.1
     Several recent survey articles cite results that underscore the challenges facing education systems
in low-income countries. Schools often lack resources and also fail to use their existing resources
efficiently. Bruns et al. (2011) contend that teachers in many developing countries are commonly
absent from school and frequently not engaged in teaching when they are present.2
    Nonetheless, in countries where education officials rarely hold teachers directly accountable
for their performance or the performance of their students, education authorities often attach high
stakes to the results of primary leaving exams (PLE). Education authorities administer these exams
to students who are completing the last year of primary school, and student results on these exams
often affect student access to secondary education.
    A recent newspaper article from Jinja district in Uganda highlights both that overall educator
accountability is weak and that schools are held accountable for student performance on the PLE.
The article reports that teachers are often absent and rarely punished for failing to teach their
classes.3 However, it also reports that district authorities recently demoted 11 school leaders
because, in each of their schools, a significant fraction of the students who took the 2017 PLE
failed. Further, district officials held a press conference to announce the demotions and to state
publicly that they planned to take additional steps to make sure that PLE pass rates rise in the
future.4
    In many African countries, PLE outcomes necessarily receive considerable attention because
they are among the few measures of primary student performance that education authorities possess.
Each year in Uganda, the Ministry of Education and Sports gathers information from each school
about aggregate enrollments, the number of students repeating particular grades, and staffing, but
the Ministry does not collect attendance or achievement data for individual students or teachers.
Further, its data do not track movements of students among schools, which means that education
officials cannot calculate dropout rates or primary graduation rates for cohorts of students who
attend a given grade in a given school. Thus, although the Ugandan Education Act of 2008 states
that all children have a right to basic education, no public records document the attendance,
attainment, or achievement of students who leave school without ever registering for the PLE.
   This absence of public information about the academic outcomes of students who never take the
PLE creates an incentive for educators to encourage weak students to drop out of school. Primary
school in Uganda involves seven grades, P1 through P7. If weak students never enter P7, they
cannot register for the PLE and therefore cannot fail the PLE, which means that their teachers

     See “Jinja headteachers demoted over PLE,” New Vision, February 1, 2018. Chaudhury et al. (2006) and Patrinos
(2013) also report that teacher absences are a problem in Ugandan schools. Further, during our first round of data
collection in rural Uganda, more than one fourth of Head Teachers report that the P6 math teacher was absent from
school, at least once, during the previous four school days.
   4
     These Head Teachers, who are equivalent to school principals in the US, were demoted to regular teaching
positions. These demotions likely involved substantial reductions in pay. The additional steps included stricter
enforcement of rules that limit teacher absences. However, as written, these rules represent rather weak requirements.


                                                          3
cannot be held accountable for their low achievement levels. Even though Ugandan educators
cannot legally force children to drop out of primary school, they can encourage weak students to
drop out by directing all or most of their attention to students at the top of their classes, and
they can counsel weak students to seek employment rather than return to school. In addition, any
school can pressure a student to leave school by simply refusing to promote the student beyond a
certain grade level.
    Figure 1 presents aggregate promotion rates by primary grade level in Uganda. At the end of
P1 through P6, promotion rates are always significantly less than one, and these rates drop more
than 20 percentage points between P3 and P6. Existing data do not allow us to determine what
fraction of those who are not promoted at a given level in a given year choose to drop out of school,
but dropout rates are substantial in Uganda, and it is reasonable to conjecture that this sharp drop
in promotion rates over the upper primary grades reflects, in part, deliberate efforts by educators to
encourage weak students to drop out before they reach P7 and register to take the PLE.5 Further,
during our field work for this project, we interviewed educators in Uganda who admitted that they
engage in this form of educational triage.

Notes: The promotion rate for level P(n) in 2014 is the enrollment in level P(n+1) in 2015 minus the number of
P(n+1) repeaters in 2015 divided by 2014 enrollment in P(n), where n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Data are from the 2014 and
2015 Educational Statistical Abstracts published by the Ministry of Education, Technology, Science, and Sports.



   5
     In its 2014 National Education Profile for Uganda, the Education Policy and Data Center reports that, in 2011,
primary completion rates in Uganda were just over fifty percent for both boys and girls.

    Table 1 presents the enrollment records for one school that we visited in the fall of 2015. Grade-
level enrollment declines after grade four and declines sharply between grades six and seven. During
our visit to this school, we asked the Head Teacher, i.e. the school principal, if this pattern had
anything to do with the public attention given to PLE results. She confirmed that this was the
case. She told us that she would receive negative attention and possibly sanctions from district
education officials if her students took the PLE and failed. So, she felt her only option was to
“narrow the bridge” between sixth and seventh grade.

Notes: We transcribed these data from official enrollment data on a chart outside the Head Teacher’s office.




    The enrollment patterns in Table 1 are not anomalous. Nationwide data for Uganda from 2015
show that total P7 enrollment was less than two thirds of P6 enrollment. Further, in the sample
of rural Ugandan schools that we analyze below, less than half of the students who begin P6 go on
to complete P7 within two school years.6
   We see similar patterns in Kenya, where students take the Kenyan Certificate of Primary
Education exam at the end of eighth grade. Glewwe et al. (2009) report that because the government
   6
    We cannot know exactly how many students complete P7 because we have no way to track students who allegedly
transfered. However, in our control schools, only 42 percent of the students in our round one sample of P6 students
go on to complete P7 and take the PLE in their round one school. If the dropout rate among transfers is at all
comparable to the dropout rate in the rest of the sample, we know that less than half of our round one control sample
completed P7 and took the PLE on time.

holds primary schools accountable for student scores on this leaving exam, some schools encourage
weak students to drop out of school at the end of seventh grade, and national data show that recent
P8 enrollment was less than 75 percent of P7 enrollment. In Rwanda, students take their PLE at
the end of P6. In 2016, P6 enrollment in Rwanda was less than 60 percent of P5 enrollment.7
    The appendix table in section 10 shows that more than thirty African countries use leaving
exams to both certify primary completion and ration access to secondary school. PLE results are
high-stakes outcomes for students, and education authorities in these countries rarely produce other
information about primary student performance. Given this context, it is not surprising that PLE
results often receive great public scrutiny. However, scholars throughout the social sciences have
documented the harmful and possibly unintended consequences that frequently arise when organi-
zations build incentive and accountability systems around a single performance metric.8 Teachers
in Uganda and many other African countries know that, if they can convince a weak student to
drop out before she is eligible to register for her leaving exam, no record of her failure to learn
will ever exist. Thus, when education officials in these countries pursue educator accountability by
attaching high-stakes to PLE results, they likely induce educators to interact with weaker students
in ways that encourage them to leave school.


Better Incentives

Below, we describe the results of a field experiment in rural Uganda that examined whether or not
a specific assessment-based incentive system for educators can reduce dropout rates and promote
learning among students at all achievement levels. The Pay For Percentile (PFP) incentive scheme
developed in Barlevy and Neal (2012) rewards educators for the academic performance of each of
their students. We introduced PFP for one year among P6 math classes in rural Uganda. Although
this treatment lasted for only one year, it increased the probability that students who began P6 in
a given school would still be attending this school at the end of the next school year from .56 to
.60. This result was mostly driven by outcomes among students who attended treatment schools
that possess textbooks. PFP generated no significant attainment gains among students in schools
without books, but in schools that provide math books for P6 students, the introduction of PFP
raised the likelihood that entering P6 students would remain in their current school during the next
two school years by seven percentage points, from .57 to .64. Further, among boys in schools with
books, PFP increased the probability that a student who began P6 would complete P7 on time
and take the PLE from .41 to .48.
    In keeping with our attendance results, PFP produced no achievement gains during P6 among
students without access to textbooks. However, in schools with books, PFP improved P6 math
achievement. Given the wide range of initial achievement levels in our schools, our assessments
included questions from the P1 through P6 curricula. In treatment schools with books, PFP
treatment improved performance on P4, P5, and P6 questions, i.e. the items most closely related
to the exercises in P6 math texts, by .118 standard deviations. Further, among students in the top
half of the round one achievement distribution, PFP in schools with books improved achievement
on P4-P6 items by .186 standard deviations. In sum, PFP produced achievement gains in schools
with books on items related to the exercises in these books, and these gains are largest among the
students who are better prepared to use the books.

    Our measures of teacher effort indicate that both teachers in schools with books and teachers
in schools without books responded to PFP by supplying more teaching effort. However, all the
measurable academic gains associated with PFP treatment occur in schools with books. We con-
jecture that teacher effort and textbooks are complements in the production of student learning,
and in section 5, we present several results that are consistent with this hypothesis.
   We proceed as follows. In the next section, we briefly describe the PFP incentive scheme.
Then, we describe our experiment. We first present results that describe how introducing PFP
during P6 impacted student attendance, attainment, PLE participation, and PLE results over the
subsequent two school years. We then examine how PFP affected achievement growth during P6.
Several of our results support the view that teacher effort and textbooks are complements in the
production of student achievement. We also discuss how our results fit into a growing literature
that documents how the returns from investments in particular types of school resources depend
on context. Our results support the view that, when new programs provide additional resources for
students, the programs must ensure that the resources match current student achievement levels
and that educators are motivated to use these new resources effectively. We conclude by discussing
the potential policy implications of our results and directions for future research.


1    How Pay for Percentile Works

Imagine an environment where J teachers each teach one class with N students who begin the year
in the same grade. Let j = 1, 2, ..., J index teachers, and let n = 1, 2, ...N index students within
a classroom. Assume that the distribution of initial achievement levels in each class is identical,
and that within each class, no two students have the same initial achievement. Without loss of
generality, let n = 1, 2, ...., N rank students within each class according to their initial achievement
level. Finally, assume that a measurement technology allows the education authority that supervises
these J educators to rank all students based on their end of year achievement levels.
    In this setting, consider the following contest scheme: Collect each of the J students who
occupies rank n = 1 in the initial achievement distribution for her class. Place all such students
in a league, and for each student, calculate her within-league percentile rank in the end of year
achievement distribution. Pay each teacher, j = 1, 2, ..., J a bonus proportional to the within-league
percentile rank of her student. Repeat this process for baseline ranks n = 2, 3, ...N.
    Barlevy et al. (2012) show that there exists a scaling factor for these bonus payments such that
all J teachers choose efficient levels of effort for all tasks that influence the achievement growth of
all N students in each classroom. The scaling factor in question is the Lazear et al. (1981) prize
for a contest between two, J = 2, educators who each devote effort to a single task that promotes
learning for one, N = 1, student.
   PFP rewards each teacher for the performance of each of her students. Thus, PFP should
induce each teacher to take on additional tasks that generate learning benefits for each of her
students. Further, because PFP contests are properly seeded, no teacher believes that her students
have little chance to be competitive or believes that her students have a clear advantage over their
competitors.
    Our working hypothesis is that teachers in our control group are providing less than efficient
levels of instructional effort for all of their students, especially their weaker students. Further, we
conjecture that many are actually pressuring their weaker students to drop out before P7. Thus,

                                                   7
we expect PFP treatment in P6 to induce more teacher effort for each student in each treatment
class.
    Our experiment is designed to determine whether or not PFP incentives elicit additional teacher
effort that offsets or mitigates the educational triage incentives that plague the PLE system in
Uganda. Since PLE systems are ubiquitous in Africa, our results speak to policy issues that likely
impact primary completion throughout the continent.


2        Sample Design

The efficiency properties of PFP hinge on contestants believing that they are competing in properly
seeded contests. Therefore, we chose only rural, government schools with one P6 stream9 and
an expected class size within a predetermined range. Further, we made sure that PFP teachers
understood that they would be competing solely against teachers in other rural, government schools
with only one P6 stream and comparable P6 enrollment.
    To create a sample of eligible schools, we used the Ugandan Education Management Information
System (EMIS) to identify government-operated schools in rural areas of the 13 Luganda speaking
districts within the Buganda sub-region of Uganda. We dropped all schools that reported 2014
EMIS enrollment for P6 of either less than 40 or more than 70 students. Then, we kept all schools
with exactly one P6 stream and one P6 math teacher.
    We identified 324 parishes that contained at least one school that satisfies our selection criteria.
If a parish contained more than one eligible school, we randomly chose one eligible school for that
parish. In the resulting sample of 324 schools, some schools located near parish boundaries were
within 2km of another school. We wanted to minimize the likelihood that teachers in the experiment
would know each other personally. So, we evaluated the location of the 324 schools in a random
order. We kept the first school for our final sample, and as we evaluated the remaining schools, we
kept each school that was not within 2km of any school already selected for our final sample. This
process eliminated 22 schools, leaving a sample of 302 schools in 302 parishes.
    Within this 302 school study sample, we formed six strata. We first divided the sample into
schools that did or did not report having P6 math books during our validation visits.10 Within these
subsamples, we defined three predicted P6 enrollment cells (large, medium, or small). Within each
of these six strata, we ranked schools by their past PLE performance. In three strata, we assigned
treatment to schools with odd ranks. In the remaining three strata, we assigned treatment to
schools with even ranks. In total, we gathered data from 151 control schools and 151 treatment
schools.
    However, we only employ data from 299 schools, 149 treatment and 150 control. One treatment
teacher informed us during his round one interview that he was in the process of leaving the school
to take a new job. Since his replacement was not yet present, we were not able to treat this school.
In two other schools, the data gathered during round two did not allow us to definitively determine
     9
     Stream is the Ugandan term for a section.
    10
     These validation visits, which were effectively round zero, took place about one month before round one began.
We used a short survey to gather information about our sample schools from the Head Teachers. We used this
information to make sure schools were eligible and to define our strata. We discovered, during our round one data
collection, that the validation data concerning the presence of P6 math books were not accurate, presumably because
these reports typically came from the Head Teacher and not the P6 math teacher.



                                                        8
whether or not the round one P6 Math teacher was still the P6 Math teacher at the end of the
school year.


2.1    Protocol

Round one data collection began in March of 2016, less than one month into the 2016 academic
year. During this round, a team of enumerators visited each of our 302 schools. The night before
each school visit, enumerators informed the school staff that a survey team would be arriving the
next day with written approval from the district education office to interview the Head Teacher
and the P6 math teacher.11 Given these advance notices, the P6 math teacher for each school was
present for our round one interviews.
    During these visits, we interviewed each P6 student in attendance, the P6 math teacher, and
the Head Teacher. We also asked the P6 math teacher to assess each of her P6 students. While one
enumerator interviewed the P6 teacher, the other supervised the administration of our round one
math assessment. We tested all students who were present using an exam that we created based
on government publications that describe the P1 through P6 curricula. After the students finished
their exams, we then told treatment teachers that they would be participating in a performance
pay contest during the coming school year.
    PFP is designed to reward educators for how well each of their students performs at the end of
the school year relative to students who began the year with comparable skills. Thus, we could not
have implemented PFP faithfully using standard P5 or P6 assessments. If our round one test had
included mainly P5 and P6 questions, more than half of the sample would have likely been placed
in one large contest group for students who missed every question on the round one assessment.
Further, teachers would have found it almost impossible to bring many of these students up to
the level of P6 questions by the end of year, given that a significant fraction of them had not yet
mastered P1 and P2 material. To credibly promise educators that we would seed contests correctly
and measure differences in academic progress among students in all contest groups, we needed to
create assessments for our beginning and end of P6 visits, i.e. rounds one and two, that cover a
wide range of skill levels.
   Our round one assessment contains items based on the P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5 curricula. We
did not repeat any items on our round two assessments. However, we chose similar items from
the P1 through P5 curriculum guides and also added completely new items from the P6 guide.
We made sure that educators in the PFP treatment group were aware that our assessments would
contain items from all levels of the P1-P6 curricula. We did so to assure them that our assessments
would measure the academic progress of all of their students, and not just those who were able to
master P6 material.12
    For both assessments, we used a two-parameter IRT model to create an estimate of latent math
skill for each student. We then created standardized versions of these scores that have mean zero
and standard deviation one.
  11
   We did not provide advance notice that we were going to be testing the students.
  12
   We also had each treatment teacher fill out a worksheet that illustrates how to map student performance into
bonus payments under PFP. This exercise demonstrates that the performance of each student matters.

2.2      Subsequent Rounds of Data Collection

In October of 2016, we returned to our 302 schools for round two data collection. We administered
a second math assessment, and we conducted a second round of interviews with the pupils, the P6
math teacher and the Head Teacher.
   In October, 2017 we returned for a third round of data collection. We did not test students, but
we did gather information about their attendance during the current term, their attendance during
the past week, and whether or not each enrolled student was still in P6 or had been promoted to
P7. We also gathered data about PLE registrations.
    Students took the PLE in early November of 2017. In February of 2018, we obtained individual
PLE results from the Uganda National Examinations Board (UNEB) for all students in the 13
districts that constitute our sampling frame. We used names and PLE testing center numbers to
match students in our sample to the individual records in the UNEB data. Section 9, the PLE
data Appendix, provides more details about the matching procedure.


2.3      Balance

Table 2 presents key descriptive statistics from round one for both our treatment and control
samples. There is no evidence that the students in our treatment and control schools differ in terms
of educational resources. None of these group differences in school level resources are statistically
significant. Further, the differences that exist do not fit a pattern. Treatment schools are more likely
to have a teacher with a low education level and are less likely to have books for students, but these
same schools are more likely to use PLE practice exams and teach students in English. Students
are demographically quite similar in treatment and control schools, and the differences that exist
are not statistically significant. Students in treatment schools do score lower on the round one
math assessment. This difference of -.096 standard deviations is not quite statistically significant,
but it is academically noteworthy. Therefore, in all regression analyses of student outcomes, we
include round one math achievement as a control.


2.4      PFP Implementation

During round one, we told control teachers that we were conducting research on learning outcomes
for students in Uganda. We did not tell them about the existence of the PFP treatment group
or our plans to return for a second round of testing at the end of the school year. In treatment
schools, we ended round one visits by informing P6 math teachers that we were going to return
at the end of the school year and test their students again, but we noted that these return visits
would not be announced.
    We repeatedly stressed that each treatment student would only be competing against students
in other rural, government schools with comparable P6 enrollment. We also stressed that each
student would compete only against other students who received similar scores on our round one
assessment. Treatment teachers learned that, for each of their students tested at the end of the
school year, they would receive a bonus payment of 20,000 Shillings times the student’s percentile
rank in her contest group, e.g. the teacher of the median performer in a contest group would receive
10,000 Shillings for that student’s performance.13
 13
      In March 2016, 20,000 Shillings were worth about six US dollars.

Notes: R1 denotes Round One. Low Teacher Education equals one if the P6 Math teacher does not have a teaching
diploma of any kind. The variable PLE Practice is an indicator that equals one if the school gives PLE practice
exams to their students. Books captures the provision of P6 math texts. This indicator equals one even for schools
that require some students to share a book. For school-level variables, we report results from standard t-tests. For
student-level variables, we use a HAC estimator and treat schools as clusters to estimate standard errors. Bruhn and
McKenzie (2008) recommend estimating regressions with strata dummies to conduct balance tests on school-level
characteristics, and Bugni et al. (2018) derive conditions that justify this approach. Our sampling scheme does not
satisfy these conditions because we do not assign treatment randomly within strata but instead seek to achieve rough
balance within strata on past PLE performance. Nonetheless, to satisfy interested readers, we performed both the
school-level and student-level tests using regressions that control for strata fixed effects. The results are quite similar.
In seven cases, the resulting p-values are equal to or slightly greater than those reported above, and no p-value falls
by more than .01.



                                                             1

    To make sure that treatment teachers understood PFP, we had each treatment teacher fill out
a worksheet that asked them to calculate the bonus payments that a teacher would earn given a
scenario involving the assessment outcomes of five students in a hypothetical class. More than 75
percent filled out the entire worksheet correctly on their first attempt. Further, only four treatment
teachers needed more than two tries to get a perfect score. Thus, our treatment teachers were not
only literate and numerate but also understood how PFP works.
    We also told treatment teachers that students who were enrolled at round one but not present
for testing would compete against other absent students from other schools. However, we do not
include students who were absent in round one but tested in round two in our analyses, in part,
because we have no way to verify that they were actually enrolled at round one.
    We further told treatment teachers that they would only earn bonus payments for the perfor-
mance of students who were present and tested during these round two visits, but ex post, we used
a slightly more generous payment rule. For the purpose of calculating bonus payments, we treated
absent students as students who took the round two assessment but got every question wrong. We
then gave these students a percentile rank equal to the fraction of students in their league who
were either absent or took the assessment and got no questions correct.14
    Table 2 shows that, on average, 30 students were present in each treatment school during round
one. Further, we tested just over three students per school in round two who claimed to be students
who were absent in round one but listed on the round one student registers. The maximum bonus
that a teacher can win for the performance of a given student is 20,000 Shillings, and each contest
among students must have one winner and one loser. So, overall we paid out just over 330,000
Shillings per teacher, which is 33 students times one half times 20,000 Shillings. Class-size is not
correlated with round two performance, so the average of our 149 payouts to treatment teachers is
just over 329,000 Shillings, which is about six weeks pay for a new teacher in Uganda and between
two and three weeks pay for more experienced teachers.15


3        Attainment

In all of our analyses of student outcomes, we restrict attention to the sample of students tested
during round one. We impose this restriction for several reasons. To begin, we were not able to
accurately identify the sample of students who were actively attending P6 in a given school at the
time of our round one visits. School registers contain many students who do not attend the school
and some who attend quite infrequently, and we are not confident that the schools possess accurate
attendance records for these students.16 Further, we use the round one math score as a control in
all of our empirical models, and these scores are not available for students who were not present
during round one.
   Our experiment is motivated by evidence that Ugandan educators behave in ways that encourage
weaker students to drop out of school before P7. As we note above, these behaviors take several
    14
     We exclude students who were not tested in round two from all of our achievement analyses. We include the
two students who took the round one assessment, returned to take the round two assessment, and actually got every
question wrong.
  15
     See http://www.public service.go.ug for salary information.
  16
     All of the results we present here are estimated impacts of the intention to treat (ITT). In both treatment and
control schools, roughly 13 percent of R1 teachers are no longer teaching their R1 class of P6 students at R2. We
contend that the ITT impacts are policy relevant because officials cannot mandate that teachers remain on their jobs.


                                                         12
different forms. A teacher may devote little attention to a weak student. A Head Teacher can tell
a student that she must repeat P6, and a Head Teacher may also tell the student that she is not
likely to ever move up to P7.
   Students who scored higher on our round one math assessment are more likely to remain in
school, enter P7, and take the PLE at the end of P7. However, more than one fourth of the best P6
students do not complete P7 on time, and many weak P6 students do.17 Therefore, if PFP induces
educators to devote more attention to all of their students, we expect students throughout the
round one achievement distribution to feel more welcome in school. Whether or not these students
experience learning gains, this effect could reduce dropout rates.
    We also expect some students to make additional academic progress that will cause their teachers
and Head Teachers to believe that they have less incentive to encourage these students to drop out.
Our data suggest that many students who are still clearly below P6 achievement levels at the end of
P6 have a reasonable chance of passing the PLE, given a full year of P7 to prepare or the opportunity
to prepare over two years by repeating P6 and then proceeding to P7. Thus, among some students,
even small improvements in P6 achievement may make educators less eager to pressure them to
leave school.18
       Tables 3a and 3b present results from linear probability models that take the following form


                                     ynj = c + treatj α + scorenj β + εnj

    Here, ynj is an attendance or attainment outcome for student n = 1, 2, ..., Nj who was tested
during round one in school j = 1, 2, ..., J. The indicator variable treatj equals one if school j
is a treatment school and zero if it is a control school. The conditioning variable scorenj is the
score that student n in school j earned on the round one assessment, and εnj captures unobserved
factors that influence measured round two achievement for student n in school j. When calculating
standard errors, we assume that our individual error terms, εnj , are independent across schools,
but we allow an unrestricted pattern of correlation among the error terms associated with students
who attend the same school.
     Tables 3a and 3b present the OLS estimates of α̂ from these regressions for different estimation
samples. The five columns in these tables present results for five different indicator variables. The
first column presents the effects of treatment on the probability that a student is present for testing
in round two, which occurred at the end of the first school year in our experiment. The second
column demonstrates how treatment changes the probability that students are still attending their
round one school in round three, which occurred at the end of the second school year. Here, we
count students as attenders if they are present or have been present on any of the previous four
school days. The third column presents results for an indicator that equals one for attenders who
are enrolled in P7 in round 3. These students moved directly from P6 to P7 during our study. This
indicator equals zero for those who are not attenders and for attenders who are still in P6.
  17
     Among control students who score two standard deviations above the mean in round one, the predicted probability
of completing P7 at the end of the following school year is less than seventy percent. Among those who score a full
standard deviation below the mean, the corresponding rate is more than one fourth.
  18
     Students who passed the PLE but earned Division 4 marks, i.e. the weakest performers among those who passed,
answered about forty percent of the P4 questions correctly in the round 2 assessment at the end of P6. Students who
took the PLE and failed answered one third of these questions correctly. Both groups missed roughly ninety percent
of the P5 questions, although the former performed marginally better.

    The final two columns deal with PLE outcomes. Column four reports the effects of treatment
on the probability of taking the PLE in November, 2017. The final column reports the effects of
treatment on the probability of passing the PLE.
   We define all five outcomes based on a student’s relationship to her baseline school. When
schools reported, in round three, that a student had not attended her baseline school at all during
year two of our study, we asked why. In a substantial number of cases, schools reported that these
students were attending other schools. Yet, we have no way to verify these reports. Some of these
students may have told their baseline school that they were going to attend another school and
never did, and others may have transferred to a different school but stopped attending school before
the date of our round three data collection.
    Still, we do know that these students are not attending their baseline schools. So, we code
them as students who are not attending in round three and not participating in the PLE. We do
not expect this choice to have a significant impact on our estimates of the impact of treatment on
attendance and attainment outcomes. In both our treatment and control samples, schools report in
round three that roughly fourteen percent of the students we tested at baseline have transferred to
another school, and in both samples, about half of these students were also not present for testing
during round two. Thus, neither the prevalence or timing of these reported transfers are correlated
with treatment status.
    Table 3a presents results for the full sample. The estimated impacts in the first column imply
that, overall and among boys and girls separately, PFP treatment raises attendance rates in round
two by roughly two percentage points. However, none of these impacts are statistically significant.
In both treatment and control schools, roughly seventy percent of students tested in round one are
present for testing in round two, which took place six to seven months later.
    However, during year two, we see attendance rates in treatment schools diverge more signifi-
cantly from those in control schools. Column two shows that, in control schools, 56 percent of the
students we interviewed in round one were still attending their original school when we returned 18
to 19 months later to collect round three data. PFP treatment is associated with a four percentage
point increase in this attendance rate. When we examine boys and girls separately, we see the same
4 percentage point increase in round three attendance. The p-values associated with the estimated
impacts for the full sample, the boys sample, and the girls sample are .02, .06, and .05 respectively.
    Only 43 percent of our round one students in control schools are both present at round three
and enrolled in P7. Our results indicate that PFP treatment raises the probability of this outcome
by three percentage points, but here the p-value is .08. The estimated impact among boys is slightly
larger with an associated p-value of .06, but the estimated impact among girls is slightly smaller
and less statistically significant. We see no significant impacts on overall PLE outcomes.
    Our results indicate that PFP treatment created changes in school environments that raised
attendance rates more than 18 months later. Table 3b demonstrates that student outcomes in
treatment schools that possess books drive this result. In control schools with books, the attendance
rate in round three was .57, and among schools with books, our results imply that PFP raised this
rate by .072 overall, .089 among boys, and .057 among girls.
   Further, among schools with books, we see some evidence that PFP impacts promotion and
PLE participation, at least among boys. Boys in treatment schools with books were more than
seven percentage points more likely to attend P7 during round three and almost seven percentage



                                                 16
points more likely to take the PLE. Note that only about forty percent of boys in our control schools
took the PLE.
    Among schools with books, PFP had little impact on promotion rates and PLE participation
among girls. Almost all of the increase in round three attendance among girls in treatment schools
was driven by a large increase in the fraction of girls who repeat P6.19 Finally, PFP did not
raise PLE pass rates significantly for boys or girls. This is true regardless of whether or not PFP
treatment schools possess books.20
    Among schools without math books, we find no statistically significant impacts of PFP treat-
ment on any measure of attendance or attainment for boys or girls. The differences between our
estimates of PFP impacts for specific subsamples of students in schools with books as opposed
to those in schools without books are often not statistically significant. However, the difference
between the estimated effects of PFP on round three attendance among boys is clearly significant
and the corresponding difference for the full sample is marginally significant.21


4        P6 Achievement

In this section, we examine how PFP impacts achievement. Our achievement results provide strong
additional support for the conclusion that our PFP treatment produced real benefits for students
in schools that possessed P6 math books but did little to benefit students in treatment schools
without these books. In the next section, we present evidence that the value of PFP treatment
hinges on the presence of books because books complement teacher effort and not because books
are simply a proxy for some unmeasured dimension of school quality.
    The PFP design seeks to direct educator attention to each student. In rural Uganda, this goal
raises concerns about assessment design. Existing research and the results from our round one
assessment show that many pupils in rural Uganda begin P6 far below grade level.22 On average,
students in the bottom fourth of our round one achievement distribution got less than half of
the questions from the P1 and P2 curricula correct. Further, the vast majority of these students
answered none of the questions from the P4 and P5 curricula correctly.
    If the teachers in our treatment sample believed that our round two assessment would consist
primarily of questions drawn from the P6 curriculum with some easier questions from P5 and
possibly P4, our PFP treatment would have provided little incentive for them to direct effort to
the students in the bottom fourth or more of our round one achievement distribution. Many of
these students did not yet possess clear command of P1 material. There is no reason to believe
that their teachers could have taught them in ways that would have allowed them to move up four
or five grade levels in one year. Therefore, the best efforts of these teachers would have had little
impact on the expected scores of their weakest students on a standard P6 assessment.
    19
     Among schools with P6 math books, less than 11 percent of round one girls from control schools repeat P6. The
corresponding fraction among treatment schools is .164, which represents an increase of more than 50 percent in the
P6 repetition rate.
  20
     Appendix Tables 1a and 1b present parallel results from regression models that do not contain a control for round
one math performance. The raw difference between round two attendance rates in treatment and control schools is
.035. The p-value associated with this difference is .06.
  21
     The p-values on two-sided tests of equality are .024 and .099, respectively.

tion. Ȳc is the control sample mean of the round two achievement measure for a given column in the sample defined
by a given row. These subsample means are defined relative to the mean scores among all round two test takers,
including those who were not present for our round one visit and therefore not included in our analysis samples. To
estimate standard errors, we use a standard HAC estimator and treat schools as clusters.

   As we note above, to address this concern, we made sure that both our round one and round
two assessments contained many items from the P1, P2, and P3 curricula. Further, we informed
PFP teachers that our round two assessment would include items from each of the P1 through P6
curricula in order to enhance our capacity to measure the progress made by students at all initial
P6 achievement levels.
    Given this design feature, we present achievement results for three different measures of round
two achievement. The first is a pupil-specific IRT ability parameter based on the full round two
assessment. The second and third are ability parameters derived from subtests of the round two
assessment that contain items from the P1 through P3 curricula and P4 through P6 curricula re-
spectively. Given the wide range of round one achievement levels, we also present results separately
for students who scored in the bottom or top half of the round one achievement distribution.
    Tables 4a and 4b follow the format of Tables 3a and 3b. Table 4a presents results for all
schools. Table 4b presents separate results for schools without math books and with math books,
respectively. The results for the full sample contain little evidence that PFP had significant impacts
on student achievement. Among girls in the top half of the baseline achievement distribution, PFP
raised round two achievement on the P4-P6 subtest by about .1 standard deviations, but none of
the other estimated impacts even border on statistical significance.
    However, Table 4b documents a striking contrast between our estimates of PFP impacts among
schools with books versus our estimates among schools without books. Among schools without
books, all of our estimated impacts of PFP on achievement are negative, although none are sta-
tistically significant. In contrast, among schools with books, we see important gains on the P4-P6
subtest. Consider the third column of Panel B in Table 4b. Among schools with books, PFP raised
achievement on the P4-P6 subtest by .118 standard deviations. We see similar results when we
examine boys and girls separately, although these estimated impacts are slightly less significant
statistically.23
    The final column shows that the performance of students in the top half of the round one
achievement distribution accounts for most of the overall achievement gains attributable to PFP.
In PFP schools with books, students who scored above the round one median score earned round
two scores on the P4-P6 subtest that are, on average, .186 standard deviations higher than the
scores of their peers in control schools. This gap is larger and more statistically significant among
girls than boys, but both enjoyed significant learning gains. Further, among students with higher
round one achievement, the treatment gains on the P4-P6 subtest drive a parallel gain of .113
standard deviations on the full test, with a p-value of .07. These estimated impacts of PFP on
round two achievement are not only statistically significant from zero but also statistically different
from the corresponding estimates of PFP impacts among treatment schools without books.24
   Yet, even in treatment schools with books, we see little evidence that PFP improves performance
on the P1-P3 subtest. This may reflect that P6 math books are not the best tools for raising
achievement on P1-P3 items. The most common P6 math text in Uganda is Primary Mathematics:
  23
     Tables 4a and 4b present results from regression of round two achievement on round one achievement and an
indicator for treatment. One can also assess the impact of treatment on gain scores. We defined three different gain
scores by taking the differences between our three round two achievement measures and our round one measure.
Appendix Tables 2a and 2b contain treatment vs control differences in mean gain scores. These results are quite
similar to those presented in Tables 4a and 4b.
  24
     In the full sample and the above median R1 achievement sample, the p-values for tests of equal treatment impacts
on the P4-P6 subtest are .035 and .022 respectively. Among higher round one achievers, the p-value on the test for
equal treatment impact on the full test is .079.

Pupil’s Book 6 by MK publishers. We have compared the exercises in this text to the items on our
round two assessment. Almost all of our P5 and P6 items are variations on exercises in this text,
while a few of our P4 items are related but easier versions of these exercises. On the other hand,
none of the items that we chose to represent the P1-P3 curricula resemble these exercises. All of
these items are much less challenging than the exercises in any standard P6 math text.
    The growing literature on the value of targeting instructional resources to individual achieve-
ment levels may help us understand the patterns of results in Table 4b.25 Students without books
did not benefit from PFP. Further, among students with access to math books, the gains associated
with treatment primarily reflect improved performance on the items that are closely related to the
content of these books, among the students who were more prepared to use these books. Weaker
students, who began the year far below grade level, may not have been prepared to use P6 math
texts effectively. Books allow teachers to assign and grade more problems. Further, books allow
teachers to let one group of students work on problems while they give special attention to other
students. However, students who are working independently in class or doing homework exercises
may benefit little from their books if their true current achievement levels are far below P6.


4.1    Comparisons with Other PFP Studies

Three existing papers describe results from previous PFP experiments. Loyalka et al. (2018) ran a
teacher incentive experiment among sixth grade math classes in rural China. They found no effects
of incentive schemes based on simple formulas that map student gain scores or level scores into
bonus payments for educators, but they found that PFP raised math achievement by .15 standard
deviations. Mbiti, Romero and Schipper (2018) report results from an experiment in Tanzania
that involved two different performance pay schemes for teachers in grades one through three. In
this case, both PFP and a scheme built around several score thresholds that mark different levels
of achievement improved student learning. However, PFP did not produce systematically larger
learning gains. Further, in several grades and subjects, the threshold scheme produced better,
although not statistically different, student performance. Fryer et al. (2013) report results from a
PFP experiment in Chicago Heights, IL, which is an economically disadvantaged suburb of Chicago.
This experiment involved students in all elementary grades, K-8. Here, the introduction of PFP
raised math scores by .185 standard deviations.26
    Our study most closely parallels Loyalka et al. (2018). Both studies involve sixth grade class-
rooms, and in both cases, teachers earned bonuses tied to the performance of their students in
math. When comparing our results, three environmental differences are noteworthy. First, all
students in the China study have books. Second, students in China began the year much closer to
their current grade level than our students in Uganda. Finally, the assessments used in the China
study are standard collections of grade-specific items. Taken together, these facts imply that our
estimated treatment effect on the P4-P6 subtest among students who scored above the median on
our round one assessment and enjoyed access to math books is the most natural point of comparison
between the two studies. Here, we estimate that PFP raises round two math achievement by .186
standard deviations, which is quite close to the corresponding result in China.
  25
    See Banerjee et al. (2017) for a recent summary.
  26
    This effect is the average effect over two arms, one that provided individual incentives and another that provided
team incentives. Yet another treatment arm combined PFP with a loss aversion treatment, i.e. teachers competed
to keep bonus payments they received at the beginning of the school year, and this treatment produced even larger
achievement gains.

5        Books and Teacher Effort

PFP is designed to provide incentives for teachers to make better use of all the educational resources
at their disposal. Thus, we are not surprised that PFP created academic gains in schools with books.
However, it is not clear why PFP had no positive impacts on attainment or achievement among
schools without books. In this section, we present evidence that PFP did induce teachers in all
schools to provide more effort. Thus, we discount the possibility that treatment teachers in schools
without books did not respond to the PFP incentive scheme. Rather, we conjecture that the stark
contrasts between our results for schools with and without books reveals that books and educator
effort are complements in the production of student learning. Below, we present several results
that support this conjecture.
    Table 5 describes the impacts of PFP on several measures of teacher effort. Each measure
is derived from data collected in round two. The variable “Days Present” is the number of days
during the past five schools days that the P6 math teacher has been present at school. We gathered
this information from the Head Teacher. Our two “Hours” measures record the hours per week
that the P6 math teacher spends preparing lessons and grading assignments. These measures are
self-reports from the P6 teacher. Our effort index is the first principle component of the other three
measures.
    Our results indicate that PFP teachers supply more effort. All of the estimated effects of treat-
ment on effort are positive. The increase in hours spent grading and the overall improvement in
our effort index are statistically significant and represent noteworthy changes in behavior. Treat-
ment teachers increased the time they spent grading assignments by more than ten percent, and
the average value of our effort index was almost one fourth of a standard deviation higher among
teachers in treatment schools.27
    We do not report separate results for schools with and without books because the results in
both subsamples are quite similar to those for the full sample. With respect to our measures of
behavior changes, treatment teachers in schools without books responded to PFP the same way
that PFP teachers responded in schools with books.28 These results suggest that the gains from
PFP are not concentrated in schools with books because the teachers in these treatment schools
responded more to the PFP incentive scheme than PFP teachers in schools without books.
    Given our conjecture about the complementarity between teacher effort and books, we examine
correlations between the presence of books and rates of achievement growth. Tables 6a and 6b report
results from regressions of round two achievement on round one achievement and an indicator for
whether or not a student’s school provided P6 math books for students. Table 6a presents results
for control schools. Table 6b presents results for treatment schools.
    27
     Our effort index is scaled to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.
    28
     The estimated PFP impacts on hours grading and the overall effort index among schools with books are quite
close to those in the full sample and those based on the sample of schools without books. The hours grading effect
is .29, and the PFP impact on overall effort is .22.

Notes: Days Present is the number of days in the past five schools days, including the round two visit day, that the
P6 Math teacher was present at school, according to the Head Teacher. The Hours Preparing and Hours Grading
variables are constructed from self-reports by the P6 math teachers. These survey items asked teachers to choose
from a menu of thirty minute time intervals to describe their time allocations. To turn these responses into hours
of work, we assigned time allocations that equal the midpoints of the chosen intervals. The Effort Index is the first
principal component of the other three variables.




    Table 6a shows that, among students with similar round one scores, round two achievement in
control schools is not significantly correlated with the presence of books. This is true for all three
measures of round two achievement in the full sample and all the subsamples that we analyze.
Further, most of the estimated correlations between the presence of books and achievement growth
are negative.
    Table 6b shows that, in treatment schools, round two achievement is correlated with the presence
of books. Further, the pattern of achievement differences between treatment students with and
without books mirrors the contrasts between treatment and control students with books presented
in Table 4b. Among treatment students, access to books is positively correlated with round two
achievement on the P4-P6 subtest. Further, this correlation is driven largely by outcomes among
treatment students in the top half of the round one achievement distribution. Among these students,
scores on the P4-P6 subtest are .171 standard deviations higher among those with access to books.
Further, among these same students, those with books score .118 standard deviations higher on
the full test.
   We have been careful to describe the results in Tables 6a and 6b as estimates of correlations.
Our experiment did not involve random assignment of textbooks to schools. So, we cannot interpret
these correlations as casual impacts. Further, because we do not know what forces caused some
schools to acquire books and others not to acquire books, the patterns in Tables 6a and 6b do
not provide direct support for our conjecture concerning the complementarity of teacher effort and
books.

Notes: See Table 6a.




    Nonetheless, we must note that round one achievement is also uncorrelated with the presence of
P6 math books in both treatment and control schools. In fact, in both treatment and control schools,
round one achievement is lower in schools with P6 math books, although neither of these deficits
is statistically significant. These patterns lead us to discount the possibility that the presence of
books serves a proxy for school quality or community support for education.
    We see several patterns in our two rounds of achievement results that fit the same story. Absent
PFP treatment, student achievement was not correlated with student access to books in either round
one or round two. Further, absent books, student achievement in round two was not correlated with
PFP treatment. However, the combination of PFP treatment and access to books was associated
with better round two performance on the material covered in P6 math books, especially among
students who were better prepared to use these books. All of these results should be expected if
baseline levels of effective teacher effort were quite low in our schools, PFP induced more effective
effort from all treatment teachers, and teacher effort and books act as strong complements in the
production of math skill.


6        Comparisons of Achievement and Attainment Gains

Before concluding, we must note a contrast between our achievement results and our results for
attendance and attainment. We did not present separate estimates of the impacts of PFP on
attendance and attainment for students who are above versus below the median round one math
score because we found that these differences are typically not large. Further, when differences
exist, the attendance and attainment gains enjoyed by PFP students in schools with books are
usually slightly larger among those with below median achievement in round one.

                                                               25
    Yet, Tables 4a and 4b indicate that PFP did not produce statistically significant achievement
gains among lower achieving students, whether or not they enjoyed access to books. In treatment
schools with books, boys in the bottom half of the round one achievement distribution did score
.071 standard deviations higher on the P4-P6 subtest than their peers in control schools with books,
and among those who scored between the 25th percentile and the median in round one, this gap is
.124 standard deviations. However, neither of these score improvements is statistically significant.
    Even though these achievement gains are not statistically significant, they are of interest since
the attainment gains associated with PFP are large and statistically significant among boys in
the lower half of the round one achievement distribution. For example, among boys in treatment
schools with books who scored below the round one median, PFP raised P7 attendance rates by
almost 11 percentage points and raised PLE participation rates by 8 percentage points.29 These
attainment gains may be driven by the attainment outcomes of a portion of low-achieving boys
in treatment schools with books who enjoyed substantial achievement gains, or it may be that
promotion decisions are quite elastic to small improvements in command over the P4-P6 material.
   Among girls in the lower-half of the round one achievement distribution, we see little evidence
that treatment in schools with books produces either achievement growth or attainment gains.
However, treatment did boost round three attendance among these girls. It is possible that PFP
improved the interactions between low-achieving girls and their teachers in ways that made them
more willing to return to school and repeat P6.
    Nonetheless, we do not understand why the girls in treatment schools with books who scored
in the top-half of the round one achievement distribution enjoyed substantial achievement gains
on the P4-P6 subtest but did not enjoy any attainment gains in terms on promotion rates, PLE
participation, or PLE performance. We hope to explore this question in future research, but for
now, we note that, although boys enjoy higher average round one scores than girls in both our
treatment and control samples, girls in our control sample were more likely than boys to finish P7,
take the PLE, and pass the PLE. These gender gaps are apparent in the patterns of control mean
outcomes presented in Tables 3a-4b.
    Further, we discovered using regressions that, among control school students with books, girls
are seven percentage points more likely to take the PLE than boys with similar round one scores,
but among treatment students with books, the corresponding gender gap in PLE participation
probabilities is essentially zero at -.006. These estimated gender gaps are statistically different, and
we find results that follow a similar pattern when we examine gender gaps in PLE pass rates.30
Students must complete P7 to take the PLE. So, these results suggest that, in schools with books,
PFP treatment eliminates a significant female attainment advantage, even though Table 4b shows
that, in the same schools, PFP generates substantial achievement gains among high-achieving girls.


7        Related Research

Our results contribute to several literatures. Other studies have shown that measured student
achievement in rural schools in low-income countries increases in experiments where teachers receive

    The p-values associated with these treatment impacts are .01 and .06 respectively.
    30
    The conditional gender gap in PLE pass rates favors girls by almost five percentage points in control schools
with books, and the p-value associated with this gap is .04. In treatment schools with books, the parallel gap is just
over one percentage point and not statistically significant. However, we cannot reject the null that these gaps are the
same.

bonus payments linked to measures of educator performance derived from student scores. In Glewwe
et al. (2010), the authors found evidence that coaching students for a specific exam rather than
better teaching may have created these improvements. However, Muralidharan and Sundararaman
(2011) and Loyalka et al. (2018) report similar results in settings where coaching should not be a
concern because the experiments employed new exams that teachers had not seen before. Further,
Mbiti, Romero and Schipper (2018) found that performance pay raised student achievement on low-
stakes audit exams that did not impact teacher pay.31 In the Glewwe et al. (2010), Muralidharan
and Sundararaman (2011) and Loyalka et al. (2018) samples, all or most of the students enjoyed
access to books. However, in Mbiti, Romero and Schipper (2018), which dealt with Tanzanian
students in grades one through three, roughly two-thirds of students did not have books.32
    The results from a different experiment involving first, second, and third graders in Tanzania
provide support for our claim that teacher effort and books are complements in the production
of student skill. In Mbiti, Muralidharan, Romero and Schipper (2018), reseachers assigned 140
schools to a control group. Then, seventy schools received resource grants that they could use for
classroom investments. Another seventy schools participated in a performance pay program for
educators that linked bonus payments to whether or not students scored above fixed proficiency
scores on end-of-year assessments. Finally, another seventy schools both received resource grants
and participated in the performance pay program.
    The grants did generate improvement in classroom resources, and on average, schools spent over
thirty-five percent of their grant money on textbooks. However, these grants alone did not produce
improved learning outcomes for students. Further, in schools that participated in the incentives-only
treatment, students enjoyed, at best, small achievement gains. Nonetheless, students in schools that
both received grants and participated in the performance pay program enjoyed large achievement
gains. At the end of year two, these students typically scored higher in all grades and subjects
than comparable students in control schools. Further, in all cases, these score gains were roughly
.2 standard deviations or more.
    Mbiti, Muralidharan, Romero and Schipper (2018) find that providing grants alone does not
improve achievement, even though these grants were used to purchase books, practice exams, and
other instructional materials. Several previous studies found that providing books directly to all
children in rural schools may do little to improve student outcomes.33 Our results suggest that
providing better incentives for educators may accomplish little if their students do not have books
or other materials that facilitate learning. Yet, our results and the Mbiti, Muralidharan, Romero
and Schipper (2018) results indicate that by combining performance incentives with programs that
improve student access to books and other learning materials, policy makers can improvement
student achievement.

     Barrera-Osorio and Raju (2017) describe a performance pay experiment in Pakistan that produced few learning
gains. The authors conjecture that the program was less effective than those evaluated in the papers cited above be-
cause government officials rather than researchers ran the program. However, the program also involved a complicated
school-level incentive scheme that was quite different than those used in previous experiments.

     Glewwe et al. (2010) report that International Child Support provided textbooks or school resource grants to
75 of the 100 schools in their incentive experiment either before or during the experiment. Das et al. (2013) report
that the government provides free textbooks to students in Andhra Pradesh, the province where Muralidharan and
Sundararaman (2011) ran their study. In personal correspondence, Prashant Loyaloka confirmed that the Chinese
schools in Loyalka et al. (2018) provide books for students. In response to our inquiry, Isaac Mbiti reported that 67
percent of the Tanzanian students in Mbiti, Romero and Schipper (2018) had no books.

dents who were more prepared to use the books present in their schools echoes several recent studies
that highlight the importance of matching instructional resources to baseline achievement levels.
Glewwe et al. (2009) found that providing textbooks to schools in Kenya produced no gains for
students in the bottom four quintiles of the baseline achievement distribution. However, students
in the top quintile did enjoy achievement gains when they received books. Glewwe et al. (2009)
argue that Kenya education policies are designed to serve the most advantaged students and that
the textbooks schools use match the needs of these students.
    Banerjee et al. (2017) reviews a number of experiments that sought to implement “teaching
at the right level” (TaRL) in Indian schools. In a series of experiments, researchers learned that
students who are far below grade level can make substantial progress given instruction tailored to
their baseline achievement levels. Along the way, researchers learned that success required getting
instructors, either teachers or volunteers, to embrace the mission of targeting the learning needs of
students who have fallen behind.
    Muralidharan et al. (2017) report results from another set of experiments in India. They note
that students enjoyed large gains in math and Hindi when they participated in an after-school
program that used Mindspark software to tailor instruction to the learning needs of individual
students. They also note that Berry and Mukherjee (2016) evaluate a similar after-school program
in India that did not employ software to deliver targeted instruction, and this program produced
no learning gains.34
    Our PFP treatment is designed to focus educators on the learning needs of all of their students,
and our attendance results suggest that even the weaker students in our treatment schools were
more likely to stay in school the following academic year. However, our treatment did not provide
materials or training that would help teachers provide differentiated instruction for students at
different round one achievement levels, and this may explain why PFP produced few measurable
achievement gains among students who were ill-prepared to use P6 math books.


8        Conclusion

We began by presenting evidence that educators in Uganda pressure weak students to drop out of
primary school before they reach P7. Given the government’s limited information about student
outcomes and teacher behavior, policy choices that attach high-stakes to PLE outcomes produce
educational triage. Our results suggest that education authorities in Uganda may be able to reduce
dropout rates and promote learning by employing well designed incentive schemes like PFP.
    We only spent about three dollars per student on bonus payments. Further, the government
can implement PFP at scale without tracking student movements among all schools or identifying
all dropouts. Authorities just need a technology that would allow them to verify the population of
enrolled students in each school at the beginning of each school year and then determine which of
these students were present for testing at the end of each year. Education officials in rural Uganda
do not now have this capacity, but they may soon have it. During the summer of 2017, Uganda
began creating a national registry of school-aged children.35
    34
     Kerwin and Thornton (2018) report that implementation details surrounding training and resources interact in
complicated ways that significantly impact the benefits that students derive from the Mango Tree literacy program.

     Our results likely have policy implications for many other low-income countries. The appendix
table in section 10 lists more than thirty African countries that use PLE systems to ration access to
all levels of secondary schooling. In addition, other countries in Africa and Asia use similar systems
to ration access to some level of upper secondary schooling.36 In many of these countries, PLE
results are high-stakes outcomes for students, and governments collect little data on other student
outcomes. Thus, it is likely the educational triage practices we highlight exist beyond the borders
of Uganda.
   Nonetheless, our results suggest that countries like Uganda cannot produce the learning out-
comes they desire simply by providing better incentives for educators. Even motivated teachers
need learning materials, e.g. books, in order to help their students learn. Further, our results are
consistent with the growing evidence that these learning materials are more valuable when they
match the baseline achievement levels of students.
    Finally, although our results suggest that effective teacher incentive provision combined with
policies that increase student access to vital instructional resources may mitigate educational triage
and promote primary completion, education authorities in Uganda cannot achieve universal primary
completion simply by implementing these policies in upper primary grades, e.g. P5, P6, or P7.
They must also implement policies that improve school performance in the early primary grades.
In Uganda, many students drop out of school before reaching P5, and many of the students in
our sample began P6 with a tenuous command of the material in the P1 and P2 curricula.37 A
growing body of evidence suggests that these students can make progress, given instruction and
materials that are intentionally remedial. However, Uganda will likely not approach universal
primary completion without adopting reforms that promote much more learning and much lower
dropout rates in grades P1 through P5.
  36
   Examples include China, Ghana and India.

   See the Overview chapter in World Bank (2018) for more evidence that achievement levels for many students in
Uganda and other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa fall well below grade level.

9     PLE Data Appendix

Here, we describe how we matched students in our schools to their PLE records. The match requires
records from two data sets:

    • The round three data on PLE registration gathered by our round three enumerators. Our
      enumerators collected names, candidate numbers, and PLE testing centers for all students
      who were registered for the PLE.

    • We obtained data on individual PLE outcomes for all students tested in the districts that
      contain our sample schools. The data contain the name, candidate number, PLE testing
      center, and PLE outcomes for each registered student.

    Our merge process involved several steps:

    1. We cleaned the student names in our round three data. These cleaning procedures involved
       correcting problems with spelling and spacing of characters for fewer than 100 records.

    2. We cleaned the PLE data as well. We removed duplicate observations. We removed five
       records that marked a student as not showing up for the exam even though another record
       in the data provided exam results for the student in question. We dropped 16 records that
       contain results for eight students. In each case, there were two records for each of these eight
       students, and the PLE results conflicted within each record pair.

    3. We matched these two data sets on name and PLE testing center. We required exact matches
       on both. We found that the candidate numbers were not reliable keys for matching.

    Notes: This table describes how results on primary leaving exams impact secondary school admission in many
African countries. We do not include countries that only use exit exams to ration upper secondary education. The
countries listed here all consider PLE results when allocating slots in secondary schools. Column 2 describes the
typical years of schooling before students take their PLE. Column 3 summarizes how PLE results impact secondary
admission decisions. Our data come primarily from UNESCO Institute for Statistics Central Data Catalog and
English translations of UNESCO International Bureau of Educations World Data on Education 2010-11 reports.

Notes: The results come from regressions of individual gain scores, defined as the differences between our measures
of round two achievement and our round one achievement measure, on the school treatment indicator. To estimate
standard errors, we use a standard HAC estimator and treat schools as clusters.
