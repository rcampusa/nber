       Within the context of conditional asset allocation strategies, this paper explores the
implications of the low correlations of the emerging market returns with developed market returns
and the relatively high degree predictability of emerging countries' returns. It is well known that
low correlations improve investment opportunities and my research provides out-of-sample
validation of the improved performance. However, the most dramatic enhancement is generated
by the use of conditioning information. Portfolio strategies that use conditioning information to
predict emerging market returns produce impressive out-of-sample performance over the 1980-
1992 period.

1. Introduction

In the 1980's, fund managers realized that significant performance gains could
be obtained with by diversifying into high quality global equity markets. How-
ever, these gains are limited by the fairly high cross-correlations returns in these
markets.
     While investment has traditionally been concentrated in developed markets,
new interest has been sparked by the so-called 'emerging' capital markets. The
emerging markets have at least three attractive qualities, two of which are their
high average returns and their low correlations with developed markets. Diver-
sification into these markets should result in higher expected returns and lower
overall volatility.
     In terms of portfolio theory, adding low correlation portfolios to an optimiza-
tion enhances the reward to risk profile by shifting the mean-variance frontier to
the left. However, this type of exercise may be misleading because it is based on
ex post returns. This paper focusses on the performance of allocation strategies
that optimize investment weights at the end of the month and hold the implied
portfolio for the next month. Investment weights are then reoptimized and this
strategy is continued throughout the 1980—1992 period.
     However, the portfolio optimization problem requires important inputs — the
expected returns and the variance-covariance matrix. In principal, all of these
measures should be forward looking. That is, the returns, volatilities and corre-
lations should be forecasted. The resulting investment strategy reflects current
information.
    The twist in this paper is that it utilizes the third desirable property of
emerging market returns: they are predictable. Forecasting models are developed
which provide one-step ahead forecasts for 41 markets (20 developed markets and
21 emerging markets). This is a much larger set of assets than the one considered
in Solnik (1993).
    Six portfolio strategies are evaluated. The first three examine traditional
allocations based on (a) developed markets, (b) developed and emerging markets

                                         1
 and (c) developed and emerging markets with a 20% cap on emerging markets.
 The allocations are traditional in that naive models, based on historical averages
 of the expected returns, variances and covariances, are used. For each case, two
 strategies are examined: (1) hold the global minimum variance portfolio and (2)
 hold the portfolio with a target volatility of 16% (annualized).
      The fourth to sixth allocations use the same set of assets except conditioning
 information directly enters the optimization. With forecasted means, variances
 and covariances, new investment weights are calculated and the out-of-sample
 performance is evaluated and compared to the traditional asset allocation strategy.
      Using the traditional asset allocation, there is some benefit to addingemerg-
 ing markets to portfolios. However, the most dramatic enhancement comes with
 the introduction of emerging markets and conditioning information. Standard
 performance measures, such as ratios of expected return to volatility, show im-
pressive performance when both emerging markets and conditioning information
are used.
     The paper is organized as follows. In the second section, the unconditional
and conditional portfolio optimization strategies are presented. The data are
presented in the third section. In the fourth part, the results of the out-of-sample
portfolio allocation are evaluated. Some concluding remarks are offered in the
sixth section.


2. Portfolio Strategies

2.1. Unconditional asset allocation

The usual problem that investment managers face is to maximize the expected
returns of the portfolio subject to some target level of volatility. That is, invest-
ment weights are chosen to give the best possible performance for an expected
level of standard deviation. The target standard deviation is determined outside
the problem by the investor's tolerance for risk.

     The solution to this problem,
                                       max w'p
                           Subject to w'Vw = Target                             (1)
                                          w'l=l
where w represents a N x 1 vector of investment proportions, iz is a N x 1 vector
of expected asset returns, V is a N x N variance-covariance matrix, and N are
the number of countries in the problem, is a standard quadratic program.
     In this problem, the investment proportions are unrestricted in size but must
sum to unity. This opens the possibility of extremely large short and long positions
in any market. Given that thin trading is a problem in many emerging markets,
it seem plausible that all short sales should be disallowed,

                           w0          fori=1,...,N.                            (2)
This adds a third set of asset specific constraints to the problem (1).
    The strategies evaluated in this paper involve solving (1) at the end of each
month and holding the implied portfolio for the next month. The sample is
updated using a 60-month moving window and the portfolio is reoptimized at
each point in time. In all strategies, transactions costs are ignored although it
is straightforward to modify the problem to add proportional transactions costs.
All strategies are evaluated on an out-of-sample basis over the 1980.12 to 1992.06
period. That is, the first allocation is based on data from 1976:12 to 1980.11.
    Two basic strategies are evaluated. The first is to choose the minimum-
variance portfolio. That is, the investment weights match the weights implied by
the minimum variance portfolio over the previous five years. These weights are
used to form a portfolio and it is held over the next month. The second strategy
involves choosing a portfolio with a target level of volatility of 16% (annualized).
This volatility is roughly the volatility of holding the Morgan Stanley Capital In-
ternational (MSCI) world market portfolio [see Harvey (1991)] which is a common
benchmark.
    In solving the problem, there is always a minimum-variance portfolio. How-
ever, there is not always a portfolio with the 16% target volatility because of the

                                         3
 short-sales constraints. In the case where the 16% can not be attained from be-
 low, the maximum-variance portfolio is chosen. When the 16% cannot be attained
 from above (on the positively sloped section of the mean-variance frontier), the
 minimum-variance portfolio is chosen.
      Three sets of equity groups are considered. The first restricts the assets to 21
 equity markets in the MSCI universe. The second group adds 20 emerging equity
 markets from the International Finance Corporation. The third group includes
 the 41 countries but imposes the additional constraint to (1) and (2) that the sum
 of the weights in the emerging markets must be less than or equal to 20%. This
 precludes the possibility that an unreasonable proportion of the portfolio is placed
 in emerging market assets.
     The strategy is considered unconditional because of the way of expected re—
turns, variances and covariances are chosen. The expected returns are the mean
returns over the previous 60 months. Although these mean returns change through
time as the 60-month window moves, using the average returns assumes that the
best forecast of the equity return is its past average. This is consistent with a
random walk model of stock prices with drift. This model implies that there is no
other information relevant for forecasting next months stock price other than the
previous price. In other words, stock returns are not predictable.
      The unconditional strategy also places restrictions on other inputs to the
problem. The variances and covariances are assumed to be the unconditional
variances and covariances over the previous 60 months. This precludes the possi-
bility that these measures move in more complex ways.
      All strategies are developed and implemented in U.S. dollar terms. This
assumes that no currency hedging takes place. Implementing the problem in local
currency terms would be consistent with perfect foresight currency hedges being
initiated for each country. This assumption is tenuous for developed markets and
unreasonable for the emerging markets. As a result, the evaluation is done in a
common numeraire currency.'

      Harvey (1993b) studies the international asset allocation problem and argues
that the portfolio selection should include currency portfolios (in the form of local

                                         4
2.2. Conditional asset allocation

In the mean-variance problem in (1), three sets of inputs are needed: means,
variances and covariances. At the end of the month, the investor is trying to design
the portfolio that guarantees the highest possible expected return for the level of
volatility that is consistent with the risk tolerance. In solving the unconditional
problem, a set of portfolio weights are obtained that guarantees the highest ex
post returns for a level of volatility — over the past five years. In other words,
the unconditional mean-variance problem delivers a set of investment weights that
'work' — but only over the past history.

      The only way for the manager to obtain an efficient portfolio (highest ex-
pected return for a level of volatility) in the unconditional problem is to hold the
investment weights implied by the actual data! Suppose that a manager is being
evaluated over the 1981.01 to 1985.12 period. In 1980.12, the manager begins to
manage the portfolio. Evaluation is measured in terms of how close the manager
is to the efficient frontier. How can the manager obtain this efficient portfolio?
—
   only on the basis of the knowing the data from 1981.01 to 1985.12 — which is
obviously impossible.
     In implementing the unconditional asset allocation strategies, managers will
optimize their portfolio over 1976.01 to 1980.12 and hold the implied portfolio
weights over the next period. These weights guarantee the portfolio is efficient
over the 1976.01 to 1980.12 — not in the future.
     So in practice, what is really required for the mean-variance problem is the
best possible forecasts of the expected returns, variances and covariances for the
next period. The past averages may not be that meaningful because the investment
manager cares about the future and not the past. Past averages are only used if
the means, variances and covariances are completely unpredictable.
    The conditional asset allocation implements forecasting models for the in-
puts of the mean-variance problems. Linear regression models are built for the

deposits or loans). The solution to the quadratic program will deliver the optimal
asset allocation as well as the optimal currency hedges.

                               E[rJ2'_1} = 2t16j,                                (3)

where r is the return on country i over from t — 1 to t, Z_1 is a 1 x £ vector of
£ global and country specific information variables that are known at time t — 1,
   is a £ x 1 coefficient matrix. The errors from this regression, , are assumed
to be unrelated to the conditioning information, Z_1.
     I use linear models for conditional means which is consistent with a num-
ber of previous studies.2 The forecasting variables include a constant as well as
world variables such the lagged world dividend yield and lagged world returns and
country-specific variables including lagged country dividend yield lagged country
returns. All of the forecasting variables are financial variables to ensure data
availability on the last day of the month.
    The portfolio problem also requires the forecast of the variance-covariance
matrix. Consider the covariance between asset i and j:

      Cov[rt,rtIZt_i] = E [(nt — E[rtjZt_i1)(rt —                                (4)
                                                        E[ritIZt_i})Zt_i].
Given the regression errors in (3), we can rewrite (4) as:


                        Cov[r1t,rtIZt_iJ = E[E2tetIZt_ij.                        (5)

The conditional covariance is the forecasted value of the product of the residuals
for the regression models for asset i and asset j.
    In principal, the conditioning information for asset i and asset j is different.
In addition, the conditioning information on the product of the two residuals
could be the intersection of the two information sets plus additional variables.
   2 See for example, Gibbons and Ferson (1985), Keim and Stambaugh (1986),
Fama and French (1988, 1989), Harvey (1989, 1991), Ferson and Harvey (1991,
1993), Campbell and Hamao (1992), and Harvey (1993a) for some examples.
Harvey (1992) compares the performance of linear models to general nonlinear
alternatives and finds that linear models perform as well as nonlinear models in
out-of-sample evaluation.

                                        6
For example, an autoregressive-conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) type model
would include lagged values of the product of the residuals in the information set.
     The approach of this paper is to use the unconditional mean of the product of
the residuals as the forecasted variance-covariance matrix. This implicitly assumes
that the product of the residuals is not predictable. This follows, in spirit, the
approach of Solnik (1993). However, the matrix used in this paper is not the
unconditional variance-covariance matrix. It is the average conditional variance-
covariance matrix. Importantly, the Zr_i variables are allowed to affect the means.
    This approach greatly simplifies the estimation. Indeed, a full model of the
variance-covariance matrix would require up to 820 forecasting equations when 41
markets are examined! In addition, the most important inputs for asset allocation
are the expected values for the asset returns. The optimal weights are much more
sensitive to a change in the means than to a change in the variances or covariances.
     Similar to the unconditional asset allocation, the variance-covariance matrix
is based on a 60-month moving window average of the product of the regression
residuals through the sample. In the analysis, the regressions are estimated over
the full sample which implies that the regression coefficients, 5, are constant.
More elaborate models which using moving-window estimation for the conditional
means are also possible. This would allow for out-of-sample forecasts at every
step .
     In addition, to minimize the data snooping problem, a set of predetermined
information variables were chosen before the data were examined. While the set
of information variables resembles the set of variables used in potentially data-
snooped studies of developed markets, no one has examined the predictability of
emerging market returns. In addition, given the low correlations between emerging
returns and developed returns, it does not necessarily follow that the variables that
predict developed market returns automatically predict emerging market returns.
     There is also the issue of survivorship biases in the emerging markets data

     Harvey (1989) and Solnik (1993) examine the out-of-sample forecasts of the
linear regression models and find that their performance compares favorably to
the in-sample forecasts.

which is examined in Harvey (1993a). The International Finance Corporation
began publishing indices in 1981 — yet their data reaches back to 1975.12. In
some of the markets, the indices were back-tracked. This induces a look-back bias
in the sample. That is, the stocks in 1976 are the ones that survived to 1981.
Harvey argues that it is not clear that this problem is serious. In addition, the
asset allocation routine avoids the look-back by requiring that the market exist
for five years before it is included in the allocation.


3. Data

3.1.   Sources and summary statistics

Data are available on for 21 developed markets from Morgan Stanley Capital In-
ternational and 20 emerging markets from the International Finance Corporation
of the World Bank. Some summary statistics are presented in table 1.
     The summary statistics are presented for the full sample period, 1976.01 to
1992.06 and for a recent subperiod, 1985.01 to 1992.06. Both U.S. dollar returns
and local currency returns are displayed. The statistics include the average (annu-
alized) arithmetic and geometric return, standard deviation and autocorrelations.
The developed market summary statistics are presented over different samples
by other authors and appear for the purpose of comparison with the emerging
returns.
       The mean U.S. dollar returns for the emerging markets range from 72% (Ar-
gentina) to -6% (Indonesia whose sample only begins in January 1990). This
sharply contrasts with the range of average returns in the developed markets. In
the MSCI sample, no country has an average arithmetic return that exceeds 25%.
In the IFC emerging sample, 9 countries (Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Philippines,
Portugal, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey and Venezuela) have returns that average
above 25%.
    It is important to present both the arithmetic and geometric average returns.
The geometric average reflects the average returns to a buy and hold strategy.

                                          8
With high volatility, there could be large differences in the arithmetic and geo-
metric mean returns. This is especially evident in the emerging markets sample.
The most dramatic example is Argentina. The arithmetic average return is 72%
and the geometic average is 27%!
     The emerging market returns are characterized by high volatility. Volatility
ranges from 18% (Jordan) to 105.6% (Argentina). In contrast, the MSCI countries
have range of volatility between 15% and 33%. There are 13 emerging countries
with volatility higher than 33% (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Greece, Indonesia, Mex-
ico, Nigeria, Philippines, Portugal, Taiwan, Turkey, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe).
    The autocorrelations are also presented in table 1. In the MSCI sample,
there are only five countries with first-order autocorrelation that exceeds 10%. In
the emerging countries, there are 12 countries with autocorrelations greater than
10%. Indeed, thereare eight countries with autocorrelations above 20% (Colom-
bia, Indonesia, Mexico, Pakistan, Philippines, Portugal, Turkey, and Venezuela).
This suggests that the returns in these countries are predictable based on past
information.
     The second panel of table 1 examines the most recent subperiod. The same
pattern in the summary statistics are evident. For example, one might think that
the extraordinary 72% average return for Argentina might be a function of the a
look-back bias because the data begins in 1975.12. However, in the most recent
subperiod the average return in Argentina is 88%! Indeed, in the most recent
subperiod, there are 10 countries whose returns exceed 33%. The predictability is
also retained with 10 countries exhibiting serial correlation above 20%.
     For comparison purposes, the statistics on the returns in local currency terms
are also presented. The wild inflation in Argentina and Brazil is evident in the
228% and 156% average returns over the full sample. Other countries that have
experienced severe inflation such as Colombia, Chile and Venezuela also have much
higher local returns. Calculating the returns in U.s. dollars eliminates the local
inflation. However, the U.S. inflation remains in the returns.
     The cross-correlations of the emerging markets and the correlations of the
 emerging markets and the MSCI markets are presented in table 2. Panel A details

                                         9
the U.S. dollar return correlations within the emerging markets. These correla-
tions are remarkably small. For example, the correlation between Argentina and
Brazil is only -3%. The correlation between Pakistan and India is -10%. The
correlation between Colombia and Chile is 0%. The correlations in the most re-
cent subperiod (panel B) show the same characteristics. The correlation between
Argentina and Brazil is still -4%.
     Panels C and D present the correlations in local currency terms. Interestingly,
the correlations do not change that much. For example, the correlation between
the Argentina and Brazil returns increases to 15% when measured in local currency
terms. Over the shorter sample, the correlation is 16%. The correlation between
Colombia and Chile is -6%.
     The correlation between the emerging and developed markets is presented in
the next four panels. The average correlations are very small. Malaysia has the
highest correlation with developed markets and Mexico has the second highest.
For the other countries, the correlations are often less than 10%. For example,
Argentina has correlations less than 10% for 18 of the 21 developed markets.
Korea has correlations less than 10% for 8 of the 21 developed markets.
      The same holds true in the most recent subperiod. Argentina and Venezuela's
correlations with each 21 MSCI markets are less than 10%. There are many
countries that have negative correlations with a number developed markets.
   Mullin (1993) argues that the low average monthly correlations could be due
market imperfections such as lead and lag effects. Mullin shows that the annual
correlations are higher than the month correlations. However, it is not clear
that they are statistically higher. In my sample (excluding Indonesia), there
are 171 cross-correlation coefficients for 19 returns. Using monthly data, 26 are
significantly different from zero. With the annual data, only 5 are significantly
different from zero. This evidence supports the position that the low correlations
are real rather than an artifact of infrequent trading.4

  '  Using monthly data, there are 5 emerging countries that have significant cor-
relation with the U.S. return. With annual data, only one country has significant
correlation (at the 5% level of significance). However, these are univariate tests

                                        10
     The low correlations imply significant benefits are possible in diversifying
into the emerging markets. Even though the volatility of the individual emerging
markets is high, the low correlations should reduce portfolio volatility. This is
evident in the work of Divecha, Drach and Stefek (1992), Stone (1990) and Wilcox
(1992). Next, I will assess how these benefits translate into portfolio performance.


4. Asset Allocation

4.1. Performance of unconditional asset allocation strategies

The unconditional minimum-variance frontiers for each month between 1980.12
and 1992.06 are graphed in figure 1. The first panel presents frontiers based on
the MSCI sample of developed equity markets. The second panel introduces the
emerging markets into the optimization. Overlaying these two panels, it is evident
that the introduction of the emerging markets greatly increases the investment
possibilities. The frontiers move up (higher mean) and shift inward (lower stan-
dard deviation). This is evident even if the emerging markets are restricted to
20% of the investment portfolio (in panel C).
    Figure 2 presents the weights placed on the aggregate of the MSCI portfolios
and the emerging portfolios for the two investment strategies. In the first panel,
the weights for the minimum-variance strategy is shown. Through the entire
sample, the weight on the developed markets decreases and the weight on the
emerging markets increases. By the end of the sample, the optimizer wants to
place over 90% of investment funds in emerging markets. The second panel shows
the weights of the minimum-variance strategy when the investment in emerging
markets is constrained to be at 20% or below. This constraint is binding in every
month.
    The next two panels show the weights for the 16% target volatility strategy.
The weights are much more variable in this exercise. Indeed, the weight on the
developed markets plunges from above 80% at the beginning of 1985 to zero for

of correlation. Multivariate tests could be more powerful.

                                         11
five months. Other than this one extreme swing, the same pattern persists: If the
optimizer is unconstrained, it will place increasing weight on the emerging equities.
The constrained optimization with the 20% cap, shown in the final panel, suggests
that the constraint is binding after 1987.
     Table 3 presents the performance measures for each of the strategies. First,
consider the minimum-variance strategy. When restricted to just developed mar-
kets, the out-of-sample performance amounts to 16.09% per year with a 15.39%
standard deviation.5 If emerging markets are added to the problem, the perfor-
mance increases slightly to 16.35%. More dramatically, the volatility drops to
only 11.63%. When the emerging markets are capped at 20%, the actual return
increases to 17.02% and the volatility increases to 14.02% — however, this is still
almost a full percent lower than the strategy that restricts investment to only
developed countries. The Sharpe ratios (return in excess of the eurodollar rate6
divided by standard deviation) for the three minimum-variance investment strate-
gies are: 0.48, 0.66 and 0.59. These results suggest an unambiguous benefit to
diversifying into emerging markets. Interestingly, the benefit is mainly driven by
lower portfolio volatility rather than higher returns.
    The first three columns of table 4 detail the year-by-year performance of
these strategies. The developed plus emerging markets with the 20% cap produces
returns that are almost always better than the developed countries alone. The
exception are the first 6 months of 1992.
     The second panel of table 3 shows the results of the 16% target volatility
strategy. All of the strategies have lower returns than the minimum-variance
strategies. The highest return, 13.48%, is found in the developed and emerging
sample. The Sharpe ratios for the three strategies are 0.23, 0.24 and 0.16.
    The year-by-year performance is presented in the fourth through sixth
columns of table 4. The 16% target strategy sustains serious losses in 1982, 1984
     For comparison over the same period, the MSCI world return was 14.32%
with a standard deviation of 15.45%. The MSCI U.S. return was 14.96% with a
standard deviation of 15.92%.

and 1990. An examination of the returns of the different 16% volatility strategies
does not suggest that any one dominates the others.
    Why doesn't the 16% target strategy perform better than the minimum-
variance strategy? The answer has to do with the mean. In solving for the
minimum-variance portfolio, you do not need the mean [see Roll (1977, eq. A.14)].
That is, the allocation is not affected by mismeasurement of the mean. However,
the 16% target strategy needs an estimate of the mean. As a result, if the forecast
of the return is poor, the 16% strategy will suffer. The minimum-variance strategy
will be relatively immune to a misspecification of the mean. It now makes sense
to examine the specification of the mean.


4.2. Predictability of returns

A number of world and local information variables are used to forecast the returns
on the 41 equity markets. Each variable is known at time t — 1 when the forecast
takes place. The world variables include a constant, the lagged world return, the
lagged return on a 10 country currency index7, the lagged MSCI world dividend
yield, the lagged MSCI earnings-price ratio, and the lagged Eurodollar rate. The
local information variables include the lagged country equity return in local cur-
rency terms, the lagged change in the country's foreign exchange rate per U.S.
dollar, the lagged country dividend and the lagged country's earnings-price ratio.
For the emerging countries, the last two information variables are only available
beginning in 1985.. As a result, these two variables do not enter the regression
forecasts until 1985.
     The results of the in-sample U.S. dollar regressions are presented in table
5. In the overall sample, 14 of the 21 developed countries exhibit significant
predictability. In 9 of these countries, the local information variables help predict
the equity returns. A multivariate test of the predictability suggests that we can
reject the hypothesis that the expected returns are constant at the 99% level of
confidence.

     See Harvey (1993b) for details on the construction of this index.

                                         13
     The predictability of the emerging returns is detailed in the next panel. The
regressions are significant in 12 of the 20 emerging markets. In addition, local
information (lagged return, lagged FX) is important in 5 of these countries. There
are 9 emerging markets whose R2s exceed 10%. This contrasts to only 4 developed
markets with R2 above 10%. The multivariate test of predictability provides a
strong rejection (99.9% level of confidence) of the hypothesis that the expected
emerging returns are constant.
     The next panel examines the most recent sample. In the developed countries,
returns are predictabl& in 15 of the 21 countries. For the emerging markets, 13
of 20 regressions are significant. Local information is important in five developed
countries. The local information (which now also includes a lagged dividend yield
and a lagged earnings-price ratio) is important in 9 of the 20 emerging market
regressions. In 18 of the regressions, the R2s exceed 10%. Indeed, in 11 of the
regressions the R2s exceed 20%. The message from the table is that the emerging
returns are predictable — and more predictable than the developed country returns.

4.3. The performance of conditional asset allocation strategies

Figure 3 draws the conditional mean-variance frontiers from 1980.12 to 1992.06.
These frontiers are based on the in-sample expected returns from the regression
model (4). For the countries with all the conditioning variables, the full-period
coefficient estimates are used for the expected returns. For the countries which
are missing the dividend yield and earnings-price ratios before 1985, two models
are estimated. The first model omits the dividend yield and earnings-price ratio
and fitted values are obtained through 1984.12. The second model uses the most
recent data and the full set of conditioning variables and the fitted values are
obtained from 1985.01 through 1992.06.
     All panels of figure 3 dramatically contrast with figure 1. The mean-variance
frontiers shift across to a lower volatility range and upward to a higher expected
return range. In almost every case, the parabola opens up indicating a wider range
of investment opportunities. The frontiers are truncated between the annualized
expected returns of -30% and 70%.
     Comparing panels A (developed markets) and panels B (developed and emerg-
ing) for the 1981—1985 period, the shape of the frontiers looks similar. However,
the frontiers have been shifted to the lower volatility range in panel B. The more
dramatic differences appear in the 1986—1992 graphs. When emerging markets are
added to the mean-variance problem, the frontier flattens out and moves to the
lower standard deviation range. Even when the 20% cap on the emerging markets
is binding (in panel C), this flattening out is evident.
    Figure 4 plots the investment weights for the minimum volatility and the 16%
target volatility strategies. Similar to figure 2, when there is no constraint on the
weight of the emerging markets in the portfolio, the investment weight assigned
to emerging markets increases through time. By 1992, the optimizer tells us to
invest only 10% of our portfolio in developed country stocks. When the problem
is rerun with the 20% cap on emerging markets, the constraint is binding from
1981.
     The weights depicted in figure 4 for the 16% target volatility strategy are


                                         15
more variable but follow similar patterns to the ones experienced in figure 2.
There is a huge reweighting to emerging markets beginning in 1986. Over time,
when the participation in emerging markets is not constrained, the investment
weights increase in these markets. By the last optimization, all investment is
placed in emerging markets. The move to emerging markets is also evident in the
constrained optimization. By 1986, the 20% cap is always binding.
     Table 6 presents the returns of the portfolio strategies. The mean (annualized)
return when only developed markets are included is 16.99% with a volatility of
15.14%. Similar to the unconditional strategy, when emerging markets are added
to the problem, the mean return increases to 17.97% and the volatility plunges to
11.66%. Also similar to the unconditional strategy, when the emerging markets
are capped at 20% the returns increase to 18.87% and the volatility increases to
14.05% — still more than a full percentage below the case where we are restricted
to only developed markets' equities. The Sharpe ratios for the three strategies
are: 0.55, 0.80 and 0.72.
     The conditional minimum volatility (table 6) and the unconditional strategy
(table 3) have striking similarities. The results are similar because, as mentioned
earlier, the minimum-variance portfolio weights do not directly depend on the
expected returns vector. The results are not exactly the same for two reasons.
First, the problem is different than the one examined in Roll (1977) because of
the no short-sales constraint. Second, and more importantly, the mean enters the
problem indirectly through the variance-covariance matrix. In the unconditional
problem, we use the unconditional variances and covariances. In the conditional
problem, we use the average conditional variance and the average conditional
covariance. The extent to which the conditional second moment measures differ
from their unconditional counterparts will determine the degree of difference in
the investment weights.
    In the target 16% volatility strategy, the expected returns play a critical
role. In the unconditional strategies in table 3, the historical average returns were
used as the expected returns and the performance of this strategy was inferior
t.o the minimum-variance strategy. For example, in the unconditional minimum-


                                         16
variance strategy with developed and capped emerging markets, the average ex-
pected volatility was 9.52% producing a return of 17.02%. In contrast, the un-
conditional 16% target volatility (whose average expected volatility was actually
16.19%), the return was only 12.09%. By taking on almost double the volatil-
ity, your returns go down. This might have seem surprising. However, as noted
earlier, the intuition behind this result has to do with the expected returns.
     The average historical mean is not a very good forecast of the expected re-
turns in most countries. This is evident from the significant regression results in
table 5. In the minimum-volatility strategy, we get around the forecasting prob-
lem. However, in the target volatility strategies, you must use have a forecasting
model. The results in table 3 suggest that implementing an asset allocation model
using historical means as forecasts for the expected returns could have disastrous
consequences.
      The results in the second panel of table 6 use the regression forecasts for
the expected returns. The average expected returns for the developed countries
sample is 29.94% with a volatility of 18.33%.8 When the emerging markets are
added to the problem, the returns leap to 54.96%, however the realized volatility
jumps to 24.40%. When the emerging markets are constrained to a 20% portfolio
weight, the annual return is 39.30% with a volatility of 19.89%. The Sharpe ratio
 for strategy with the emerging markets capped at 20% is 1.53. This compares to
 a ratio os 1.16 if the investor is restricted to only developed markets and 0.23 for
 the strategy that does not use conditioning information.
     The year-by-by returns of the six different investments that use conditioning
information are presented in table 7. The minimum-volatility strategy returns are
similar to the ones presented in table 4 in that losses are sustained in the first and
  8 These results  are consistent with Solnik's (1993) study of 8 developed markets
over the 1971.01 to 1990.08 period. His unconditional asset allocation produced
returns of 18.2% with a standard deviation of 17.5%. Using the conditional means
and the unconditional variances and covariances, the returns increased to 24.6%
and with a volatility of 20.4%.
     The volatility of the conditional strategy is higher than the target volatility
because the average conditional volatility differs from the unconditional volatility
by the variance of the conditional means.

                                         17
last years. However, the choose 16% volatility strategies are much different from
the unconditional ones presented in table 4. In the exercise with both developed
and capped emerging markets, there is only one year with a small negative return
(1982, -0.49%). All other years have positive returns and there are five years
where the returns exceed 30%.
     One potential criticism of the conditional asset allocation exercise is that
the regression models are not estimated on an out-of-sample basis. That is, the
method assumes fixed coefficients through the entire sample. This could lead to
an overfitting problem.
   Tables 8 and 9 present the results of a conditional asset allocation exercise
where the regression forecasts are calculated on an out-of-sample basis. The con-
ditioning information includes: a constant, lagged world return, lagged change in
G-10 exchange rate, lagged world dividend yield, the lagged world earnings-price
ratio, the Eurodollar rate, and the lagged country return. For example, the regres-
sion model is estimated to 1990:02 (based on information variables available at the
end of 1990:01). The estimated coefficients are applied to the information avail-
able at the end of 1990:02 to form an out-of-sample forecast for 1990:03. This
out-of-sample forecast is the conditional mean for the asset allocation program
input.
   The results are surprisingly resiliant to the out-of-sample forecasts. For the
minimum variance strategy, there is little change which is consistent with the
intuition that the conditional mean does not have much of an impact. In the
strategy with developed and emerging countries (20% cap), the average realized
return reported in table 8 is 18.28% with a 14.12% volatility. This compares to
an 18.87% return using the in-sample forecasts. When the rolling unconditional
means are used, the average performance is 17.02%. All of these three sets of
conditioning information produce about the same realized volatility.
    The performance of the choose 16% volatility strategy is more affected by the
choice of the out-of-sample forecasts. With developed markets only the average
return performance is 16.56% with a volatility of 18.64% (Sharpe measure of
0.42). In contrast, the unconditional strategy in table 3 reported 13.19% return

                                        18
and 19.55% standard deviation (Sharpe measure of 0.23).
     With both developed and emerging markets and using the out-of-sample fore-
casts, the strategy produces average returns of 25.43% and a volatility of 19.23%.
In contrast, the unconditional results in table 3 showed a 13.48% return and a
19.92% standard deviation. The Sharpe measure for the out-of-sample conditional
asset allocation is 0.87 compared to 0.24 for the unconditional strategy.
     When the out-of-sample forecasts are used with developed and emerging coun-
tries (20% cap), the results in table 8 show a 20.25% return and 19.20% standard
deviation (Sharpe measure of 0.60). This is a great improvement over the uncon-
ditional strategy which produced a Sharpe measure of only 0.16.
     It is not surprising that the returns of the conditional strategies using out-
of-sample regression forecasts are lower than the conditional strategies using in-
sample regression forecasts. However, the important message is that even using
the out-of-sample strategies, the performance of the conditional asset allocation
strategies is impressive compared to the unconditional strategies.
       The returns implied by the conditional asset allocation suggests that the
main benefit of investment in emerging markets comes from the predictability of
the emerging market returns. This predictability, combined with the low corre-
lations within emerging markets and with developed markets, enhances portfolio
performance. 10



5.   Conclusions

The idea of this study is to examine the impact of emerging equity markets on
global investment strategies. Recently a number of researchers have documented

  10
      Implicit in the mean-variance analysis are the assumptions that investors
prefer higher expected returns and that the risk (which investors dislike) of the
portfolio is captured by the overall variance. It is useful to characterize the risk
of the individual markets. Indeed, in implementing portfolio optimization, it
is commonplace to add constraints to limit exposure to certain types of risk.
Harvey (1993a,c) provides some insights on the exposure of the emerging markets
to different global risk factors.

                                        19
the low correlations between emerging equity returns and developed market re-
turns. In an active portfolio strategy, this means that the opportunity set has
become larger: higher expected returns can be gained at lower volatility.
    Portfolio simulations were presented to verify that the low correlations pro-
duced superior out-of-sample portfolio allocations. The out-of-sample allocation
is important because portfolio programs usually produce weights that are ex post
optimal. There is no guarantee that these weights will work with data outside the
program (in the future). However, strategies that included emerging equity mar-
kets consistently outperformed strategies that were limited to developed markets.
     While the low correlations with developed markets are important, the most
striking advantage of investing in emerging markets relates to their predictability.
Regression models were presented that show that the returns in a number of the
emerging markets are predictable based on both global and country-specific infor-
mation variables. When these regression forecasts are combined with a portfolio
optimizer, the simulated portfolio performances sharply improve.
     One important issue that this paper does not address is the sources of the
predictability in the emerging market returns. Indeed a broader issue is the ex-
tent to which these markets are integrated into world capital markets. Models
that allow for time-varying conditional integration of world capital markets are
explored in Bekaert and Harvey (1993).
     On a more practical side, as long as the emerging market is investable, the
portfolio manager may not care whether the market is integrated. Lack of inte-
gration can present opportunities for investors. High expected returns assets can
be purchased at prices cheaper than comparable assets in developed countries.
The evidence in this paper suggests that there is a benefit to including emerging
market assets in a globally diversified portfolio.
