I.   Introduction

          As a result of rapid growth in the post—war period, pension plans

have become a major component of the financial structure of large corpora-

tions. A recent survey [5] of 475 of the Fortune 500 companies revealed

that pension cost in 1978 averaged 12.5% of pretax profits and 7.2% of

wages and salaries. Vested liabilities and pension assets averaged 34% and

26% of book net worth, respectively.1 Given a typical debt/net worth ratio of

40% this data implies that pension assets for this group of companies approximate

19% of corporate assets and vested liability is 85% of long term corporate

liability.2 Despite these magnitudes, pension items do not appear on the

corporate balance sheet and little has been known about how pension decisions

are and/or should be made.3

           In the past few years there has been a growing interest in pension

policy from a financial management viewpoint.4 At one end of the spectrum

of available literature there is the analysis of corporate pension funds

under the assumptions of perfect markets and equal access.5 For example,

3Treynor, etal [111 have demonstrated the importance of integrating the balance
 sheets of corporations and their pension funds in analyzing the capital structure
 of firms and the value of each claim.
4This has arisen in part from the growth of the private pension system and in
 part from the public policy concerns as reflected in the Employees Retirement
 Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). The act regulates various aspects of
 the major policy decisions facing the corporation; (1) benefit provisions,
 (2) funding and (3) investment of pension fund assets. It lso established
 the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation (PBGC) which is a quasi—government
 corporation that insures pension benefits and has the power within limits to
 assess corporations for funding deficiencies in the event of a plan termination.
5See Fama [3] for a review of this framework.

Sharpe [8] demonstrates that funding and investment policy will have

no effect on the value of the total compensation of employees——

current plus deferred wages (pensions)——so long as employees are rational,

the capital market is perfect and individuals and firms have equal access

to it. In this world the firm will have to pay the price of providing

risk—free pension promises; if the funding and investment strategy is

risky, then employees or the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation will demand

that the firm acquire insurance to protect their claims or pay them excess

current wages so that they can acquire it themselves.   enhe value of tle
compensation   package is fixed,a it is in Sharpe's case, Black [ii has shown that

the level of funding and the investment policy should not affect shareholder value.

 This comes about because investors can offset any corporate asset/liability

 decision on personal account. This conclusion can be expanded to a world of

 uncertainty, including the possibility of corporate bankruptcy and/or pension

 plan termination so long as claimants on the firm (i.e. shareholders,

 beneficiaries, bondholders) protect themselves from one another with costlessly

 enforced me—first rules which ensure that the characteristics of the payoffs

 on the firm's outstanding claims are unaffected by changes in financial

 policy (see Fama [3] for the argument as applied to capital structure decisions).

           The special tax status of corporate pension plans is a major factor

that is ignored in the perfect markets assumptions underlying these results.

 In [9] Tepper and Af fleck concluded that, given the tax status of corporate

pension plans, a firm could enhance shareholder value by borrowing to fund the

pension plan. This strategy would produce an arbitrage situation within the

firm whereby the pension fund would earn a pretax rate of return while the

 firm would pay tax—deductible interest on the financing.6 Creditors should

6The paper also considered factors other than the tax considerations (e.g. bank-
ruptcy and the priority of claims; these will be discussed in later sections
of the present paper).
                                  —3—


 not object since, when the balance sheets of the pension fund and the

 company are integrated, the net leverage after taxes is decreased. The

 only loser is the government. The paper also concluded that an equity—

 financed investment of debt in the pension fund would not produce economic

benefits. This strategy omits the tax deduction of interest charges

at the corporate level which produced the arbitraged returns in the

debt—financed strategy. Since the only difference between the two

funding strategies is the source of financing, the results have to be

attributable to an assumed economic benefit of leverage. Given recent

research in the area of corporate capital structure this is a questionable

assumption and any results based upon it must be reevaluated.

         The Tepper—Af fleck paper utilized the Modigliani—Miller (MM)

world with corporate taxes (but with no differential personal tax rates

on debt and equity returns). This is a troubling framework because, without the

introduction of bankruptcy costs or other imperfections, the firm should have all

debt and no equity in its capital structure. The case of equity

financing an investment in the pension fund would not even be a relevant

alternative. More importantly, the limitations of the NM framework as a

robust theory of capital structure have been widely recognized. Therefore, any

conclusions regarding corporate pension policy that are based upon it should

be suspect. As will been shown below, and contrary to the conclusions of

the Tepper—Af fleck results, when a more general framework is used, the source

of financing is not the important factor is assessing the desirability of

pension funding; equity is almost as good as debt.

        A second tax—related question has arisen. The Tepper and Af fleck

paper analyzed a pension fund investment in debt. Would the advantage to

funding still prevail if the pension fund were invested in equities? At
                                   —4—
 present equities account for approximately 50% of pension fund invest-

 ments and have ranged from a low of 19% in 1950 to a high of 74% in 1972.

As discussed above, in the MM framework the advantage to pension funding

was attritutable to the tax advantage of leverage.   Hence, this advantage
would exist regardless of what the pension fund was invested in. In

contrast, •in the more general framework used in this paper, tax advantages

exist only when the pension fund is invested in debt.

          Finally, the main result of the paper rested upon the assumption

 that the contribution to thepension fund was fully deductible at the time

 it was made. The paper did not consider in detail what the consequences

 of not taking an immediate deduction would be and, as it turns Out, this

 is an important practical case if a firm attempted to continually fund above

the level of tax—deductible contributions that is allowed by the Internal

Revenue Service.7 This question is dealt with in the Appendix.

           These issues will be elaborated on below. In Section II the
effects of the tax structure on the desirability of having pension

plans and on the funding and investment policies of such plans is discussed.

A setting is used in which pension fund earnings are exempt from corporate

taxation (this assumption is justified in the Appendix) and the personal

tax rate on equity returns is less than the personal tax rate on bond

returns. The Miller [6] case in which there is no tax advantage to corporate

leverage is thus encompassed. The major results of.the analysis are that

pension plans should be fully funded and invested totally in bonds as

opposed to equities (contrary to current. practice).8 These results

follow from the fact that the return on debt held in a corporate

pension fund is passed through the firm to the shareholder and is

 The paper showed in a simplified setting that it was still desirable to make
 excess contributions to the fund even if the deductions were not taken
 immediately.                                             -




8Fischer Black in [2] arrives at the same conclusions. His
                                                           analysis does
not rely on integration of shareholder and corporate investments, as does
mine. He derives the results at the corporate level.
                                        —5—


      taxed at the lower personal tax rate on equities; the shareholder will pay

      less taxes than if the debt were held in his personal portfolio. As a result

      the shareholder is better off if the pension funds of the corporations

     he invests in maximize their bond commitments through funding and investment

      policies and he minimizes them in his personal portfolio. The shareholder

      should directly invest in the equities he wishes to hold and the pension funds

     of the companies he invests in should not.




                The conclusions of this paper are based on the portfolio structure

     principles discussed above, not on leverage. Even when there is no tax

     advantage to debt the optimal both policy permits the investor to have the

     debt/equity exposure he desires and minimizes his taxes. As will be

     shown below, the tax benefits of funding that stem from taking maximum advantage

     of differential personal tax rates on debts and equities are larger than

     any tax benefit that is attributable to corporate leverage.

                Section III discusses the discrepancies between the prescriptions

     presented above and current practice. In general, it is found that while

     corporations do take advantage of the tax benefits by establishing qualified

     pension plans they do not maximize the benefits obtainable in establishing

     financial policies for the plan. Pension policy is guided mostly by

     considerations involving a breakdown (either real or perceived) in other

     aspects of the perfect markets/equal access assumptions.

                The Appendix contains a detailed analysis of eaéhof the two tax

•

     provisions that apply to corporate pension plans. Taken together, these provisions

     permit the firm to earn the pretax rate of return on its pension fund investments,

    i.e. they result in a complete exemption from taxes on income: this result

     is used throughout the paper.     Each provision by itself permits a deferral
    of taxes.      The deferrals amount to interest free loans from the government, and
                                    —6—


'the economic benefits that the company derives stem from its ability to earn

interest on these deferrals. It is shown that the sum total of the economic

benefits of these deferrals is a complete tax exemption for the pension fund

income, and that a fairly long time horizon is required before the economic

benefits become significant.


II. Tax—md :ed Effects on Corporate Pension Policy

         Corporate pension plans have two major tax provisions: (1) earnings

in thefund are not taxed, (2) contributions to the pension fund (subject

to maximum limitations) are deductible immediately. As shown in theAppendix

these provisions result in a complete exemption of earnings on the pension

fund from corporate taxes; i.e. the pension plan earns the pretax rate of

return. These tax provisions have implications for the full spectrum of

corporate pension policies; (1) funding, (2) investment, (3) benefit provisions.


         In this section each of these areas will be discussed. With the

exception of the tax treatment, a perfect market framework is employed in

which it is permissible to think of pension portfolios as an integral part

of the personal portfolios of the shareholders of the firm.9 With equal

access, investors can take positions that offset pension investments. In

the tax area,Miller's [6] world of different personal tax rates on equities

and bond returns is incorporated.


9mis analysis assumes that the firm is a going concern over the horizon of
 these contracts. It therefore ignores the risk elements introduced by the
 possibility of bankruptcy and/or plan termination (see Treynor, etal [11]).
 In general, funding the pension system worsens both the bondholders and
 the stockholders position, but while not treated in this paper, the tax
 benefits probably swamp these effects.
                                     —7—


            Funding and investment policy will be treated as interrelated

 financial decisions; the value of funding depends on whether the fund is

 invested in stocks or bonds. The results will be stated in terms of the

 economic gains to the shareholders as was done by Miller. In all cases

 treated,a fully hedged position will be created and   the   net returns to

 the shareholder, if any, will be risk—free. The economic gain will be

 these returns capitalized at the after—tax rate of return on personal

 debt holdings. This is equivalent to the approach used by Miller and to

his assumption that the streams are perpetuities. The latter requires

that the financial policies analyzed are put in place on a permanent basis.

 (More will be said about this in Section III.).

            The general principles underlying the analysis are that 1) the

return to shareholders of a debt investment in the pension fund is passed

through the corporation and is taxed at the personal tax rate on equities.

Hence, so long as the personal tax rate on equities is less than the

personal tax rate on debt, shareholders would prefer to have their bondholdings

in the corporate pension fund as opposed to being held in their personal

portfolios; 2) the choice of financing a pension fund investment hinges on

the familiar analysis of where shareholders prefer to borrow——at the corporate

level or at the personal level. As Miller has stated, with a low personal

tax rate on equities the decision depends upon a comparison of the corporate

tax rate with the personal tax rate on bonds. The case where there is no

tax advantage to corporate leverage is highlighted in the

follows.

           The conclusions that are reached from the analysis below are 1) the

pension plan should always be funded and debt should be the investment

vehicle, so long as personal tax rates on equities are less than that
                                   —8—


 on debt; 2) debt financing would always be Optimal; equity financing would

 be inferior only if there is a positive value to corporate leverage. If the

 clientele effect is operating there will be no optimal financing policy.

                Case 1: Debt investment; debt financed

          The debt investment in the pension fund does not necessitate an

 offsetting transaction in personal portfolios since it has been offset at the

 corporate level. The economic gain (see Table 1) depends upon the personal

 tax rates on debt and equity returns and the corporate tax rate. In equilibrium

they will all be interrelated. When they have values such that there is no

tax advantage to corporate leverage, the after—tax cost to the shareholder

of corporate debt {(l—T) (l—T3)] is equal to the after—tax return (cost)

of personal lending (borrowing) [1_Tb]. When this is true, the shareholder is

indifferent between the company issuing debt and he/she selling bonds or

taking out a loan to finance the investment in the pension fund. The value

of this strategy in this case is simply the value of having the corporation

invest the pension fund in bonds and passing the returns through to the shareholders

at the personal tax rate on equities. This value is identical to Case3 below.

                 Case 2: Equity investment; debt financed

          In this case,the equity investment in the pension fund increases

the shareholder's total equity holdings. The increase can be offset by re-

ducing equities held in his/her personal portfolio. There are no1:tax effects

since the return on equity is taxed at the personal tax rate whether equities

are held in the pension fund or in the investorTs portfolio. Equity investments

in the pension fund do nothing for the shareholder. The debt that is

taken on to finance this position must now be offset in personal portfolios.

Hence, this strategy would not have any value when there is no value to

corporate leverage.

          If   there is a tax—induced reason to increase corporate leverage

relative to equity it would be more efficient to do so with a capital

structure change as opposed to borrowing and putting the money in pension fund

equities. The latter would increase the exposure of the shareholders and

would require that the latter engage in unnecessary offsetting transactions.

                 Case 3: Debt investment; equity financed

          This strategy involves reducing the amount of investible funds in

shareholder portfolios. Since debt is being held in the pension fund the

shareholder would reduce his holdings of debt in order to maintain a constant

total portfolio structure (i.e. personal plus pension fund holdings). As in

Case I, this transaction has the effect of altering the taxation of the

returns on portfolio debt; the returns would now be taxed at the personal

tax rate on equities as opposed to the personal tax rate on debt. It

is only valuable to the shareholder when the personal tax rate on equity is

lower than that of debt. Its value is identical to the value in Case 1 when

there is no value to corporate leverage; i.e. the bond investment strategy

has a positive value independent of its financing (see footnote III to Table 1).

                 Case 4: Equity investment; equity financed

          The strategy simply involves substituting equities held on personal

account for equities held in the pension fund. As discussed in the discussion

of Case 2 there are no tax induced gains)°

     Benefit   Policy

                The tax considerations used above are helpful for assessing whether

     the firm should have a pension plan and/or a liberal policy with respect

     to granting pension benefits. A simplified model will be used in which

  the pension obligation is simply a deferred wage. This approach does

 not factor in any incentive effects that may exist with respect to certain

 benefit schemes —         e.g.   final average pay plans —   that   (especially) salaried

 workers often have.11 It lso does not consider the effects of the shifting

 of risks from the firm to the employee if a corporate—funded defined benefit

 plan is dropped in favor of an employee funded plan which is essentially a

 defined contribution plan. With these caveats in places the firm's benefits

 policy is determined by the decision regarding how much pension liability

 to issue.

                Following Sharpe [81, it will be assumed that employees are rational

 and are willing to make tradeoffs between current wages and deferred wages

 paid out as pensions so long as their economic position is not deteriorated.

 With the establishment of Individual Retirement Accounts (IRA's) in 1974

 as part of ERISA,employees of a firm that does not have a pension plan

 can set up their own and receive the same tax status as corporate pension

 plans —       i.e.   deferral of taxes on contributions and deferral of taxes on

 earnings in the retirement plan. Therefore, the employee will earn the same

 pre—tax rate of return the firm does and would use a pretax risk—free rate

 of return in establishing current/deferred wage tradeoffs.L The other side


     The existence of incentives has been questioned. In a rational economic
     model only the deferred wage aspect can be identified. See Sharpe [8].
12
     An equilibri risk/retu tradeoff is assumed to exist in the capital
     markets and, for simplicity, comparison of alternatives is made uniformly
     at the risk—free rate.

 of   this is that the risk—adjusted cost of funds raised by the firm via

 issuing pension liabilities is the pre—tax rate of return. Since the

 firm   earns   the pretax rate on pension assets the best it can do is to

stay even either by having a fully funded pension plan or by having

no plan at all and letting the employees establish IRA's.

                In this simple analysis certain factors have been omitted. For example,

 it has been implicitly assumed (as was done in the analysis of corporate

 plans) that no changes in the employee's tax rate takes place from the

 time contributions are made to the time they are withdrawn. If the tax rate

 at which contributions are made is higher than the tax rate applied to with-

drawals then the employee would be willing to accept a lower rate of return.

 It is almost certain that the tax rate will decline at the time the employee

 retires since retirement income does not usually equal income just prior to

retirement. However, the employee will be making contributions to the IRA

throughout his lifetime and it is not clear that, on balance, he/she will be

contributing at a higher rate than the rate that would apply during the with-

drawal period. In the earlier years of the career, real income and investible

wealth will be lower; for home owners their deductions will be higher. Add

to that the effects of-inflation on the individual's tax bracket and it is

not at all clear whether, on balance, the tax rate in the accumulation

period is higher or lower than the rate in the decummulation period. To

the extent that it is higher, the benefit of a pension plan will be diminished

but not eliminated.

            Another factor which might affect the employee's position is the

$1500 limit on contributions to the IRA. This limit would be reached for

high—salaried employees if the formulas determining the level of contribution
                                   —13—



 were based on reasonable replacement ratios for income in retirement. Congress

 is currently studying increases in I limits so that this may not be a factor

 In the near future.


          With these caveats in mind, unfunded pension liability is likely

 to be an expensive source of funds relative to debt if employees evaluate

 their opport"nities rationally. Pension plans are encouraged by the tax

 structure and employees can provide them for themselves o go to a company

 that does.

 III. Concluding Remarks

           Corporate pension policies in practice today diverge significantly

 from the prescriptions presented above. As the data at the beginning of

 this paper indicate, firms have raised a substantial amount of funds through

 the issuance of pension liabilities. Theydo not appear to maximize the fund-

 ing of their pension systems and they invest a substantial portion of the

 fund (currently about 50%) in equities. Some explanations of these phenomena

are presented below.

          Unfunded pension liabilities would be a costly source of funds

because competing firms would take advantage of the tax structure and

would provide fully funded plans. In the absence of competitors, the

employees could establish an IRA and take advantage of the tax provisions

thems&Ives. The IRA type of pension scheme came about as part of ERISA

in 1974, long after most firms established their plans and accumulated the

bulk of the existing liabilities. Prior to 1974 the tax situation was more

favorable to corporate pension schemes in that employees would have accepted

a lower rate of return between current wages and supplements a:.d deferred

pension benefits. The fact that the company bears the investment risk in
                                     — 14 —




defined   benefit plans, not the employees, would also be an important factor if

the choice was between a company plan and an IRA.

           While it is often said that firms minimize their pension outlays,

this is not true. The majority of firms use actuarial procedures that produce a

required pension contribution in excess of the minimum they could get away

with. Among the several actuarial cost methods that are acceptable, the one

that produces the lowest level of contributions is designed to fund benefits

as they accrue. Most firms elect one of the other, more liberal methods and

hence pre—fund benefit accruals. In addition to higher costs, this procedure

results in a buildup of a relatively permanent level of assets in the pension

fund in excess of what is needed to cover benefit accruals (see Trowbridge [121).

In addition, many firms use conservative actuarial assumptions and this has the

effect of further prefunding benefits.

           The result is that many firms do accelerate funding by the choice

of methods and assumptions over long time periods and this results in signifi-

cant tax—induced gains. However, considerations other than the tax structure

dominate this decision. The two most—often mentioned are benefit security

and cost stabilization. The actuarial profession has been the dominant force

in promoting these considerations and in developing the pension cost procedures

that produce preserves?! which make satisfaction of these goals possible. It

is true, however, that within the established actuarial framework, firms

typically minimize pension contributions. Changes in funding in this instance

would not be permanent and hence would not accumulate to the maximum possible

tax benefit (see Jackson [4]).

           A number of explanations exist as to why firms do not consider

the tax benefits to be a major factor. First, even though in the general equi1ibrium

analysis presented in this paper there will be an advantage to shareholders
                                    — 15 —




 even if corporate tax rates change,
                                     managers who focus on their own

 company's financial performance will be concerned about such a possibility.

 In general, falling corporate tax rates will be good and rising
                                                                 corporate
 tax rates will be bad. Inflation and other
                                                 social/economic effects will
 cause rates to rise but tax legislation can lead to reductions. It is

 not clear what corporate tax rates will be over the long run. Secondly,

 prefunding the pension system enhances the economic position of the

participants to the detriment of the suppliers of
                                                      capital, since the wealth
in the pension fund cannot be brought back into the firm. Thirdly, the

firm   may be resource—constrained; i.e. it may not be able to freely

raise the capital needed internally and also fund the pension plan. This

argument runs counter to the perfect markets
                                                 assumptions utilized above.
Fourthly, it is often argued that pension fund
                                                 investments have not kept'
pace with inflation and hence that it is poor investment. This argument fails

to consider the inflation—induced gains
                                          on the financing side of pension
fund investments. In the arbitraged scheme utilized in this
                                                            pape; gains
and losses due to inflation are
                                fully hedged. (For a further discussion
the points raised in this paragraph see {9] and [10].).

            Finally, the investment of pension fund assets in equities can only

be rationalized by appealing to violations of the perfect markets assumptions

ëtnployed herein and/or to the failure of management to consider and understand

the value of having bonds in the pension fund given the economic opportunities

of its shareholders. These problems are central to many issues in
                                                                  corporate
finance and are not dealt with herein.

                                 Appendix
           Taxes and Rates of Return on Pension Fund Investments


           The bulk of corporate pensions are qualified by the Internal

 Revenue Serivce to receive special tax treatment. Specifically, contribu-

 tions to the pension fund, subject to maximum limitations, are deductible

 at the time they are made and earnings on pension fund investments are

not taxed. When the maximum deductible limit is not constraining the

corporation earns the pension fund's pre—tax rate of return on the invest—

ment of its contributions. The return comes in the form of reduced pension

contributions in the future. The purpose of this appendix is to examine

each of the tax provisons.separately and to assess their relative importance.



          It is important to recognize that each of the two tax provisions

taken separately results in a deferral of taxes (but that together they

amount to a complete exemption of pension fund income from tax). All

contributions to the pension fund will eventually be deductible as a

business expense. If a deduction is taken when a contribution is made

then that deduction cannot be taken in the future. Hence, current taxes

are reduced and future taxes are increased.13 Similarly, not paying taxes

on pension fund earnings at the time they are earned will result in an

eventual tax payment on these earnings. At some point in the future,

contributions to the plan will be reduced by an amount equal to the accumula-

tion of untaxed income (assuming the plan's liabilities are unchanged).1-4

At that time taxable income will increase by this amount and hence taxes will

be paid. on it. These deferrals are interest free loans from the government and

the general rule is that the gain to the firm is equal to the after—tax

interest that accumulates on the deferral.
13This is analogous to tax shelter deals.
'4The funding patterns and the adjustments made to them as a result of altering
  contribution schedules and/or the accumulation of pension fund earnings are
  determined by the plan's actuarial cost methods.
                                              —17—
              In measuring the amount of the economic benefit of these deferrals

 a bond investment in the pension fund is assumed and the benchmark used will

 be that of a riskiess corporate investment where the firm pays taxes on

 returns in each period and, therefore, earns the after—tax rate of return.'5

The first situation considered is where the deferral of taxes on pension

 fund investment earnings is permitted but where deductions of contributions

cannot be taken when the contribution is made.16 The contributions will

accumulate in the pension fund at the (pretax) rate of return and at some

point in the future contributions will be reduced——and pretax profits

will increase——by this accumulated value. At that time the company will

receive a deduction for the contribution it initially made so that it would

only pay tax on the accumulated earnings in the fund. Using a simplified

framework, let,

              r the (pretax) rate of return in the pension fund; assumed to

                   be in bonds for comparison with a riskiess corporate investment.

                  E   the   year in which contributions are reduced by the pension

             Tc
                      corporate   tax rate.


 Then, for a dollar invested in the pension fund the firm           earns,   after—tax,

 (l+r)tt —                        over the period of n years. The value of the tax
              rc[(l+r)nl_lJ
 deferral of earnings is the difference between this amount and the amount that

 would have been accumulated if the dollar had been placed in an investment in

 which earnings were taxed year—by—year.

                      value of tax = (l+rf'—T {(l+r)n_l] —
                      deferral of earnings
                                             c                [l+r(1_T)]"            (1)


       arrangement is chosen so that the comparison can be made on a risk—free
  basis. There are a number of investment alternatives where the corporation
  can defer the taxes on at least some part of its returns. However these
  alternatives are rarely as riskiess as are bonds held in the pension fund.

16This is the relevant case for contributions made in excess of the maximum
  tax—deductible limit. It is important since actuarial procedures permitted
  by the IRS do significantly limit the amount that can be deducted in a given
  year. See Jackson [4].
                                      — 18 —




 The value of the tax deferral stems from the compounding of investment

 earnings at the pre—tax rate of return and then paying the tax only on

 the interest accumulated. The economic benefit is equal to the after—tax

 accumulated interest on the deferral of tax payments on interest earned.

 This is shown next.

           The tax deferral in period (t) is equal to the tax that would

have been paid on the return on the firm's investment in that period.

The firm's investment in that period is the amount that would have

accumulated had the firm been paying taxes on earnings up to that point.

The deferral will accumulate interest from period (t) to period (n) at

which t:fine taxes are paid on the accumulated interest. The after—tax

return on the sum of each period's deferral is given by



            E r r [l+r(l—T )]t_l     (l—r )   [(l+r)t_l]
                 tax deferral in t     after—tax return on the
                                            deferral in t

 which is equal to

            (l-t) [(l+r)n -   (l+r(l-T))J     + t[l— (l+r(l—T))]

 which is equal to equation (1).


          In the second situation, contributions can be deducted imriediately, in addi-

 tion toearnings not being taxed, Every dollar of thefirm's after•tax investment

in the pension fund is augmented by the deferred tax payment T/(l—T), so that

the pension fund has a total amount invested of l/(l—). This amount

accumulates at the pension fund rate of return over the a years at which time

the contribution is reduced. The full value of this accumulat:on is taxable

since the deduction for the contribution has already been taken. The firm earns,

after—tax, an amount equal to (l_Tc)(lIl_T) (l+r), so that with both
                                             —19—



tax deferrals operating the firm earns the pre—tax rate of return on the

pension fund.17 The value of the deductibility of contributions given by

equation 2 below can be established by subtracting from this accumulated

return on investment the return the firm would earn in the previous case

where only taxes on earnings are deferred.


           value of tax =      T
                                   c [(l+r)"—lJ                                      (2)

                 c




17Another way of saying this is that the return on the pension is equivalent
  to a return on corporate investments in which no taxes are paid. Therefore,
  only if the firm has riskless investment opportunities similar to bonds
  in the pension fund in which taxes on the returns are deferred for significant
  time periods so that it effectively earns close to the pre—tax rate, will
  the pension fund will not be as attractive a use of funds and the tax
  provisions will not be much of an incentive.

          Figure 1 shows the values of each of the two tax deferral provisions
 for a pension fund return of 10% and a corporate tax rate of 50%. It shows

 that when the deferral period is short the deferral due to the deduction

 of contributions dominates. The deferral of taxes on earnings is not

 important when an immediate deduction is not allowed because the accumulation

 of earnings is small relative to the principalinvested. Taken together

the two tax provions amount to an exemption of taxes independent of the

horizon. The tax on, earnings deferral begins to become significant when

 the deferral period approximates ten years. It increases the dollar

ieturn on the company's investment at the end of ten years by approximately

10% which is equivalent to an increase in the compound return from the

after—tax rate at 5% to approximately 6%. This effect is approximately 20%

of the total return enhancement that takes place when both tax deferral

provisions takes place. It takes approximately 50 years before the impact

of the two provisions are about equal.
