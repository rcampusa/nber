        What motivated men to risk death in the most horrific war in U.S. history when pay was low and
irregular and military punishment strategies were weak? In such a situation creating group loyalty by
promoting social capital is of paramount importance and in the Civil War was the cement of both armies.
We find that individual and company socio-economic and demographic characteristics, ideology, and
morale were important predictors of group loyalty in the Union Army. Company characteristics were
more important than ideology or morale. Soldiers in companies that were more homogeneous in ethnicity,
occupation, and age were less likely to shirk.

1       Introduction

The Civil War was the most horrific war in United States history. The total number of deaths in

the Civil War equaled the total number killed in almost all other wars combined and more than

one out of every five white men participating died, over half of them from disease (Vinovskis

1990). The combatants faced death, the hardships and monotony of camp life, and distance from

loved ones, all for low and irregular pay. One soldier wrote, “I have cursed the day I have enlisted

for what benifit [sic] will I ever drive from being a Soldier. the common Soldier will not reap the

Harvest of Victories but it is some other men that will gain all Praise Honor and Wealth.”1 Had

he deserted, he would have faced only a 40 percent chance of being caught and a negligible risk

of death if arrested (Linderman 1987: 174, 176). A self-interested soldier would have deserted.

But, over 90 percent of all Union Army soldiers did not (Linderman 1987) and among Union

Army soldiers whose three year enlistment terms were up, half of them re-enlisted (McPherson

1997: 81-82). What motivated these men to soldier on?

          This paper investigates the determinants of group loyalty, studying the relative impor-

tance of individual and community characteristics, of ideology, and of morale in determining

group loyalty among Union Army soldiers. Loyalty can be expressed through cowardice and

heroism. The measures of “cowardice” are desertion, arrests, and absences without leave. A

measure of “heroism” is promotion from private to officer, though not deserting could also be

regarded as heroism. This paper provides the first large-scale quantitative assessment of the

correlates of cowardice and heroism based upon soldiers’ deeds rather than their words. An

unusually rich dataset provides us with detailed demographic and economic characteristics of in-

dividuals, of companies, and of the geographical areas from which individuals came. We find that

individual and company socio-economic and demographic characteristics, ideology, and morale

were important predictors of group loyalty in the Union Army.

            Our analysis provides insights into firm organizational design. A distinguishing charac-

teristic between the military and the modern firm is the military’s inability (except for a mercenary

army) to fully compensate individuals for risk and to link pay to performance.2 In an organization

where workers have discretion and unobserved effort matters, altruism for others and the need for

others’ respect will mitigate the agency problem. Social capital is therefore an important input

into having a productive organization.3 O’Reilly, Caldwell, and Barnett (1989) find that in work

units where social integration is high, turnover is low. Social capital is also important for the

economy as a whole. La Porta et al. (1997) show that worldwide trust is associated with more

efficient judiciaries, less corruption, and higher quality government bureaucracies. Knack and

Keefer (1997) find that trust predicts economic growth and Guiso et al. (2000) find that it predicts

financial development.

            Studying the Union Army has many advantages over previous studies of shirking and

effort in organizations. One advantage is that the stakes are high. It is costly for a military company

if an individual shirks. It is also costly for soldiers to do their duty, thus allowing researchers

to obtain a better measure of commitment than firm turnover rates or questions on membership

in organizations, the measures commonly used in the social capital and organizational behavior

literature. Secondly, it is easier for team members to observe and for researchers to measure

shirking in the military than in a modern firm. Thirdly, the way companies were organized

provides us with an ideal study design. Our data contain a large number of companies (303),

     Although the armies of Frederick the Great feared their officers more than their enemies, this has never been
true in the United States.
    3
      Social capital is defined as aspects of the social structure such as trust, networks, and conventions that encourage
collaboration and coordination between friends and strangers (Coleman 1990).

but because each company consists of roughly 100 men, each is small enough so there can be

relatively little Tiebout sorting within the company. Because companies were built on a local

community basis, companies are heterogeneous whereas they would not be if there were random

assignment. However, each company is large enough so that there cannot be perfect Tiebout

sorting by groups of friends within companies. Finally, because the job of a soldier was unskilled,

largely consisting of learning the movement of linear formations, of obeying orders without

hesitation, and of mastering the 9 steps of loading a musket and firing in the direction of an

enemy hidden by the smoke of the battlefield (Hess 1997: 18-19, 137), worker skills are perfect

substitutes.



2       Demand and Supply of Organizational Loyalty

All organizations face potential agency problems. Solutions for mitigating such problems include

backloading pay, using promotions as an incentive, and paying bonuses to individuals (Lazear

1979: Gibbons 1998). But, Civil War soldiers who survived expected to be discharged from the

war-time military when their enlistment term was up, were lucky if their pay arrived on time,

and faced a higher risk of death on the battlefield if promoted because officers led the charges.

Military outcomes are produced in a team setting, in which one or more regiments win or lose

a battle. In such a case where only team output is observed and individual effort is not, a for

profit can use pay for performance incentives to induce the efficient level of individual effort

(Holmström 1982). Unlike such an organization, the military substitutes loyalty for high powered

incentives.4


    4
   Assuming that output is measuring in terms of battles won, the efficient contract would fine soldiers within a
company after they lost a battle (see Theorem 3 in Holmström (1982)), but this would lead to widespread desertion
when the expectation of victory was low.




                                                        3
           Why are soldiers loyal? Soldiers’ survival instincts should lead them to shirk, but

altruism for men in their companies, the desire for the respect of men in their companies and in

their communities, and belief in the cause will lead them to risk their lives on the battlefield.5

If men do not believe in the cause and do not care for the esteem of others (or fear their social

sanctions), it is rational to shirk. Concern with personal honor depends in turn upon men’s

socioeconomic and demographic characteristics and on the characteristics of the organization.

Because belief in the cause is less costly when one’s side is winning, morale will also determine

committment to a military organization. Based upon his reading of soldiers’ letters, McPherson

(1997) argued that Civil War soldiers were sustained by convictions of duty, honor, patriotism,

and ideology, impulses of courage and self-respect, and by fighting units’ group cohesion and

by peer pressure in their home communities. In reply to questionnaires, WWII enlisted soldiers

cited ending the task, solidarity with the group, thoughts of home and loved ones, and a sense of

duty and self-respect as the most important factors in movitating them to keep going (Stouffer et

al. 1949: 109). In contrast, Bearman (1991) argues that among men from North Carolina, local

homogeneity led to high desertion rates.



3     Empirical Framework

Our empirical framework can be thought of in terms of the following production functions:


                 loyalty    =    f (social capital; individual characteristics; ideology; morale)               (1)

          social capital    =    g (individual characteristics; community characteristics) :                    (2)


    5
      Writing of World War II soldiers, Marshall (1947: 150) observed, “Personal honor is the one thing valued more
than life itself by the majority of men.” McPherson (1997: 77) finds the phrase “death before dishonor” in Civil War
letters and diaries innumerable times.

Since we do not explicitly measure social capital, we substitute Equation 2 into Equation 1 and

model loyalty as a function of individual characteristics, community characteristics, ideology,

and morale. Table 1 lists the sets of variables determining group loyalty. We will examine the

relative impact of these four types of variables on group loyalty, measuring loyalty using days

until desertion, AWOL, arrests, and promotion to officer and examining days until one of these

events using a competing risks framework.

          Socio-economic and demographic characteristics of soldiers affect group loyalty be-

cause they shape soldiers’ ideology and affect their productivity within an organization. As

noted in Table 1, these characteristics include birth place, marital status, age, and social status

(as proxied by occupation, family wealth, and literacy). Birthplace and social status influence

ideas of patriotism, honor, and duty. Older soldiers may be more disciplined. Married men may

be either more or less motivated to fight by the thought of loved ones. Studies of American

soldiers in World War II found combat performance to correlate positively with social class and

education, age, and being married (Stouffer et al. 1949: 36-37). In the case of Civil War soldiers,


                                                5
the sense of duty and honor and the potential for public shame was probably greater among the

more socially prominent. Germans who fled the revolutions of 1848 may have been more likely

than Irish or British immigrants who migrated for economic reasons to view the United States

as the best hope for the survival of a form of republican government. Protestant Germans were

more likely to be Republican than the Irish because a large proportion of Republican voters were

anti-Catholic Know-Nothings (Fogel 1989: 384). Financial hardship at home led some married

men to desert, but this was probably truer of Confederate soldiers whose families faced food

shortages (McPherson 1997: 138). The importance of individual characteristics to individuals’

commitment to organizations is observed in civilian life as well. The modern military and the

human resource departments of corporations select individuals on the basis of their characteristics.

Ichino and Maggi (2000) find that region of birth, age, education, tenure, and promotion rate are

important predictors of worker absences and misconduct. Group loyalty requires interactions

with fellow workers or community members, but committment to interacting with others varies

by demographic group (Glaeser, Laibson, and Sacerdote 2000).

          Community characteristics influence group participation. Previous studies examined the

effect of community characteristics on public expenditures (Luttmer 2001; Poterba 1997; Alesina,

Baquir, and Easterly 1999; Goldin and Katz 1999) and on time allocation and organizational

membership (Alesina and La Ferrara 2000; Costa and Kahn 2001). In contrast, we examine

willingness to risk death. Our primary measure of a soldier’s community is the company he

was in. We examine the effect of such company characteristics as birth place fragmentation,

economic fragmentation (proxied by occupational fragmentation), age diversity, and the percent

of the company of own ethnicity and occupation on group loyalty. We also investigate the impact

of other definitions of community, including whether the soldier had a brother, father, or son

in the same company and population size of city of enlistment. Some studies (e.g. Watson

1978: 117) have argued that the most effective military squads are those that are psychologically


                                                 6
homogeneous. Within heterogeneous units team production may therefore be harder because

there is less social integration and less informal communication and because communication is

less frequent. Team production may also be harder because social sanctions are less effective.

The notion that intense loyalty, to the point of self-sacrifice, to a small band of comrades is

soldiers’ primary motivation for fighting became widespread among sociologists, psychologists,

and military historians after World War II (McPherson 1997: 86). Because soldiers live with

the same men for so long, endangering the group leads to personal guilt and ostracism within

the group. Some have argued that this group loyalty was also evident among Civil War soldiers,

where feelings of loyalty were compounded by community pressure since fellow soldiers from the

same hometown could and did report on others’ behavior (McPherson 1997: 77-89). Empirical

evidence examining individual interactions has found that the more similar are pairs of individuals,

the higher is trust (Glaeser, Laibson, Scheinkman, and Soutter 2000). Studies of firms have found

that heterogeneity in age, education, tenure, race, and sex is positively related to turnover, but

which of these heterogeneity measures is more important depends upon the organization studied.6

We cannot tell apriori whether such measures of community heterogeneity as fragmentation

indexes are better predictors of group loyalty than the percent of the company of own ethnicity or

occupation.

           Although we assume that social capital is a productive input into group loyalty, we realize

that there could be a “dark side” of social capital such that greater homogeneity contributes to

shirking and to favoritism. There is evidence that by sustaining local area loyalties, company

heterogeneity bred higher desertion rates (Bearman 1991).

           Ideological fervor bolsters loyalty and will therefore mitigate the agency problem.

Questionnaires administered to American volunteers in the Spanish Civil War found that ideology


   6
    See Pfeffer (1997: 83-85) for a review. Sørenson (2000) argues that it is not just current but also previously
experienced demographic heterogeneity within a firm that matters.


                                                        7
was the single most important factor helping men to overcome fear in battle (Dollard 1943: 55),

whereas among World War II soldiers it played only a small role (Stouffer et al. 1949: 109). During

the American Civil War, not just own ideology but also ideology of the soldiers’ hometown was

an important factor. Soldiers’ morale depended not just upon good news from the front, but also

upon their families’ and communities’ support. We measure ideology using year of enlistment,

volunteer status, and percent of the county voting for Lincoln. Men who enlisted after 1962

were commonly described as being without patriotism, honor, or interest in the cause (McPherson

1997: 9). The constituencies voting for Lincoln were diverse, consisting of anti-Catholics,

farmers, and land reformers, among others, opposed to slavery on both economic and moral

grounds (Fogel 1989: 369-387). Soldiers’ committment to the cause may have grown the longer

they served in the army. When Lincoln ran for re-election he received 78 percent of the soldier

vote compared to 53 percent of the civilian vote, despite some 40 to 45 percent of soldiers having

come from Democratic families in 1860 (McPherson 1997: 176). We can test whether soldiers’

committment increased by examining whether cowardice hazards decrease with time and whether

heroism hazards increase with time.

          Another important determinant of group loyalty is the morale of the troops. Morale

will depend upon support from the home front, leadership, and also upon the own unit’s and

the entire Army’s success on the battlefield. The ideologically committed men who served in

the Spanish Civil War cited defeats, retreats, and heavy casualties, ignorance of objectives and

lack of reliable news, and poor food, clothing, and shelter as the most common conditions in

which demoralizing rumors were likely to spring up (Dollard 1943: 53). Morale is a dynamic

variable. In 1865 desertion reached epidemic levels in the Confederate Army when it was clear

that the Confederacy could not win. In the Union Army, desertion reached a high point after

the removal of McClellan in November 1862, the defeats at Fredericksburg and at Chickasaw

Bluffs in December 1862, the rise of the peace Democrats at home, and the controversy over


                                                8
emancipation. Morale revived with victories at Gettysburg and at Vicksburg in July of 1863,

though continued gyrations were in store for the troops (McPherson 1997: 155-162).



4       The Union Army

On the eve of the Civil War, the regular army consisted of only 15,000 enlisted men.7 By the

end of the war over 2 million men had served in the Union Army, with four out of five men

born in the prime birth cohorts of 1837-1845 serving. From April 1861 to July 1862 the army

depended solely upon volunteers enlisting for low pay. In July 1862, the Militia Act assigned

quotas to each state to fill and these in turn assigned quotas to towns. When patriotic appeals

failed, states and towns began offering men bounties to induce them to enlist so that they could fill

their quotas. In March 1863 the Enrollment Act created a conscription system administered by the

federal government. Quotas were assigned to each congressional district and then broken down

into subdistricts within each district. When towns failed to meet their quotas, every able-bodied

male citizen between the ages of 20 and 45 became eligible for the draft, though married men

were less likely to be called. Draftees could hire a substitute to take their place or they could

pay a commutation fee of $300 (equal to the yearly wage of an average worker) to be exempt

from that particular draft, though not from another. Draftees and substitutes were relatively rare,

constituting no more than 10 percent of all soldiers. Paying a commutation fee was also rare.

Only 87,000 men became exempt in this way.

           States and individuals played a large role in the formation of regiments of volunteers,

the basic units of the armies. The volunteer infantry regiments consisted of 10 companies, each


    7
     See Hattaway (1997), Gould (1869), and U.S. Provost Marshall General (1866) for a detailed discussion of the
organization of the Civil War Armies and Linderman (1987), Kemp (1990), Mitchell (1990), and McPherson (1997)
for discussions of soldiers and their communities.




                                                       9
containing roughtly 100 men, commanded by a captain and two lieutenants, often volunteer

officers drawn from state militias, men of political significance, or assorted prominent men in the

community. Professional officers were not necessarily more skilled in military matters because

the West Point curriculum emphasized engineering rather than military tactics. Regiments were

typically formed from men who came from the same area. Each company would generally contain

bands of men who had known each other in civilian life.8 Mitchell (1990) argues that this way of

recruiting was not accidental. The voluntary organization of small communities into a national

army, the amalgation of civic pride and national patriotism, was how the volunteers imagined

the Union should function. Because of the strong loyalties men felt toward their companies, a

company was not replenished with new men when disease, military casualties, and expirations of

enlistment terms whittled down a company’s numbers. If a company’s numbers were sufficiently

reduced, the company disappeared and the men who continued to fight would transfer to another

company.

           Soldiers reported home on the cowardice, courage, and moral behavior of their com-

rades, thus bringing home peer pressure to bear on men’s behavior. Companies maintained

constant contact with their home communities through local newspapers and letters that never

had to pass a censor’s desk, arriving with the same speed as mail today unless soldiers were in the

deep South. Companies could also increase social integration among like-minded individuals.

Soldiers formed debate societies and organizations of Christian associations.

           The Union Army was not held together by discipline. Citizens visited their friends in

camp at all hours of the day. Except for some camp drills, most men and company commanders

learned on the job. When officers were men soldiers had known all their lives, the men had


   8
     Finding a company that was a good match could be a matter of luck. One soldier wrote home, “We have a
remarkable civil and Religious company ... i think it is a providencial circumstance that I enlisted in this company
for I hear that there is desperate wickedness in very regiments i came so near enlisting in.” (Letter of David Close,
November 4, 1862, 126th Ohio Volunteer Infantry, Company D, http://www.iwaynet.edu/ lsci/


                                                        10
trouble thinking of officers as their superiors and were slow to or refused to follow orders. The

officers who commanded respect were those concerned for the welfare of their men and those

who demonstrated personal courage and a willingness to do themselves what they asked of their

men. Those who commanded contempt resigned their commissions, driven out by the ill-will of

their men.

               The Army’s coercive powers were limited. As the war progressed, the Army designated

units of provost guards to drive stragglers (men who milled at the rear) into line. However,

because they were reluctant to shoot soldiers wearing the same uniform, they were not always

effective. Similarly, executions for such serious penalties as desertion were relatively rare. Out of

roughly 200,000 deserters, 80,000 were caught and returned to the army and 147 were executed

for desertion (Linderman 1987: 174, 176). Executions were loathsome both to soldiers and to

civilians. Instead the penalties for desertion, and also AWOL, generally ranged from fines and

loss of pay to imprisonment (including with hard labor) to performance of the more onerous duties

in the company to the social sanctions of men’s home communities.



5         Data

Our data consist of 31,854 white, enlisted men in 303 Union Army infantry companies.9 The

sample represents roughly 1.3 percent of all whites mustered into the Union Army and 8 percent

of all regiments that comprised the Union Army. The data are based upon a random sample of 331

companies drawn at the company level.10 Ninety-one percent of the sample consists of volunteers,

         The data were collected by Robert Fogel and are available from http://www.cpe.uchicago.edu.
    10
     Our sample is limited to 303 companies because complete data have not yet been collected on all 331 companies.
Among the original 331 companies, New England is under-represented and the Midwest over-represented relative to
the army as a whole. The companies that have not yet been collected are from Indiana and Wisconsin, states that
were unusually committed to the Union cause.

with the remainder evenly divided between draftees and substitutes. In terms of real estate and

personal property wealth, the sample is representative of the 1860 age-adjusted population (Fogel

2001). The primary data source consists of men’s military service records. These records

provide such basic information as year of muster, age, birthplace, and height in inches, and also

information on what happened to the soldier during his military service. Desertions, arrests, and

AWOLs were handled by military courts convened in the field. Men were linked to the manuscript

schedules of the 1860 census which provides information on the value of personal property for

all individuals in the household and on illiteracy and allows us to infer marital status. (Linkage

details are provided in the Appendix.) We merged data on population in city of enlistment and

voting in the 1860 presidential election (see the Appendix for sources). We include region fixed

effects for New England, Middle Atlantic, East North Central, West North Central, Border, and

West.

          Table 2 illustrates the wide variation in shirking and mortality rates by state. Shirking

was high in the border states of Kentucky and Maryland. Of particular note are the high promotion

rates in Wisconsin and Iowa.

          We constructed variables describing recruits’ individual characteristics, the characteris-

tics of their communities, their ideological fervor, and their morale (see the Appendix for details).

Our individual variables consist of occupational class, country of birth, age, height in inches (a

measure of productivity), the soldier’s marital status in 1860, total personal property wealth in the

soldier’s 1860 household, and whether the soldier was illiterate. Our community variables consist

of company birthplace fragmentation, company occupational fragmentation, the coefficient of

variation for age for the company, and the size of the town the recruit enlisted in. Soldiers from

large cities who shirked were more likely to be able return to their home towns without facing

social sanctions from the whole town. We also created community variables for the percent of

the company of a given ethnicity or occupation and for whether the recruit had a brother in the

company. Our ideology variables consist of the year the soldier was mustered in, his volunteer

status, and the percent of all votes in the soldier’s county of enlistment for Lincoln (a measure

of the soldier’s own and the community’s ideology). Our measures of morale are both company

specific and for the Army as a whole and consist of the fraction of the company who died for

each half year that the soldier was in the company and the fraction of Union victories to all

major battles for each half year that the soldier was in the service. Both of these variables are

time-varying covariates. Note that the fraction of Union victories to major battles does not vary

across companies and only varies across individuals who were mustered in at different dates. We

do not treat the other company variables as time-varying covariates because there was very little

change in company characteristics from the start to the end of their service. Note that we cannot

include company leader characteristics as a variable because we know leader characteristics only

for internal promotions.

          Table 3 lists all variables used in the regression tables and shows that the sample

means for those who deserted, were arrested, were AWOL, and were promoted to officer differ

substantially from those for the entire sample. To simplify the tables we do not include as

covariates the fraction of the company that is of soldier’s own ethnicity or occupation or whether

the soldier had a brother in the company; instead, we describe the results in the text. Among

shirkers, the individual level variables that differ are occupation, birth place, and household wealth.

The community level variables that differ are company birth place fragmentation, occupational

fragmentation, and coefficient of variation for age, and population size in city of enlistment. The

ideology variables that differ are year of muster, volunteer status, and the percent of votes cast for

Lincoln. Shirking also occurs when the company death rate is high and when Army-wide morale

is low. Those promoted to officer were native-born professionals and proprietors who volunteered

in 1861 and who were from high mortality companies.

6    Econometric Framework

Our measures of cowardice and heroism are desertion, arrest, AWOL, and promotion to officer.

Desertion is the best measure of shirking. Arrests and promotions depend upon officer decisions.

Desertion is a more serious offense than AWOL and, because 10 percent of the sample deserted, it

also is the measure with the largest number of outcomes. Absences without leave were generally

failing to return from furlough on time and straggling from the company. Arrests that were not

for desertions or AWOL were for drunkenness, assault, robbery, insubordination, and sleeping

while on picket duty.

         Our empirical strategy uses a time-varying competing risk hazard model to estimate

days from entry into the company (muster-in) until desertion, arrest, AWOL, or promotion to

officer. We use a competing risk framework because some men may have died, been discharged,

changed company, become prisoners of war, or be missing in action before they could desert.

Similarly, some men may have died, been discharged, changed company, become prisoners of

war, be missing in action, or have deserted before arrest, AWOL, or promotion to officer (see

Figure 1). Hazard models provide a framework to estimate the micro and macro determinants of

cowardice and heroism. Our estimated hazard, (t), is


                    (t) = exp(x0I I + x0C C + x0D D + x0M M )0 (t)                        (3)


where I indexes the individual variables, C indexes the community variables, D indexes the

ideology variables, M indexes the morale variables and O (t) is the baseline hazard which we

assume to be Weibull. The survival function thus takes the form, exp((;j tj )p) for subject j,

where p is the duration dependence parameter and can be interpreted as representing whether men

who were in the war longer became more or less committed soldiers. We present results both

with and without the morale variable. The hazard ratios that we report indicate whether a one


                                              16
Figure 1: Schematic of Events Studied




                 17
unit change in an independent variable gives an increase/decrease in the odds of an event. Thus

a hazard ratio of 1.3 on our Irish-born dummy variable indicates that the Irish were 1.3 times as

likely as the native-born to desert. We account for unobserved company-level correlation by using

variance correction models (Lee, Wei, and Amato 1992; Cai, Wei, and Wilcox 2000). Clustering

on companies provides us with a lower bound on the standard error of company characteristics.11



7        Results

Our results show that individual characteristics, community characteristics, ideology, and morale

were all important predictors of cowardice and heroism. However, the relative importance of

these variables depends upon whether we examine desertions, arrests, AWOLs, or promotions to

officer (see Tables 4, 5, 6, and 7).

           Consider first individual characteristics. In the case of desertion, arguably our best

measure of shirking, men who were farmers, who were older, who came from a household with

high property wealth in 1860, and who were literate were less likely to desert.12 Relative to

the native-born the Irish and British were more likely to desert. They were also twice as likely

to be arrested as the native-born. Married men were significantly more likely to desert, but

the interaction term on married and personal property wealth was insignificant, suggesting that

financial hardship at home did not necessarily lead to disproportionate desertions among married


    11
     We estimate contextual interactions, wherein a soldier’s behavior varies with such exogenous characteristics of
the group as ethnic diversity. We also account for correlated effects at the company level arising from such factors
as men’s trust and opinion of the captain and lieutenants commanding the company and variation in punishments
for desertion or AWOL by company. We do not attempt to identify endogenous interactions, wherein the soldier’s
behavior varies with the behavior of the group because while we observe individuals if they move out of a company,
very few did and for those who did we cannot observe the characteristics of the company they move into. See Manski
(2000) and (1993) for a discussion of endogenous interactions, contextual effects, and correlated effects.
    12
    If all men in the sample had come from the wealthiest household (one in which the logarithm of personal property
wealth was 10.8), the average predicted probability of desertion would have been 0.056 instead of 0.094.

men. Married men were more likely to be AWOL (but not significantly so), probably because

furloughs were generally granted only to married men thus providing them with an opportunity

to go AWOL. The most important individual characteristics predicting promotion to officer were

social status, birth place, and height. Professionals or proprietors and artisans were more likely to

be promoted than farmers or laborers. Men born abroad were less likely to be promoted than the

native-born and the tall were more likely to be promoted. Whether a soldier was owed a bounty

(as was true for many volunteers after 1862), decreased desertion rates (not shown), but the effect

was not statistically significant.13

           Community characteristics were also important predictors of cowardice and of heroism.

Men who came from companies in which birth place, occupation, and age heterogeneity was

high were all more likely desert. Although birth place fragmentation was not a statistically

significant predictor of desertion when we clustered on companies, it became a statistically

significant predictor when we dropped occupational fragmentation from the regression. Men

in companies in which birth place and occupational diversity was high were significantly more

likely to be arrested. The only company socioeconomic and demographic characteristic that

significantly predicted AWOL was birth place diversity. Note that although high birth place

diversity is a positive, but insignificant predictor of promotion once we cluster on companies, it

becomes a negative predictor of promotion once we add dummies for Iowa and Wisconsin, the

two states with unusually high promotion rates. When we included the company Gini coefficient

for both personal and property wealth calculated from the 1860 census, we found that while men

in companies where inequality was high were more likely to desert, the effect was statistically

insignificant. Men who enlisted in large cities were more likely to desert (perhaps because they


  13
     God was not necessarily a better motivator than mammon. The higher the ratio of church seats to county of
enlistment population, the higher the desertion rate. However, this ratio is probably a proxy for urbanization. We
could find no clear pattern by type of religion.



                                                       23
faced fewer community sanctions and because they were less likely to know the men in their

company).

          We have a unique opportunity to study peer groups for brothers, fathers, and sons among

men linked to the 1860 census. These men might either be more likely to shirk because collusion

is easier or be less likely to shirk because of loyalty. We find that having close kin in the same

company increased the probability of desertion, but the coefficient was not statistically significant.

It decreased significantly decreased the odds of going AWOL and did not affect arrests.

          As previously noted, we have not attempted to identify endogeneous interactions. How-

ever, because of the non-linearity of our estimation equation, the endogeneous interaction can be

estimated off of the functional form (Manksi 1993, 2000; Brock and Durlauf 2001). We there-

fore included a time-varying measure of the fraction in the company deserting in our desertion

specification as a robustness check. We found that this measure significantly increased desertion

rates, but that the company death rate became an insignificant predictor of desertion and that the

significance of the coefficient on the proportion of Union victories fell from 1 to 10 percent. All

other coefficients were unaffected.

          We find no evidence of a true “dark” side of social capital, but we do find some evidence

of ethnic favoritism. We did not find that company characteristics predicted battlefield mortality

among men, suggesting that more homogeneous companies were not successful in colluding to

straggle away from the front lines. We investigated whether there was any interaction between

own ethnicity and that of a company officer for the limited set of companies for which we know

something about the officers because they rose from the ranks. In the case of AWOL, the Irish

were significantly more likely to be AWOL if the company had an Irish officer, but we could not

determine if punishments for AWOL were lower in these companies. However, both the Irish and

the British were more likely to be arrested if the company contained an Irish or British officer

and the British were significantly less likely to desert if the contained a British officer. We also


                                                 24
investigated whether the interactions between own occupation and the proportion of men in the

company in that occupation and own birth place and the proportion of men of that ethnicity were

at all significant. The Irish were less likely to be arrested if the proportion of Irish in the company

was high. Soldiers were more likely to desert if the at least 50 percent of the company was Irish,

but the Irish were significantly less likely to desert if at least 50 percent of the company was Irish.

Artisans were less likely to desert or to be arrested if the proportion of artisans in the company

was high. However, laborers were more likely to desert and to be arrested if the proportion of

laborers in the company was high.

          Ideology predicted desertion, arrest, and AWOL, but not promotion to officer. Men

who enlisted in 1861 were less likely to desert or to be arrested. Surprisingly, soldiers mustered

in 1862 and 1863 were less likely to be AWOL than soldiers mustered in 1861 and men mustered

in 1865 were more likely to be promoted than men mustered in 1861. However, men mustered in

1861 were more likely to be promoted than men mustered in 1862-1864. Men who volunteered

and men from pro-Lincoln counties were less likely to desert or to be AWOL. We find mixed

evidence that soldiers became more committed to the cause the longer they remained in the army.

Although desertion hazards decrease with time, arrest and AWOL hazards increase with time and

promotion hazards decrease with time.

          Lastly, morale was a predictor of all of our measures of cowardice and of heroism. Men

were more likely to desert when company mortality was high and when the Union was losing.

Arrest rates were higher when the Union was losing. A high company mortality rate significantly

reduced time until AWOL. When the Union was winning time until promotion to officer was

shorter perhaps because enlisted men exerted extra effort and therefore were more likely to be

promoted.

          We experimented with different outcome variables. We investigated what predicted

re-enlistment for another 3 year term among men who enlisted in 1861 and who had already


                                                  25
served a 3 year term. Approximately half of re-enlistees in the sample received a bounty upon

re-enlistment. Generally men re-enlisted as regiments or companies (Hess 1997: 89). Older men,

men from large cities, and Germans were less likely to re-enlist and men who received a bounty

for re-enlisting were more likely to re-enlist, but these were the only characteristics that predicted

re-enlistment.14 We also combined desertion, arrest, and AWOL as one outcome measure of

“cowardice,” finding that birth place and occupational fragmentation, age diversity, enlisting in

a large city, enlisting at a late date, a small pro-Lincoln vote, a high company death rate, a low

fraction of Union victories, and being a non-farmer, Irish, or British rather than native-born,

younger, poorer, and illiterate all led to higher cowardice rates.

             We performed further robustness tests by experimenting with state fixed effects for

all regressions. When we combined desertion, arrest, and AWOL as one outcome measure of

“cowardice,” we found that difficulties we faced is that when the number of companies within a

state was small correlation between birth place and occupational fragmentation was high. In the

case of promotion to officer, AWOL, and arrest, the coefficients on company socioeconomic and

demographic characteristics, the percentage of the county voting for Lincoln, and the company

death rate remained unchanged. For desertion, both birth place and occupational fragmentation

were statistically significant predictors of desertion, but the proportion of the county voting for

Lincoln (a measure that varies more across states than within states) became an insignificant

predictor.

      There was no dishonor in not re-enlisting. Newton Scott, a private in the 36th Iowa Infantry, Company A, wrote
to Hannah Cone, “I think it the Duty of Every Able Bodied man If Necessary to Help Defend His country But I think
3 years Sufficient long for one man to Serve while they all take there [sic] turns...” http://www.civilwarletters.com

Desertion, AWOL, and arrest probabilities are predicted from the third specifications in Tables 4, 5, and 6, respectively.
Promotion to officer is predicted from the fourth specification in Table 7. In this sample, the largest share of the vote
Lincoln received in a county was 86.6%. Cities with a population of less than 2500 were not even listed in the census
and are therefore considered small towns.



8     Implications for Organizational Design

What do our results imply about designing a well functioning military organization? Table 8

shows the relative importance of community socioeconomic and demographic characteristics,

morale, and ideology for the predicted probability of desertion, arrest, AWOL, and promotion to

officer. (This table also provides a good indication of the magnitude of the coefficients on our

variables.) In the case of desertion the single most important variables were age and occupational

diversity within the company. In the case of arrests, birth place and occupational fragmentation,


                                                          27
the fraction of Union victories, the percentage of the county voting for Lincoln, and year of muster

were the single most important predictors. Birth place diversity, age diversity and the fraction

of the county voting for Lincoln were the most important predictors of AWOL. The single most

important predictors of promotion to officer were age diversity and the fraction of Union victories.

On the whole company socioeconomic and demographic characteristics were the most important

predictors of desertion, arrest, AWOL, and promotion to officer. Morale was relatively more

important than ideology for promotion to officer and ideology was relatively more important than

morale for desertion, arrest, and AWOL.

          Why does the Army today not make greater use of social capital by creating socio-

economic and demographically homogeneous fighting units? Two reasons include diversification

and human capital specialization in the modern army. Drawing companies on the local level

ended after highly-publicized losses to communities during World War II. In the modern army,

soldiers perform a myriad of tasks requiring different training. Because their skills are not perfect

substitutes, the modern army is more likely to face a bundling problem which inhibits it from

achieving the high level of social capital that the “old” army could achieve.



9    Conclusion

What motivates loyalty to an organization? Is it the attributes of a person, the socio-economic and

demographic characteristics of the organization, the attributes of the organization’s leader, belief

in the organization’s mission, or self-interest? Recent studies have argued that sacrifice among

Ultra-Orthodox Jews provides them with self-insurance benefits (Berman 2000) and that loyalty

to street gangs can provide future riches (Levitt and Venkatesh 2000). Iannaccone (1992) argues

that efficient religions may benefit from self-sacrifice because of free rider problems. In contrast,

loyal Union Army soldiers gained little monetary compensation, only the knowledge that they


                                                 28
could hold their heads high among their comrades and in their home towns (McPherson 1997:

77-84). In such an organization creating group loyalty is of paramount importance. Group loyalty

in the Civil War was the “cement of the armies,” allowing both the Union and the Confederacy

to mount comprehensive military efforts even though indiscipline was chronic, military training

scant, and the system of military justice weak (Linderman 1987: 35-36).

          How was this group loyalty created? Individual socio-economic and demographic char-

acteristics, company socio-economic and demographic characteristics, ideological committment,

and morale were all important determinants of group loyalty among Union Army soldiers in the

Civil War. Company socio-economic and demographic characteristics were particulary impor-

tant, even more so than ideological committment and morale. However, while homogeneous

companies were more successful in accomplishing the short-run goal of fielding full companies,

we cannot ascertain whether there were any long-run benefits of being in a heterogenous company

to individual soldiers.



Data Appendix

This appendix describes the construction of our demographic and socio-economic variables, our

community variables, our ideology variables, and our morale variables. All data on Union Army

recruits are obtained from Aging of Veterans of the Union Army, Robert W. Fogel, Principal

Investigator, http://www.cpe.uchicago.edu.

Socio-economic and Demographic Characteristics



   1. Dependent variable. We calculated days from muster until desertion, arrest, AWOL, or
      promotion to officer. We allowed for censoring by also calculating days from muster until
      death, discharge, changing company, becoming prisoner of war, or missing in action.
   2. Occupation. Dummy variables indicating whether at enlistment the recruit reported his
      occupation as farmer, artisan, professional or proprietor, or laborer. Farmers’ sons who

                                              29
     were not yet farmers in their own right would generally report themselves as farmers.

  3. Birth place Dummy variables indicating whether at enlistment the recruit reported his birth
     place as the US, Germany, Ireland, Great Britain, or other.

  4. Age at enlistment. Age at first enlistment.

  5. Height in inches. Height in inches at first enlistment.

  6. Married in 1860. This variable is inferred from family member order and age in the 1860
     census. This variable was set equal to 0 if the recruit was not linked to the 1860 census.

  7. Log(total household personal property) in 1860. This variable is the sum of personal
     property wealth of everyone in the recruits’ 1860 household. This variable is set equal to 0
     is the recruit was not linked to the 1860 census.

  8. Missing census information. A dummy equal to one if the recruit was not linked to the
     1860 census. Linkage rates from the military service records to the 1860 census were 57
     percent. The main characteristic that predicted linkage failure was foreign birth.

  9. Illiterate. This variable is from the 1860 census and provides illiteracy information only
     for those age 20 and older.

 10. Missing illiteracy information. A dummy equal to one if we do not know whether the
     recruits was illiterate, either because he was not linked to the 1860 census or because he
     was less than age 20 in 1860.

 11. Region effects. Our region dummies are New England, Middle Atlantic, East North
     Central, West North Central, Border, and West.


Community Characteristics



  1. Birth place fragmentation. We calculated, by company, the fraction of individuals born in
     the US in New England, in the Middle Atlantic, in the East North Central, in the West North
     Central, the Border states, the south, and the west and born abroad in Germany, Ireland,
     Canada, Great Britain, Scandinavia, northwestern Europe (France, Belgium, Luxembourg,
     the Netherlands), other areas of Europe, and other areas of the world. Our birthplace
     fragmentation index, fi , is then

                                        fi = 1 ;
                                                   X ski ;
                                                       2

                                                   k
     where k represents the categories and where ski is the share of men of born in place k in
     company i.

                                              30
  2. Occupational fragmentation. We calculated, by company, the fraction of individuals
     who were farmers, higher class professionals and proprietors, lower class professionals and
     proprietors, artisans, higher class laborers, lower class laborers, and unknown. Our occu-
     pational fragmentation index is then calculated similarly to our birthplace fragmentation
     index.
  3. Coefficient of variation for age. We calculated, by company, the coefficient of variation
     for age at enlistment.
  4. Population in city of enlistment. We obtained population in city of enlistment from Union
     Army Recruits in White Regiments in the United States, 1861-1865 (ICPSR 9425), Robert
     W. Fogel, Stanley L. Engerman, Clayne Pope, and Larry Wimmer, Principal Investigators.
     Cities that could not be identified were assumed to be cities of population less than 2,500.

Ideology Variables


  1. Year of muster. Dummy variables indicating the year that the soldier was first mustered
     in.
  2. Volunteer. A dummy equal to one if the recruit was a volunteer instead of a draftee or a
     substitute.
  3. Percent of vote in 1860 Presidential election. We obtained by county of enlistment
     the fraction of the vote case for Lincoln and for other candidates from Electoral Data
     for Counties in the United States: Presidential and Congressional Races, 1840-1972
     (ICPSR 8611), Jerome M. Clubb, William H. Flanigan, and Nancy H. Zingale, Principal
     Investigators. Because we cannot attribute a county to each recruit, our categories are
     percent in county of enlistment voting for Lincoln, other candidate, and unknown.

Morale Variables


  1. Fraction in company dying. We calculated, by company, the fraction dying overall and the
     fraction dying (among all men at risk to die) within all half years that each recruit served.
     Our means present the fraction dying overall. Our regression results use the time-varying
     covariate, fraction of men at risk dying during all half years that each recruit served.
  2. Fraction of major Union victories. This is a time-varying variable that indicates for each
     half year that the recruit was in the service the fraction of major Union victories to all major
     battles in that half-year. It takes the value 0 if there were no major battles.
