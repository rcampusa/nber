                                             ABSTRACT

Notwithstanding its impressive contributions to empirical financial economics, there remains a significant
gap in the volatility literature, namely its relative neglect of the connection between macroeconomic
fundamentals and asset return volatility. We progress by analyzing a broad international cross section
of stock markets covering approximately forty countries. We find a clear link between macroeconomic
fundamentals and stock market volatilities, with volatile fundamentals translating into volatile stock
markets.

1. Introduction

       The financial econometrics literature has been strikingly successful at measuring,

modeling, and forecasting time-varying return volatility, contributing to improved asset pricing,

portfolio management, and risk management, as surveyed for example in Andersen, Bollerslev,

Christoffersen and Diebold (2006a, 2006b). Much of the financial econometrics of volatility is

of course due to Rob Engle, starting with the classic contribution of Engle (1982).

       Interestingly, the subsequent financial econometric volatility, although massive, is

largely silent on the links between asset return volatility and its underlying determinants.

Instead, one typically proceeds in reduced-form fashion, modeling and forecasting volatility but

not modeling or forecasting the effects of fundamental macroeconomic developments.1 In

particular, the links between asset market volatility and fundamental volatility remain largely

unstudied; effectively, asset market volatility is modeled in isolation of fundamental volatility.2

       Ironically, although fundamental volatility at business cycle frequencies has been studied

recently, as for example in Ramey and Ramey (1995) and several of the papers collected in Pinto

and Aizenman (2005), that literature is largely macroeconomic, focusing primarily on the link

between fundamental volatility and subsequent real growth.3 Hence the links between

fundamental volatility and asset market volatility again remain largely unstudied; fundamental

volatility is modeled in isolation of asset market volatility.

            1
             The strongly positive volatility-volume correlation has received attention, as in Clark (1973),
   Tauchen (1983), and many others, but that begs the question of what drives volume, which again remains
   largely unanswered.
            2
               By “fundamental volatility,” we mean the volatility of underlying real economic fundamentals.
   From the vantage point of a single equity, this would typically correspond to the volatility of real earnings
   or dividends. From the vantage point of the entire stock market, it would typically correspond to the
   volatility of real GDP or consumption.
            3
             Another strand of macroeconomic literature, including for example Levine (1997), focuses on the
   link between fundamental volatility and financial market development. Hence, although related, it too
   misses the mark for our purposes.
       Here we focus on stock market volatility. The general failure to link macroeconomic

fundamentals to asset return volatility certainly holds true for the case of stock returns. There

are few studies attempting to link underlying macroeconomic fundamentals to stock return

volatility, and the studies that do exist have been largely unsuccessful. For example, in a classic

and well-known contribution using monthly data from 1857 to 1987, Schwert (1989) attempts to

link stock market volatility to real and nominal macroeconomic volatility, economic activity,

financial leverage, and stock trading activity. He finds very little. Similarly and more recently,

using sophisticated regime-switching econometric methods for linking return volatility and

fundamental volatility, Calvet, Fisher and Thompson (2003) also find very little. The only

robust finding seems to be that the stage of the business cycle affects stock market volatility; in

particular, stock market volatility is higher in recessions, as found by Officer (1973) and echoed

in Schwert (1989) and Hamilton and Lin (1996), among others.

       In this paper we provide an empirical investigation of the links between fundamental

volatility and stock market volatility. Our exploration is motivated by financial economic

theory, which suggests that the volatility of real activity should be related to stock market

volatility, as in Shiller (1981) and Hansen and Jagannathan (1991).4 In addition, and crucially,

our empirical approach exploits cross-sectional variation in fundamental and stock market

volatilities to uncover links that would likely be lost in a pure time series analysis.

       Our paper is part of a nascent literature that explores the links between macroeconomic

fundamentals and stock market volatility. Engle and Rangel (2005) is a prominent example.

Engle and Rangel propose a spline-GARCH model to isolate low-frequency volatility, and they

            4
             Hansen and Jagannathan provide an inequality between the “Sharpe ratios” for the equity market
   and the real fundamental and hence implicitly link equity volatility and fundamental volatility, other things
   equal.

                                                        -2-
use the model to explore the links between macroeconomic fundamentals and low-frequency

volatility.5 Engle, Ghysels and Sohn (2006) is another interesting example, blending the spline-

GARCH approach with the mixed data sampling (MIDAS) approach of Ghysels, Santa-Clara,

and Valkanov (2005). The above-mentioned Engle et al. macro-volatility literature, however,

focuses primarily on dynamics, whereas in this paper we focus primarily on the cross section, as

we now describe.

2. Data

       Our goal is to elucidate the relationship, if any, between real fundamental volatility and

real stock market volatility in a broad cross section of countries. To do so, we ask whether time-

averaged fundamental volatility appears linked to time-averaged stock market volatility. We

now describe our data construction methods in some detail; a more detailed description, along

with a complete catalog of the underlying data and sources, appears in the Appendix.

Fundamental and Stock Market Volatilities

       First consider the measurement of fundamental volatility. We use data on real GDP and

real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) for many countries. The major source for both

variables is the World Development Indicators (WDI) of the World Bank.

       We measure fundamental volatility in two ways. First, we calculate it as the standard

deviation of GDP (or consumption) growth, which is a measure of unconditional fundamental

volatility. Alternatively, following Schwert (1989), we use residuals from an AR(3) model fit to

GDP or consumption growth. This is a measure of conditional fundamental volatility, or put




           5
            Earlier drafts of our paper were completed contemporaneously with and independently of Engle
   and Rangel.

                                                     -3-
differently, a measure of the volatility of innovations to fundamentals.6

       Now consider stock market volatility. We parallel our above-discussed approach to

fundamental volatility, using the major stock index series from the IMF’s International Financial

Statistics (IFS). Stock indices are not available for some countries and periods. For those

countries we obtain data from alternative sources, among which are Datastream, the Standard

and Poors Emerging Markets Database, and the World Federation of Exchanges. Finally, using

consumer price index data from the IFS, we convert to real stock returns.

       We measure real stock market volatility in identical fashion to fundamental volatility,

calculating both unconditional and conditional versions. Interestingly, the AR(3) coefficients are

statistically significant for a few developing countries, which have small and illiquid stock

markets.7

On the Choice of Sample Period

       Our empirical analysis requires data on four time series for each country: Real GDP, real

consumption expenditures, stock market returns and consumer price inflation. In terms of data

availability, countries fall into three groups. The first group is composed of mostly industrial

countries, with data series available for all four variables from the 1960s onward.

       The second group of countries is composed mostly of developing countries. In many

developing countries, stock markets became an important means of raising capital only in the

1990s; indeed, only a few of the developing countries had active stock markets before the mid-

1980s. Hence the second group has shorter available data series, especially for stock returns.


            6
            The latter volatility measure is more relevant for our purposes, so we focus on it for the
   remainder of this paper. The empirical results are qualitatively unchanged, however, when we use the
   former measure.
            7
                Again, however, we focus on the condition version for the remainder of this paper.

                                                         -4-
       One could of course deal with the problems of the second group simply by discarding it,

relying only the cross section of industrialized countries. Doing so, however, would radically

reduce cross-sectional variation, producing potentially-severe reductions in statistical efficiency.

Hence we use all countries in the first and second groups, but we start our sample in 1983,

reducing the underlying interval used to calculate volatilities to 20 years.

       The third group of countries is composed mostly of the transition economies and some

African and Asian developing countries, for which stock markets became operational only in the

1990s. As a result, we can include these countries only if we construct volatilities using roughly

a 10-year interval of underlying data. Switching from a 20-year to a 10-year interval, the

number of countries in the sample increases from around 40 to around 70 (which is good), but

using a 10-year interval produces much noisier volatility estimates (which is bad). We feel that,

on balance, the bad outweighs the good, so we exclude the third group of countries from our

basic analysis, which is based on underlying annual data. However, and as we will discuss, we

are able to base some of our analyses on underlying quarterly data, and in those cases we include

some of the third group of countries.

       In closing this subsection, we note that, quite apart from the fact that data limitations

preclude use of pre-1980s data, use of such data would probably be undesirable even if it were

available. In particular, the growing literature on the “Great moderation” – decreased variation

of output around trend in industrialized countries, starting in the early 1980s – suggests the

appropriateness starting our sample in the early 1980s, so we take 1983-2002 as our benchmark

sample.8 Estimating fundamental volatility using both pre- and post-1983 data would mix

           8
            On the “great moderation” in developed countries, see Kim and Nelson (1999), McConnell and
   Perez-Quiros (2000) and Stock and Watson (2002). Evidence for fundamental volatility moderation in
   developing countries also exists, although it is more mixed. For example, Montiel and Serven (2006) report

                                                      -5-
observations from the high and low fundamental volatility eras, potentially producing distorted

inference.

3. Empirical Results

       Having described our data and choice of benchmark sample, we now proceed with the

empirical analysis, exploring the relationship between stock market volatility and fundamental

volatility in a broad cross section covering approximately forty countries.

Distributions of Volatilities in the Cross Section

       We begin in Figure 1 by showing kernel density estimates of the cross-country

distributions of fundamental volatility and stock return volatility. The densities indicate wide

dispersion in volatilities across countries. Moreover, the distributions tend to be right-skewed,

as developing countries often have unusually high volatility. The log transformation largely

reduces the right skewness; hence we work with log volatilities from this point onward.9

The Basic Relationship

       We present our core result in Figure 2, which indicates a clear positive relationship

between stock return and GDP volatilities, as summarized by the scatterplot of stock market

volatility against GDP volatility, together with fitted nonparametric regression curve.10 The

fitted curve, moreover, appears nearly linear. (A fitted linear regression gives a slope coefficient

of 0.38 with a robust t-statistic of 4.70, and an adjusted R2 of 0.26.)


   a decline in GDP growth volatility from roughly four percent in the 1970s and 1980s to roughly three
   percent in the 1990s. On the other hand, Kose, Prasad, and Terrones (2006) find that developing countries
   experience increases in consumption volatility following financial liberalization, and many developing
   economies have indeed liberalized in recent years.
             9
             The approximate log-normality of volatility in the cross section parallels the approximate
   unconditional log-normality documented in the time series by Andersen, Bollerslev, Diebold and Ebens
   (2001).
             10
                  We use the LOWESS locally-weighted regression procedure of Cleveland (1979).

                                                        -6-
       When we swap consumption for GDP, the positive relationship remains, as shown in

Figure 3, although it appears less linear. In any event, the positive cross-sectional relationship

between stock market volatility and fundamental volatility contrasts with the Schwert’s (1989)

earlier-mentioned disappointing results for the U.S. time series.

Controlling for the Level of Initial GDP

       Inspection of the country acronyms in Figures 2 and 3 reveals that both stock market and

fundamental volatilities are higher in developing (or newly industrializing) countries.

Conversely, industrial countries cluster toward low stock market and fundamental volatility.

This dependence of volatility on stage of development echoes the findings of Koren and

Tenreyro (2007) and has obvious implications for the interpretation of our results. In particular,

is it a development story, or is there more? That is, is the apparent positive dependence between

stock market volatility and fundamental volatility due to common positive dependence of

fundamental and stock market volatilities on a third variable, stage of development, or would the

relationship exist even after controlling for stage of development?

       To explore this, we follow a two-step procedure. In the first step, we regress all variables

on initial GDP per capita, to remove stage-of-development effects (as proxied by initial GDP).

In the second step, we regress residual stock market volatility on residual fundamental volatility.

       In Figures 4-6 we display the first-step regressions, which are of independent interest,

providing a precise quantitative summary of the dependence of all variables (stock market

volatility, GDP volatility and consumption volatility) on initial GDP per capita. The dependence

is clearly negative, particularly if we discount the distortions to the basic relationships caused by

India and Pakistan, which have very low initial GDP per capita, yet relatively low stock market,

and especially fundamental, volatility.

                                                 -7-
       We display second-step results for the GDP fundamental in Figure 7. The fitted curve is

basically flat for low levels of GDP volatility, but it clearly becomes positive as GDP volatility

increases. A positive relationship also continues to obtain when we switch to the consumption

fundamental, as shown in Figure 8. Indeed the relationship between stock market volatility and

consumption volatility would be stronger after controlling for initial GDP if we were to drop a

single and obvious outlier (Philippines), which distorts the fitted curve at low levels of

fundamental volatility, as Figure 8 makes clear.

4. Variations and Extensions

       Thus far we have studied stock market and fundamental volatility using underlying

annual data, 1983-2002. Here we extend our analysis in two directions. First, we incorporate

higher-frequency data when possible (quarterly for GDP and monthly, aggregated to quarterly,

for stock returns). Second, we use the higher frequency data in a panel-data framework to

analyze the direction of causality between stock market and fundamental volatility.

Cross-Sectional Analysis Based on Underlying Quarterly Data

       As noted earlier, the quality of developing-country data starts to improve in the 1980s. In

addition, the quantity improves, with greater availability and reliability of quarterly GDP data.

We now use that quarterly data 1984:1 to 2003.3, constructing and examining volatilities over

four five-year spans: 1984.1-1988.4, 1989.1-1993.4, 1994.1-1998.4, and 1999.1-2003:3.

       The number of countries increases considerably as we move through the four periods.

Hence let us begin with the fourth period, 1999.1-2003:3. We show in Figure 9 the fitted

regression of stock market volatility on GDP volatility. The relationship is still positive; indeed

it appears much stronger than the one discussed earlier, based on annual data 1983-2002 and

shown in Figure 2. Perhaps this is because the developing country GDP data have become less

                                                 -8-
noisy in recent times.

       Now let us consider the other periods. We obtained qualitatively identical results when

repeating the analysis of Figure 9 for each of the three earlier periods: Stock market volatility is

robustly and positively linked to fundamental volatility. To summarize those results compactly,

we show in Figure 10 the regression fitted to all the data, so that, for example, a country with

data available for all four periods has four data points in the figure. The positive relationship

between stock market and fundamental volatility is clear.11

Panel Analysis of Causal Direction

       Thus far we have intentionally and exclusively emphasized the cross-sectional

relationship between stock market and fundamental volatility, and we found that the two are

positively related. However, economics suggests not only correlation between fundamentals and

stock prices, and hence from fundamental volatility to stock market volatility, but also (Granger)

causation.12

       Hence in this sub-section we continue to exploit the rich dispersion in the cross section,

but we no longer average out the time dimension; instead, we incorporate it explicitly via a panel

analysis. Moreover, we focus on a particular panel analysis that highlights the value of

incorporating cross sectional information relative to a pure time series analysis. In particular, we

follow Schwert’s (1989) two-step approach to obtain estimates of time-varying quarterly stock

market and GDP volatilities, country-by-country, and then we test causal hypotheses in a panel

framework that facilitates pooling of the cross-country data.


            11
             Two outliers on the left (corresponding to Spain in the first two windows) distort the fitted curve
   and should be discounted.
            12
                 There may of course also be bi-directional causality (feedback).

                                                          -9-
       Briefly, Schwert’s approach proceeds as follows. In the first step, we fit autoregressions

to stock market returns and GDP, and we take absolute values of the associated residuals, which

are effectively (crude) quarterly realized volatilities of stock market and fundamental

innovations, in the jargon of Andersen, Bollerslev, Diebold and Ebens (2001). In the second

stage, we transform away from realized volatilities and toward conditional volatilities by fitting

autoregressions to those realized volatilities, and keeping the fitted values. We repeat this for

each of the 46 countries.

       We analyze the resulting 46 pairs of stock market and fundamental volatilities in two

ways. The first follows Schwert and exploits only time-series variation, estimating a separate

VAR model for each country and testing causality. The results, which are not reported here,

mirror Schwert’s, failing to identify causality in either direction in the vast majority of countries.

       The second approach exploits cross-sectional variation along with time series variation.

We simply pool the data across countries, allowing for fixed effects. First we estimate a fixed-

effects model with GDP volatility depending on three lags of itself and three lags of stock

market volatility, which we use to test the hypothesis that stock market volatility does not

Granger cause GDP volatility. Next we estimate a fixed-effects model with stock market

volatility depending on three lags of itself and three lags of GDP volatility, which we use to test

the hypothesis that GDP volatility does not Granger cause Stock market volatility.

       We report the results in Table 1, using quarterly real stock market volatility and real GDP

growth volatility for the panel of 46 countries, 1961.1 to 2003.3. We test non-causality from

fundamental volatility (FV) to return volatility (RV), and vice versa, and we present F-statistics

and corresponding p-values for both hypotheses. We do this for thirty sample windows, with the

ending date fixed at 2003.3 and the starting date varying from 1961.1, 1962.1, ..., 1990.1. There

                                                 -10-
is no evidence against the hypothesis that stock market volatility does not Granger cause GDP

volatility; that is, it appears that stock market volatility does not cause GDP volatility. In sharp

contrast, the hypothesis that GDP volatility does not Granger cause Stock market volatility is

overwhelmingly rejected: Evidently GDP volatility does cause stock market volatility.

       The intriguing result of one-way causality from fundamental volatility stock return

volatility deserves additional study, as the forward-looking equity market might be expected to

predict macro fundamentals, rather than the other way around. Of course here we focus on

predicting fundamental and return volatilities, rather than fundamentals or returns themselves.

There are subtleties of volatility measurement as well. For example, we do not use implied stock

return volatilities, which might be expected to be more forward-looking.13

5. Concluding Remark

       This paper is part of a broader movement focusing on the macro-finance interface. Much

recent work focuses on high-frequency data, and some of that work focuses on the high-

frequency relationships among returns, return volatilities and fundamentals (e.g., Andersen,

Bollerslev, Diebold and Vega, 2003, 2007). Here, in contrast, we focus on international cross

sections obtained by averaging over time. Hence this paper can be interpreted not only as

advocating more exploration of the fundamental volatility / return volatility interface, but also in

particular as a call for more exploration of volatility at medium (e.g., business cycle) frequencies.

In that regard it is to the stock market as, for example, Diebold, Rudebusch and Aruoba (2006) is

to the bond market and Evans and Lyons (2007) is to the foreign exchange market.

                                            Appendix

        Here we provide details of data sources, country coverage, sample ranges, and

transformations applied. We discuss underlying annual data first, followed by quarterly data.

Annual Data

        We use four “raw” data series per country: Real GDP, real private consumption

expenditures (PCE), a broad stock market index, and the CPI. We use those series to compute

annual real stock returns, real GDP growth, real consumption growth, and corresponding

volatilities. The data set includes a total of 71 countries and spans a maximum of forty-two

years, 1960-2002. For many countries, however, consumption and especially stock market data

are available only for a shorter period, reducing the number of countries with data available.

        We obtain annual stock market data from several sources, including International

Financial Statistics (IFS), the OECD, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) Emerging

Market Data Base (EMDB), Global Insight (accessed via WRDS), Global Financial Data,

Datastream, the World Federation of Exchanges, and various stock exchange web sites. Details

appear in Table A1, which lists the countries for which stock market index data are available at

least for the twenty-year period from 1983-2002. With stock prices in hand, we calculate

nominal returns as                . We then calculate annual consumer price index (CPI)

inflation,   , using the monthly IFS database 1960-2002, and finally we calculate real stock

returns as                    .

        We obtain annual real GDP data from the World Bank World Development Indicators

database (WDI). For most countries, WDI covers the full 1960-2002 period. Exceptions are

Canada (data start in 1965), Germany (data start in 1971), Israel (data end in 2000), Saudi Arabia

(data end in 2001), and Turkey (data start in 1968). We obtain Taiwan real GDP from the

                                               -12-
Taiwan National Statistics web site. We complete the real GDP growth rate series for Canada

(1961-65), Germany (1961-71), Israel (2001-2002) and Saudi Arabia (2002) using IFS data on

nominal growth and CPI inflation. We calculate real GDP growth rates as                       .

       We obtain real personal consumption expenditures data using the household and personal

final consumption expenditure from the World Bank’s WDI database. We recover missing data

from the IFS and Global Insight (through WRDS); see Table A2 for details. We calculate real

consumption growth rates as             .

Quarterly Data

       The quarterly analysis reported in the text is based on 46 countries. Most, but not all, of

those countries are also included in the annual analysis.

       For stock markets, we construct quarterly returns using the monthly data detailed in

Table A3, and we deflate to real terms using quarterly CPI data constructed using the same

underlying monthly CPI on which annual real stock market returns are based.

       For real GDP in most countries, we use the IFS volume index. Exceptions are Brazil

(real GDP volume index, Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics website), Hong Kong

(GDP in constant prices, Census and Statistics Department website), Singapore (GDP in constant

prices, Ministry of Trade and Industry, Department of Statistics website), and Taiwan (GDP in

constant prices, Taiwan National Statistics website.

       Table A4 summarizes the availability of the monthly stock index series and quarterly

Notes to Figures and Tables

Figure 1. We plot kernel density estimates of real stock return volatility (using data for 43

countries), real GDP growth volatility (45 countries), and real consumption growth volatility (41

countries), in both levels and logs. All volatilities are standard deviations of residuals from

AR(3) models fitted to annual data, 1983-2002. For comparison we also include plots of best-

fitting normal densities (dashed).

Figure 2. We show a scatterplot of real stock return volatility against real GDP growth

volatility, with a nonparametric regression fit superimposed, for 43 countries. All volatilities are

log standard deviations of residuals from AR(3) models fitted to annual data, 1983-2002.

Figure 3. We show a scatterplot of real stock return volatility against real consumption growth

volatility, with a nonparametric regression fit superimposed, for 39 countries. All volatilities are

log standard deviations of residuals from AR(3) models fitted to annual data, 1983-2002.

Figure 4. We show a scatterplot of real stock return volatility against initial (1983) real GDP

per capita, with a nonparametric regression fit superimposed, for 43 countries. All volatilities

are log standard deviations of residuals from AR(3) models fitted to annual data, 1983-2002.

Figure 5. We show a scatterplot of real GDP growth volatility against initial (1983) real GDP

per capita, with a nonparametric regression fit superimposed, for 45 countries. All volatilities

are log standard deviations of residuals from AR(3) models fitted to annual data, 1983-2002.

The number of countries is two more than in Figure 2 because we include Uruguay and Denmark

here, whereas we had to exclude them from Figure 2 due to missing stock return data.

Figure 6. We show a scatterplot of real consumption growth volatility against initial (1983) real

GDP per capita, with a nonparametric regression fit superimposed, for 41 countries. All

volatilities are log standard deviations of residuals from AR(3) models fitted to annual data,

1983-2002. The number of countries is two more than in Figure 3 because we include Uruguay

and Denmark here, whereas we had to exclude them from Figure 3 due to missing stock return
data.

Figure 7. We show a scatterplot of real stock return volatility against real GDP growth volatility

with a nonparametric regression fit superimposed, for 43 countries, controlling for the effects of

initial GDP per capita via separate first-stage nonparametric regressions of each variable on 1983

GDP per capita. All volatilities are log standard deviations of residuals from AR(3) models

fitted to annual data, 1983-2002.

Figure 8. We show a scatterplot of real stock return volatility against real consumption growth

volatility with a nonparametric regression fit superimposed, for 39 countries, controlling for the

effects of initial GDP per capita via separate first-stage nonparametric regressions of each

variable on 1983 GDP per capita. All volatilities are log standard deviations of residuals from

AR(3) models fitted to annual data, 1983-2002.

Figure 9. We show a scatterplot of real stock return volatility against real GDP growth

volatility, with a nonparametric regression fit superimposed, for 40 countries. All volatilities are

log standard deviations of residuals from AR(4) models fitted to quarterly data, 1999.1-2003.3.

Figure 10. We show a scatterplot of real stock return volatility against real GDP growth

volatility, with a nonparametric regression fit superimposed, for 43 countries. All volatilities are

log standard deviations of residuals from AR(4) models fitted to quarterly data over four

consecutive five-year windows (1984.1-1988.4, 1989.1-1993.4,1994.1-1998.4,1999.1-2003.3).

Table 1. We assess the direction of causal linkages between quarterly real stock market

volatility and real GDP growth volatility for the panel of 46 countries, 1961.1 to 2003.3. We test

non-causality from fundamental volatility (FV) to return volatility (RV), and vice versa, and we

present F-statistics and corresponding p-values for both hypotheses. We do this for thirty sample

windows, with the ending date fixed at 2003.3 and the starting date varying from 1961.1, 1962.1,

..., 1990.1.
