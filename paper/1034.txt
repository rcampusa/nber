                 TOWARDS AN EXPLANATION OF NATIONAL PRICE LEVELS


                                    ABSTRACT


     The purpose of this paper is to call attention to the need for a theory

 of comparative national price levels and to explore some of the elements

 that seem to belong to such a theory. Most theoretical discussions have

maintained that national price levels tend towards equality and focus on

 presumably temporary divergences from equality. Yet strong evidence has

been accumulating that there are large and long—standing differences in

price levels, the highest of which are more than twice those of countries

with the lowest prices.

    Long—run price level differences are most clearly related to levels of

real per capita output, with richer countries having higher price levels.

These differences have been explained as resulting from greater advantages

in productivity for the wealthier countries in goods production, mostly

tradable, than in services production, mostly nontradable. The differences

in relative productivity may be in total factor productivity or only In

labor productivity, reflecting the greater capital intensity of goods pro-

duction and possibly a higher elasticity of substitution between capital

and labor in goods production.

    We find in the empirical analysis that a large part of the differences

in price levels can be explained by structural factors such as real GDP per

capita, the degree of openness of the economy, and the share of noritradable

goods    in output. The only non—structural factor emerging from a preliminary
analysis of several of these was the rate of growth of the quantity of money.

                              I. Introduction




    The main purpose of this paper is to call attention to the need for a

theory of comparative national price levels and to explore some of the ele-

ments that seem to belong to such a theory.'

    It is overstating the case to claim that a theory of comparative price

levels does not exist, but the exaggeration is not great. As will be seen

in the next section, the theoretical discussions most prominent in the

literature have maintained that price levels tend towards equality. They

have thus directed attention to what have been regarded as temporary

divergences from equal (exchange—rate--converted) price levels, and diverted

attention away from the need to explain large and systematic differences in

national price levels that actually exist. The reality and extent of these

differences may be seen in the summary   data   presented in Table 1 (P. 9)

iir 1975 for the 34 countries included in Phase III of the International

Comparison Project (IcP). The figures indicate that GDP price levels in

high income countries were more than double those of countries with very

low incomes.

 II. Antecedents
     The great majority of discussions of price levels by economists has

 assumed that price level differences are evidence of disequilibrium and has

been concerned with the mechanism by which deviations from equilibrium are

erased. An early treatment ofprice levels along these lines may be found

in the course of David Hume's exposition of the factors determining the

distribution of specie. Hurne concentrated more on the mechanism by which

disequilibrium differences in price levels would be adjusted than on an

effort to describe the nature of the equilibrium levels themselves.

Indeed, he was sufficiently vague about the relationship between price

levels to have been subsequently interpreted by some writers as an early

advocate of the law of one price and by others as describing changes in

relative price levels as part of the adjustment process. (Collery, 1971,

pp. 25—26).

    In the very large literature on the adjustment mechanism relying on

price elasticities, which may be regarded as a logical outgrowth of Hume's

work, the nature of the world price structure has seldom, if ever, been

clearly specified.    In much of this work the basic assumption has been that

changes in exchange rates could alter the price of one country's goods

relative to those of another country and consequently produce changes in

the balance of trade. But it has been rarely, if ever, specified whether

prices for identical goods do or do not have to be the same (after

allowance for transfer costs) in different countries (Kravis and Lipsey,

1978).

    Price   levels also play a prominent role in the purchasing power parity

theory of exchange rates. Since the main thrust of the theory is that

exchange rates will adjust so as to equalize price levels (or changes in
                                          —3—

 price levels), price level differences are regarded as deviations from nor-

mal conditions. It is true that Cassel recognized that exchange rates

 could deviate from purchasing power parity owing to an unequal impact of

 the trade restrictions imposed by different countries on exports and

imports, and, in the short run, to capital movements and expectations

 (Cassel, 1922, pp. 147—162; Holmes, 1967). But purchasing power parities

remained as the "normal" exchange rates (Cassel, 1922, p. 156) and even

these qualifications were often lost sight of in the writing of subsequent

supporters of the theory.

        recent years, the purchasing pcer parity theory has been revived as
       In

part of the monetary approach to the theory of the balance of payments.
Once again, the       main purpose of the theory was not to explain price levels.

Rather      a   "law of one price' was invoked to help demonstrate the dominant

role    of the supply of money in determining balance of payments deficits and
surpluses       and exchange rate changes. The law of one price, it may be

noted, has usually been held to apply particularly among the more

industrialized       countries and particularly to traded goods. In some ver—
sions    of the monetary approach, differences in the relative prices of home

oods were given a crucial though transient role in the adjustment mecha-

nism (Frenkel and Johnson, 1976; Whitman, 1975),

    Mention may also be made of a very different though less extensive

literature in which contrary assumptions were made about the possibility of

price level differences. The reference here is to writings on export—led

growth,      particularly those advancing the hypothesis of export—led growth
for advanced industrial countries. In one variant, the idea of export—led
growth      for such countries, with their varied exports, rests on the assump-

tion that relative national price levels are not necessarily determined as
                                     —4—


endogenous   variables hut rather that the price level can be used as a

policy instrument. A widely held interpretation of the rapid recovery and

growth of western Europe after World War II was based on a reading of

events along these lines (Lamfalussy, 1963). Alternatively, cost—reducing

technological change may improve a country's price competitiveness and

though the price level is not held down as a matter of deliberate policy,

the result, under a system of fixed exchange rates, may be price—induced

export—led growth2 (Beckerman, 1965, p. 46).

     Despite the dominant tendency to treat price levels as an incidental

facet of balance of payments and exchange rate problems, structural expla-

nations of price level differences did appear. The kernel of the idea that

price levels might be a function of real per capita income is found in a

statement by Ricardo that home goods would be more expensive "in those

countries where manufactures flourish" (Ricardo, 1817). A reasonably full

account of a real theory of comparative national price levels was set out

by Harrod (1939) in the 1930's and restated by Balassa (1964) and Aukrust

(1970) after World War ii. All these writers assumed that at least as a

first approximation internationally traded goods would tend to obey the law

of one price. That is, local currency prices of of tradable goods were
proportional to exchange rates. Each set out in a fairly complex way what
has been called the "differential productivity model" (Kravis, Heston, and
Summers, 1978a). The essence of the model lies in differences in price
formation    and in productivity for traded and nontraded goods. Prices for

traded   goods are set in world maiiets while prices for nontraded goods are
determined    in the home market. With   similar prices for traded goods in all
countries, wages in the industries producing traded goods in each country
will depend on productivity. The wage level established in the traded
                                           —5—

goods industries prevails also in the nontraded goods industries, but

 international productivity differences are smaller for such industries.

This means that in poor countries the low wages established in the low—

productivity traded goods industries will apply also to the not—so—low pro-

ductivity     nontraded goods industries. The consequence will be low prices
In low incon countries for nontraded goods. Since the price level is a
weighted average of traded and nontraded goods prices, price levels will
tend to be lower in low income than in high Income countries.
    Harrod        (1939, P. 62) also stressed an additional point of great importance:

retail prices (and by implication final product prices for all commodities)

are amalgams of prices of traded and nontraded goods. Indeed, it is not

easy to think of a traded good that reaches its final purchaser without the

addition of nontraded services such as distribution and local transport.

This substantially widens the possible gap for differences in national

price levels. Jones and Purvis (1981) have recently explored this source

of differences in national price levels more systematically. They put

forth a model in which each country transforms imported inputs into final

goods by adding nontraded inputs. The imported inputs are obtained in

•.xchange for exports which are used as inputs for the production of final

goods in other countries; in these countries final products are produced by

adding nontradable factors to these imports of intermediate goods. Even if

the law of one price is assumed to apply to "middle products" —        the   traded

inputs
         —
             it   does not necessarily follow that the same law will hold for

final   product prices.4
    Balassa       (1964)   and Clague and Tanzi (1972) were among the first to draw
on new statistical studies of purchasing power and of comparative levels of

real per capita GDP which provided direct comparisons of price levels.
                                  —6—

These studies began to appear in the 1950's; the most recent is the source

of the data in Table i.5 For the most part this work concentrated on the

empirical problems of measurement rather than on explanation of the dif-

ferences observed.6

   The availability of more reliable comparisons of real per capita GDP

for a limited number of countries naturally raised the possibility of using

the relationship between exchange—rate—converted (nominal) and purchasing—

power—converted (real) CDPs to extend the real comparisons to other

countries. At first these short cut methods simply turned on the rela-

tionship of nominal (n) to real (r) GD? as revealed in the benchmark

studies; this relationship was used to estimate r from the n of each non—

benchmark country.7 Subsequently, searches were undertaken for factors

other than n which could explain r.8 Although these efforts were usually

cast in terms of a search for the relationship between real GD? per capita

and exchange—rate-converted GDP per capita, relative price levels are

implied by this relationship.


       III. Defining National Price Levels for Comparative Purposes

    These relationships may be clearly seen by calling attention to the

basic approach to international income and product comparisons used in

Gilbert and Kravis and all the major ensuing studies. The comparisons rest

on the identity: price (F) times quantity (Q) equals expenditure (PQ). For

a pair of countries, j and b (the latter the numeraire country), for a

single good:

         li..9i= PjQ
    (1) 1b     Qb bQb
                                      —7--

 where the Ps are in each country's own currency. If a quantity conparison

 (QJIQb) could easily be made for each good in a way that would Involve

 identical or at least equivalent qualities, deriving comparative GDPs would

 then simply be a matter of finding a suitable method of aggregating the

quantity ratios. In practice quantity comparisons are very difficult to

make, owing in no small degree to the fact that the most disaggregated

data with which it Is feasible to work in international comparisons of GDP

 relate not to individual products but to detailed categories (e.g., men's

footwear) which contain a variety of products and sometimes a quite hetero—

geneous collection (e.g., women's dresses). For most detailed categories,

the matching and sampling problems become much more manageable if one tries

to obtain a sample set of price comparisons (j/b).9 Thus the typical

procedure in international GDP comparisons is to get an average j'b ratio

for each category, and, taking advantage of (1), to derive the Qj'Qb ratio

by dividing the price ratio into the expenditure ratio. The expenditures

are available (or at least obtainable) from each country's national

accounts data.

    In the absence of such a comparative price study, the Ps and Qs are

nknown, and all that can be done for comparative purposes is to convert

the expenditures to a common currency via the exchange rate. For example,

where PQ =   GDP   in own currency, and ej/b is the number of units of j

currency that are required to buy one unit of b's currency on the foreign

exchange market, a CDP comparison is obtained by:


         (2) EPQ       ÷ ej/b   n
              E bQ b
                                                  — 8—

This indeed is still the most common way of comparing GD? among countries;

it is used, for example, in the standard compilations of comparative GDPs

published by the United Nations and the World Bank. This approach Impli-

citly assumes that "j/b               el/b; that is, the relative purchasing powers of

the currencies are reflected in the exchange rate.

    If the latter equality holds, exchange—rate converted prices in the two

countries are equal; there is only a world price level and national price

levels are all the same. In fact, the equality does not hold; the

purchasing power of a currency relative to a numeraire currency may in cer-

tain cases be two or three times the exchange rate (see Table 1), and com-

parisons based on exchange rate conversions are often far from the mark.

If j'b > el/b prices in j are higher than in b and an exchange rate con-

version will overstate j's real GD? relative to b's; if j/b < el/b prices

in j are lower than in b and an exchange rate conversion will understate

i's real GDP (r). If j/b is known for every category of GDP, r can be

obtained:

            (3) EPQ            /b =          r
                   bQb
where the purchasing power parity j/b is an appropriately weighted

average of the

              is expressed in terms of units of i's currency per unit of b's.

Prices may be more conveniently compared by dividing the j/b or the PPPs

by the exchange rate:

            (4)   ...J...   el/b =   PLj/b
where PLj/b is i's price level expressed as a ratio of b's. PL may be com-

pared for both detailed category                 levels   and for aggregations such as GD?.

    The use of the national accounts framework provides the answers to some

important conceptual questions that plagued early efforts to produce an

operational definition of the •general price level" (Snyder, 1928;

Keynes, 1930, pp. 76—94). What prices to include and what weights to

assign to each price fall into place once it Is decided to base the com-

parisons on the national accounts concept of final expenditure on CDP.

Each price is, in principle, the weighted national average price; that is,

It Is the    that Is embedded in the national accounts expenditure figure

PjQ. The weights are determined by relative importance In expenditures on

GDP. There are to be sure problems about how the weights of the different

countries will enter into the weights used in the comparison, but at least

the conceptual problem of what data to start with at the country level Is

clearly resolved.'0

    The concept of a national price level is a relative one; the prices of

the goods comprising the GDP of any country In any period have no absolute

meaning. There Is no meaningful average price of a unit of GDP. The con-

cept of a national price level Is of Interest only when it is Intended to

compare price levels in two or more different situations. The reference

      for the study of the price level of a given country is some other

country or group of countries. The average price comparison that Is sought

is between sets of prices separated in space.

    The difficulties posed for the comparison of national price levels by

the existence of different currency units, Is, as indicated in (4), cir—

cuinvented by converting the price or purchasing power parity relationship

to a price level comparison by dividing by the exchange rate. The fact

that national price levels can be compared only by converting prices to a

common currency by means of exchange rates calls attention to the very close
                                              — 11 —


 connection between price levels and exchange rates. The economic links

 will be discussed further on, but some aspects of the statistical

 constructs that link      the   two variables may be usefully treated at this

 point.

      In the literature on the determination of exchange rates and also in

that dealing with purchasing power parity theory the term "real exchange

rate" is often encountered. The reference is usually to an index of

exchange rate changes (for currency j relative to a numeraire country,

b) corrected for relative price changes.'1 That is, country i's index of

the real exchange rate (IRER) in year t, taking year o as a base and country

b as the nuineraire country, is:




      (5)
              IRERl =
                            e9
                                                   p

      The IRER involves the same terms as the index of relative price levels

converted to a common currency (IRPL), but the two are not identical.

IRPL, the index of price level movements adjusted for exchange rate

hanges, is the reciprocal of the IRER. For country                 j   relative to country

b in the year t,       taking   the year 0    as   the base year, IRPL is:


                                     et\           Pt
      (6)                                           b
              IRPLt.
                                     e0   I        p°
                                                    b


     The    concept of price levels used in the present study (PL) is based

on   the price level in a given country during a           given   period, taken
                                             — 12   —




relative    to the price level of a numeraire country at the same period of

time. PL is formed by the numerator terms in (6):


    (7)     PLt =   (pt   r   et)    ÷ Pt
              j       j        j        b


The terms to the right of the equal sign correspond, of course, to the form

given in (4), pt/pt + et



    For present purposes, the b in (7) refers to a single numeraire

country, the U.S. The choice of the U.S. as a numeraire rather than some

other country does not affect the results except in a trivial scaling

sense. 12



              IV.   Elements        in a Theory of National Price Levels

    The elements that determine differences in the national levels of

prices during a given period of time may be classified in different ways.

A distinction might be made, for example, betweewn real and monetary fac-

tors or between long run and short run influences. Another classifIcation

that suggests itself is one that would divide the influences according to

which of the two factors that enter into the formula for the price level

(7) they affect —    i.e.,         those that operate on the relative domestic price

level (the PPP) and those that work through the exchange rate. From a

general equilibrium standpoint this may be viewed as a misleading dicho—

tomy since PPP and exchange rates jointly determine relative price levels

and are determined by them in an interdependent set of relationships.'3

The simple monetarist approach to the balance of payments, for example,

holds that price levels are the same everywhere (with exceptions for

nontradables, in some versions). A policy designed to alter the domestic—

 currency price level will merely produce compensating changes in the
 exchange—rate from the standpoint of the individual country. However, it
 has already been established that in the real world price levels are not
 the same in different countries, and it      is   preferable to leave open the
 possibility      that some Influences may operate on exchange rates with an

 incomplete or delayed adjustment in domestic—currency price levels, and

 others on domestic—currency price levels with an incomplete or delayed

adjustment in exchange rates.'4

        The twofold classification used in the exploratory empirical work which

follows does not rest squarely on this distinction, but embodies some

aspects of it. Influences on the price level (PL) are viewed as consisting

of long run factors that determine the underlying price level and of short

run factors that cause deviations from the basic level. The long run         fac-
tors are regarded as real variables, and the short run factors are mainly

monetary variables.

    Long    run structural factors. The long run factors are structural
variables that characterize the comparative economic framework of the
country.     One key structural variable, real per capita CDP, has already

:een shown to be positively correlated with the price level. Other struc-

tural characteristics that merit examination for possible links to price

levels are the industrial composition of GDP and factor endowments,

including the skill composition of the labor force and the distribution

of the labor force across industries. The size of the country and the

influence this has in leading It to more or less participation in inter-

national trade are also relevant. These variables are for the most part

long run    In   character in the sense that they change only gradually over

time.

         As pointed out in the earlier discussion of the productivity differen-

tial model, some of these factors affect the price level primarily through

a    differential impact on the prices of tradable and nontradable goods.15
It   has long been a matter of casual empirical observation that service pri-

ces and the prices of nontradables generally are relatively cheap in 1cM

income countries. This is confirmed in the ICP studies. For the 34

countries included in the 1975 ICP benchmark study, classified by

increasing incon levels, the price indexes for tradable and nontradable

goods are as follows:

         Of course, if tradable goods prices are linked more or less closely to

world price levels, but nontradables are cheap in low income countries, the

low income countries will be characterized by low price levels for GD? as a

whole, again a finding of the ICP studies evident in the above text table.

         The productivity differential model ascribes low nontraded goods prices

to relatively high productivity in the poor countries' service industries,

industries that account for most nontraded goods (Kravis, Heston, and

Summers (1978a)). That is, although the productivity of poor countries is
                                     - 15   -



low relative to that of rich countries in both service and commodity pro-

ducing industries, the productivity differentials are smaller in the ser-

vice industries. Empirical evidence supporting this pattern of produc-

tivity differences was first offered by Kuznets through the use of sectoral

productivity ratios —   i.e.,   sectoral shares in output divided by sectoral

shares in employment.'6 Confirmation is found in Chenery and Syrquin's

"stylized" presentation of relationships for 101 countries covering the

period 1950—70 (Chenery and Syrquin, 1975, pp. 20—21; Chenety 1979, p.

20).17

    Productivity in this model is usually interpreted in the Ricardian

sense, that is, as a partial productivity measure—-i.e. ,   output   per unit of

labor input. This explanation of differences In service/commodity price

ratios between rich and poor countries could be reconciled with an explana-

tion based on a standard factor proportions trade model. Using the latter

model we would explain the differences in service/commodity price ratios In

the same way that we explain differences in price ratios among tradable

goods: namely, the abundance and prices of the factors of production in

rich and poor countries.

    The factor proportions explanation would run as follows. Service

industries are relatively labor intensive, on the average, in all

countries.18 Because capital is abundant in rich countries, labor is

highly productive and expensive. As a result, rich countries produce and

export   to poor (labor—abundant) countries capital—intensive tradables, and
poor countries produce and export to rich countries labor—intensive tra—
dables. Nontradables, however, must be produced by each country for its
own use. Since services (nontradables) are labor intensive, and since
labor is expensive in rich countries, the price of services tends to be
                                 — 16     —




high in rich countries relative to the price of commodities, just as the
price of labor—intensive goods is high relative to that of capital—intensive

goods. We thus have an alternative explanation of the price structure that

does not require the assumption that productivity, with respect to all fac-

tors, or in the production function sense, is more similar between rich and

poor countries in services than in goods, and is even compatible with iden-

tical production functions in all countries.

   Total factor productivity provides the test upon which the survival of

the differential productivity theory relative to this simpler explanation

depends. Some far-from—perfect data suggest that low income countries do

have a lesser disadvantage in services than in commodities with respect to

total factor productivity as well as for labor productivity:

   The reasons for these differences seem to be complex and cannot be

pursued here in any depth.'9 Kuznets (1957, p. 14f) mentions several fac-

tors affecting the supply and demand of the services and commodities and of

the types of labor that produce them, including, for example, the higher

incomes that some of the professions providing services may    be able to
                                      — 17 —


 extract    in low income countries that have relatively little national

 investment in human capital. Another area of explanation may be found in

 the differences In the diffusion of technology; that Is, the technological

 gap separating productive practices in poor and rich countries may be

 smaller in service production than in
                                         commodity production, especially in
 countries where backwardness in overpopulated rural areas may be a severe

 problem.

     A possible further explanation of the high relative prices of services

 relative to commodities in developed countries Is that the elasticity of

 substitution between capital and labor Is lower in service industries.20

 If that Is the case, while in tradables industries, rich countries can

adapt to high labor prices by substituting capital for labor and thus

achieve higher labor productivity in tradables than poor countries even if

they are all on the same production function, the same possibility is not

available in nontradableg industrjes. There the substitution possibilities

are absent, or lower, and labor productivity differences are therefore also

absent, or lower.

    Although we have described productivity differentials between tradables

and nontradables as a function of the level of per capita incon, there

could be other determinants of such differentials.       One country's tradables
sector may include a protected, backward agriculture, while another's may

be entirely   composed of hIghly efficient and competitive manufacturing.
One country's service sector may be filled with small, inefficient

retailing units protected by laws restricting mass retailers while

another's may permit vigourous competition which eliminates inefficient

units. Rational efficient growth should eliminate these intersectoral. dif-

ferences. But in    the meanwhile large dispersions in   sectoral   productivity
                                    — 18 —


ratios   should, other things being equal, lead to high prices in the low

productivity sectors which would be more shielded from international

competition than high productivity sectors. Consequently, PL should vary

directly with the dispersion of sectoral productivity ratios of each

country. Unfortunately, it is difficult to develop accurate sectoral pro-

ductivity measures for large numbers of countries, particularly for

industries subdivided into more than 8 or 10 branches.

    Among the structural factors not related to the productivity differen-

tial model is the strength of the country's economic links   with   the rest of

the world, which we refer to as "openness.' For a country with a high

degree of openness a large proportion of tradables will actually be traded

and, other things equal, exports and imports will be large relative to GDP.

    The degree of openness may affect the price level through its influence

on prices of the factors of production. The higher the degree of openness,

the higher the price of the abundant factor, abstracting from differences

in elasticity of factor supply. If services tend to be labor intensive

relative to commodities or tradables everywhere, the more open a labor—

abundant country, the higher its price of services and the higher its price

level, because openness would increase the price of labor. The more      open   a


capital—abundant    country, the higher the price of capital and the lower the
relative price of services and the overall price level. If low      incomes   and

labor    abundance are associated with low elasticities of labor supply, the

effect of a high degree of openness in producing a high price level would

be enhanced. This would not be the case, however, in surplus labor econo—

mies with very high labor supply elasticities and comparative advantage in

labor—intensive industries. In comparisons with the U.S., however, if the

U.S. is the most labor—scarce (capital—abundant) of all countries, the
                                                — 19


effect of openness should be positive on all countries' price levels.

However, the effect should be stronger on the price levels of low income

countries, with the possible exception of the surplus labor economies.

     The productivity differential model as described above points to

variables such as real per capita GDP (r) that attempt to capture the

direct Impact of the operation of the model, or to measures of relative

productivity in commodity and service production. An alternative

suggestion, first made by Clague and Tanzi (1972) and recently implemented

in a more plausible way by Isenman (1980) is to try to use the relative

quantity or prices of skilled labor to reflect differential productivity.

Isenman assumes that services are intensive in skilled personnel, and a

relatively large proportion of educated or highly skilled personnel or low

incomes for educated and skilled personnel would therefore have a negative

influence on a country's price level.

     A number of other structural factors have been suggested. The role of

trade restrictions in tending to lower the price level of a country whose

exports are depressed by partner country restrictions to a greater degree

than it curbs its imports has already been mentioned in connection with

Cassel's work. Usher (1968, pp. 108—113) has offered a somewhat broader

treatment of this influence, and Clague (1980) has modelled the rela-

tionship. Clague and Tanzi (1972) argue that a country rich in natural

resources is apt to have a higher price level, other things (including r)

being equal, because abundant resources relative to human skills should

make commodity prices (which tend to be resource intensive relative to

services) relatively cheap and service prices relatively dear. Tradable

natural resource products will sell at or near world price levels, and high

service prices will lead to a high average price level for CDP. Usher
                                     — 20 —


(1968, pp. 78f) pointed Out   that   transport costs might affect price levels

if their impact on home prices of exports and import goods was not

offsetting — as might be the case for a price—taking country distant from

world markets.2' Finally, Balassa suggested that a high share of tourist

expenditures (intensive in skilled labor) in exports would push the price

level up; so too would a high ratio of indirect to direct taxes, assuming

that the indirect taxes are also levied on the imports.22

    Short run factors. By contrast to the relatively small literature

dealing with long run determinants of national price levels, relatively

short run influences have been the subject of close and extensive scrutiny

in the literature on exchange rate determination. The unexpected volati-

lity of the nominal exchange rates of the main     currencies   since the end of

the Bretton Woods has led to a still on—going search for improved explana-

tions of exchange rate determinants.23 Some of this has been addressed to

the real exchange rate, which, as seen above, is the reciprocal of a time—

to—time index of relative price levels. It is clear that the volatility of

nominal exchange rates has been large relative to the movements of national

price levels (Flood, 1981; Aizenman, 1982). The implication is that there

    short run factors that have a substantial impact on exchange rates

without necessarily involving offsetting adjustments in domestic—currency

price levels. If this is the case, short run variations         in price levels
(PL) may well be dominated by exchange rate influences.
    The explanation of exchange rates which has the longest history, the

monetary approach, views the exchange rate as the relative price of two

monies, the price of each dependent on its supply and demand. Since the

law of one price is held to prevail, the exchange rate must equal the
                                         — 21 —



purchasing power parity. Hence,
       (8) el/b =

Given    the assumption that prices are determined by nominal money supply and

real money demand and that real money demand is determined by real income

and nominal interest rates (Dornbusch, 1980), changes in the exchange rate

are a function of these variables, as follows:

                    +       +
   (9)     ej/b = F(mj/b,   u/b, ri/b)

The terms in    (9) are in logs; and ej/b is the price in i's currency of a
unit    of b currency, m the nominal money supply, i the nominal interest rate

and r the real income. The signs over the variables indicate that

increases in i's money supply or in interest rates relative to those of b

will raise the exchange rate (a depreciation) and a raise in j's real

income will have the opposite effect. The rise in interest rates and in

real income work through their impact on money balances, the former

decreasing the demand for money balances and thus raising prices and

causing a depreciation and the latter increasing the demand for money

balances with the opposite consequences.

    The extensions of the monetary model to cope with the volatility of

exchange rates has led to formulations based on a view of the exchange rate

as the price of an asset, and to efforts to take account of the current

balance as the means through which shifts in asset holdings occur. This

avenue also led to the inclusion of expectations measured by interest rate

differentials or by the relationship of the forward to the spot rate, and

to attempts to take into account the effects of unanticipated events as

well.

    Efforts to explain the volatility of exchange rates more specifically
                                   — 22 —


include   the Dornbusch (1976) hypothesis that exchange rate changes

overshoot those required in the long run, as explained below.

   Another line of explanation for the volatility of exchange rates rests

on the idea that current exchange rates reflect not only current supply and

demand conditions but also expectations about future market determinants

(Frenkel, 1976; Mussa 1976). The current price of foreign exchange is close-

ly linked to its future price because like other financial assets foreign

exchange can be held at small storage cost and traded at small transactions

cost. Because of this link, changes in supply and/or demand conditions,

particularly unexpected changes based on new information, have magnified

impacts on exchange rates.

   Various models of exchange rate determination differ too in their

treatment of relative prices —   across sectors and across countries. The

Dornbusch (1976) overshooting model does not assume any long—run inflation

differential between the country considered and the rest of the world. A

monetary expansion leads to an immediate depreciation of the exchange rate

to, or even beyond the equilibrium rate. The events that bring about that

depreciation take place in financial markets, while goods prices, which

wiil eventually rise to offset the ultimate depreciation, lag behind. In

this event there will be an initial fall in the exchange—rate—converted

price level of domestic goods and then a rise as their prices come finally

to rise in proportion to the money growth. In this model, the extent of

overshooting in the depreciation depends on the degree to which the money

growth reduces interest rates; a large reduction implies a large

overshooting since a low interest rate must be associated with expectation

of an appreciating currency. Thus we would expect to find low    price
levels, relative to those suggested by long-run influences, associated with
                                    — 23 —


recent monetary expansion and low nominal interest rates.

    Long—run differences in inflation rates, matched by differences in

nominal interest rates, are incorporated in a model offered by Frankel

(1979).   The short—run effects of money growth are similar to those in

Dornbusch, with money growth causing the same initial overshooting of

depreciation. The deviation of the exchange rate from purchasing power

parity is proportional to the differential in real interest rates and is

not associated necessarily with high or low nominal rates. Such a model

suggests both   monetary variables and real interest rates as explanatory
variables for   our analysis.

    One   of the few models that allows for permanent   changes in relative

prices, and therefore in price levels, is what Dornbusch (1980) refers to

as an "extended Mundell—Fleming model." In this version, changes in demand

can bring about long—term changes in relative prices while monetary distur—

bances cause only short—term price level changes. The variables of

interest to us in this model include both monetary and fiscal policy

variables,   particularly in the form of unanticipated changes in policy, and
changes in real wealth,   as well as any other factors which cause shifts in

demand.

    While these models do not explicitly introduce the dichotomy between
traded and nontraded goods, that distinction has become common in balance

of payments models, as, for example, in Bergias and Razin (1973) and Bruno

(1976). A recent article by Craig (1981) treats traded goods prices as

determined instantaneously by world prices, so that     an increase   in money

supply, which produces an excess demand for all goods, leads to "an increase

in imports and decrease in exports" but to a temporary increase in prices

of nontraded goods and therefore to a temporary increase in the price level.
                                   — 24 —


    Because the various theories present partial models that try to

simplify complex reality by focusing on a few key variables, they sometimes

produce opposite predictions about the effects of certain of these

variables.    The Keynesian theory, for example, predicts that higher real
income will   produce current account deficits and exchange rate

depreciation; the monetary approach, as noted above, sees the increase in

income as raising the demand for money balances and thus leading to a

current account surplus and exchange rate appreciation. If all the rele-

vant variables were taken into account these differences might disappear.

For example, higher real income might indeed absorb more money balances if

the increase was due to real factors such as domestic expansion, but the

Keynesian prediction that higher real income would bring deficits and

depreciation would be correct if the monetary authorities more than met the

extra demand for money (Bilson, 1979). Another illustration is the effect

of an increase in the interest rate on the exchange rate; if the interest

rate rises because of a tight money policy, the exchange rate will appre-

ciate, but if the cause is inflation the exchange rate will depreciate.

    Given these complexities and the uncertainties of the present state of

kilo7ledge about exchange rate determination, the literature on the subject

will be used more as a guide to the search for variables affecting price

levels and to the interpretation of the behavior of these variables than as

a source for the rigorous specification of relationships.

    Clearly an important influence on the price level in general or on the

price level for nontraded goods in particular that these models point to is

the growth in money supply, although with somewhat varying implications for

price levels. The nominal or real rate of interest is also involved in the
                                      — 25 —


 process, as an indicator of expectations regarding exchange rates and rates
 of inflation.

      There are in any case difficulties in the direct translation of

 variables designed to trace only the movements of one country's exchange

 rate over time to the explanation of the country to country structure of

price levels. One difficulty in transforming the intertemporal version of

the variables to an interspatial context is that it may not be justifiable

to carry over to an interspatial context the implicit assumption that a

variety of other influences can safely be ignored since they tend to be

relatively constant over time within a given country. For example, the

velocity of circulation, implicitly assumed to be constant in most time—to—

time analysis, may vary widely across countries.

      Secondly, and not completely unrelated to this first complication, the

explanation is being sought for a wide variety of countries with different

exchange rate practices and with different degrees of market power. The

currencies of some countries such as the U.S. dollar, the U.K. pound, and

the Japanese yen, were in a managed float in the reference period 1975:

Others, such as the French franc and the Germany mark, were in a joint

1oat against the dollar and other outside currencies. Most of the deve-

loping countries were pegging their rates to the U.S. dollar, or to one of

the other major currencies, or to some composite of other currencies. It

is more difficult to describe simply the relative degrees of market power

of different countries. Obviously, a small country like Sri Lanka is more

likely to be a price taker than a large one like the U.S.; but a small

country whose exports are highly concentrated, like those of Sri Lanka, may

be   a large factor in the world market for some of its exports (tea, for

example, in the case of Sri Lanka).

   The view we will take in the empirical work is to assume that the

structural determinants of price levels are constant over the whole period

or change only along a trend. We associate them with equilibrium differen-

ces in price levels and we do not expect such differences to show any ten—

dency to disappear. On the other hand, the short—term determinants of

price levels reflect mainly timing differences such as differences in the

speed with which traded goods prices and nontraded goods prices respond to

changes in domestic monetary variables or exchange rates or differences In

the speed with which domestic prices in general and exchange rates respond

to changes in these variables or in expectations about them.

                V.   The Empirical Explanation of Price Levels


     In this section we make a beginning exploration of a large uncharted

 field. We confine our work here to a data set defined by the IC? coverage

 of benchmark countries — 16 with a 1970 reference date and 34 for 1975.

The IC? data used here are price level estimates for GDP as a whole and for

 traded and nontraded goods, and corresponding estimates of real per capita

quantities of GDP and of traded and nontraded goods. No attempt is made to

tackle the more extensive data set available by extrapolating the benchmark

estimates to other years and to other countries. By these means the data

set could include over 100 countries over a 20 or 30 year period.

    Structural variables. We begin our empirical analysis of price levels

by testing the implications of the productivity differential model and the

factor proportions model, using as the independent variable explaining the

price level (PL), real GD? per capita. We then add to this a measure of

the openness of the economy, the nontradable share of GDP, and the share of

the labor force working in the nontradable sector. The coefficient for

real GDP per capita (r) may     reflect   the lower relative nontradables

   '.ices plus construction) productivity associated with higher real

income.24 That is, countries with higher real income enjoy a larger margin

in productivity over lower income countries in tradables than in nontra—

dables. Or it may    reflect   the higher price of labor and therefore of

labor—intensive nontradable goods associated with higher real income.

In either case, the coefficient should clearly be positive.

    The openness variable, as mentioned earlier, should reflect the effect

of strong ties with the rest of the world. Such ties, which cause trad—

ables prices to resemble those of other countries, should generally, we
                                     — 28 —


argued earlier, cause them to be lower, relative to nontradable prices,
than they would be in the absence of such ties. In other words, openness

should raise the relative price of nontradables and thus the overall price

level.

    The role of the share of nontradables in output or employment is a

little different, though related. If nontradables tend to be high—priced

in rich countries and low—priced in poor countries, a large share of

nontradables should tend to raise the price level of a rich country but

lower that of a poor one. In that case the share of nontradables should

be introduced in the form of an interaction between income per capita and

the nontradable share of output. The share of nontradables may be calcu—

lated either in own—prices or in international dollars. One would expect a

stronger positive correlation between PL and the own—price version of the

nontradables share.

    Equation (10) gives a relationship between price level (PL) and real GDP

per capita (r), both relative to the United States, across 34 countries in

Neither the addition of a squared term in r nor the fitting of a logarith-

mic equation with or without a squared term, adds to the explanatory power

of the relationship.26

   Assuming that the real income level of a country is a structural

characteristic we then test whether the relation between income and price

level has changed over the five year period for which we have some data,

1970,1973, and 1975. Equations (11), (12), and (13) are fitted to data for

the   identical group of 16 countries in the three years.

Equation (11) does not differ significantly from equation (10); that is,

restriction of the data to only 16 of the 34 countries does not change the

relationship. The tests clearly indicated that the equation for 1970 was

significantly different from those for both 1973 and 1975, but that the

observations in those two years could belong to the same relationship. We

thus conclude that there was a shift in the relation of price level to

income after 1970. However, the closeness and strength of the relationship

is evident in all of the equations: real income per capita explains most of

the differences in price levels.

      Although the coefficients in the equations for 16 and 34 countries in

1975 do not differ substantially, the 2         is   much reduced by the addition of

the 18 countries. One difference in the two data sets is that while 8 of

the original 16 were OECD countries with developed economies and statisti-

cal systems, the additional 18 consisted of only 5 developed OED countries

and of 2 centrally—planned economies, and 11 developing countries. It may

be that the centrally—planned and developing countries do not fit the model

as well as the developed countries, or that the data for prices and nominal
                                      — 30 —


 income are sufficiently poorer to introduce large data errors, or that the

 prices set in the centrally—planned economies depart further from the

 structure of costs than in the other countries.

    If there were structural factors other than income determining price

levels, as opposed to short—term influences, we might expect that the resi-

duals from the various equations would be correlated. That is, a country

with a high positive residual in 1970 would also show a high positive resi-

dual in other years. Between 1970 and the other two years we found little

correlation        =   .08 between 1970 and 1975 and .18 between 1970 and

1973). However, there was a statistically significant positive relationship

between the residuals in 1973 and 1975 (2 =      .70).   The lack of correlation

between 1970 and the later years suggests that there might be no other

structural variables, or at least none that was important. Instead there

may have been non—structural factors that affected countries' price levels

between 1970 and 1973 that persisted through 1975.

    Despite these results that discouraged the search for further struc-

tural variables we did experiment with several. One was openness, a struc-

tural variable that had proved useful in previous efforts to estimate real

GDP from nominal CDP.27 The openness measure is the one used in Kravis,

Heston, and Summers (1978a), a ratio of trade (exports plus imports) to GDP.

This measure reflects not only the trade policy of a country but also its

size and the density of its population, both factors important in deter-

mining the trade output ratio. Other measures of openness designed to eli-

minate the effects of country size and density, described as residual

openness" in Kravis and Lipsey (l982a, p.    216), did not appear to be as   closely
related   to price levels and were not used in the equations shown here.
                                            — 31 —


 When openness (scaled with the U.S.100) is included with r as an indepen—

 dent variable, the result for the 34 1975 observations Is as follows:



       (14)    PL = .2374        + .0090 r + .00024 OP               = .829
                       (5.0)       (11.7)        (2.5)        S.E.E. = .1204
                                                                 PL = .7015
As we hypothesized earlier, openness is positively related to the price

level.

       Two other structural variables that seemed theoretically promising were

the share of nontradable goods in GDP (nSH) and the share of nontradable

goods industries in total employment (LSH). Since the overall price level

is presumably determined by the price level for nontradable goods, a larger

nontradable goods sector should mean a higher than average price level for

rich countries ——       that   is, high for the per capita real income —— and a

lower than average price level for poor countries. We can test the role of

the nontradable goods share by adding to our equations a term for the share

of nontradable goods In nominal GDP (nSH) or an interaction term for the

share of nontradable goods and per capita real income (nSF!       .   r)   as in

Equations     (15) and (16).28

The share of nontradable goods adds to the explanation of PL in part by

diminishing the influence of income and OP. The effect on the openness

coefficient, in particular, is not surprising since a higher proportion of

nontradables in production is likely to mean a lower level of openness, as
                                             — 32   —




we measure it. When the nontradables share is introduced in the form of an

interaction term, the product of the nontradable goods share and per capita

real GDP, as in equation 16, the R2 is reduced.

    An alternative measure of the importance of the nontradable sector is

the proportion of the labor force engaged in the production of nontradable

goods. Labor force information, however, is not available for final pro-

duct sectors such as were used in the ICP, but only, in international com-

pilations for a large number of countries, for 9 industrial sectors, such

as manufacturing, retail and wholesale trade, etc. One way to see how

much difference it makes when the industrial classification is substituted

for the final product classification is to compare the ICP shares of

nontradable goods with nontradable goods shares as measured by the

industrial classification. In terms of own current prices, the correla-

tion is quite high —      the        for a correlation involving 26 of the 34 ICP

countries for which an industrial breakdown of GDP Is found in World Tables,

1980 is 0.67.29 Furthermore, the substitution of the World Tables share

variable (nSHW) for the ICP variable produces a highly similar equation.

Equations (17) and (18) contain the same 26 countries but the first includes

RW and the second, corresponding to (15) but for only the 26 countries,

the IP    version   (nSH):


(17)     PL = —.2356 + .0062 r + .00024 OP + .0103 nSHW

                        S.E.E. =     .0933
                                 = .7315

                             FL = .7315
                                              — 33 —



       Equation' (17), based on the shares in terms of industrial origin, gives
a slightly closer fit, but the difference is clearly marginal.

Furthermore, very similar results to those of equation (18) for these 26

countries can be gotten from an equation including only real income per

capita and the nontradable share of output, as in equation (19):



(19)      PL = —.1294 + .0063r ÷ .0134 nSH
                   (1.1)     (6.1)       (3.9)

                   R2 = .893    S.E.E. = .1031


The similarity of (18) and (19) indicates that OP adds little, but

something, to the explanation of price levels in this form. Perhaps it

might be more appropriate to define OP in the form of the ratio of trade to

tradables production.

       Given our structural explanations of the price level, the influence of

real income per capita should be larger on nontradable than on tradable

goods price levels. At the extreme, if there were pure tradable goods, and

if trade equalized prices, we would expect no relation at all between their

prices and income levels, and we would have to think of the observed dif—

-.ences mentioned earlier as reflecting the nontradable element in all

tradable goods. We test this supposition with 34—country data for 1975 by

relating the two price levels first to real incomes per capita:



(20)     PLNT =     .1239    + .0102 r                     ?2 = .853
                     (3.3)           (13.9)            S.E.E. = .1186
                                                         PL   = .5542


(21)     PLT   =    .5408 + .0080 r                        r2   .618
                    (10.0)           (7.4)             S.E.E. = .1737
                                                          FL  = .876
                                          — 34 —


Our expectations are met in several respects. We explain the price levels

for nontradable goods more successfully, in terms of both.the degree of

correlation (i2) and the standard error of estimate, and the coefficient of

r (real per capita incon) is higher for nontradable goods, presumably

because in the tradable goods •equation it reflects the influence of r only

on   the nontradable component of these goods' prices.
       Our earlier analysis of the       openness variable, which was that a more

open    econxny would tend to have tradable goods prices closer to world pri-
ces than    a more closed one, implies that there should be little relation

between openness and the residuals from Equation (21) but a stronger one

with the residuals of Equation (20). We test this proposition in

Equations (22) and (23) by adding an openness variable to Equations (20)

and (21). We find that openness has the expected positive coefficient in

each equation,


(22)      PLNT       .0502 + .0098r + .00025 OP                  = .881
                     (1.2)     (14.5)         (2.9)      S.E.E. = .1068

(23)      PLT    =   .4732   ÷ .0076 r + .0023 OP                = .640
                     (7.7)       (7.1)        (1.7)      S.E.E. = .1688

but the coefficients for openness are very similar in the two equations.

It does not, moreover, add more to the explanation of price level differen—

ces for nontradable goods than for tradable goods.

       The residuals from the two pairs of equations (i.e., 20 and 21 and 22

and 23) were positively correlated (r2s were .40 and .34 respectively).

High    prices for tradable goods, relative to per capita income levels,
were    associated with high   prices for nontradable goods, as we would

expect if the tradable goods price levels reflected the nontraded

component of these goods. There were some outliers in this

relationship, however. Sri Lanka and India had the lowest price
                                     — 35.-



 levels for nontradable goods relative to tradable goods prices, given their

 levels of r and OP. Not quite as low but still below average were the

 relative nontradable goods prices of Luxembourg and the three centrally—

 planned economies. At the other extreme, Syria, Thailand, Japan, and Kenya

had low prices for tradable goods and high prices for nontradable goods.

That relationship suggests that in these countries the productivity level

 in nontradable goods is lower, relative to that in tradable goods, than we

would expect of countries at their levels of real income per capita.

    In some countries both tradable and nontradable goods prices are high

or low in comparison to what we would expect from the levels of real income

per capita. That is, the residuals in the two equations are large and both

positive or both negative. In such cases we can say that exchange rates are

high or low relative to price levels. Jamaica, Zambia, Denmark, and

Ireland seemed to belong in the category of relatively high price levels

for both types of goods. Hungary, Uruguay, and the United States were all

on the low   side.
    We also experimented with variables designed to measure the quality of

the labor force, such as enrollment ratios at various levels of schooling

ad numbers of teachers, but these contributed little or nothing to the

explanation of the variation in FL. We are left so far with real income

per capita, openness and the share of nontradable goods as the explanatory

variables, all positively correlated with the price level.

    Nonstructural Influences.   We assume that Equations (17)   for   aggregate

price   levels and (22) and (23) for nontraded and traded goods price levels
represent the structural elements of price level determination.30 Since
the residuals from th 1970 and 1975 equations were not significantly corre-
lated, we conclude tentatively that the differences between the equations
                                       —36—


represent the effects of economic policy or other changeable charac-

teristics of the economies, and we therefore attempt here to explain the

residuals by such factors.

       The recent volatility of exchange rates has been so extreme that It

must have produced changes in the deviations of price levels from their

long run equilibrium levels since domestic currency prices for aggregate

output do not fluctuate that widely. The change in the exchange rate

regime between 1970 and 1975 brought exchange rate movements which were a

mixture of, initially, officially determined changes, presumably to remove

deviations from long—run equilibrium, and later, largely market—determined

changes, some of which may have created new deviations. Equation (24),

which relates the difference in residuals (from Equation (17) between 1970

and 1975 to exchange rate changes, shows that countries with comparatively

large increases in exchange rates (i.e., large currency depreciations) bet-

ween 1970 and 1975 tended to have their price levels fall relative to their

position on the per capita income scale:


(24)         RPL(75—70) = .1275 — .1202 XR75/70           r2 = .169
                          (2.0)     (2.0)             S.E.E. = .0684
                                                          n = 15
where RPL(75—70) =    differences   in residuals from the structural price

level equations in 1975 and 1970, and X.R75/70 = 1975/1970 ratio of exchange

rates.31

   Starting from a period of fixed exchange rates, as we do with 1970 as

the first year, we can think of a chain of events as initiated by the

change in exchange rates. Then we expect that the immediate impact of a

currency depreciation from the standpoint of partner countries Is to lower

the prices of the depreciating country since prices do not move as rapidly
                                       —37—


 as exchange rates. As the depreciation begins to have its effects on the

 depreciating country, through tendencies toward equalization In traded—

 goods prices, its own—currency prices and hence PL (i.e., PPP/XR) will

 rise. For these 16 countries over the period 1970—75, the rise (fall) in

 domestic prices was not sufficient to negate completely the currency depre-

 ciation (appreciation) and therefore PL did decline (rise). Or to put the

 Implied causality differently, the rise (fall) in domestic prices brought

 about a more than fully offsetting depreciation (appreciation) in the

 exchange rate and hence a rise (fall) in XR is associated with a fall

 (rise) in PL.

       A different view, probably more appropriate for the second part of our

 period, is to treat the exchange rate changes as intermediate steps in a

process beginning with differences in rates of growth of the stock of money

which affect both own—currency prices and exchange rates. In that case,

 the change in deviations from long—run relationships would depend on the

 speed with which own—currency prices and exchange rates respond to money

growth, as discussed above. If exchange rate changes more than offset the

concurrent price changes, countries with the most rapidly increasing money

'L'tock over the preceding few years will have relatively declining

deviations from long—run price levels. Little support for this proposition

is given by Equation (25):



(25)        RPL(75/70) = .0730   — .0281 MQ75/70   i.2 =   0.002
                         (.1.0) (1.0)              n =     15



This correlation is not significant, but the tendency for a negative coef-

ficient to show up for the variable representing the stock of money in

equations in which the change in the residual price level is the dependent
                                      — 38 —


variable    is quite persistent in alternative formulations of the money

variable.32      Changes in the money supply over this period were positively,

but not very strongly, associated with changes in the exchange rate (?2 =

.13 for the 1975/70 ratios). The weakness of the association may reflect

the initial change from fixed rates that were far removed from their

equilibrium levels. We are ignoring here the important distinction made in

the theoretical literature cited earlier between money supply growth that

is a continuation of the past rate and is already incorporated in the ini-

tial residual price level and unexpected changes In the rate of money

growth.

       Thus far we have discussed changes in the residuals of the structural

equations for a common set of 16 countries between 1970 and 1975. The

effects of changes between 1970 and 1975 in exchange rates and, less

clearly In money supply, have been shown to be associated with the dif-

ferences in the two sets of residuals. If the changes in exchange rates

between 1970 and 1975 had not yet, by 1975, been fully absorbed into own—

currency price levels, of if the rates of money supply growth from 1970 to

1975 had not been reflected in exchange rates and in own—currency prices to

       same degree, we should find that exchange rate changes or money growth

should help to explain the residuals from the structural equation for the

34 countries In the 1975 ICP comparison.

       The residuals of the 1975 equation (RPL75) are related to exchange rate

changes from 1970 to 1975 as follows:33



(26)        RPL75 =   .0359 — .0290 XR75/70               -?2 =   .167
                      (1.7)   (2.6)                   S.E.E. = .0899
                                                          a =31
                                           — 39 —


       This   equation again suggests a negative relationship between price

levels and exchange rate changes; the full effects of an appreciating

currency, at least during these years, were not absorbed in contemporary

price changes and exchange rate changes did not simply offset concurrent

price changes.

       Equation (26) also does not support the idea that the 1970 to 1975

exchange rate movements performed the function of eliminating deviations

from long—run relationships that had been sustained by fixed exchange

rates. As a further test of this hypothesis we correlated the 1975/70

exchange rate changes with the 1970 deviations from the structural rela-

tionship (RPL7O). There was no relationship between the 1970 deviations

and the subsequent changes in exchange rates. Either the 1970 deviations

did not represent disequilibria or the subsequent changes in exchange rates

did not move exchange rates towards equilibrium levels.

       When the residuals of the 1975 price level equation are correlated with

the change in the stock of money over the period 1970—75, the coefficients

It   is interesting to see in these equations that differences in money

supply growth accounted for more of the deviations of price levels from

their structural positions in the case of nontraded goods than in the case

of traded goods. Presumably international competition was a larger

influence relative to money supply in affecting traded goods prices.

       Other monetary variables and the combination of those with the exchange

rate changes did not add to our ability to explain the 1975 residuals from

the structural equation. We therefore settle tentatively on the money

supply growth alone as the only nonstructural variable to include in

equations combining structural and nonstructural elements. The com-

binations are represented by equations (30) through (32).

       As before, it is the price levels for traded goods that we have the

least success in explaining; the R2 for that equation Is the lowest and the

standard error of estimate the highest among the three equations. For both

traded and nontraded goods price levels and for the total price level, real

income per capita Is the major source of variation among countries but

openness, as measured by the ratio of trade to output,      is   always signifi-

cant.     Both high income per capita and a high degree of openness are
                                      — 41 —


associated with high price levels. In addition, the share of nontraded

goods in output is significant in the equation for the total price level,

with a high share associated with a high price level. These are the long—

run or structural influences that we have identified. The strongest short—

term or nonstructural variable we have found is the rate of growth of

money, with a high rate of past growth associated with a low price level.

In other words, whatever the inflationary effect In domestic currency of a

rapid rate of money growth, it was more than offset during this period by

changes in exchange rates.

    Much remains to be explained about the factors that determine differen-

ces in national price levels. In this first reconnaissance, we have done

little to explore what may   prove   to be substantial differences in the

operation of explanatory factors for different circumstances, particularly

for the difference between periods of fixed rates and periods in which

major currencies floated, between (since 1973) countries that have had

pegged rates and those that have managed floats, and between countries that

are price takers and those that are large enough to influence prIces. We

have ignored the interest rate link between money growth and exchange rate

changes, the distinction between expected and unexpected money growth, also

linked to interest rates, the relation of money growth to the demand for

money, and the role of capital flows, partly in response to interest rates

and partly autonomous, in determining exchange rates and price levels.

These are subjects for future study.

   What seems very likely from our studies so far is that efforts to

explain changes in exchange rates over a moderately long period——say 5 or

10 years——are likely to be improperly specified if the structural factors

are ignored, even for Industrial countries if there are substantial
                                    — 42 —


differences   among them in growth rates.    It also appears likely that the

search for better short cut estimates of real GDP per capita needs to take

into account short run influences. Such influences dominate the literature

on exchange rate determination but they have been largely ignored in the

much more limited literature on short cut methods.

1. A closely related use of such a theory, when expressed in equations
    explaining relative price levels, is to pave the way for better
    "short cut" estimates of real per capita GDP.   ("Real" per capita
    GDP's are converted to a common currency by purchasing power
    parities, rather than by exchange rates). Benchmark studies such
    as those relied upon in this paper will not soon, if ever, be feasible
    for all the countries of the world.  If a comprehensive system of
    real product comparisons is to be developed, therefore, short cut
    methods will have to be applied to non—benchmark countries. Short cut
    estimates are formed by extrapolating to other countries the relation-
    ships between real and exchange—rate—converted GDP found in benchmark
    studies of purchasing power and real GDP such as those included in the
    UN International Comparison Project (Kravis, Heston, and Summers, 1982).

2. Beckerman writes that "The role of exports in growth has been of
    central importance in economic history, particularly in explaining
    differential national growth rates in the second half of the nineteenth
    century..." Export—led growth requires "competitive" exports and com-
    petitiveness is "basically a question of price and technological
    superiority." Exports have also figured in the literature on the
    economic growth of developing countries although explicit references to
    the role of prices are infrequent. See I.B. Kravis, "Trade as a Hand-
    maiden of Growth: Similarities Between the Nineteenth and Twentieth
    Centuries," Economic Journal, December 1970.

3. The Harrod volume treats the subject in a chapter entitled "Comparative
    Price Levels."

4. Indeed, Jones and Purvis show how under different assumptions with re-
    spect to the reactions of different countries to external shocks (e.g.,
    two importers of a given middle product facIng a rise in itS world
    price), the resulting price changes for the final product may vary from
    one country to another. Among the factors producing the varying price
    responses are country—to—country differences in technological flexibility
    (i.e., the ease of substituting labor for the middle product), in the
    share of labor and the middle product in the cost of the final product,
    and the price elasticity of demand for the final product. It is hard
    to see, however, how the factors pointed to by Jones and Purvis can
    contribute to an explanation of the systematic relationship between the
     price levels of various countries and their real per capita incomes ob-
     served in Table 1.   (of course, that was not their aim.)

     of three reports of the U.N. International Comparison Project, the
     latest of which is Kravis, Heston, and Summers (1982a).

6. Though the OECD and U.N. studies included some analysis of price and
     quantity relationships.

7. The first attempt at these "short—cut" methods appears to have been
    made by Delahaut and Kirschen (1961).

 8.   Kravis, Heston, and Summers (1978a). For reviews of different short
      cut methods, see Heston (1973), and Ahmad (1980).

 9. The advantage of price comparisons over quantity comparisons is not
     only that prices are easier to obtain —— one can go into a store and
     ask —— but also that we are willing to assume that the price ratios
     between countries for Items we cannot or do not sample are like those
     we do sample. Quantity ratios, on the other hand, vary much more
     widely among products, even within a given sampling stratum.

10. These are, of course, alternative ways each of these questions might
     be answered. For example, the issue of which prices to include might
     be resolved by selecting the set of prices entering Into the purchases
     of consumers. However, such a criterion would leave out capital goods
     and government seryices, both important components of total output.
     If restricted to prices paid by households, the prices would exclude
     publically financed services, the scope of which varies from one
     country to another according to the extent to which such services as
     health and education are financed Out of private or public purses.
     Another possibility is to use the set of prices collected by the
     statistical authorities for the country's wholesale price indexes,
     but this choice has little to commend it. There is no clear conceptual
     framework for wholesale price indexes. Furthermore, this set of
     prices is apt to be biased toward adherence to the law of one
     price relative to other goods because it includes a high proportion
     of tradable goods. This bias may be reinforced by the tendency of
     the indexes to overrepresent primary products and to underrepresent
     highly differentiated manufactured goods.

11. In models based on small country assumptions, in which all tradables
     prices are determined outside the country, the only possible effects
     on relative prices of a small country's devaluation stem from changes
     in the price of tradables relative to that of nontradables in the
     small country. That change itself is sometimes described as the
     "real rate of exchange" in balance of payments models. See, for
     example, Bergias and Razin (1973) and Bruno (1976). The relation
     between that definition and the one used here, which involves no
     assumptions about the fixity of price relationships, depends on the
     movement of tradables prices and of nontradables prices in the rest
     of the world and on the share of nontradables in the country being
      observed.

12. However, the results might be affected if use were made of "effective
     exchange rates," each representing a trade—weighted average of a given
     country's changes in its exchange rates vis—a—vis its trading partners.
     The concept of an effective exchange rate is relatively simple to em—
     ploy when the purpose is to explain exchange rate changes over time
     for one country. Where, as in the present work, the focus is on a
     large number of countries at once, the introduction of effective ex
     change rates would bring substantial complications in forming the
     explanatory variables. Also the disadvantage of using simple exchange
                                    — 45 —



                           Footnotes   (continued)

     rates may be offset by the fact that the inclusion of many countries
     does cause some account to be taken of each country's exchange rate
     relative to the currencies of a number of other countries, though in
     not so precise or systematic a way.

13. Frenkel (1978), though recognizing that price levels and exchange rates
     are best viewed as mutually endogeneous variables, finds that single
     equation methods tend to support the line of causation running from
     exchange rates to price levels rather than in the opposite direction
     favored by PPP theorists.

14. Mussa (1982) suggests that monetary models are useful in explaining
     nominal exchange rates and that models taking balance of payments
     equilibrium as the final determinant of exchange rates are most
     relevant to real exchange rates.

15. The productivity differential model bears a strong relationship to
     "Scandinavian" models of price and wage—setting behavior which dis-
     tinguish between "exposed' and "sheltered' sectors of the economy
     (Aukrust, 1970). Prices in the exposed sector are set In inter-
     national markets, these prices determine wage levels in all sectors,
     and prices in sheltered sectors are set by markups over cost. The
     exposed sectors are essentially tradables and the sheltered sectors
     essentially nontradables.

16. Kuznets (1957). See p. 41 for the data and p. 33 for Kuznets' dis-
     cussion of the meaning of sectoral productivity measures. See also
     the revision reaching the same conclusions on the basis of later data:
     Kuznets (1971, pp. 208—248). The latter part of this section (p. 236f)
     considers the possible explanations for the observed intersectoral
     differences.

17. Chenery and Syrquin (1975), writing about developing countries, do not
     show data for high income countries. Kuznets' data comparing nonagri-
     cultural commodities with services cover the whole income range and
     support the view that service productivity relative to commodity
     productivity is lower in the very high income countries than in very
     low income countries.

18. For example, capital/labor ratios for very low and very high income
     countries are as follows:

                      Commodities               Services

       Low income         4.39                        2.48
       High income       21.91                       10.96

19.   For a further probing of the reasons for the relatively high service
      productivity in poor countries, see Kravis, Heston, and Summers (1983).

20. A well—known example of this story is the explanation by Baumol and
     Bowen for the rise in prices in the performing arts (Baumol and Bowen,
      1966).

21. The countryts exports would be cheap at home and the effect on its
     import prices might not be compensating as, for example, if its
     exports were wage goods or if they embodied substantial imported
     inputs. Usher (1968, p. 78f).

23. For recent reviews of this literature, see Bilson (1979); Dornbusch

24. In view of the interdependence between PL and r, errors of measurement
     in one produce equal and opposite errors in the other. In our
     equations incorporating PL as a dependent variable and r as an
     independent variable, the coefficient of r is biased towards —1.

25. The PL variable was scaled with U.S. =      1.0;   r with U.S. = 100.

26, If a logarithmic, form is desired because it explains percentage
     differences in price levels, a squared term does improve the
     explanation. The equation in logs relating price level to income
     per capita is

         ln PL = 3.99   —   .481 ln r + .141 ln r2         R2 = .781
                 (7.92) (1.47)         (2.80)

      When the fitted values from this regression are exponentiated and
      orre1ated with the original observations (in arithmetic form) the
      is .800.

27. Kravis, Heston, and Summers (1978a).

28. The use of the share of nontradable goods valuing GDP and all its
     components in international dollars also improved the results of
     equation 14, though by not as much as the own—prices form of the
      variable used in equations 15 and 16.
29.   Agriculture,   mining and manufacturing industries were regarded as
      producing tradable products. Construction; electricity, gas and
      water; trade and finance; transportation and communication; public
      administration; and other branches were considered as producing
      nontradable goods.

30. An equation like (17) but without openness (equation 17') has almost
     as strong a claim for representation of the aggregate price level,
     particularly since in the 16 country data for 1970 it produces a
     higher    than the analogue of (17). The s for the 1970 and 1975
     equations based on the 16 Phase II countries are as follows:
                                        Independent variables

                              1970           .927     .921
                              1975           .867     .884
     The coefficient of openness had a t—value below 0.1 in 1970 and the
     coefficient of the nontraded goods share variable in the equation with
     openness has a t—value of .9 in 1975. However, the choice between
     these two equations makes little practical difference since their
     residuals are very highly correlated ( = .98 for the correlation of

31. Exchange rates, expressed as U.S. dollars per local currency unit, are
     annual average market rates taken from IMF International Financial
     Statistics, 1981 Yearbook (row rf when available).

32. For changes in exchange rates and in the stock of money, the ratio of
     1975 to 1970 seemed a natural starting point since we begin by com-
     paring the residuals from the 1970 and 1975 equations. This limita-
     tion, if it is a legitimate one, does not apply to subsequent
     materials where we try to explain the residuals of 1975 equations.
     Experiments with changes in exchange rates and money stocks based on a
     number of alternative periods generally yielded similar results. One,
     1974—75 as a ration of 1972—73 values, tended to produce marginally
     highers, but we retained the simpler formulation.

33. Actually 31 countries are included since some of the necessary data
     were unavailable for 3 countries.
