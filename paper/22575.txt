                                         ABSTRACT

Residential segregation by race and income are enduring features of urban America.
Understanding the effects of residential segregation on educational attainment, labor market
outcomes, criminal activity and other outcomes has been a leading project of the social sciences
for over half a century. This paper describes techniques for measuring the effects of
neighborhood of residence on long run life outcomes.

Segregation is a pervasive and enduring feature of American society. Americans tend to
live near, and attend school with, those with similar educational, socioeconomic, and racial
backgrounds. In 2000 the average Black individual lived in a city where over 50 percent of
her immediate neighbors were Black, although just 20 percent of residents city-wide were.1
She was two and one half times as likely to have a Black neighbor relative to a counterfactual
world without residential segregation by race.
Segregation, to borrow a phrase from Durlauf (1996b), generates associational inequality
across identifiable sub-groups. The typical Black adolescent in America lives in a very
different type of neighborhood, attends a very different type of school, and is embedded in
a very different type of social network, than her White counterpart. Almost a half century
after the civil rights era these differences remain poignant: an adolescent Black male at the
turn of the century was three times as likely to have reported witnessing a shooting than his
White counterpart (see Table 4 below).
Segregation, by making the lived experiences of identifiable sub-groups, on average, different
is itself a type of inequality. Minority children tend to grow up in different social environ-
ments, than their White counterparts. This observation, while self-evident, is nevertheless
important and, perhaps, too infrequently made. Society may legitimately have direct con-
cerns about associational inequality. More often, however, concerns are indirect: worries
about segregation are related to beliefs about its effects on other outcomes. By generat-
ing inequality in social networks and public goods important for the acquisition of human
capital, segregation, so the argument goes, contributes to inequality in earnings, wealth and
other outcomes. This argument has been frequently and elegantly made (e.g., Loury 1977,
2002). Its quantitative assessment has been a leading, and controversial, project of the social
sciences at least since the Coleman report (Coleman et al., 1966).
Table 1 reports early adult outcomes for a subsample of White, Black and Hispanic respon-
dents in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (NLSY97) cohort. This cohort
was born between 1980 and 1984, went through adolescence in the late 1990s, and is now
in their 30s. The subsample includes respondents living in 44 metro areas of the United
States; these metro areas are broadly representative of urban America, especially as it exists
in larger cities.2 Black-White and Hispanic-White early adult outcome gaps are substantial.
Blacks fail to complete high school at twice the rate of, complete college at only one-third

in 263 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) in 2000.

     The NLSY97 sample consists of 8,984 respondents. Of these 7,263 resided in one of 126 different MSAs
at baseline in 1997. The analytic sub-sample discussed in the text includes the 4,419 respondents that, at
baseline, lived in an MSA with at least 5 White NLSY97 respondent households as well as at least 5 Black
and/or 5 Hispanic respondent households.

the rate of, score almost one standard deviation lower on the Armed Forces Qualification
Test (AFQT), earn about 74 percent less, and are incarcerated at almost three times the
rate of, their White counterparts (Columns 1 and 2 of Table 1).3 Hispanic-White gaps in
these outcomes are also substantial, albeit less pronounced.
The facts presented in Table 1 are at variance with many Americans own beliefs about
mobility. In a 2011 survey conducted by the Pew Charitable Trust, 47 percent of respondents
strongly agreed that economic success mostly depends on hard work and drive, while only
27 percent of respondents identified race and/or class background as severe limitations to
upward mobility (Pew Charitable Trusts, 2011).4
From the vantage point of a social scientist, the gaps reported in Table 1 present a puzzle.
The conjunction of large measured differences in outcomes across subgroups, and the relative
isolation of these subgroups from one another due to residential segregation, motivates a
focus on contextual or neighborhood effects as a possible driver of inter-group inequality.
The hypothesis, in a very loose sense, is that “place” matters.
In thinking about this hypothesis it is useful to make three, policy-relevant, distinctions.
Place may matter because expenditure per pupil, teacher quality, access to good hospitals
and proximity to well-paying jobs varies across neighborhoods. In principle these types of
neighborhood inequalities can be ameliorated by transferring resources across space. The
wave of school finance reforms that began with the California Supreme Court’s ruling in Ser-
rano v. Priest in 1971, generated transfers of this type. President Obama’s “Promise Zones”
initiative also represents an effort to channel more resources into distressed neighborhoods.
Kline and Moretti (2014) review the economics of “place-based” policies.
Second place may matter because the characteristics and behaviors of our neighbors directly
influence key life outcomes. If employment depends, in part, on information and referrals
from friends and neighbors, then living in a disadvantaged neighborhood, where few people
are stably employed, makes the acquisition of a job that much harder. If learning depends, in
part, on being surrounded by able peers, then a child in a classroom of advantaged children,
will learn more quickly than an identical child in a classroom of disadvantaged children.
These types of neighborhood effects are peer group effects or social interaction effects. This
source of inequality can not be ameliorated by transferring financial resources across space.

     The reported earnings and incarceration statistics are for male respondents only.

     The exact wording of the question was: “Which of the following comes closest to your own point of
view: A. Whether or not a person gets ahead economically in this country depends on drive, hard work and
obtaining the right skills; OR B. Circumstances beyond any person’s control - a person’s race, gender, and
parents as well as the quality of education available where they happen to live can severely limit a person’s
ability to get ahead economically?” Respondents could strongly or not so strongly agree with either A or B;
or say they didn’t know or were not sure.

Notes: Each row corresponds to a least squares fit of the listed outcome onto a constant, a Black
dummy, and a Hispanic Dummy (with baseline NLSY97 sampling weights used). The NLSY97
sample consists of 8,984 youths, of which a total of 7,263 resided in an MSA at baseline (1,796
Hispanic respondents, 1,943 Black respondents, and 3,524 non-Hispanic, non-Black respondents).
The estimation sample used here includes the 4,419 respondents who resided in a MSA with at
least 5 White responding households as well as 5 Black and/or 5 Hispanic responding households
(Panel A). Panel B is based on the subset of 2,292 male respondents. Standard errors, clustered
at the household level, are reported in parentheses. “AFQT score at age 16” corresponds to the
inverse normal CDF transform of the adjusted AFQT percentile score used in Altonji, Bharadwaj
and Lange (2012). This score was normalized to the distribution of percentile scores across NLSY79
respondents aged 16 at the time of test-taking in 1980. Across respondents from the reference
population of American Youth aged 15 to 23 in 1980 this transform of percentile scores is mean zero
with unit variance. Since the Altonji, Bharadwaj and Lange (2012) percentile scores are normalized
to a different reference group (both in terms of age-of-testing and year-of-birth), “AFQT score at age
16” need not be mean zero with unit variance (across all 7,002 respondents with valid AFQT scores
its mean is -0.0001 and its standard deviation is 0.9893). AFQT and earnings were only available
for a subset of the target sample. The AFQT row of Panel A is based on 3,291 respondents, while
the earnings row of Panel B is based on the 1,879 male respondents with non-zero earnings.

Reducing peer group inequality requires people to move across space; in the words of Durlauf
(1996b), associational redistribution.5
Third place may matter because it represents a partially isolated arena of social interaction.
If individual decisions – to study hard, use drugs or engage in delinquent behavior – depend,
in part on those of neighbors/peers, then there may exist multiple equilibrium distributions
of actions within a neighborhood (Brock and Durlauf, 2001a,b, 2007). Across two ex ante
identical neighborhoods, one may converge to a low drug use equilibria, another a high
use equilibria. In the presence of multiple equilibria policies which attempt to engineer
“equilibrium shifts” can change the distribution of outcomes within a neighborhood even in
the absence of resource transfers or associational redistribution. Of course, the effects of
these first two types of interventions may also vary with the structure of social interaction
among neighborhood residents.
My typology mirrors that given by Manski (1993). Place may matter because of (i) corre-
lated, (ii) exogenous/contextual and/or (iii) endogenous effects. In this paper I principally
review econometric methods for the identification and estimation of neighborhood effects of
the second type.6 The focus is methodological and no comprehensive review of the empirical
literature is attempted, although empirical work will feature prominently in the exposition.
Although peer group effects have be studied in other settings, most notably schools (e.g.,
Angrist and Lang, 2004; Graham, 2008; see Epple and Romano (2011) for a recent review),
my focus will be on their operation in the context of neighborhood of residence. This focus
is partly expositional and partly substantive. Its expositional value is that it provides a
common running example throughout what follows. The focus is substantive because sort-
ing into neighborhoods is mediated by the housing market, for which we observe a price.
Other types of sorting, for example into marriage and friendship, generally occurs outside a
formal economic market. Studying the process of matching and network formation in these
settings, as well as its effects on outcomes, is a topic of great interest but beyond the scope of
this paper (see Goldsmith-Pinkham and Imbens (2013) and Graham (2015b) for two recent
treatment of problems of this type and Graham (2011, 2015a) for surveys of other research).
Nevertheless, many of the points made below will be relevant to researchers interested in
“peer effects” broadly defined.
   5
      See Piketty (2000, p. 466) for a related discussion. A referee made the valid point that while eliminating
peer group inequality itself requires associational redistribution, other types of resource transfers could
ameliorate the effects of peer group inequality. An example of such a transfer is Title I funding ,which is
provided to school districts with large numbers of economically disadvantaged students.
    6
      The study of endogenous interactions raises distinct issues, some of which are closely related to those
addressed by the burgeoning literature on the econometrics of games (see Aureo de Paula (2013) for a review).
My omission of this material is not meant to suggest its irrelevance, merely that a careful treatment is best
left for a separate survey. See Section 4 below for some additional comments.

                                                       5
Section 1 presents basic information on the scale of residential segregation by race in the
contemporary United States. This section necessarily briefly reviews techniques for measur-
ing segregation as well. After documenting the scale of residential segregation, I present, in
Section 2, a series of correlations – or stylized facts – on its “effects” using geocoded data
from the 1997 cohort of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY).
I establish (i) that the social contexts in which Black, Hispanic and White adolescents are
embedded differ substantially (on average) and (ii) that these “contextual gaps” are larger
for youth who reside in segregated cities (and, conversely, smaller for those who reside in
more integrated cities).7 While the second fact follows almost axiomatically from the first,
documenting them motivates the search for a causal connection between neighborhood of
residence and long run life outcomes.
Having established the degree of residential segregation and its correlation with contextual
measures, Section 3 turns to a review of the evidence on what drives segregation. I do
not discuss the array of institutions, laws, and policies which have historically exerted a
strong influence on neighborhood- and school-level stratification. Sharkey (2012) provides a
recent synopsis of this material. Other useful references include Massey and Denton (1993),
Schill and Wachter (1995) and Dawkins (2004). Instead, my discussion is on explanations for
segregation which conceptualize it as an equilibrium outcome; one where overt discrimination
does not play a role (e.g., Benabou, 1993, 1996; Durlauf 1996a; Epple and Platt, 1998;
Nesheim, 2002; Fernandez, 2003). My intent is not to discount the historical or continuing
relevance of “non-market” drivers of sorting (cf., Yinger, 1999; Ross and Yinger, 2002), but
rather to narrow the focus to a domain where economics has a disciplinary advantage.
The focus on choice-based explanations of segregation also foreshadows my discussion of
identification. In identifying the effect of neighborhoods on outcomes, the econometrician
must confront the fact that the information set available to individuals (or their parents)
when choosing their residence is generally larger than that available to her when she at-
tempts to model their effects. Consequently, observed neighborhood characteristics may be
correlated with unobserved individual characteristics, which themselves drive the outcome
of interest (e.g., Mayer and Jencks, 1989; Manski, 1993).
Fortunately, the empirically-oriented economist can lean on a rich theoretical literature on
locational sorting in order to build intuitions and guide research design. I attempt to pro-
   7
     A note on nomenclature: first, in what follows I use the word “White” to denote any non-Hispanic,
non-Black, individual. Thus “Whites” include Asian-Americans as well as Native Americans. Second, by
“city” I mean a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) as defined by Office of Management and Budget (OMB).
I use 1999 OMB definitions (with a few minor differences described in Graham and Sharkey (2013)). MSAs
include central city cores as well as adjacent suburbs. They provide a convenient approximation to a local
labor and housing market.

vide a synoptic view of this research which foreshadows the discussion of identification and
estimation in Section 4.
Section 4 provides an overview of approaches to identifying and estimating neighborhood
effects. Throughout I focus on measuring the effects of neighborhood racial composition
on outcomes. Of course, residential stratification also occurs along other dimensions, most
notably by income (e.g., Watson, 2009; Reardon and Bischoff, 2011). My focus on residential
segregation by race is pedagogically motivated. Other types of segregation may be equally
important or, more interestingly, interact with racial segregation. I ignore these and other
complications.
I divide my discussion into two parts based on the type of data available to the researcher.
First, I consider the case where the researcher has access to matched individual-neighborhood
data, typically from a single city. A prototypical dataset of this type is the Los Angeles
Family and Neighborhood Survey (L.A. FANS), which collects household- and neighborhood-
level data from Los Angeles families. These data can be matched with tract level data from
the U.S. Census (Sastry and Pebley, 2010). The data collected in conjunction with the
Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN) is also of this type
(Sampson, Sharkey and Raudenbush, 2008). I also discuss what can, and can not, be learned
from housing mobility experiments, such as the Moving to Opportunity (MTO) program.
Second, I consider the case where the researcher has access to matched individual-city data,
typically for many cities. Cutler and Glaeser (1997) provide an early and well-known example
of this research design. Here the analysis involves correlating individual-level outcomes with
city-level measures of sorting/segregation. This literature typically argues that aggregation
reduces biases due to sorting (e.g., Card and Rothstein, 2007), I make this argument precise.
Section 4 briefly touches on other approaches to identifying neighborhood effects, such as
methods based on structural locational sorting models. Section 5 summarizes my thoughts
about what directions future work should take. No comprehensive review of empirical work is
attempted, nor do I review all available research designs. My goal is narrower. Specifically by
formalizing a stylized version of what empirical neighborhood effects researchers have often
done in practice, I attempt to illuminate the strengths and weakness of common research
designs, and suggest incremental ways to improve upon existing work. Readers interested in
a more comprehensive survey of existing empirical work in economics and the other social
sciences are directed to Durlauf (2004, 2006), Durlauf and Iaonnides (2010), Harding et. al.
(2011), Sharkey (2012), Sampson (2012b) and Sharkey and Faber (2014).

Notes: Measures of segregation for Underrepresented Minorities (URMs, Blacks & Hispanics)
relative to Whites/Asians. Measures of neighborhood segregation were computed for a total of
319 MSAs in the year 2000. Of these 319 MSAs, a total of 99 had at least 500,000 residents in
2000. These two groups of MSAs constitute “All MSAs” and “Large MSAs” in the table. They are
comprised of a total of 223,967,756 and 175,232,556 residents respectively. Listed MSAs correspond
to those with the most segregated neighborhoods according to the Dissimilarity Index (DI) described
in the main text (Column 1). Column 2 reports the “eta-squared” (η 2 ) index, Column 3 the fraction
of residents belonging to a URM, and Column 4 the Isolation Index (I).

     America

Table 2 lists, among those with a year 2000 population of at least 500,000, the ten most
racially segregated metropolitan areas in the United States. The ranking is based on the
Dissimilarity Index (DI), a widely used, albeit often misinterpreted, measure of segregation
in social science research (Iceland, Weinberg and Steinmetz, 2002). In order to provide a
precise definition of the DI it is helpful to establish some basic notation. I will also use this
notation in the exposition of research designs in Section 4 below.
Consider the population of individuals residing in a given metropolitan area (a “city”). Let
T ∈ {0, 1} denote whether a random draw from this city is Minority (T = 1) or not (T = 0).
Let Z be an N × 1 vector with a 1 in the ith row and zeros elsewhere when the random
draw resides in the ith neighborhood (i ∈ {1, . . . , N}). Here N denotes the number of
neighborhoods in the city. Let s (z) = Pr (T = 1| Z = z) be the proportion of neighborhood
Z = z that is Minority. For example if z has a one in its third row and zeros elsewhere, then

s (z) gives the fraction of residents in the third neighborhood that are Minority. Finally let
Q = Pr (T = 1) be the city-wide frequency of Minority residents. The Dissimilarity Index
(DI) equals                                                  

where, to be clear, the expectation in (1) is over the population of residents (not neigh-
borhoods).8 In a perfectly integrated city each neighborhood’s racial composition will mir-
ror that of the city as whole (i.e., s (Z) = Q for all neighborhoods) so that (1) equals
zero. In a perfectly segregated city, where no Minority shares a neighborhood with a
White,
  h    s (Z) will equal i1 with probability Q and 0 with probability (1 − Q) so that DI =

             + (1 − Q) ·   1−Q
                                 = 1.
Appendix A demonstrates that the Dissimilarity Index equals the city-wide proportion of
minority residents who would need to move in order to achieve perfect integration, relative
to the proportion that would need to move under a status quo of perfect segregation (cf.,
Jakubs, 1977). Researchers routinely omit the relative qualifier (e.g., Cutler and Glaeser,
1997; p. 837).

Massey and Denton (1993, p. 20) suggest that a DI of less than 30 corresponds to a relatively
integrated city, one between 30 and 60 to a moderately segregated city, and one greater than
60 to a highly segregated city. Another point of reference is provided by considering the
degree of segregation in urban South Africa at the end of the Apartheid era (where residential
segregation was forcibly imposed). Christopher (1994), computing Black vs. non-Black
dissimilarity indices using 1991 South African Census data, finds values of approximately
0.9. Since South African Census enumeration areas contain only one-fourth as many people
as U.S. Census Tracts (on average), we might except South African segregation measures to
be somewhat inflated relative to their U.S. counterparts for purely statistical reasons. With
these benchmarks and caveats in mind, the 0.79 Dissimilarity Index for the Detroit metro
area in 2000 is extraordinary and substantiates the “two societies” language famously used
by the Kerner Commission to describe urban America almost a half century ago.
The spatial distribution of Minority and White residents in the ten cities listed in Table 2
is decidedly uneven. In each of these cities Minorities and Whites largely live in separate

which, in turn, accords with the definition given by Massey and Denton (1988, p. 284).

neighborhoods; neighborhoods with differing access to schools, parks and other public goods,
differing exposure to violence, and where individuals’ potential networks of peers also differ.
Table 2 also lists the “eta-squared” (η 2 ) and isolation index (I) measures of segregation. The
former has been widely used to characterize sorting by economists following Maskin and
Kremer (1996). It has a longer history in other disciplines (e.g., Farley, 1977) and will also
arise frequently in the econometric analysis undertaken in Section 4 below. To give a precise
definition of η 2 , it is helpful to first define the isolation index (I). This index equals the
fraction of one’s neighbors who are Minority for the average Minority resident in a given city
or
                                             I = E [ s (Z)| X = 1] .

While Minorities make up only 26 percent of the population in Detroit (Column 3), the
neighborhood in which a typical minority resides in is over three-quarters minority (Column
4).9
The η 2 index coincides with the coefficient on T in the linear regression of s (Z) onto a
constant and T .10 As such it provides a measure of the degree to which own race predicts
the race of one’s neighbors. Using the fact that (i) T is binary, (ii) C (T − s (Z) , s (Z)) = 0,
and (iii) V (T ) = V (s (Z)) + E [V (T | Z)], some algebra gives

                                                 C (T, s (Z))   I−Q
                                        η2 =                  =     .                                     (2)
                                                    V (T )      1−Q

The η 2 index therefore provides a scaled measure of minority isolation. It measures the
excess isolation of Minorities in a city compared to perfect integration (the numerator in
(2)) relative to the corresponding excess isolation that would be observed in a perfectly
segregated city (the denominator in (2)).
The dramatic levels of Minority isolation in the ten cities listed in Table 2 do not characterize
all large metro areas in the United States. Table 3 lists, again according to the Dissimilarity
Index, the ten most integrated metro areas (among those with at least 500,000 residents
in 2000). In the Vallejo-Fairfield-Napa metro area of Northern California almost one third
of residents are Minorities. However these residents live in neighborhoods that are only
slightly more than one third Minority (compare Columns 3 and 4). For some of the cities
     9
         We can also define White exposure to minorities as

                                               E = E [ s (Z)| X = 0] .

Exposure coincides with the fraction of neighbors who are minority for the typical White resident.

      Here and in what follows I use “linear regression of Y on X” to denote the mean squared error minimizing
linear predictor of Y given a constant and X (e.g., Goldberger, 1991).

listed in Table 2, Hispanics constitute a sizable fraction of the total Minority population.
Prior research has shown that Hispanics are less-segregated from Whites than Blacks, a
distinction glossed over in the aggregate statistics report in Tables 2 and 3 (e.g., Logan and
Turner, 2013). Nevertheless, as I will articulate more precisely below, the lived experiences
of Minorities and Whites are measurably different in the cities listed in Table 2 than they
are in those listed in Table 3. Whether these differences help explain other dimensions of
racial inequality is a key question that will be evaluated below.
Although residential segregation by race is pronounced in the United States, it has undergone
appreciable changes in recent decades (e.g., Cutler, Glaeser and Vigdor, 1999). Figure 1
plots exposure indices for Blacks and Hispanic metro area residents from 1970 to 2000. The
exposure of Blacks to Blacks corresponds to the isolation index defined above. The exposure
of Blacks to Hispanics corresponds to the fraction of Hispanic residents in the average Black
person’s neighborhood, etc. Figure 1 indicates that Black isolation has declined from over
0.65 in 1970 to just over 0.50 today. This decline reflects a more or less equal rise in exposure
to Hispanics (from 0.05 to just over 0.10) and Whites (from 0.30 to just over 0.35). The
decline in Black exposure to all Minorities (i.e., to Blacks and Hispanics) has been far less
pronounced: from 0.71 to 0.64 from 1970 to 2000. In 1970 the typical Black metro resident
lived in a neighborhood that was a little more than two thirds Minority, in 2000 she lived in
a neighborhood that was a little less than two thirds minority.
In contrast to that of Blacks, the experience of Hispanics from 1970 to 2000 has been one


                                               11
of rising residential segregation.11 While in 1970 Hispanic exposure to Whites was over 55
percent, it had fallen to almost 40 percent by 2000. Hispanic exposure to Blacks increased,
albeit modestly, while own exposure, or isolation, increased sharply from just under 0.35
to just over 0.45. Overall Hispanic exposure to all Minorities increased from 0.44 to 0.58
between 1970 and 2000.
Segregation trends can be sensitive to the measure used. Figure 2 plots Minority (i.e., Black
and Hispanic) vs. Majority (i.e., White and Asian) Dissimilarity and η 2 indices from 1970 to
2000. The population weighted DI declined by almost 0.1 from 1970 to 2000 (left panel, blue
line). Likewise the η 2 index, which can be thought of as a composition adjusted measure of
Minority isolation, fell from about 0.45 to 0.35 (right panel, blue line).
Although one’s conclusions about trends in residential segregation by race are somewhat
sensitive to the measure used, high levels of segregation by race, even in the post Civil
Rights era, appears to be a durable feature of urban America.



2        Contextual inequality by race in contemporary urban
         America

The previous section presented evidence indicating that in some of America’s largest cities
Minority and White residents live in largely distinct neighborhoods. That extreme levels
of residential sorting by race should be associated with commensurate inequalities in the
social context in which Minorities and Whites live, work and socialize, should come as no
surprise. Nevertheless, since differences in school quality, social services and exposure to
violence (among other factors) across Minority and White neighborhoods are often asserted
to be the mechanism by which “neighborhood effects” operate, it is worth documenting and
measuring these differences more precisely.
Table 4 reports Black-White and Hispanic-White gaps in a few measures of contextual back-
ground for the subsample of NLSY97 respondents used to construct Table 1 above. The
values of each of these variables are respondent reported, they measure youth perceptions,
which may or may not be systematically biased.
Blacks and Hispanics are less likely to report feeling safe at school or that their peers have
college plans (rows 1 and 2). Black and Hispanic males are almost twice as likely to report
that significant numbers of their peers belong to gangs (row 3). Finally male Black youths
    11
     There is some nuance to this claim. The Hispanic population has increased sharply in many metro areas,
this demographic change would increase Hispanic isolation even in a perfectly integrated society.

“Peers in gangs” takes a value of 1 for respondents who report that at least 25 percent of their peers
belong to a gang and zero otherwise. “Peers with college plans” takes a value of 1 for respondents
who report that at least 75 percent of their peers plan to go to college and zero otherwise. “Feel
safe at school” takes a value of 1 for respondents who strongly agree or agree that school is safe and
zero otherwise. “Shooting witness” equals one if a respondent reports witnessing a shooting at some
point prior to age 18 and zero otherwise. Due to item non-response the samples sizes for the four
rows in the table are, respectively, 4,411, 4,415, 2,288 and 2,040.


are three times more likely to report witnessing a shooting prior to turning 18 than their
White counterparts; Hispanics report witnessing a shooting at twice the rate of Whites.
The choice of measures included in Table 4 reflects a combination of availability and potential
relevance. The two explicit peer measures proxy for differential exposure by race to peers
engaging in “delinquent” activities vs. “human capital building” activities. Models of peer
influence hypothesize that peer behaviors can exert strong influences on adolescent behavior
(e.g., Crane, 1991). Peer interactions have been hypothesized by a number of authors as a
major neighborhood effects mechanism.

The second two contextual measures capture different levels of exposure to violence. In
choosing these measures I was guided by two pieces (no doubt among others) of emerging
evidence on the role of violence in “neighborhood effects”.

The first comes from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD)

                                                 15
Moving to Opportunity (MTO) demonstration. A random subset of MTO participants
were given access to a housing voucher to support relocation away from traditional public
housing projects. Ludwig (2012) provides a basic overview of the MTO demonstration. While
access to the housing voucher was randomly assigned, participation into the experiment was
voluntary. Almost 80 percent of MTO participants listed a desire to “get away from gangs and
drugs” as their primary or secondary reason for wanting to leave their current neighborhood.
Violence and safety themes also emerge in various MTO follow-up studies. I will discuss
what we can, and can not, learn about neighborhood effects from the MTO evidence below.
The second reason for focusing on violence exposure measures, is due to its hypothesized
effect on various human capacities (see Massey (2004) for an interesting survey and com-
mentary). For example, Sharkey (2010) compares scores on cognitive assessments given to
youth just prior, or immediately after, a homicide in their neighborhood, finding that the
performance of the latter group is significantly lower than the former. His sample con-
sists of Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN) respondents.
Youth exposure to violence is also correlated with lower levels of self reported health in early
adulthood (e.g., Boynton-Jarrett et al. 2008).
Table 4 documents high levels of contextual inequality between Blacks, Hispanics and Whites.
Since context is a local concept, one might conjecture that this inequality is greater (lower)
in metro areas where these groups live apart from (with) one another. Tables 5 and 6
present evidence confirming such a pattern. Let c = 1, . . . , C index cities and i NLSY97
respondents within cities. Define T = Black + Hispanic to be a “Minority” dummy and let
s (z) = Pr (T = 1| Z = z) remain as defined above (i.e., the fraction of Minority residents
in neighborhood Z = z). Let Yci be a given contextual measure and consider the following
regression model

    E [ Yci | Wci ] = ac + bB × Blackci + bH × Hispanicci
                      +cB × Blackci × {E [ s (Z)| Blackci = 1] − E [ s (Z)| Tci = 0]}
                      +cH × Hispanicci × {E [ s (Z)| Hispanicci = 1] − E [ s (Z)| Tci = 0]} , (3)

with E [ s (Z)| Blackci = 1] measuring Black exposure to Minorities, E [ s (Z)| Hispanicci = 1]
Hispanic exposure to Minorities, E [ s (Z)| Tci = 0] White exposure to Minorities, and Wci a
vector containing all the regressors appearing on the right-hand-side of (3) (including a vector
of city-specific dummy variables). Observe that E [ s (Z)| Blackci = 1]−E [ s (Z)| Xci = 0] and
E [ s (Z)| Hispanicci = 1] − E [ s (Z)| Tci = 0] are exposure gaps. In a perfectly integrated city
these two terms will equal zero, in a perfectly segregated city, where Whites live separately
from all Minorities, they will equal one. Hence bB gives the expected Black-White “context

                                               16
gap” in a perfectly integrated city and bB + cB the expected gap in a perfectly segregated
city. The interpretation of bH and bH + cH is analogous. These are predictive statements
and, as such, can be viewed as “facts” (albeit with some parametric structure on the form of
E [ Yci | Wci ] maintained). Their implications will be discussed more critically below.12
The “a” columns in Tables 5 and 6 report the coefficients associated with the least squares fit
of each of the four context variables onto MSA-specific constants and the Black and Hispanic
dummy variables alone. The estimated context gaps are similar to those reported in Table
4, which made no allowance for cross-MSA differences in context. While the distribution of
Blacks, Hispanics and Whites is not uniform across MSAs, these differences do not drive the
contextual gaps documented in Table 4. Instead it is within-MSA differences which drive
the differences in context documented in Table 4.
Column “b” presents estimates of the coefficients in equation (3). Consider the Black-White
gap in peer gang exposure first (Column 1b of Table 6). Observe that the estimate of bB is
insignificantly different from zero while that of cB is positive and significant. This indicates
that Black-White differences in gang exposure are substantial in segregated cities and modest
in more integrated cities. The lower panel of the Table reports estimates of the Black-White
gang exposure gap in cities with low and high levels of Black-White separation. Clearly, and
also unsurprisingly, contextual inequality is far greater in America’s most segregated cities.13
A similar pattern emerges for exposure to peers with college aspirations (Column 2b of Table
5). Blacks self report exposure to peers with college plans at about 70 percent of the rate at
which Whites do. However in integrated cities there is only a small exposure gap, while in
segregated cities Blacks report exposure at just over one half the rate Whites do (see Panel
B of Table 5). Hispanic exposure to peers with college aspirations also varies systematically
with the degree of residential segregation.
For the two violence exposure measures, the connection with residential segregation is both
sharp and dramatic. Unconditionally Blacks report witnessing a shooting at three times
the rate Whites do. Almost half of Black youths report witnessing a shooting by age 18.
The Black-White gap in violence exposure varies substantially across cities, however. In
relatively integrated cities Blacks witness shootings at just over twice the rate of their White
counterparts. In segregated cities they do so at almost four times the rate (Table 6, Panel
B).14
The evidence presented in Tables 4 to 6 indicates the Minority youth live in meaningfully
  12
     As these “facts” are based on a random sample, it is worth reminding the reader that uncertainty, due
to sampling variability, remains. However this component of uncertainty is quantifiable and captured by the
standard errors reported throughout.
  13
     For the gang exposure measure there is less evidence that residential segregation plays an important role

different types of neighborhoods than their White counterparts. They live with peers who, on
average, on more likely to belong to gangs and less likely to have college plans. They attend
schools that feel less safe and are exposed to violence at a greater rate. These contextual
gaps, unsurprisingly, are more pronounced in segregated cities.



3     What drives segregation?

The previous section documented substantial levels of residential sorting by race and income.
It also documented how measured sorting correlates with specific measures of the social
contexts in which youths live. Blacks and Whites, for example, are exposed to different peers
and levels of violence. These gaps are largest in segregated cities, where the two groups tend
to live apart. These facts raise the question of why Blacks and Whites live apart? While there
are very important historical, institutional and policy reasons for widespread segregation (cf.,
Sharkey, 2012), in this section I will focus on explanations of segregation as an equilibrium
by-product of decentralized sorting by households.
At least since the work of Tiebout (1956), economists have modeled household neighborhood
choice in terms of utility maximization. Tiebout (1956) concluded that neighborhood sorting
was efficient: the combination of multiple communities, majority voting for public expendi-
tures within communities, and heterogenous valuations of public goods, allows households
to choose a community with a level of public good provision (and associated tax rate) that
closely aligns with their preferences. Households vote with their feet.
Bewley (1981) provided several counter examples which illustrated different ways in which
a sorting equilibrium could diverge from a social planner’s assignment of households to
communities. This theme was further developed, with a particular emphasis on the effects
of social spillovers, in a series of papers published in the 1990s (e.g., de Bartolome, 1990;
Benabou, 1993, 1996; Durlauf, 1996a; Becker and Murphy, 2000). Piketty (2000), Fernandez
(2003) and Durlauf (2004) survey this literature. Here I provide a synoptic sketch of this
work.
The model is a two period one.15 Household utility depends on first and second period
consumption, U (ct , ct+1 ). There are two types of households, t ∈ {0, 1}. Without intending
to be pejorative I will call t = 1 and t = 0 households, respectively, “high” and “low” type
in explaining Hispanic-White differences.

     The shooting exposure rates derived from the NLSY97 are consistent with those from other surveys.
Finelhor et al (2009), using the National Survey of Childrens Exposure to Violence, report that 22.2 percent
of 14 - 17 year olds were exposed to a shooting.

households (representing advantaged and disadvantage households respectively). In period
one households choose a neighborhood of residence. All neighborhoods are ex ante identical,
ex post they vary in the fraction of high type families which live in them. Let sc denote the
fraction of high type families in community c.
In period t households are exogenously endowed with income yt . They choose their neigh-
borhood of residence and optimal level of debt, dt . Since housing is homogenous, and all
neighborhoods are ex ante identical, the price of housing in community c depends only on
the fraction of high type households there. The period t budget constraint is therefore

                                     ct + p (s) = yt + dt ,                               (4)

with p (s) denoting the price of a home in a neighborhood with composition s.
In period t + 1 households realize income

                               yt+1 = tmH (s) + (1 − t) mL (s) .                          (5)

Period t + 1 income depends on the “quality” of neighborhood chosen in period t. Equation
(5) captures the possibility that human capital acquisition may be facilitated by exposure to
high type peers, which, in turn, increases future wages. Assume that both mH (s) and mL (s)
are increasing in s, then period t + 1 income, holding own type constant, will be higher for
those households who choose neighborhoods with many high type residents. Equation (5)
provides a reduced form representation of how peer spillovers influence the human capital
accumulation of children. This could be due to direct peer effects or because, say, the tax
base in high type communities supports better schools.
Households face a simple trade-off: purchasing a home in a higher quality neighborhood
increases future income (and hence second period consumption), but at the cost of reducing
first period consumption. The presence of a credit market, which allows home purchases to
be at least partially financed, complicates the analysis; but not essentially.
In period t + 1 households also pay off all debt (principal plus interest). Let rH and rL
denote the interest rate available to high and low type borrowers. If credit markets are
perfect rH = rL = r. The second period budget constraint is

              ct+1 + d (1 + trH + (1 − t) rL ) = yt+1 = tmH (s) + (1 − t) mL (s) .        (6)




                                              21
Solving (4) and (6) for ct and ct+1 and plugging into the utility function yields

    U (ct , ct+1 ) = U (yt + dt − p, tmH (s) + (1 − t) mL (s) − dt (1 + trH + (1 − t) rL )) .   (7)

To characterize how families trade-off housing prices (or equivalently period one consump-
tion) and neighborhood quality we differentiate (7) with respect to housing price, p, and
neighborhood composition, s, holding utility constant

                     −U1 dp + U2 {t∇s mH (s) + (1 − t) ∇s mL (s)} ds = 0.

Using the Euler equation for the optimal level of borrowing

                                 U2       1               1
                                    =t        + (1 − t)        ,
                                 U1    1 + rH           1 + rL

and solving for dp/ds then yields

                            dp             ∇s mH (s)           ∇s mL (s)
                                 =     t             + (1 − t)                                  (8)
                            ds              1 + rH              1 + rL
                                 def
                                 ≡ R (t, s) .

Equation (8) characterizes a household’s marginal rate of substitution between first period
consumption and neighborhood quality. The higher R (t, s) the more a household is willing-
to-pay to live in a neighborhood with a higher fraction of high type households.


Equilibrium

Assume there is a continuum of equally-size neighborhoods. Let fSeq (s) denote a candidate
equilibrium neighborhood composition density. Feasibility of this equilibrium requires that
                                       Z       1
                                                   sfSeq (s) ds = pH ,                          (9)
                                           0


with pH the population frequency of high type households (cf., Graham, Imbens and Ridder,
2010).
Consider two neighborhoods, both with fraction s high types. Imagine a reallocation of
households to neighborhoods such that s increases by ds in the first neighborhood and de-
creases by ds in second. Call the set of households who actually change neighborhoods as
part of the reallocation movers. Each moving high type household trades homes with a mov-

                                                         22
ing low type households. Moving high type households enjoy a higher quality neighborhood
post-move, while moving low type households enjoy a lower quality neighborhood post-move.
The net present value of the change in neighborhoods for high type movers is

                                     mH (s + ds) − mH (s)
                                                          ,                                  (10)
                                            1 + rH

while that for low type movers is

                                     mL (s − ds) − mL (s)
                                                          .                                  (11)
                                            1 + rL

If the sum of (10) and (11) is positive, then the net gain to movers from the reallocation will
be positive. Consequently there will be a set transfers between high and low type households
that will sustain the reallocation (e.g., by selling each other their houses at differing prices).
For ds infinitesimally small positivity of the sum of (10) and (11) is equivalent to the condition

                                  ∇s mH (s) ∇s mL (s)
                                           −          > 0.                                   (12)
                                   1 + rH    1 + rL

The left-hand-side of (12) is a measure of local complementarity (in net present value terms)
between own and neighbor’s type. If, at neighborhood composition s, condition (12) holds,
then moving high type households will gain more from an improvement in neighborhood
quality, than moving low type households will lose from a deterioration in neighborhood
quality. Condition (12) implies that there exists a set of transfers between a high and low
type household such that both can be made better off by switching neighborhoods.
Note that Condition (12) coincides with

                                η̃ (s) ≡ R (1, s) − R (0, s) > 0.                            (13)

which, if it holds for all s ∈ [0, 1], is called a single crossing condition. Single crossing
implies that high types’ willingness to pay for a marginal improvement in neighborhood
quality exceeds that of low types for all values of s. As Benabou (1996, Proposition 1) and
others have shown, when (13) holds for all s ∈ [0, 1] the equilibrium assignment of households
to neighborhoods will be completely segregated. Conversely if R (1, s) − R (0, s) < 0 for all
s ∈ [0, 1] then perfect integration will be the unique stable equilibrium (under simple best-
reply dynamics).
The characterization of equilibrium when R (1, s) − R (0, s) changes sign is more complex,
however, under best-reply dynamics, at any s on the interior of the unit interval for which

                                               23
fSeq (s) is positive, it must be the case that R (1, s) − R (0, s) < 0.
Condition (12) indicates that two forces drive sorting. First, even if the human capital
benefit of a marginal improvement in neighborhood quality is the same for high and low
type households (i.e, ∇s mH (s) = ∇s mL (s)), the equilibrium assignment of households to
neighborhoods will be segregated if rH < rL . Credit market imperfections, which allow
high type households to finance home purchases at more favorable terms than low type
households, help to sustain a stratified equilibrium. Differential access to credit by Blacks
and Whites has been an important driver of residential segregation by race historically (cf.,
Ross and Yinger, 2002). Under limited liability constraints, access to credit on favorable
terms varies with socioeconomic status almost by construction.
Second, sorting may arise due to “technological” complementarity between own and neigh-
bor’s type. That is, even in the absence of capital market imperfections, households will
sort into homogenous neighborhoods if ∇s mH (s) > ∇s mL (s) (i.e., if the marginal benefit,
in terms of second period income, of an improvement in neighborhood quality is higher for
high type households).


Efficiency

When two households “trade neighborhoods” in a decentralized housing market, the desir-
ability of the trade is evaluated solely in terms of the costs and benefits of the trade to the
directly involved parties. However, when a high type household leaves a neighborhood it
imposes costs on the households left behind and provides benefits to households located in
its new neighborhood. These spillover effects are not internalized by a decentralized hous-
ing market. The presence of these spillovers means that the laissez faire assignment of
households to neighborhoods may be inefficient (even in the absence of credit market imper-
fections). The net benefits associated with a neighborhood trade depend on its implications
both for the directly involved movers, which are fully internalized by the housing market, as
well as the implications for stayers, which are not.
Since the social planner necessarily discounts the future income of low- and high-type house-
holds equally, we may assess the social efficiency of any candidate neighborhood assignment
by studying its implications for the distribution of second period income. Let

                               m (s) = smH (s) + (1 − s) mL (s)

equal the average second period income in a neighborhood of composition s. If, as before,
we take two neighborhoods with ex ante composition s and move ds high types from one

                                                24
neighborhood to the other (and ds low types in the opposite direction) the net change in
average income will be
                              m (s + ds) + m (s − ds) − 2m (s)
                                                               .
                                              2
For ds infinitesimally small this change will be positive if

                                          ∇ss m (s) = 2η (s) + λ (s)                              (14)

is greater than zero for

                                    def
                           η (s)    ≡ ∇s mH (s) − ∇s mL (s)
                                    def
                           λ (s)    ≡ s∇ss mH (s) + (1 − s) ∇ss mL (s) .


The first term in (14) measures the “technological” complementarity between own and neigh-
bor’s type. The second term is what Benabou (1996) calls curvature. If the marginal benefit
of an additional high type is declining in the fraction of high types already present in the
neighborhood, then reallocations which increase segregation may be inefficient (even if own
and neighbor’s type are complementary).
Consider the following functional forms for mH (s) and mL (s)

                                   mL (s) = αL + βs − γs2
                                   mH (s) = αH + (β + ǫ) s − γs2 ,

with β, γ, and ǫ all positive. Under this technology the marginal benefit of an incremental
increase in neighborhood quality is declining for both low- and high-types. Concavity of this
type means that transfers of high types from low s to high s neighborhoods will tend to
harm stayers on net. However the incentives for sorting will be driven by complementarity
between own and peer type, in this case given by

                                                  η (s) = ǫ,

so that for any ǫ > 0 a high type household will always outbid a low type household for any
marginal improvement in neighborhood quality: equilibrium will be stratified.16 However,
for 0 < ǫ < γ, the overall mapping of neighborhood composition into average income is
(globally) concave since ∇ss m (s) = 2 (ǫ − γ) < 0: stratification is inefficient.

   To keep things simple the discussion abstracts from credit market imperfections (i.e., I assume that
rH = rL = r).


                                                     25
This example provides a rather dramatic demonstration of a general theme which emerges
from the literature on locational sorting in the presence of social spillovers: when the private
incentives to sort are misaligned with the social costs and benefits from doing so, the laissez
faire assignment of families to neighborhoods need not be efficient and, in some cases, may be
grossly inefficient. This possibility is an important motivation for associational redistribution
(cf., Piketty, 2000).


Adding unobserved heterogeneity

In the simple locational sorting model outlined above, the only source of agent heterogeneity
is their type, high vs. low. In practice there is within-type heterogeneity, generally unob-
served by the econometrician. To get some sense of how heterogeneity affects sorting consider
the following simple (expositional) example. Assume that the outcome, Y , given residence
in a neighborhood with composition S = s is
                                   (
                                       αH + βH · s · exp (A1 ) , if T = 1
                         Y (s) =                                                .
                                       αL + βL · s · exp (A1 )    , if T = 0

This model presumes that the outcome increase linearly in s for both high and low types, but
at a rate which may be individual-specific (due to variation in A1 ). Further allow agent utility
to differ from the outcome of interest to the researcher. Specifically the utility associated
with residence in a neighborhood with composition S = s is
                                   (
                                       Y (s) − γH · s · exp (A2 ) , if T = 1
                        V (s) =                                                     .
                                       Y (s) − γL · s · exp (A2 ) , if T = 0

There are two sources of unobserved heterogeneity in this model. Agents vary in the sensi-
tivity of their outcome to neighborhood composition (variation in A1 ) and may also vary in
their taste for s for reasons other than its effect on Y (variation in A2 ). Assume that
                                                         !             !!
                              A1                  − 21           1 ρ
                                       T ∼N                  ,              .
                              A2                  − 12           ρ 1

Under these assumptions we have average mappings from neighborhood composition into
outcomes of

                            mH (s) = E [ Y (s)| T = 1] = αH + βH s
                            mL (s) = E [ Y (s)| T = 0] = αL + βL s

                                                  26
and average mappings from neighborhood composition into utilities of

                            uH (s) = E [ V (s)| T = 1] = αH + (βH − γH ) s
                             uL (s) = E [ V (s)| T = 0] = αL + (βH − γL ) s.


Agents observe A2 – their tastes – prior to choosing their neighborhood of residence, but
A1 – which indexes heterogeneity in the outcome effect of neighborhood composition – is
only revealed ex post. Under the normality assumption the expected marginal utility of an
incremental increase in s is
                                                               

 E [ ∇s V (s)| T, A2 = a2 ] =            2                   2

                               βL · exp − 1 (1 − ρ) − ρa2 + 1−ρ2 − γL · exp (a2 ) , T = 0
                                           2                  2



Agents with a high marginal utility of neighborhood composition will outbid those with lower
marginal utilities for spots in high s neighborhoods.17

There are two neighborhoods of size one. For simplicity, I also assume that there are equal
numbers of high and low types. Let FH (·) and FL (·) denote the distribution function of
expected marginal utility for high and low types respectively. Let c∗ be the expected marginal
utility level which satisfies
                                            FH (c∗ ) + FL (c∗ ) = 1.                                       (15)

Note that exactly half the population (highs and lows together) has a marginal utility of
neighborhood composition greater than c∗ and half one less than or equal to c∗ . The value
of c∗ which partitions the population into two halves determines the nature of sorting in this
economy.
Assume that βH > βL , γH < γL and ρ ≤ 0 such that, on average, high types value an
incremental increase in s more than low types. Under these conditions the high type neigh-
borhood will have fraction s′ = 1 − FH (c∗ ) high types while the low type neighborhood with
have fraction s = FH (c∗ ) .
Now say the econometrician attempts to infer the marginal returns to an increase in s for
  17
       To keep things simple I assume that utility is directly transferable across agents who trade locations.

High types in the two neighborhoods have different observed outcomes, on average, for
two reasons. First, those individuals located in the high S = s′ neighborhood benefit from
greater exposure to high type neighbors. Second, the distribution of A1 differs across the two
neighborhoods. High types in the high S = s′ neighborhood tend to benefit more from their
high type neighbors than their counterparts in the low S = s neighborhood would. This is
sorting bias: the distribution of unobserved agent ability varies with observed neighborhood
composition. Note that if ρ = 0, so that knowledge of A2 provides no information about
the value of A1 , then the sorting bias term will be zero. Assessing households’ information
sets is often an important step in justifying particular identification conditions (cf., Graham,
Imbens and Ridder, 2010).
Developing research designs which ameliorate the effects of sorting bias has been a preoc-
cupation, perhaps the central preoccupation, of neighborhood effects researchers for at least
three decades (e.g., Mayer and Jencks, 1989). The logic of simple sorting models, particu-
larly when augmented with unobserved agent-level heterogeneity, can be useful for developing
intuitions about the plausibility of different research designs in particular settings.



4    Research designs for identifying neighborhood effects

Consider a cohort of individuals who reside in a common metropolitan area during their
formative years, for example, individuals born in the early 1960s who lived in the Bay Area
of California as teenagers. Diversity in this population is characterized by the pair (A′ , T ).
Here A is a vector of unobserved individual attributes, measured prior to, or at the onset of,
adolescence. The elements of A capture, among (many) other attributes, innate cognitive
ability, health endowments, and family and ethnic background. An agent’s observed type is
given, as earlier, by the binary indicator T . In practice T might be a race dummy or an
indicator for whether a child’s parents graduated from college or not.
Let Y be an outcome of interest. This outcome is measured post-adolescence; examples

                                               28
include adult earnings, eventual educational attainment and incarceration status by age 28.
All exogenous agent characteristics measurable at the onset of adolescence and relevant for
the determination of Y are captured by (A′ , T ). Since A is unmeasured, and may be of
arbitrarily high dimension, this is without loss of generality. For convenience I will call A
“background”. It should be recognized that this reification is simply a shorthand for what is
typically a large bundle of both acquired and innate attributes which help to determine Y .
Continuing to keep the exposition concrete I will also refer to T = 1 households as Minorities
and T = 0 households as Whites. Of course, other running examples are possible.

Individuals reside in one of i ∈ {1, . . . , N} neighborhoods. Let Z be an N × 1 vector of
neighborhood dummies. Let s (z) = Pr ( T = 1| Z = z) be the fraction Minority in neighbor-
hood Z = z, mA (z) = E [ A| Z = z] the mean background of residents living in neighborhood
Z = z, and U additional unobserved neighborhood-level characteristics. Throughout what
follows I will take the joint distribution of (A′ , T )′ as given and invariant across policies. In
practice this means that the elements of (A′ , T )′ are non-manipulable, at least over the time
frame in which the outcome is being measured. We conceptualize (A′ , T ′ )′ as a bundle of
fixed characteristics that a household brings with them as they move from neighborhood to
neighborhood. Behaviors, for example parenting style, which may change with neighborhood
of residence, are not elements of A.
We will also view U as a vector of exogenous location specific characteristics (e.g., micro-
climate, proximity to the city-center and so on). Its marginal distribution is invariant across
policies. Other location-specific characteristics, for example the mill rate on assessed prop-
erty values, may vary with the mix of residents living in a location (e.g., via the mechanism of
majority voting). The influence of these composition-induced policy changes on the outcome
of interest are “peer effects”, broadly defined.

A prototypical analysis of the effects of residential segregation by race on Y begins with the
linear regression model

    E [ Y | T, s (Z) , mA (Z) , U, A] = α0 + β0 T + γ0 s (Z) + mA (Z)′ δ0 + U ′ κ0 + A′ λ0 .   (16)

Equation (16) provides a mapping from the neighborhood distribution of household types and
backgrounds, given own type, background and exogenous neighborhood-level characteristics,
into outcomes. There are neighborhood effects, or more precisely, spillovers, if the outcome
varies with changes in the neighborhood distribution of household types and/or backgrounds
(i.e., γ0 6= 0 and/or δ0 6= 0). There are place effects if any of γ0 , δ0 and κ0 differ from zero.
The predictive value of own type and background, T and A, on the outcome is indexed by


                                                29
β0 and λ0 . The parameter γ0 measures how the expected outcome changes with the fraction
Minority in one’s neighborhood, while δ0 does so for changes in mean neighbor “background”.
Finally κ0 measures the influence of U, neighborhood “amenities”, on the outcome.

I assume this equation is structural in the sense of Goldberger (1991); specifically that its
invariant across associational redistributing policies. Since we are free to define A and U
broadly, the assumption that (16) describes a causal relationship, the linear conditional mean
assumption aside, is not especially restrictive (cf., Wooldridge, 2005). Recall that the joint
distribution of (A′ , T )′ , and the marginal distribution of U is assumed invariant. There-
fore equation (16) is structural in that it provides accurate predictions for an individual’s
outcome given an exogenous change in her neighborhood environment. Put differently, the
policies of interest are reallocations or, in the words of Durlauf (1996b), associational redis-
tributions. Equation (16) is helpful for understanding how “who lives with whom” influences
the distribution of Y .
Let (16) be the long regression of interest. The econometrician can compute the sample
analog of the short regression of the outcome onto a constant, own Minority status and the
fraction Minority in one’s neighborhood of residence:

                             E [ Y | T, s (Z)] = a0 + b0 T + c0 s (Z) .                    (17)

Prior reviewers of the empirical literature on neighborhood effects have outlined a variety
of reasons for why c0 need not coincide with γ0 and, more generally, why knowledge of
relationship (17) may not be useful for understanding the effects of reallocations on the
distribution of outcomes.


Sorting and matching

Two concerns commonly raised by reviewers of the neighborhood effects literature are biases
due to sorting and matching. Graham, Imbens and Ridder (2010) formally define sorting and
matching on unobservables in the context of a non-linear, non-separable, version of regression
(16). The linear form of (16) allows for a more compact development of the key ideas, but
this is not without a loss of generality. I begin with the mean regression representation of A

                              A = π0 + φ0 T + B, E [ B| T ] = 0.                           (18)

Here B is the component of “background” that does not vary, on average, with race. It is
convenient to partition unobserved agent-level heterogeneity into a component that varies

                                                30
with type and one which is (mean) independent of it. Equation (18) is nothing more than
a decomposition. Graham, Imbens and Ridder (2010) work with a variant of (18) appro-
priate for models where A enters non-separably; they provide additional discussion and
motivation. Note that the “background gap” between Minorities and Whites is given by
φ0 = E [ A| T = 1] − E [ A| T = 0] .
There is no sorting unobservables if an individual’s neighborhood of residence, Z, is not
predictive of the B component of her background conditional on her observed type, T :

                                 E [ B| T, Z] = E [ B| T ] = 0.                          (19)

The second equality in (19) follows by construction. Condition (19) implies that the dis-
tribution of “background” (specifically its mean) among, say, Minorities is similar across
neighborhoods. If this is not the case, then we say there is sorting on unobservables. For ex-
ample, it may be that Minority families living in predominately White neighborhoods differ
systematically in terms of A, from their counterparts in predominately Minority neighbor-
hoods (e.g., their adult members may have graduated from more elite colleges). This captures
the intuition that observed neighborhood characteristics may be correlated with the unob-
served characteristics of its residents; a commonly articulated concern in empirical analyses
of neighborhood effects (e.g., Brooks-Gunn, Duncan, Klebanov and Sealand, 1993; Duncan
and Raudenbush, 2001; Sampson, Morenoff and Gannon-Rowley, 2002; Kling, Liebman and
Katz, 2007). The previous section presented an example of how this could occur in a sorting
equilibrium.
Matching is a related but distinct process. There is matching when the unobserved exogenous
attributes of one’s neighborhood (e.g., proximity to the city-center) can be predicted by own
type. There is no matching on U if

                                      E [ U| T ] = E [U] .                               (20)


If, for example, Minorities are less likely to live in neighborhoods adjacent to employment
districts, then we say there is matching on U.


Anatomy of the short regression

A large empirical literature fits models of the form given in (17), typically with additional
individual- and location-level characteristics (see below for more on the role of controls).
How do these analyses relate to the structural model (16)? After tedious manipulation it is

                                              31

where p = E [T ] is the population fraction Minority, η 2 the eta-squared index of segregation
defined earlier and C (X, Y ) denotes the covariance of X with Y . Under the no sorting on
unobservables condition (19) we have C (s (Z) , E [ B| Z]) = 0 since

       (s (Z) − p) E [ B| Z] = (s (Z) − p) E [ E [ B| T, Z]| Z] = (s (Z) − p) E [ E [ B| T ]| Z] = 0

and hence a coefficient on Minority equal to

                                             b0 = β0 + φ′0 λ0 ,                                            (23)

so that knowledge of a person’s race alters one’s prediction of their realization of Y via a
direct adjustment, β0 , as well as an indirect adjustment capturing the population average
difference in A across the two groups, φ′0 λ0 = (E [ A| T = 1] − E [ A| T = 0])′ λ0 . Because the
distribution of (A′ , T )′ is assumed invariant across reallocations, b0 , is a structural, albeit
composite, parameter when there is no sorting on unobservables.19 When condition (19) fails
to hold, b0 is not structural, in the sense that its value is not policy invariant. As is clear
from inspection, the third component of (21) varies with the joint distribution of (A′ , T, Z ′ )′ ,
whose manipulation is precisely the goal of a reallocation policy. If neighborhood of residence
predicts unobserved background conditional on observables (i.e., condition (19) fails), then
then b0 will not be useful for predicting the effects of reallocative policies.
A similar set of observations apply to c0 , the coefficient on fraction Minority, in (17). It is this
coefficient which purports to provide a measure of peer group or neighborhood effects. The
third term in (22) depends on the covariance between fraction minority in a neighborhood
and mean neighbors’ background. Although B is mean independent of T , its neighborhood
average need not be. Consider a city where low B households, irrespectively of race, sort into

     When the distribution of (A′ , T ′ ) is invariant across the policies of interest maintaining an “inclusive
definition of type” is without loss of generality (cf., Graham, Imbens and Ridder, 2010).

predominately Minority neighborhoods and high B households into predominately White
neighborhoods. Under this type of sorting pattern C (s (Z) , E [ B| Z]) = E [ E [ B| Z]| T = 1]−
E [ E [ B| Z]| T = 0] will be negative. This will, in turn, bias c0 downward relative to γ0 +φ′0 δ0 ,
making exposure to Minority neighbors appear more detrimental for Y than it would be in
the absence of sorting.
When there is no sorting on unobservables the coefficient on fraction Minority simplifies to

                                           1
                      c0 = γ0 + φ′0 δ0 +     2

                                           η

The first two terms in (24) are invariant across reallocations, while the last is not.20 However
if we additionally impose the no matching condition (20) the third term drops out leaving

                                             c0 = γ0 + φ′0 δ0 ,                                       (25)

which does measure the causal effect of exogenous changes in fraction Minority on outcomes.

I conclude that regression (17), is informative about neighborhood effects when conditions
(19) and (20) hold. Specifically b0 and c0 are useful for predicting the effects of “doubly
randomized” reallocations of households across neighborhoods (Graham 2008, 2011; Gra-
ham, Imbens and Ridder, 2010). First, the social planner selects a feasible distribution of
Minority fraction across neighborhoods. If the status quo assignment is heavily segregated,
the planner may choose a more integrated distribution. Second, she fills Minority and White
“spots” in each neighborhood by taking independent random draws from the populations of
Minorities or Whites as appropriate. Third, neighborhoods, so formed, are assigned at ran-
dom to locations. Steps two and three of this procedure ensure that the new neighborhood
assignment obeys the no sorting and matching restrictions. No sorting and no matching
requires that individuals, conditional on their type, are “as if” randomly assigned to groups
and, further, that groups so formed are “as if” randomly assigned to locations.
Expressions (21) and (22) also provide a framework for understanding conventional neigh-
borhood effects analyses based on observational data, where conditions (19) and (20) are
unlikely to hold. Consider the effect of sorting on unobservables on the coefficient on Minor-
ity status. If high “background” households, irrespective of type, tend to be concentrated in
predominately White neighborhoods, then C (s (Z) , E [ B| Z]) < 0. Sorting by background
biases the coefficient on Minority upward relative to the no sorting benchmark case (cf.,
  20
    In practice we could replace the no sorting on unobservables condition with the weaker requirement
that C (s (Z) , E [ B| Z]) = 0. However the stronger condition more naturally generalizes to semiparametric
models and is maintained here (cf., Graham, Imbens and Ridder, 2010).


                                                    33
equation (23)). When the Minority population share is small (p small), and/or segregation
by race large (η 2 big), the bias will be even larger.
Now consider the coefficient on fraction Minority in (17). Terms three and four in (22)
are bias terms. The third term is proportional to the sorting bias term in (21). If sorting
follows the form sketched in the previous paragraph this term will be negative. The fourth
term is due to Minority-White gaps in location-specific amenities. If predominately Minority
neighborhoods have characteristics which otherwise tend to lower outcomes, then this term
will be negative as well. Collectively sorting and matching will exaggerate any negative, or
attenuate any positive, impact of Minority exposure on the outcome.
These conclusions are specific to the assumptions made about sorting on unobservables and
matching; other assumptions could lead to opposite results. The point of walking through
a specific example is to show how the structure of the prototypical neighborhood effects
regression analysis may be utilized to be more precise about (i) assumptions needed for
causal inferences to be valid and (ii) how to think about likely biases when causal inference
is not warranted.
While conditions (19) and (20) are strong, there are examples of real world datasets where
they are plausible. For example in the Project STAR class size reduction experiment, stu-
dents were first randomly grouped into classes (no sorting), with classes then assigned ran-
domly to teachers (no matching) (see Graham (2008) for additional details and caveats).
The value of such experiments for enhancing our understanding of peer group and neighbor-
hood effects is considerable. It is illuminating to consider a hypothetical housing mobility
experiment satisfying double randomization. Consider a public housing authority that has
constructed new housing units in multiple locations of a city. Among all households allo-
cated to a new unit, the authority could (i) randomly group sets of households together (no
sorting) and then (ii) randomly assign these groups to different newly constructed locations
(no matching). This is not a completely implausible scenario, but it is also far from the
structure of any type of experiment implemented to date.


Conditioning on observed household- and neighborhood-level attributes

In the context of observational neighborhood effect analyses, researchers’ reactions to the
biases caused by sorting and matching has typically been to improve measurement. Specifi-
cally to add proxies for A and U to equation (17). This approach has led to innovative data
collection strategies (e.g., the “ecometrics” espoused by Sampson and Raudenbusch (1999)).
Datasets like the L.A. FANS include a rich array of theoretically motivated and carefully

                                             34
measured family- and neighborhood-level proxies for A and U.
To understand how this approach work in practice, let W be a vector of predetermined
household-level attributes (e.g., parents’ schooling) and X a vector of exogenous neighborhood-
level attributes (e.g., distance to closest major employment center). Redefine a household’s
unobserved “background”, B, as

                     A = π0 (W, X) + φ0 (W, X) T + B, E [ B| T, W ] = 0.

There is no sorting on unobservables, conditional on W and X if

                          E [ B| T, W, X, Z] = E [ B| T, W, X] = 0                        (26)

Condition (26) implies that among, say, Minority households (i) living in neighborhoods
with the same observable amenities (X) and (ii) having identical measured backgrounds
(W ), one’s neighborhood of residence, Z, is not predictive of the unobserved household-level
determinants of Y . More concretely, it implies, for example, that among Minority households
with college-educated heads living in neighborhoods near a major employment center, the
average unobserved component of background, B, is similar across neighborhoods.
There is no matching on unobservables, conditional on W and X if

                             E [ U| T, W, X] = E [ U| W, X] = 0,                          (27)

or if, among households homogenous in W and X, Minority status is not predictive of un-
observed neighborhood amenities. Again, concretely, it implies that college-educated house-
holds living near major employment centers, enjoy similar unobserved neighborhood ameni-
ties irrespective of their Minority status.
Let E∗ [ Y | X; Z] denote the best linear predictor of Y given X conditional on Z. Wooldridge
(1997, Section 4) summarizes the basic properties of conditional linear predictors (CLPs).
Under (26) and (27) the conditional linear predictor of Y given T and s (Z), conditional on
W and X, is given by
                                                                                  
        E [ Y | T, s (Z) ; W, X] = α0 + π0 (W, X)′ (β0 + γ0 ) + β0 + φ0 (W, X)′ λ0 T
                                                        
                                   + γ0 + φ0 (W, X)′ δ0 s (Z)                             (28)

In practice researchers generally impose the additional restrictions that φ0 (W, X) = φ0 (i.e.,
is constant in W and X) and π0 (W, X) = ΠW W + ΠX W (i.e., is linear in W and X).
With these two extra functional-formal assumptions, conditions (26) and (27), provide a

                                              35
formal justification for least squares “kitchen-sink” neighborhood-effects regression analyses
(e.g., Datcher, 1982; Brooks-Gunn, Duncan, Klebanov and Sealand, 1993; Leventhal and
Brooks-Gunn, 2000).
An interesting example of identification via conditioning is provided by Bayer, Ross, and
Topa (2008). In that paper a neighborhood corresponds to a census block, while W cor-
responds to a vector of census tract indicators. Recall that census tracts contain multiple
census blocks. In their setup condition (26) rules out within-track sorting on unobservables;
an assumption they motivate by appealing to frictions in the housing market (i.e., households
may be able to choose their tract of residence, but probably not their exact block). Condition
(27) requires, effectively, that the Minority and White census blocks, within a given tract,
have similar neighborhood amenities. Hoxby (2000) and Ammermueller and Pischke (2009)
employ a analogous research design to study peer effects at the classroom level. With the
increasing availability, albeit generally by special agreement, of rich geocoded datasets, this
approach to identification may be useful to empirical researchers.
My own view is that approaches based on covariate adjustment, as in other areas of causal
analysis, have a meaningful role to play in neighborhood effects research. Such approaches
can motivate the collection of better data, which often has other auxiliary benefits. Of
course, as in other areas of causal analysis, approaches based on covariate adjustment are
not always compelling (cf., Durlauf, 2006). This observation has led researchers to develop
other research designs for neighborhood effects analysis.


Within- and between-neighborhood decomposition

Graham and Hahn (2005) emphasize the panel data structure of conventional neighborhood
effects analysis. Under (16) the between-neighborhood outcome equation equals



               E [ Y | Z] = α0 + π0′ (δ0 + λ0 ) + (β0 + γ0 + φ′0 (δ0 + λ0 )) s (Z)
                              +E [ B| Z]′ (δ0 + λ0 ) + U ′ κ0 ,                           (29)

while the within-neighborhood outcome equation equals


                Y − E [ Y | Z] = (β0 + φ′0 λ0 ) (T − s (Z)) + (B − E [ B| Z])′ λ0 .       (30)

Let bW equal the coefficient on T in the within-neighborhood population regression and bB
the coefficient on s(Z) in the between-neighborhood regression. A bit of algebra (or a little

                                                 36
introspection; cf., Mundlak (1978)), gives

                                       b0 = bW
                                       c0 = bB − bW .

The within- and between-neighborhood regression functions provide no additional informa-
tion beyond that already contained in the short regression function (17). Nevertheless the
decomposition has pedagogic value and can facilitate the implementation of certain instru-
mental variables methods. Graham and Hahn (2005) provide details.


Moving to Opportunity (MTO) and other instrumental variables
methods

A large body of quantitative observational studies on neighborhood effects is now available.
Early studies typically matched household-level data from, for example, the Panel Study of
Income Dynamics (PSID), with neighborhood-level variables constructed from the Census
(e.g., track-level poverty rate). An early example, within economics, is provided by Datcher
(1982). More recent studies often utilize special-purpose datasets, such as the L.A. FANS.

Prior reviewers have generally been dismissive of this work. For example, Durlauf (2006),
argues that “with very few exceptions...empirical studies of neighborhood effects based on
observational data have failed to deal seriously with the possible statistical biases induced
by self-selection into neighborhoods” (p. 159). This assessment continues to be true today,
but it does not, in my view, imply that such work is without value. The establishment of
robust conditional correlations provides the library of “stylized facts” that theoretical, as
well as more sophisticated empirical work, should seek to explain. For example, it is a fact
that the Black-White gap in many outcomes is greater in more segregated cities. Explaining
this pattern is a legitimate project for the social sciences. At the same time it is correct
that basic observational studies are arguably of only limited value in justifying, for example,
policies of school and/ residential desegregation.
It is in this context that projects such as the Moving to Opportunity (MTO) demonstration
have arisen. The MTO program provided randomly assigned opportunities for some house-
holds to leave public housing and move to a low poverty neighborhood with the help of rent
subsidies. Ludwig (2012) provides an useful overview of the MTO research program, and
Kling, Liebman and Katz (2007) and Ludwig et. al. (2008, 2012) summaries of its main
findings. In what follows, since my purposes is primarily pedagogical, I abstract from many


                                              37
nuances of the experiment’s design, instead taking a more synoptic approach.
Let W ∈ {0, 1} now be an indicator for whether a household has access to a rent subsidy.
To keep the exposition more policy-relevant, and in line with the MTO example, let T
now indicate whether a household falls below (some multiple of) the poverty line or not.
Assume that that W is independent of B. This allows for random assignment of vouchers to
households, but with differing assignment probabilities across poor and non-poor households
(including an assignment probability of zero for non-poor households).
Let ΞS = (E [ s (Z)| W = 1] − E [ s (Z)| W = 0]) be the average difference in neighborhood
poverty across voucher and non-voucher households. Similarly define

                     ΞB = (E [ E [ B| Z]| W = 1] − E [ E [ B| Z]| W = 0])
                     ΞU = E [ U| W = 1] − E [ U| W = 0]

as the average difference in neighbors’ background and neighborhood amenities respectively
across voucher and non-voucher households. All these contrasts are post-assignment, and
hence post-move (if applicable). Let pW = E [W ] equal the marginal frequency of voucher
receipt.
Consider the linear instrumental variables fit of Y onto a constant, T and s (Z), using W as
an excluded instrument for s (Z). Note that, since W is randomly assigned conditional on
T , this would seem to be a promising and valid application of the method of instrumental
variables. The coefficient on s (Z) in this fit has a probability limit of (see Appendix B)

cIV   = (γ0 + φ′0 δ0 )
          pW (1 − pW ) ΞB − (E [ E [ B| Z]| T = 1] − E [ E [ B| Z]| T = 0]) p (E [ W | T = 1] − pW ) ′
        +                                                                                              δ0
                              pW (1 − pW ) ΞS − η 2 p (E [ W | T = 1] − pW )
          pW (1 − pW ) ΞU − (E [ U| T = 1] − E [ U| T = 0]) p(E [ W | T = 1] − pW ) ′
        +                                                                               κ0 ,      (31)
                        pW (1 − pW ) ΞS − η 2 p (E [ W | T = 1] − pW )

which is not free of sorting and matching bias.
Although W is conditionally randomly assigned given T and the underlying outcome model
is linear, the instrumental variables fit in this setting does not recover an interpretable
causal parameter. The reason is that T is not exogenous. Under sorting and matching a
household’s type will covary with unobserved neighbors’ attributes mA (Z) and neighborhood
amenities U. Equation (31) suggests that the application of instrumental variables methods
to neighborhood effects regression analysis may involve some subtlety.
In the Moving To Opportunity (MTO) demonstration experiment, vouchers were only avail-

                                                38
able with positive probability to T = 1 households.21
In this case E [ W | T = 1] = pW so that (31) simplifies to

                                                             Ξ′B δ0   Ξ′ κ0
                            cM T O = (γ0 +      φ′0 δ0 )   +        ++ U .                          (32)
                                                              ΞS       ΞS

Equation (32) is a measure of the “effect of place” free of sorting and matching bias. Ex-
pression (32) is also consistent with the interpretation of instrumental variable fits provided
by neighborhood effects researchers (e.g., Ludwig et. al. 2012). Importantly, it is not a
measure of neighborhood-level spillovers. Furthermore, as a composite parameter, it may be
close to zero even if many of its components are non-zero due to offsetting effects.
Whether (32) is an interesting parameter or not, depends upon the question of interest. It
is not a parameter that can be used to predict the effects of (doubly randomized) asso-
ciational redistributions. The intent to treat (ITT) effects of voucher receipt reported by
MTO researchers are likely good estimates of the benefits of a marginal increase in voucher
availability among the population of MTO participants.
The instrumental variables coefficient on s (Z), (32), varies with the effect of voucher re-
ceipt on the change in (i) neighborhood fraction poor (ΞS ) and (ii) unobserved neighbors’
background (ΞB ) and unobserved neighborhood amenities (ΞU ). While voucher receipt ap-
pears to have had rather durable effects on households’ exposure to concentrated poverty,
other aspects of neighborhood changed much less for MTO voucher recipients (cf., Sampson,
2012a). For example, various (measurable) dimensions of school quality appeared to have
been little affected by voucher receipt.
While a rejection of the null that cM T O = 0 requires that at least one of γ0 , δ0 or κ0 differ
from zero and hence that “place matters”. The interpretation of such a rejection cannot be
equated with the presence of neighborhood spillovers (i.e., γ0 and/or δ0 different from zero),
since such a rejection may arise from a pure amenity effect (κ0 6= 0). Furthermore a failure
to reject the null could easily reflect the operation of various offsetting effects. An MTO-
type-induced move may improve some dimensions of neighborhood quality, while worsening
others (cf., Durlauf and Iaonnides, 2010; as an example, lower poverty neighborhoods with
available rental units could be located in neighborhoods far from employment centers, with
less transit options, etc.). Furthermore the relative importance of these different dimensions
may vary with the outcome under study. Expression (32) may be helpful for understanding
  21
   In fact MTO participants were a self-selected subgroup of eligible households. While this fact has
important implications for the interpretation of the MTO experimental results, it is less relevant to the
methodological points I aim to make here.

patterns of cross-site heterogeneity found by MTO researchers as well as the findings of
researchers exploiting closely related designs (e.g., Oreopoulos, 2003).


Cross-city research designs

Several researchers have proposed estimation methods involving aggregation of (16) to the
city-level as a remedy for sorting bias (e.g., Evans, Oates and Schwab, 1992; Cutler and
Glaeser, 1997; Card and Rothstein, 2007; Ananat, 2011). This approach requires observa-
tions from a cross-section of cities, typically operationalized by a metropolitan statistical
area (MSA), and restrictions on how the joint distribution of (A′ , T )′ various across cities.
A formalization and illustration of this approach is provided here.
The researcher has access to a nationally representative sample of (T, Y ) pairs. Assume
further that this sample is geocoded, such that each observation can be assigned to a specific
MSA. As a concrete example, the NLSY79 and NLSY97 restricted-use geocode files, available
from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) by special agreement, may be used to assign
each respondent to an MSA of residence (at the time of adolescence). Index MSAs by
c = 1, . . . , N and sampled respondents within a city by i = 1, . . . , Mc . Assume that various
measures of residential segregation by race, corresponding to the period coinciding with the
respondent’s adolescence, are available for each city (e.g., computed using information in the
Neighborhood Change Database (NCDB)).22
We begin by modifying (16) to incorporate a city-specific effect (i.e., intercept):

            E [ Yci | Tci , s (Zci ) , mA (Zci ) , Uci , Aci ] = αc + β0 Tci + γ0 s (Zci )                (33)

The presence of αc allows the mean outcome to vary across cities for reasons unrelated to
segregation.

Let E∗ [ Y | X; c] denote the best linear predictor of Y given X conditional on residence in city
c. Let V ( Y | c) and C ( X, Y | c) denote city-specific variances and covariances. Some basic
algebra gives a CLP of fraction minority in one’s neighborhood given own Minority status of
                                                                   

    In what follows I assume that these segregation measures are known precisely (i.e., not up to some
sampling error). If these segregation measures are themselves estimated, then this fact will need to be
incorporated into inference procedures. In the empirical illustration below ηc2 is constructed from tract-level
information in the NCDB; sampling variation is not an issue.

Notes: The NLSY97 sample consists of 8,985 youths, of which a total of 7,263 resided in an MSA at
baseline (1,796 Hispanic respondents, 1,943 Black respondents, and 3,524 non-Hispanic, non-Black
respondents). The estimation sample used here includes the 4,419 respondents who resided in a
city with at least 5 White responding households as well as 5 Black and/or Hispanic responding
households. “AFQT score at age 16” corresponds to the inverse normal CDF transform of the
adjusted AFQT percentile score used in Altonji, Bharadwaj and Lange (2012). This score was
normalized to the distribution of percentile scores across NLSY79 respondents aged 16 at the time
of test-taking in 1980. Across respondents from the reference population of American Youth aged 15
to 23 in 1980 this transform of percentile scores is mean zero with unit variance. Since the Altonji,
Bharadwaj and Lange (2012) percentile scores are normalized to a different reference group (both in
terms of age-of-testing and year-of-birth), “AFQT score at age 16” need not be mean zero with unit
variance (across all 7,002 respondents with valid AFQT scores its mean is -0.0001 and its standard
deviation is 0.9893). AFQT scores were only available for a subset of the target sample of 7,263
MSA-residents. The y-value of each point in the figure corresponds to the coefficient on a dummy
variable for Minority (i.e., Black or Hispanic) in the least squares fit of standardized AFQT score
onto a constant and Minority using observations from a single MSA. The x-value corresponds to the
eta-squared measure of Minority segregation in 2000. The size of the scatter points are increasing
in the estimated precision of the corresponding Minority-White AFQT gap. A total of 44 MSAs are
represented in the figure.

where ηc2 is the eta squared segregation measure for city c and pc = Pr (T = 1| c) is the
city-wide fraction Minority. In highly segregated cities (ηc2 → 1) own race is very predictive
of neighbors’ race. In integrated cities (ηc2 → 0) the city-wide fraction Minority has more
predictive value.23

                   φc = E [ Aci | Tci = 1, c] − E [ Aci | Tci = 0, c]
                   υc = E [ E [ Bci | Zci ]| Tci = 1, c] − E [ E [ Bci | Zci ]| Tci = 0, c]

to be the Minority-White gap within city c in (i) “background” (φc ), (ii) neighbors’ back-
ground (υc ), and (iii) neighborhood amenities (τc ) respectively. The first of these terms is a
vector of average differences between Minorities and Whites. The latter two terms are vec-
tors of average differences in features of their neighborhoods. Specifically in the unobserved
attributes of their neighbors and the unobserved non-composition-based characteristics of
their neighborhoods. Both of these are measures of average differences in neighborhood
quality between Minorities and Whites. To the extent that these components of neighbor-
hood quality directly influence the outcome of interest (i.e., δ0 6= 0 and/or κ0 6= 0), they
both are drivers of neighborhood effects, broadly defined.
Using (33), (34) and the notation defined above we get a city-specific short regression,
deviated from city-specific means, of
                                                                  
                        E [ Yci | Tci ; c] − E [ Yci | c] =           β0 + (γ0 + φ′c δ0 ) ηc2
                                                                  +υc′ δ0 + τc′ κ0 + φ′c λ0 }

Let φ0 now equal the mean of φc across cities (i.e., φ0 = E [φc ]) with ν0 and τ0 analogously
defined. Equation (35) indicates that the Minority-White outcome gap in city c – GAPc =
E [ Yci | Tci = 1; c] − E [ Yci | Tci = 0; c] – varies with its degree of segregation, as measured by
the eta-squared, ηc2 , index:

                                    GAPc = a0 + (γ0 + φ′0 δ0 ) ηc2 + Vc                               (36)

              a0 = β0 + υ0′ δ0 + τ0′ κ0 + φ′0 λ0
              Vc = (υc − υ0 )′ δ0 + (τc − τ0 )′ κ0 + (φc − φ0 )′ λ0 + (φc − φ0 )′ δ0 ηc2 .

Here Vc varies with a city’s Minority-White gap in (i) neighbors’ unobserved “background”,
(ii) exogenous neighborhood attributes, (iii) own “background”, and (iv) the interaction of
own-background with measured segregation. If
                                                      
                                               E Vc ηc2 = 0                                       (37)

then, by equations (35) and (36), a least squares fit of the city-specific measure of the
Minority-White outcome gap, GAPc , onto a constant and ηc2 will provide a consistent esti-
mate of γ0 + φ′0 δ0 . Observe that this coincides with the coefficient on fraction minority in
the prototypical neighborhood effects regression (17) under no sorting and matching (i.e.,
when conditions (19) and (20) hold).

Restriction (37) is sometimes referred to as a no “differential sorting” across cities assumption
(e.g., Card and Rothstein, 2007). To understand this language consider the common case
where δ0 and κ0 are a priori presumed equal to zero. In that case condition (37) requires
that, across cities, variation in the “background gap” is uncorrelated with variation in racial
segregation (i.e, C (φc , ηc2 ) = 0). Sorting across cities is allowed in the sense that differences in
average “background” across cities do not threaten identification. However the background-
gap across cities, if it varies, must do so independently of measured segregation.
Note that, again in the special case where δ0 = κ0 = 0, aggregation does eliminate biases
due to sorting on unobservables. In that case the coefficient on s (Z) in the within-city
neighborhood effects regression (17) is (see (22) above)

                                  1
              c0 = γ 0 +                 (E [ E [ B| Z]| T = 1] − E [ E [ B| Z]| T = 0])′ λ0
                           η2         2
                                (1 − η )

with the second term due to sorting and where I have also made use of the equality

                C (s (Z) , E [B| Z])
                                     = E [ E [ B| Z]| T = 1] − E [ E [ B| Z]| T = 0] .
                      p (1 − p)

In contrast, the coefficient on ηc2 in the cross-city regression of the Minority-White outcome
gap onto a constant and ηc2 is equal to γ0 alone. Under these conditions aggregation does
eliminate biases due to sorting, as is often asserted in empirical work.


                                                     43
However, when δ0 and κ0 possibly differ from zero, condition (37) requires maintaining addi-
tional (strong) assumptions. First, for δ0 6= 0, we require zero covariance between measured
racial segregation and (υc − υ0 )′ δ0 , the first element of Vc . This implies that the Minority-
White gap in neighbors’ background is uncorrelated with the degree of metropolitan-area
segregation. Very loosely speaking this assumption does not rule out within-city sorting on
unobservables, but it does constrain such sorting to be similar across cities. When δ0 6= 0
we also require strengthening the zero covariance condition C (φc , ηc2 ) = 0. For example if
                                    
φc is mean-independent of ηc2 , then (φc − φ0 )′ δ0 ηc2 ηc2 , the last term in Vc ηc2 , will be mean
zero (along with the third term). In practice if the researcher is willing to assume that
C (φc , ηc2 ) = 0, then they ought to be willing to assume that E [ φc | ηc2 ] = φ0 . It is difficult
to imagine plausible sorting processes that imply the weaker (former) condition, but not the
stronger (latter) condition.
Second, for κ0 6= 0, we require zero covariance between ηc2 and (τc − τ0 )′ κ0 , the second
element of Vc . This implies that the degree to which race predicts exogenous neighborhood
characteristics is uncorrelated with the level of racial segregation.
In practice, it seems likely that own race will be a better predictor of unobserved neighbor-
hood attributes in highly segregated cities, for no other reason than in such cities Minorities
and Whites live apart. These considerations suggest that recovering a consistent estimate of
γ0 from the cross-city correlation of GAPc and ηc2 is difficult. At the same time, one may be
able to learn about the “effects of place” broadly defined from such an analysis.
To understand this claim, considering maintaining the assumption that E [ φc | ηc2 ] = 0 (i.e.,
that the city-specific Minority-White background-gap is mean independent of measured seg-
regation). This is a strong assumption, but is one that can be indirectly assessed (see Figure
4 for some mixed support in the present case). For example, one could correlate gaps in
measured components of family background with segregation. Under this assumption the
least squares fit of Gc onto a constant and ηc2 is consistent for
                                                                                     
        E∗ GAPc | ηc2 = β0 + φ′0 λ0 + Π′υ δ0 + Π′τ κ0 + γ0 + (φ0 + Πυη )′ δ0 + Π′τ η κ0 ηc2 (38)

where
                                             
                                   E∗ υc | ηc2 = Πυ + Πυη ηc2

                                   E∗ τc | ηc2 = Πτ + Πτ η ηc2 .

Here the coefficient on ηc2 is not structural. In particular it is not consistent for γ0 (or γ0 +
φ′0 δ0 ) and hence informative about the effects of reallocations on outcomes. The coefficient

is, however, a measure of the effects of “place” on outcomes. It captures the collective effects
of differences in the racial composition of ones’ neighborhoods, their average background,
and neighborhood amenities on the Minority-White outcome gap. Importantly, it is not
affected by sorting. I conclude that while a structural interpretation of cross-city correlations
between outcome gaps and segregation requires strong assumptions, a looser interpretation
– as a measure of the “effects of place” – may be compelling in some circumstances (similar
to the interpretation of the IV-MTO estimand (32) above). Of course, the policy-relevance
of this measure, unlike that of the composite parameter γ0 + φ′0 δ0 , which can be used to
predict the effects of doubly randomized reallocations, is not immediately clear.
Figure 3 depicts the relationship between Minority (Black or Hispanic) - White gaps in
AFQT scores and residential segregation across 44 large MSAs (see the notes to the Figure for
details on the estimation sample). The Minority-White gap in test scores is substantial and
significantly larger in highly segregated cities. Under condition (37) the variance-weighted
least squares (OLS) fit of the estimated AFQT gap onto a constant and ηc2 will provide a
consistent estimate of γ0 + φ′0 δ0 :24


                           \        −0.4214    −0.9901 ETA2c
                         AFQTGAPc =          +               .
                                    (0.0857)   (0.2364)

This fit indicates that the AFQT gap averages under 0.5 standard deviations in America’s
least segregated cities but over 1 standard deviations in its most segregated cities. These
differences are precisely determined. Under condition (37) the data suggests that we can
strongly reject the null that γ0 + φ′0 δ0 = 0. Again, maintaining condition (37), the fit
suggests that a student, if contrary to fact, was instead raised in a neighborhood with a
fraction Minority 10 percent lower, her AFQT score would, in expectation, be about 0.1
standard deviations higher.
As a pure peer effect, a value of γ0 + φ′0 δ0 equal to -1 seems implausibly large. If we instead
interpret the coefficient on the eta-square measure in terms of regression (38), our view
changes. In that case the measured relationship is not presumed to be a pure peer effect.
Rather the effect measures the cumulative impact of a bundle of human-capital producing
amenities that differ, on average, across Minority and White neighborhoods. These could
include, among of things, systematic differences in school and teacher quality, differences
in environmental quality (e.g., indoor air quality, noise, etc.), differences in exposure to
violence and other risks, as well as a pure peer effect. Each of these items has been shown
  24
    Since I am weighting I technically need the mean independence analog of (37). Unweighted results are
not appreciably different.


                                                  46
to independently influence academic performance. When many drivers of human capital
accumulation vary across neighborhoods, the estimated effect of place can be plausibly large.
While the interpretation of the pattern shown in Figure 3 is not straightforward, what
is without dispute is that the AFQT gap varies significantly with measured segregation.
Minority adolescents fare worse relative to their White counterparts, in terms of AFQT
scores, in cities where they live in separate neighborhoods. Again, whether this is due to
neighborhood effects (i.e., γ0 + φ′0 δ0 < 0), or has some other cause, is open to debate.


Additional identification challenges and opportunities

Policies other than associational redistribution

The discussion above has presumed that the researchers’ interest lies in understanding the
likely effects of an associational redistribution. Associational redistributions are resource
neutral and, as such, leave the joint distribution of T and A unchanged. In certain settings,
however, interest may center of the effects of policies which do change the conditional dis-
tribution of T given A. For example T may be an indicator for whether an individual has
completed high school or college. In such a setting the composite parameter, γ0 + φ′0δ0 would
not be invariant to policies which, say, increase the rate of college completion. In order to
understand the effects of such a policy on the distribution of outcomes, knowledge of γ0 is
required. Acemoglu and Angrist (2000), and Ciccone and Peri (2006) discuss identification
and estimation of γ0 in such settings. They also provide empirical illustrations.


Endogenous effects and social multipliers

In model (16) all social spillovers, using the typology of Manski (1993), are of the exogenous
type. The presence of endogenous interactions, whereby the propensity of an individual to
engage in some activity covaries with the frequency of participation among her peers, can
raise new issues.

One feature of (16) is that all individuals within a group, in our case, a neighborhood, are
equally influenced by one another. Furthermore, there are no cross group linkages. This
simple model can be viewed as the reduced form of a model also admitting endogenous
effects. This point is developed carefully in Manski (1993) and Brock and Durlauf (2001a).
If the policies of interest are associational redistributions, then knowledge of the reduced
form will be sufficient.


                                              47
Once one departs from the benchmark “linear-in-means” model, however, the endogenous vs.
exogenous spillovers distinction has content. One direction of departure involves maintain-
ing linearity, but assuming that agents are embedded in a non-trivial network (cf., Calvo-
Armengol, Patacchini and Zenou, 2009; Bramoullé, Djebbari and Fortin, 2009; Blume, Brock,
Durlauf and Jayaraman, 2015). Each individual is connected to only a finite subset of all
other individuals. In such a setting, the presence of an endogenous effect, implies that an
intervention acting upon a single-individual can have social multiplier effects which percolate
across the entire network (cf., Graham, 2015c). By picking certain, more “central”, individu-
als within a network to intervene upon, indirect spillover effects can be maximized (see Kim
et al. (2015) for an interesting empirical study related to technology adoption). In con-
trast, if only exogenous effects are present, then the effects of interventions stay local; with
spillover effects being confined to direct friends alone. The non-trivial network structure also
generates new avenues for identification (cf., Bramoullé, Djebbari and Fortin, 2009; Blume,
Brock, Durlauf and Jayaraman, 2015).
Another direction of departure involves introducing nonlinearity, while maintaining the sim-
ple group interaction structure. Brock and Durlauf (2001a,b) provide an early, and seminal,
analysis of such models. In nonlinear models, endogenous effects may result in multiple
equilibrium action configurations. Multiple equilibria introduce the possibility of engineering
improvements in the distribution of outcomes without having to (i) engage in associational
redistribution or (ii) change the conditional distribution of T given A.
In addition to their potential policy implications, nonlinear models of strategic interaction
raise a number of challenging, albeit also interesting, identification and estimation issues.
de Paula (2013) provides a useful survey of the relevant literature, mostly inspired by em-
pirical settings common in industrial organization. Brock and Durlauf (2007) present some
interesting identification results specific to the neighborhood effects setting.
My own view is that while it is now possible to point to a modest collection of studies which
provide relatively strong evidence for the existence of social spillovers (e.g., Graham, 2008;
Bayer, Hjalmarsson and Pozen, 2009), there are few studies which characterize the relative
importance of endogenous and exogenous effects. A priori we might expect endogenous
interactions to be relatively important for explaining some types of behaviors, such as the
initiation of sexual activity, or drug use, among adolescents (cf., Card and Giuliano, 2013).
For other outcomes, such as measured academic achievement (i.e., grades or test scores), the
a priori case for endogenous effects is, in my view, weaker.
Given the rather profound policy implications of endogenous interactions, as well as the
interesting identification challenges and opportunities their presence creates, empirical work

                                               48
in this area would be an interesting undertaking. Boucher, Bramoulle, Djebbari and Fortin
(2014) and Liu, Patacchini, and Zenou (2014) are two recent, and careful, attempts to study
endogenous social effects. Unfortunately, many existing discussions of endogenous versus
exogenous effects in the empirical literature are often either non-credible, confused or both.


Nonlinear exogenous effects

Even without endogenous effects, nonlinearity raises complex identification, estimation and
policy issues. Henderson, Mieszkowski and Sauvageau (1978) provide an early example of an
empirical study which takes such nonlinearities seriously (both in terms of empirical, as well
as policy, analysis). Graham, Imbens, Ridder (2010) provide a discussion of identification,
estimation and social planning issues in nonparametric (i.e., nonlinear) models with exoge-
nous social spillovers. The presentation of the more basic linear model in this survey, as
well as the development of the no sorting and matching condition, was designed to make the
more general results in Graham, Imbens, Ridder (2010) accessible to readers of this survey.
Graham (2011, Section 5) provides additional material.


Structural models of locational sorting

The analysis thus far has viewed sorting and matching biases as nuisances best dealt with
by an appropriate choice of research design. An alternative approach utilizes structural
features of a locational sorting equilibrium to facilitate identification. Of course, taking
a stand on the sorting process does make inference fragile to violations of the additional
maintained assumptions. However explicitly modeling the sorting process can help to (i)
increase efficiency, (ii) generate testable restrictions and (iii) facilitate the implementation of
counterfactual policy analysis. Nesheim (2002) provides a nice illustration this approach (cf.,
Bayer, Ferreira, McMillan, 2007; Calabrese, Epple, Romer and Sieg, 2006). Sieg and Holmes
(2015) survey the literature on structural estimation of models of locational equilibrium,
albeit not with a specific focus on models with spillover-induced sorting (which do raise
special issues). Iaonnides (2011) provides a survey with an explicit neighborhood effects
focus.
My view is that structural models have an important role to play in the literature on neigh-
borhood effects and, further, that there remains considerable scope for additional empirical
work in this area. In justifying this view it is perhaps helpful to step back and take a bird’s
eye view of the identification problem. The key empirical challenge faced by neighborhood ef-
fects researchers in economics is to identify the average mapping from own and neighborhood

                                                49
attributes into outcomes. Call this mapping the production function. The mean regression
of the outcome onto own and neighborhood attributes, regression (17) above, typically does
not identify the production function due to sorting and matching. A model of locational
equilibrium allows the researcher to explicitly characterize sorting and matching bias under
maintained assumptions. Furthermore such models can, again under certain assumptions, be
used to correct for sorting and matching bias. Conceptually the idea is analogous to model-
ing input demand in order to identify a firm’s production function (Griliches and Mairrese,
1998; Olley and Pakes, 1996). When one further considers that the process of locational
sorting is itself of intrinsic scientific and policy interest, the dividends to modeling sorting
become even greater. Altonji and Mansfield (2014) provide a recent and interesting take on
this line of reasoning.
At the same time I also wish to emphasize that fully nonparametric identification of the
production function is always preferable. In a fully nonparametric/non-linear model, non-
parametric identification requires exogenous variation in neighborhood quality of the type
generated by, for example, (conditionally) double random assignment as described in Graham
(2008), Graham, Imbens and Ridder (2010) and Graham (2011). An ideal empirical approach
would therefore combine experimental estimation of the production technology with a model
of locational sorting fitted to observational data. Here the experimentally-identified produc-
tion function could be used to validate the sorting model, while the sorting model could be
used to simulate the effects of various counter-factual policies. This last point is especially
important when we consider that most realistic policies, by changing the incentives to sort,
only indirectly implement associational redistributions (cf., Durlauf, 2006).


Neighborhood effects over the life course

Most empirical models of neighborhood effects are static. An individual’s neighborhood
environment during, for example, childhood is modeled as fixed. In practice individuals’
neighborhood contexts generally evolve throughout childhood, whether due to the explicit
movement of households from neighborhood to neighborhood, or due to secular changes in
one’s environment due to, for example, gentrification.
In practice, therefore, it is likely better to conceptualize individuals’ as experiencing a se-
quence of neighborhood environments during childhood. Furthermore it seems sensible to
allow for feedback from current neighborhood quality and (intermediate) outcomes into fu-
ture neighborhood quality. For example parents who feel as though their children are poorly
served by their neighborhood school, may seek out new schooling options for their children.
In such a setting current test scores may be influenced by past neighborhood environment,

                                              50
while at the same time also drive changes in future neighborhood environment. A dynamic
perspective also allows researchers to ask when neighborhood context is most salient (e.g.,
early childhood vs. adolescence). One can also discriminate between episodic and persistent
exposure to various types of neighborhood environments.
Relatively few researchers have taken a dynamic approach to neighborhood effects analysis
(e.g., Wodtke Harding and Elwert, 2011; Sharkey and Elwert, 2011; Wodtke, 2013). This
work utilize methods of covariate adjustment under settings of sequential exogeneity devel-
oped by Jamie Robins in a series of papers (e.g., Robins 1986, 1997, 1999, 2000). These
methods are neither conceptually, nor in terms of implementation, straightforward. Nev-
ertheless they arguable have considerable merit in the context of observational studies of
neighborhood effects. Graham (2015d) provides a “textbook” introduction to these meth-
ods. The scope of their application, given the increasing availability of large administrative
databases with a longitudinal structure is considerable. For example, Chetty, Hendren and
Katz (forthcoming), observe features of an individual’s neighborhood environment through
the school age years, the intermediate outcomes of test scores, as well as the final outcome
of adult earnings.



5    What next?

Prior reviewers of the empirical literature on social spillovers have been remarkably (and
consistently) pessimistic. For example, Durlauf (2006), an otherwise enthusiastic proponent
of the (potential) role of social interactions in various social and economic domains, argues
that extant empirical work “suffers from sufficiently serious problems of interpretation that
it should not strongly influence one’s prior beliefs...” (p. 163). Thankfully, the situation has
improved somewhat in the intervening decade. It is now possible to point to a handful of
empirical studies which, at least in my view, are of sufficiently high quality that one should
use them to update their prior beliefs (e.g., Graham, 2008; Carrell, Fullerton and West, 2009;
Gould, Lavy and Paserman, 2004, 2009, 2011).
There is also a growing collection of high quality studies which report null effects for many
outcomes (e.g., Oreopoulos, 2003; Angrist and Lang, 2004; Ludwig et al. 2012). Many of
these are housing mobility studies with strong, highly persuasive, research designs. Some re-
searchers have interpreted this body of evidence as supportive of the null that neighborhoods
and/or peers are relatively unimportant for a wide range of life outcomes (e.g., Angrist, 2014,
p. 106). I have not attempted to survey this literature exhaustively, but my selective reading
of it leads me to a rather different conclusion.

                                              51
Consider Oreopoulos (2003), who measures the long run effects of growing up in “high den-
sity” public housing versus “low density” public housing in Toronto. Oreopoulos (2003)
reports that the percent of households below the poverty line in neighborhoods with “high
density” public housing was about 18 to 36 percentage points higher than in neighborhoods
with “low density” housing (depending on the definition of “neighborhood” used; Table II,
Row 3). Oreopoulos (2003) then estimates that male youths growing up in the smaller, low
density, housing projects had average earnings 5 percent higher than their counterparts in
high density projects, with a 95 percent confidence interval of (roughy) -5 percent to 15
percent (Table VI, Row 2, Columns 5 & 6). A 15 percent increase in earnings, for a 18 to
36 percentage point reduction in childhood exposure to neighborhood poverty, strikes me as
a rather large, perhaps implausibly large “place effect”. Put differently Oreopoulos’ (2003)
95 percent confidence interval more or less spans the magnitude of effects that I would place
positive probability density on a priori. While the Oreopoulos (2003) study is superbly
designed and executed, its effect on my posterior views of the long-run earnings effects of
exposure to impoverished neighborhoods, has been limited.
My read of Angrist and Lang (2004), who study the effects of classroom exposure to inner
city youth on the academic achievement of suburban youth, is similar. When an inner city
youth enters a suburban classroom she affects average measured achievement in the two
ways. The first effect is purely compositional, the second effect arises from any spillovers
onto other students. The ratio of the total-to-compositional effect is the social multiplier, a
unitless summary measure of spillover strength (e.g., Glaeser, Sacerdote and Sacerdote, 2003;
Graham, Imbens and Ridder, 2010). Using the coefficient estimates reported in Column 5
of Panel A of Tables 5 and 6 of Angrist and Lang (2004) I compute social multiplier point
estimates for reading, mathematics and language achievement of 1.16, 1.26 and 1.59. While,
as Angrist and Lang (2004) correctly note, many observational studies report even larger
effects, these point estimates are nevertheless meaningfully large. The tables lack sufficient
information to calculate confidence intervals for these social multipliers, but the available
information suggests they would be quite large.
Oreopoulos (2003) and Angrist and Lang (2004) are not the only high quality studies to
report null findings of neighborhood and/or peer effects, although they are two of the more
widely cited of such studies. Indeed, they are both excellent studies. They also present results
completely consistent with sizable neighborhood/peer effects (as well as results consistent
with the absence of such effects). Unless one places substantial a priori probability on the
event that neighborhood effects are extraordinarily large, the Oreopoulos (2003) and Angrist
and Lang (2004) should cause only a modest update in your beliefs.


                                              52
It is important to contextualize these observations. Several observational peer and neigh-
borhood effects studies in the 1990s reported what were, at least in retrospect, implausibly
large effects (e.g., Crane, 1991). In addition to well-understood problems of unmeasured
“confounders” emphasized in the discussion above, many of these studies suffered from much
deeper methodological problems (e.g., they attempted to fit what we would now call incom-
plete models; cf., Manski, 1993; Angrist, 2014). The discipline’s reaction to these weaknesses
was to undertake studies with stronger research designs. Unfortunately many of these studies
have been underpowered; failing to reject zero effects, but also sometimes quite large effects.
Relatedly these studies have generally focused on very disadvantaged populations where few
interventions of any kind have been shown to improve outcomes. Nevertheless the corrective
has been useful; recent evidence suggest, for example, that the return to less exposure to
concentrated poverty is probably not as high as, for example, earning a college degree.
I have learned a different set of lessons from Moving To Opportunity (MTO) demonstration
project. It is undeniable that many scholars have found the apparent failure of MTO to
find any effects of improved neighborhood quality on the economic outcomes of adult movers
deeply disappointing (cf., Rothwell, 2015). This finding seems to cast doubt on, for exam-
ple, the belief that spatial mismatch is an important driver of poor minority employment
outcomes. However, Ludwig et a. (2012, Table 1) report that only about 6 percent of MTO
participants listed employment goals as a primary or secondary reason for wanting to move at
baseline. Perhaps a lack of large economic effects among the population targeted by MTO
should not have been so surprising? In contrast, participants did list violence avoidance,
housing quality and better schools for children, as main motivations for wanting to move.
MTO was largely successful at meeting the first two of these self-reported goals.
Chetty, Hendren and Katz (2016), undertaking the longest term follow-up to date, with
arguably the best data as well, find that MTO youth who moved early in life experience
better labor market outcomes in early adulthood than their non-moving counterparts. This
finding is consistent with their being a human capital penalty associated with sustained
exposure to concentrated poverty. It will be interesting to track this cohort in the future.
Where does this leave us? Perhaps disappointingly there remains substantial scope to con-
duct studies whose primary aim is simply to test for the presence, and measure the magnitude
of, neighborhood effects. There is not yet even a loose disciplinary consensus on the rough
importance of neighborhoods on life outcomes. We are even further away from answering the
deep question motivating many neighborhood effects researchers: what are the social costs
and benefits of residential segregation? It is possible to motivate associational redistribution
policies solely by appeals to equity (i.e., by placing intrinsic social value on diverse, inte-


                                              53
grated, neighborhoods); however, given the controversy often associated with such policies,
it is also important to understand their efficiency implications as well (cf., Piketty, 2000).
The optimal assignment of individuals to groups in the presence of social spillovers, in ad-
dition to depending on the form of preferences, typically hinges on quite subtle features of
the mapping from group composition into outcomes. This was emphasized in the context
of a stylized model by Benabou (1996) and is an important theme of Graham, Imbens and
Ridder (2010). Hopefully the next wave of work on neighborhood effects will combine the
considerable progress that has been made on understanding the strengths and weakness of
various research designs with a sharper focus on questions raised by the theory on sorting
and segregation.

A     Properties of the dissimilarity index (DI)

To get additional insight into the interpretation of the dissimilarity index (DI) rewrite (1)
as                                                        
                                      1        s (Z) − Q
                                  DI = E                       .                        (39)
                                      2        Q (1 − Q)
The numerator inside the expectation in (39) gives the proportion of a neighborhood’s resi-
dents who would have to move in order to align its demographic structure with the city-wide
one. If s (Z) > Q, then movers are Minority residents who will be replaced with arriving
White residents (with the opposite occurring when s (Z) < Q). Following this logic,

     E [|s (Z) − Q| · 1 (s (Z) − Q ≥ 0)]   E [ |s (Z) − Q|| s (Z) ≥ Q]
                                         =                             Pr (p (Z) ≥ Q)   (40)
                      Q                                 Q




                                               64
equals the city-wide proportion ofhminority residents who
                                                      i   must move in order to achieve
                    25              s(Z)−Q
perfect integration.   Likewise E     1−Q
                                            s (Z) < Q Pr (s (Z) < Q) gives the city-wide
proportion of White residents who must move. Since the aggregate number of Minority and
White moves must coincide we have the equality
                                                                             
            s (Z) − Q                                        s (Z) − Q
   QE                 s (Z) ≥ Q Pr (s (Z) ≥ Q) = (1 − Q) E             s (Z) < Q
                Q                                               1−Q
                                                 × Pr (s (Z) < Q)

Iterated expectations applied to (39) then gives, after substituting in the above equality and
re-arranging,

                                      Q−1 E [|s (Z) − Q| · 1 (s (Z) − Q ≥ 0)]
                           DI =                                               .                                (41)
                                                      1−Q

Equation (41) demonstrates that the Dissimilarity Index equals the city-wide proportion of
minority residents who would need to move in order to achieve perfect integration, relative
to the proportion that would need to move under a status quo of perfect segregation (cf.,
Jakubs, 1977).26
  25
   Let Mi denote neighborhood size and n city size. Let n1 and n0 respectively equal the Minority and
White population of the city such that Q = n1 /n. We can re-write (40) as
                                                            N

     The denominator in (41), 1 − Q, equals the proportion of Minority residents that would need to move
under a status quo of complete residential separation. In that case 1 − Q fraction of residents would need to
leave each Minority neighborhood in order to integrate all neighborhoods.
