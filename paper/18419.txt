Teacher Quality Policy When Supply Matters

                                              ABSTRACT

Recent proposals would strengthen the dependence of teacher pay and retention on performance, in
order to attract those who will be effective teachers and repel those who will not. I model the teacher
labor market, incorporating dynamic self-selection, noisy performance measurement, and Bayesian
learning. Simulations indicate that labor market interactions are important to the evaluation of alternative
teacher contracts. Typical bonus policies have very small effects on selection. Firing policies can have
larger effects, if accompanied by substantial salary increases. However, misalignment between productivity
and measured performance nearly eliminates the benefits while preserving most of the costs.

1     Introduction

Recent education policy debates have centered on teacher quality.1 Secretary of
Education Arne Duncan lays out the agenda: “We have to reward excellence....We
also have to make it easier to get rid of teachers when learning isn’t happening”
(Hiatt, 2009).2 Researchers have focused on developing and validating measures of
teacher effectiveness (Chetty et al., 2011; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, 2012),
though questions remain (Rothstein, 2011; Corcoran, 2010). By contrast, relatively
little attention has been paid to the design of policies that will use the new measures
to improve educational outcomes.
           Several recent experiments have examined the short-term effects of perfor-
mance bonuses, with generally disappointing results (Goodman and Turner, Forth-
coming; Fryer, 2011; Springer et al., 2010; though see Fryer et al., 2012).3 These
studies were designed to detect teacher effort responses, which may be the wrong
margin. Many observers believe that variation in teacher effectiveness primarily
reflects largely immutable personality traits.4 Under this view, the primary mecha-
nism by which instructional quality might be improved is through selection.
    1 Ina 2010 manifesto, sixteen big-city school superintendents confidently state that “the sin-
gle most important factor determining whether students succeed in school...is the quality of their
teacher” (Klein et al., 2010). Influential advocates promise that policies aimed at improving teacher
quality can “turn our schools around” (Gates, 2011).
    2 Secretary Duncan’s suggestions are not the only potential routes to improved instruction. Alter-

natives include improved selection on entry into the profession or more or better professional devel-
opment. Researchers have had trouble identifying characteristics observable at the time of hiring that
are strongly correlated with subsequent effectiveness (Hanushek and Rivkin, 2006; Clotfelter et al.,
2007; Rockoff et al., 2011). Taylor and Tyler’s (Forthcoming) examination of a formative evaluation
program for experienced teachers found large impacts on teachers’ subsequent performance.
    3 The evidence from the developing world is more positive. See, e.g., Lavy (2002) and Duflo et

al. (2012); but also see Glewwe et al. (2010).
    4 Klein et al. (2010), for example, urge us to “stop pretending that everyone who goes into the

classroom has the ability and temperament” to be an effective teacher.



                                                  2
        A well designed contract could make the profession more attractive to ef-
fective teachers and less attractive (or perhaps unavailable) to ineffective teachers
(Lazear, 2003). We know little about effects of this type. Career decisions depend
on expected compensation many years in the future, and short-term experimental
interventions cannot have large effects on this. Even quasi-experimental approaches
are not promising. Performance pay systems have generally been short-lived (Mur-
nane and Cohen, 1986), so potential teachers are unlikely to expect that recent pol-
icy experiments will persist for very long.
        In this paper, I use simulations to examine the selection effects of alter-
native teacher contracts. I develop a stylized model of the teacher labor market
that incorporates heterogeneity in teacher ability. Teacher supply responses derive
from a dynamic discrete choice model in which graduates and experienced teachers
choose between teaching and alternative occupations on the basis of the compen-
sation on offer.5 Decisions to enter into teaching depend on risk-adjusted expected
compensation over the whole career. Similarly, experienced teachers consider their
expected compensation over the remainder of their potential careers in deciding
whether to exit the profession. Alternative contracts affect the future compensa-
tion and security of a teaching job, with differential anticipated impacts on teachers
who vary in their estimates of their own ability. These impacts in turn influence
both decisions to enter the profession and to exit for other opportunities.
        Two consensus results from the recent teacher quality literature are that
teacher ability is difficult or impossible to measure directly (via, e.g., education or
    5 Dynamic occupation choice models include Adda et al. (2011) and Keane and Wolpin (1997);

see also Wiswall (2007) on teacher licensing requirements. Essentially static models of teacher
attrition include Murnane and Olsen (1989) and Dolton and van der Klaauw (1999). Tincani (2011)
develops a static model of teacher sectoral choice under policies like those considered here.


                                              3
personality characteristics) and that realized performance can provide a noisy but
informative measure. Thus, I assume that compensation and retention decisions can
condition only on a sequence of noisy performance signals – which might be “value
added” scores or some alternative – and not directly on teacher ability. Prospective
teachers start with limited information about their own abilities, and then update
their estimates with each performance measure. A teacher who receives positive
signals concludes that she is likely to receive an above average number of perfor-
mance bonuses in future years or to have a below average probability of being fired
for poor performance, while a teacher who receives negative signals concludes the
opposite. These expectations drive the teacher’s dynamic decision-making about
whether to enter the profession and, having entered, to remain.
       Given the extremely limited variation in extant teacher contracts, I do not
attempt to estimate the model directly. Instead, I calibrate it using parameters ob-
tained from estimates in the literature. I attempt to choose parameters to make the
best realistic case for performance-based contracts, and explore the robustness of
the results to specific parameter values through extensive sensitivity checks.
       My policy analysis is closely related to studies of teacher retention and non-
retention by, e.g., Staiger and Rockoff (2010) and Boyd et al. (2011). These studies
ignore behavioral responses. In Staiger and Rockoff’s (2010) simulation of teacher
tenure policies, for example, the district can draw without limit from the current ap-
plicant pool to replace poor performers who are fired, without raising salaries. Not
surprisingly, then, the optimal tenure denial rate is extremely high. My model aug-
ments Staiger and Rockoff’s framework with a non-degenerate teacher labor mar-
ket. An increased firing rate requires higher salaries, both to compensate prospec-


                                          4
tive teachers for the increased risk and to attract enough additional applicants to
replace fired teachers.6 I find that the required salary increase is substantial, even
for much much lower firing rates than those considered by Staiger and Rockoff
(2010). Nevertheless, the results indicate that firing policies can be cost effective,
albeit with smaller benefits than have sometimes been promised.
         My framework allows me to consider a broader class of contracts than do
Staiger and Rockoff (2010). I focus on a performance bonus based on recent out-
comes and a policy of ongoing retention decisions. In the appendix, I present addi-
tional results for a traditional up-or-out tenure decision after the second year of the
career (as in Staiger and Rockoff, 2010) and a performance pay system in which
pay is continuously related to demonstrated effectiveness.
         In order to focus on the selection effects of performance accountability poli-
cies, I rule out by assumption any other effects of these policies. Effort is irrelevant,
and teachers can do nothing to influence their actual or measured performance. This
neglects the important possibility that high-stakes accountability could lead to dis-
tortion of the performance measure (Campbell, 1979), perhaps through narrowing
of curricula and redirection of effort toward measured outcomes (Holmstrom and
Milgrom, 1991; Glewwe et al., 2010), changes in student assignments (Rothstein,
2009), or even outright cheating (Jacob and Levitt, 2003). It could also crowd out
intrinsic motivation, thereby lowering teacher effort (Jacobson, 1995), or discour-
   6 Although   there is considerable slack in the teacher labor market now, following substantial
layoffs during the Great Recession, as recently as 2007 education policymakers worried about where
they would find enough qualified new teachers to fill the expected openings (Chandler, 2007; Gordon
et al., 2006). Shortfalls are traditionally filled by hiring teachers with “emergency” credentials, often
semi-permanently. Some have hypothesized that current credentialling rules are unrelated to quality.
If so, loosening of requirements could serve to offset other changes that reduce supply. But changes
in entry requirements need not be accompanied by changes in pay or retention policies, so the two
policies can be evaluated independently. I focus on the latter.


                                                   5
age cooperation among coworkers. The potential for manipulation and, worse, goal
distortion militates against high-stakes uses of the performance measures (Baker,
1992, 2002). In Section 5 I extend the model to allow for an imperfect alignment
between true productivity and the output that is measured and for possible distort-
ing effects of incentives. I find that these considerations are extremely important
– even a very limited ability of teachers to manipulate their measured performance
can undo nearly all of the positive effects of a firing policy.



2   What are the Policies of Interest?

Rick Hess, responding to the POINT study of teacher performance bonuses (Springer
et al., 2010), argues that identifying the selection effects of such policies requires
that the researcher “start by identifying a couple thousand high school students,
follow them for fifteen or twenty years, and study whether alterations to the com-
pensation structure of teaching impacted who entered teaching, how they fared, and
how it changed their career trajectory” (Hess, 2010). Even if this could be accom-
plished, the study “wouldn’t tell us what to do today [and] wouldn’t generate much
in the way of findings until the 2020s” (Hess, 2010). Efforts to evaluate selection
effects via natural experiments face similar challenges (Murnane and Cohen, 1986).
        This motivates my structural modeling strategy, as such an approach can
predict the effects of policies that have not yet been implemented – if the model
is correctly specified. In principle, the parameters of the model could be identified
using data on teachers subject to traditional contracts. But because these contracts
typically involve a “single salary schedule” that is totally invariant to teacher effec-
tiveness, results would be highly dependent on functional form and distributional

                                           6
assumptions. I thus calibrate the model rather than estimating it, relying on the best
evidence from the literature about the various parameter values.
         There are two broad components of the model: The performance measure-
ment system and the teacher labor market. A great deal of recent research has
examined the former topic, focused around “value added” models that measure a
teacher’s effectiveness based on her students’ test score growth. I use estimates
from this literature to calibrate the performance measurement component of the
model. Nothing in the model is specific to a value-added-based system, how-
ever; the model could equally well describe contracts based on more traditional,
classroom-observation-based, performance measures.
         The second major component is the interaction between teacher account-
ability policies and the teacher labor market. Calibration of this component is much
less straightforward. I discuss here several aspects of the policies of interest that
bear on the teacher labor market.
         First, I focus on modeling policy changes implemented at the level of the
state or nation rather than by individual districts. This implies smaller labor supply
elasticities than would apply to a small district (Manning, 2005).7 Relatedly, I rule
out the “dance of the lemons,” whereby a teacher fired by one district is rehired by
another; in my model, fired teachers must exit the profession.
         Second, an important issue in my analysis is uncertainty about a teacher’s
ability that is gradually resolved through her demonstrated performance on the job.
    7 Lazear’s (2000) famous Safelite Auto Glass study examines a firm-level performance pay pro-

gram; a similar program implemented at the industry level would almost certainly have smaller
selection effects. The ongoing official evaluation of the federal Teacher Incentive Fund will assign
schools to treatments within participating districts (Mathematica Policy Research, undated), severely
limiting its ability to identify policy-relevant effects on teacher recruitment and retention.



                                                 7
Accordingly, I distinguish between decisions to enter the teaching profession and
those about exiting later. Because uncertainty is greatest at the beginning of the ca-
reer, entry decisions are relatively insensitive to performance-dependent contracts,
while exit decisions become gradually more sensitive as the career goes on.
         Third, as suggested above by Hess (2010), occupation choices depend on
both current salary offers and on anticipated future salaries.8 My model explicitly
incorporates forward-looking expectations and uncertainty coming from limited in-
formation about one’s own ability and from noise in the performance measurement
system. I rule out, however, uncertainty about the future direction of policy: I as-
sume that everyone assumes that any proposed contract will be unchanged for the
duration of all current teachers’ careers, and I examine steady-state effects after all
teachers recruited under a prior contract have retired.
         Finally, teacher quality depends on demand as well as on supply. I assume
that districts are unable to distinguish teacher ability at the point of hiring.9 Their
only options for managing quality are to adjust contract parameters to induce self
selection on the part of potential teachers and/or to retain teachers selectively after
observed performance reveals a teacher’s quality. The district obtains no value from
excess supply, so I assume that it adjusts base wages to the point that total labor
supply (net of that offered by teachers who the district chooses to fire) matches
that obtained under the baseline single salary schedule. This amounts to treating
   8I  am not aware of good estimates of the return to teaching experience in non-teaching jobs. If
experienced teachers are paid in other occupations like inexperienced workers, policies that raise the
turnover rate may dramatically lower the expected lifetime returns to entering teaching.
    9 Ballou (1996) hypothesizes that salaries are weakly linked to quality in the cross section because

districts facing excess supply do a poor job of selecting the highest-quality applicants. This claim
is not inconsistent with a supply-side effect of salaries on the quality of applicants, as implied by
evidence that teacher quality has declined as high-ability women’s non-teaching options improved
(Corcoran et al., 2004).


                                                   8
the district’s labor demand as totally inelastic, consistent with laws and collective
bargaining contracts that commonly specify class sizes.



3      The Model

I develop the model in several parts. Section 3.1 defines the performance measure
and the Bayesian learning process. Section 3.2 discusses entry and exit decisions,
which depend on both the contract terms and the teacher type. These are motivated
by an on-the-job search model. Finally, Section 3.3 describes the performance-
linked contracts that I consider. Additional contracts are considered in the appendix.


3.1         Effectiveness, Performance Measurement, and Learning

Individual i has fixed ability τi as a teacher. In the current pool of teachers ability is
normally distributed with mean 0 and standard deviation στ , though new contracts
may change the selection process and thereby alter that distribution.
            A teacher’s output depends on her ability and her experience, t, with known
return-to-experience function r (t): y∗it = τi + r (t). Each year, a noisy productivity
measure is observed by both the teacher and the employer:10


                                              yit = τi + εit .                                           (1)


The noise component, ε, is i.i.d. Gaussian with mean 0 and standard deviation σε .
The performance measure is unbiased – all teachers draw their εs from the same
    10 In
        practice, the observed signal is y∗it + εit = yit + r (t). But so long as the r () function is known,
all parties can easily back out yit .



                                                     9
distribution, regardless of who they teach or the methods they use.11
       Prospective teachers have only limited information about their τi s. At entry,
                            �             �
teacher i’s prior is τi ∼ N µi , στ2 − σµ2 , where µi represents the teacher’s private
                          �      �
information and µi ∼ N 0, σµ2 in the population of current teachers.12 The preci-
sion of potential teachers’ information can be summarized by h ≡ V (E[τ | µ])/V (τ) =
σµ2/στ2 ,   where h = 1 corresponds to perfect accuracy and h = 0 to a total lack of in-
formation. The employer cannot observe µi or τi , and compensation and retention
thus depend only on the sequence of yit s.
            Incumbent teachers update their priors rationally as performance signals ar-
rive. The teacher’s posterior after t years is
                         �                                                          �

where ȳt ≡ t −1 ∑ts=1 ys is the average performance signal to date. I denote the poste-
rior mean – the first term in (2) – by τ̂it . As t gets large, the influence of the original
guess shrinks, and τ̂it converges toward the true ability τi .


3.2         The Teacher Labor Market: Entry and Persistence

Prospective teachers have von Neumann-Morgenstern utility u (w), where w is an-
nual compensation, and discount rate δ .13 Each prospective and incumbent teacher
   11 It is not clear whether real-world performance measures have this property – see Rothstein
(2010) and Chetty et al. (2011).
   12 If low-ability prospective teachers overestimate their own effectiveness, the effect of perfor-

mance incentives on recruitment would be diluted – even bad teachers would respond to incentives
meant for good ones.
   13 To my knowledge, this is the first dynamic occupational choice model to allow for risk aversion

(i.e., concave u ()). A more complete model would define u () over annual consumption and allow
agents to borrow and save to smooth consumption over time. I do not pursue this here. I discuss an


                                                10
draws a single outside job offer at the beginning of each year t, 1 ≤ t ≤ T . These
offers are summarized by their continuation values, ωt .
        A prospective teacher forecasts the utility she will obtain from a teaching
career, which I denote V1 (µ; C) to emphasize that this may depend both on her
private information µ and on the terms of the contract C, and enters teaching if
V1 (µ; C) > ω1 . An incumbent teacher’s forecast of her remaining utility in teach-
ing, Vt (θt−1 ; C), depends on the state variable θt−1 ≡ {µ, y1 , . . . , yt−1 } and on C. If
Vt (θt−1 ; C) < ωt , the teacher accepts the outside offer. Teachers who accept outside
offers, either initially or later, can not reenter teaching.
        After each year of teaching, the teacher receives a new performance signal,
and uses this to better forecast her inside earnings. She also receives a new draw
from the outside offer distribution. Thus, Vt is defined recursively:


             Vt (θt−1 ; C) = E [u (wt ) + δ max (ωt+1 , Vt+1 (θt ; C))| θt−1 ] .         (3)


The expectation is taken over the teacher’s posterior τ distribution following period
t − 1, as given by (2), and over the distribution of the noise term εit . Careers end
after T periods, so VT (θT −1 ; C) = E [u (wT ) | θT −1 ].
        ωt is assumed independent of θt−1 and τ. This is consistent with most
of the available evidence, which generally indicates little relationship between be-
tween teaching effectiveness and characteristics observable on entry (Hanushek and
Rivkin, 2006; Rockoff et al., 2011). Several studies find that effectiveness is nega-
tively correlated with the probability of exit from teaching (Krieg, 2006; Goldhaber
et al., 2011); given the weak or nonexistent returns to effectiveness in teaching, one
alternative model that captures some income smoothing in Section 4.3.


                                              11
would expect the opposite if teaching ability were correlated with outside wages. I
weaken this assumption later.
        The ωt distribution is calibrated so that the annual exit hazard under the
base contract – the probability that ωt exceeds Vt (θ ; C0 ), where C0 is the baseline,
single-salary contract discussed below – is λ0 and the elasticities of entry and exit
with respect to certain, permanent changes in w are η and −ζ , respectively.14 The
Appendix discusses the distributional assumptions that generate this.
        Equation (3) does not have a closed-form solution, so I evaluate the value
function numerically using an algorithm described in the Appendix. To simulate
the impact of an alternative contract C, I draw teachers from the joint distribution of
{µ, τ}, then draw performance measures {y1 , . . . , yT } for each. For each teacher,

I compute Vt at each year t under contract C, and use this to compute the effect of
contract C on the probability of entering the profession and, conditional on entering,
on surviving to year t. Note that this does not require modeling the distribution
of {µ, τ} in the population of potential teachers – under my constant elasticity
assumptions, changes in the returns to teaching induce proportional changes in the
amount of labor supplied to teaching by each type that do not depend on the number
of people of that type in the population.
        An important parameter governing the effect of alternative contracts is the
cost to a teacher of being fired. I assume that a teacher who is fired after year t
receives continuation value equal to (1 − κ) times the continuation value obtained
under contract C0 (under which no one is ever fired). This captures the empirical
   14 As T → ∞ the average career length approaches the inverse of the annual exit hazard, and

the elasticity of the career length with respect to the inside wage converges toward ζ . With the
parameters used below (T = 30, λ0 = 0.08, and ζ = 3), the elasticity is roughly 0.77ζ = 2.3. The
total labor supply elasticity is the sum of the entry and career length elasticities, η + 0.77ζ .


                                               12
fact that workers who lose their jobs see long-run earnings declines (von Wachter
et al., 2009). The firing penalty κ is not paid by someone who voluntarily exits in
advance of an expected termination. Thus, if κ is large, teachers who anticipate a
high probability that they will eventually be fired will voluntarily exit at high rates.


3.3     Teacher contracts

I treat as the baseline a single salary contract C0 under which all teachers are re-
tained every year (though they may depart voluntarily) and pay rises with t but
is independent of θ : w0it = w0 (1 + g (t)), with g� () ≥ 0 . Alternative contracts
base either the compensation or the retention decision on the sequence of perfor-
mance signals to date. I consider two alternatives, performance-based bonuses and
performance-based non-retention (i.e., firing):

Bonus Bonuses are awarded to teachers with sufficiently high measured perfor-
       mance, averaged across two years to reduce the influence of noise. Thus, in
                                                                yit +yi,t−1
       year t bonuses are awarded to all teachers with               2        above a threshold yB ;
       first-year teachers are ineligible. yB is calibrated based on the baseline dis-
                      yit +yi,t−1
       tribution of        2        to ensure that in the absence of behavioral responses a
       fraction f B of teachers would receive bonuses each year. In order to balance
       the increased labor supply induced by the bonus program, base salaries are
       reduced to a fraction α B < 1 of the baseline salary w0it .15 Thus, compensation
       is wBit = α B w0it (1 + b ∗ eit ), where eit is an indicator for bonus receipt and b
  15 Bonus programs have often been implemented as add-ons to the preexisting base salary. In my
framework, this produces excess labor supply, and districts have no choice but to choose randomly
from the pool of applicants. The productivity benefits are the same as with a lower base salary, but
costs are much higher.

          indexes the size of the bonus (as a share of base pay).

Firing In this contract, firing decisions are made on an ongoing basis – any teacher
          for whom the district’s posterior mean falls below a threshold yF is dis-
          missed.16 Thus, a teacher who performs extremely badly in the first year or
          two is fired right away, while a teacher who squeaks above that threshold but
          continues to perform badly is fired somewhat later. yF is calibrated so that the
          share of teachers in the current ability-experience-performance history distri-
          bution whose posterior means fall below the threshold is f F . Pay for teachers
          who are not fired is according to the single salary schedule, wFit = α F w0it , with
          α F > 1 to ensure adequate labor supply.

The firing contract differs from the tenure rules considered by Staiger and Rockoff
(2010), under which the district is forced to make a once-and-for-all retention deci-
sion early in the teacher’s career. Tenure contracts are more common than the one
I consider, but make poor use of the available information – there is no reason to
ignore post-tenure performance information entirely.
           In the appendix, I consider a more traditional tenure contract. I also consider
there a contract that allows pay to depend continuously on performance, with a
larger variable component for experienced teachers for whom the district has better
information. Neither these nor the contracts above are optimal. In my model, where
effort is irrelevant, the optimal pay schedule would have low or zero annual pay and
a very large performance-dependent retirement bonus. The firing rule would have

         assume the district uses a prior for entering teachers of τ ∼ N 0, στ2 , resulting in poste-

contract the τ distribution for entering teachers will differ from this. I ignore this complication.

a threshold that rises even faster with t than in my firing contract, in recognition of
the option value of retaining a teacher for whom the prior variance is high.


3.4     Calibration

Table 1 lists the key parameters of the model along with the values that I use. I
discuss the choice of baseline values in each category in turn.
         I calibrate the effectiveness and measurement parameters from the value-
added literature. The standard deviation of teacher value-added for students’ end-
of-year test scores has been widely estimated to be between 0.1 and 0.2, with 0.15
as a reasonable central estimate (e.g., Rivkin et al., 2005; Rothstein, 2010; Chetty
et al., 2011). The same research typically shows important experience effects in the
early years of the career that level off later; the specific value for r (t) in Table 1 is
drawn from Staiger and Rockoff’s (2010) estimates for New York City. A number
of papers also examine the year-to-year correlation of value-added measures (Sass,
2008; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, 2010). My chosen value for σε corre-
                                                        V (τ)          στ2
sponds to a reliability ratio for y (defined as         V (y)   =   στ2 +σε2
                                                                             )   of 0.4, at the upper end
of the range surveyed by Sass (2008).
         A number of studies have found that observable teacher characteristics are
poor predictors of future effectiveness. Rockoff et al. (2011) are among the most
successful at predicting future value-added, using a number of academic and per-
sonality characteristics, but obtain an h of only 0.1. Of course, teachers may have
more information about their own personalities than can be captured by the Rock-
off et al. (2011) survey.17 Nevertheless, my assumption that h = 0.25 most likely
  17 Participants   in the POINT study (Springer et al., 2010) were asked to forecast their probability


                                                   15
overstates the true value.
         There are few good estimates of the key teacher preference parameters. The
discount rate is relatively standard. Zero risk aversion is unlikely; one might expect
teachers – who have self-selected into a very secure but low paying occupation – to
be unusually averse to risk (Flyer and Rosen, 1997). I use linear utility as a baseline,
and explore risk aversion in Section 4.3.
         The exit elasticity, ζ , is taken from Ransom and Sims’ (2010) study of salary
variation across Missouri school districts. This study focuses on exit to other school
districts, and thus most likely overstates the elasticity of exit from the profession.
I arbitrarily assume that the entry elasticity η is the same (in absolute value). I as-
sume that the annual exit hazard under the baseline single salary contract is constant
at 8%, and that careers end after T = 30 years. This is roughly consistent with the
observed national data, though in these data exit rates are somewhat higher in the
first years of teachers’ careers; see Appendix Figure 1.
         A teacher who is fired obtains a continuation value κ = 10% below what
is obtained under the baseline contract. This is likely an understatement – von
Wachter et al. (2009) find that workers displaced by mass layoffs see their earnings
decline by 20-30% relative to a control group, with effects that persist for at least
20 years.18
         I assume that the single salary contract provides for a 1.5% (real) increase
of winning a performance award. These forecasts — from experienced teachers who certainly knew
more about their own effectiveness than would an entering teacher — were uncorrelated with actual
award receipt. This suggests that h is quite small.
   18 The effects of mass layoffs may overstate the effect if layoffs are concentrated in declining oc-

cupations or industries. On the other hand, even in declining sectors at least some laid off workers
are able to find reemployment in the same sector; I assume that a fired teacher must exit the occu-
pation. Moreover, future employers may react more negatively to learning that a job candidate was
fired from a previous position for poor performance than that she lost her job in a mass layoff.


                                                 16
for each year of experience. The alternative contracts are based on this contract
and thus provide similar average experience premia. The bonus contract provides
a 20% bonus for teachers whose two-year moving average performance exceeds
a fixed threshold yB = 0.178, set to ensure that f B = 25% of the current teaching
workforce would get bonuses.
        The firing contract is calibrated so that a teacher is fired whenever the dis-
trict’s posterior mean for her ability falls below yF = −0.159. This threshold is
chosen to ensure that f F = 10% of current teachers would be fired in the first year
of the contract’s implementation, though the steady state firing rate would be much
lower. Given the other parameter values, a new teacher would need y1 < −0.40
                                1
to be fired after one year,     2 (y1 + y2 )   < −0.29 to be fired after two years, and
1
3 (y1 + y2 + y3 )   < −0.24 to be fired after three. Under the current τ distribution,
less than 5% of teachers would be fired after the first year, a slightly larger share of
those who remain would be fired in the second year, and firing rates would decline
thereafter; 22% of teachers would be fired before the end of a 30-year career.
        Both yB and yF are fixed – if the alternative contracts attract more high-τ
teachers then more bonuses would be paid or fewer teachers would be fired.
        The final parameters are α B and α F , the adjustments to base pay under the
bonus and firing contracts. These are chosen, given the other parameters, to ensure
the same total number of teachers (in steady state) as are obtained under the baseline
contract. This requires a 3.6% reduction in base pay under the bonus contract and
a 5.4% increase under the firing contract.

4      Results

4.1         Noise, information, and incentives

The incentive faced by a teacher i with ability prior τ̂it depends on the link between
this prior and her true ability, the link from true ability to the performance signal,
and the link from the performance signal to the contract terms. Moreover, the suc-
cess of a contract depends on the average incentive perceived by teachers at each
true ability level τi , among whom there may be much variation in τ̂it .
            Under the bonus contract, the rule of iterated expectations can be used to
express the subjective probability in year t of winning a bonus in year s > t + 1
(ensuring that yt does not directly affect bonus eligibility) as:

                                          � �                        � �� �
                       E [eis | τ̂it ] = E E E [eis | yis , yi,s−1 ] � τi � τ̂it .                (4)


I am able to omit the outer conditioning variables from the inner expectations be-
cause the inner variables capture all of the relevant information – bonus receipt is
independent of ability conditional on performance over two years, and performance
is independent of perceived ability conditional on true ability.
                                                                                            yis +yi,s−1
            The innermost term is straightforward – eis is merely an indicator for               2        >
yB . But each of the two outer expectations serves to smooth out the incentives. The
dotted line in Figure 1 plots the probability that a teacher at each ability (τ) level
will win a bonus in a given year, E [eis | τi ].19 The other series show the effects of
    19 In
       this figure and in those that follow, I express ability in terms of the percentile rank within
the current teacher distribution (which, recall, is Gaussian with mean 0 and standard deviation
στ = 0.15). Of course, under alternative policies this distribution would change. The fixed-norm
percentile scores are simply a convenient scale.


                                                  18
shortening or lengthening the averaging period. They show that using only one year
of measured performance produces extremely high rates of misclassification, with
bonus probabilities above 10% for all teachers in the upper two-thirds of the ability
distribution. Averaging over five years reduces the probability that a bottom-half
teacher will win a bonus to less than 2%, but still yields substantial error rates for
teachers near the threshold: While top decile teachers win bonuses an average of
80% of the time, those in the next decile win with only 40% probability. The two-
year bonus contract is intermediate between these, with meaningful incentives for
top-third teachers but only limited distinctions among them.
        These incentives are further attenuated by uncertainty about one’s own abil-
ity. Figure 2 shows E [eis | τ̂it ] = E [E [eis | τi ] | τ̂it ] at different points in the career.
For early-career teachers, the τ̂it distribution is quite compressed. Thus, even a
teacher at the 90th percentile of the µ distribution thinks she has only a 37% chance
of receiving a bonus in any given year of her career. As teachers accumulate in-
formation, they quickly learn their places in the distribution. After one year, the
teacher at the 90th percentile of the posterior mean distribution thinks her chance
of receiving a bonus is 42%, and this rises to 45% after two years and 49% after 5
years. By that point, teachers’ posteriors are fairly tight, and the curve in Figure 2
closely resembles that in Figure 1.
        Figure 2 illustrates the allocation of incentives by teachers’ perceived abil-
ity, τ̂it . But the key question for the efficacy of the bonus system is whether teach-
ers who actually are of high ability perceive their future pay to have risen. That
is, the incentives that the teacher contract creates to attract good teachers are gov-
erned by E [E [wis | τ̂it ]| τi ], which is necessarily flatter than E [wis | τ̂it ] because be-


                                               19
cause E [ τ̂it | τi ] has a slope less than one. Figure 3 shows the average anticipated
probability of winning a bonus by percentile of true ability. At entry there is very
little differentiation except at the extreme tails of the distribution. But perceived
incentives become much better targeted as teachers gain experience. Thus, while
incentive effects of a bonus system are weak at the recruitment stage, later attrition
decisions may be more sensitive to these incentives.
       As Figure 1 illustrates, a big source of slippage in the bonus program is the
use of only two years of performance data for determination of bonus eligibility,
even when more are available. This suggests that the firing contract, which uses
all available performance data for each year’s retention decisions, may be more
effective. I turn now to this contract. The solid line in Figure 4 shows the probability
that a teacher of ability τ will be fired at some point over a 30 year career under
this contract. Not surprisingly, the firing policy is much more accurate than is the
bonus policy (compare to Figure 1): A teacher at the 10th percentile has a 93%
chance of being fired, where a teacher at the 90th percentile had only a 54% chance
of receiving a bonus in any given year, while a median teacher has a 9% chance of
receiving a bonus but only a 4% chance of ever being fired.
       As with the bonus policy, however, the incentives created by the firing con-
tract are attenuated by teachers’ uncertainty about their own abilities. The dashed
line in Figure 4 shows the average subjective probability of ever being fired, mea-
sured at the beginning of the career and averaged across all prospective teachers at
each ability level. It shows that there is relatively little difference between high and
low ability prospective teachers in their subjective assessments of the likelihood
that they will be recognized as ineffective.


                                          20
        There is a close, albeit imperfect, mapping from the subjective probabilities
of positive and negative outcomes graphed in Figures 3 and as the dashed line in
4 to the average values of teachers of different abilities under the two contracts.
Figure 5 shows average continuation values of teachers under the two contracts,
by ability level and years of experience.20 Because the V scale is not intuitive, I
report equivalent variations: Changes in salaries under the single salary contract
that would yield the same values. An estimate of (for example) +5% means that w0
would need to rise by 5% under contract C0 to yield the same value as is obtained
under the alternative contract. The figure shows that the bonus contract produces the
equivalent of a 1.3% salary increase for the average 95th percentile teacher at entry,
and a 6.9% increase after five years.21 These small changes suggest that any self-
selection responses to the bonus program will be quite modest, even with relatively
large labor supply elasticities. The firing contract achieves a steeper slope, but even
it creates only weak incentives for self selection: The range of continuation values
is equivalent to only about 7% of salary differentiation at entry, growing to about
15% after two years and shrinking thereafter.


4.2    Impact of incentives

Figure 5 indicates that the performance pay contract creates quite modest incentives
to encourage highly effective teachers to enter and remain in teaching, and that the
  20 Averages are computed over all teachers who have not been fired to date, ignoring voluntary exit

decisions. This means that the values shown for experienced, low-ability teachers under the firing
contract reflect outlier teachers who have been unusually lucky in their measured performance.
   21 Recall that base salaries are reduced by an amount 1 − α B under the bonus contract. Thus,

the average equivalent variation for the lowest ability teachers approaches α B − 1 = −3.6% as the
(subjective) probability of future bonus receipt approaches zero.




                                                21
firing contract creates somewhat larger but still not enormous incentives – though a
potentially more important effect of this contract is that it forces many teachers to
leave even though they would prefer to remain. What do these estimates imply for
the recruitment and retention of teachers of different abilities?
       I begin by examining recruitment. Figure 6 shows the number of entering
teachers at each ability percentile under each contract, expressed as a percentage of
the number obtained under the baseline contract. Both alternative contracts entice
more high ability and fewer low ability teachers to enter teaching, with the firing
contract much more successful than the bonus contract at the top end but much less
successful at the bottom end. (Note that the firing contract requires many more
recruits in total, to replace those from earlier cohorts who have been fired.)
       Figure 7 shows average career length under the four contracts. The bonus
contract has only small effects on this margin, concentrated at the very top of the
ability distribution. To offset the increased labor supply of high-ability teachers,
base salaries are reduced by 1 − α B = 3.6% under this contract, reducing career
lengths by about 5% for below-median teachers.
       The firing contract has a more dramatic effect. At the bottom of the abil-
ity distribution, career lengths shorten dramatically, by as much as 85% for the
very weakest teachers. This primarily reflects firing decisions. Substantial salary
increases are required to offset this; I find that salaries under the firing contract
must rise by α F − 1 = 5.9% to yield enough teachers. This reduces voluntary at-
trition for teachers who do not expect to be fired, lengthening the average career
of above-median teachers by about 12%. The higher salaries also reduce voluntary
attrition among low-ability teachers, but because these teachers are generally fired


                                          22
quite early in their careers this has little effect.
        Figure 8 presents the impact of the two contracts on the steady state number
of teachers at each ability level, combining entry and career length effects. Not
surprisingly, the bonus contract has relatively small effects, reducing the number of
low ability teachers by about 10% and increasing the number of high ability teachers
by a bit more, as much as 40% at the very top of the distribution. The firing policy
is much more effective, attracting slightly fewer of the highest ability teachers but
more than making up through this with larger increases in the number of average-
to-high ability teachers and dramatic reductions at very low ability levels.
        Table 2 shows the effects of the two contracts on teacher ability, experience,
effectiveness (combining ability and experience effects), and salaries. Bonuses raise
average ability only slightly, while the firing policy is nearly three times as effective.
Neither policy has large effects on the experience distribution, so net effects on
teacher productivity – +0.015 for bonuses and +0.040 for firing – are quite close to
the gross effects on teacher ability.
        The result that the firing policy has negligible effects on the number of inex-
perienced teachers contrasts sharply with Staiger and Rockoff’s (2010) result that
teacher experience effects constrain the scope of tenure policies (albeit at much
higher firing rates). There are two explanations for this. First, in the Appendix I
show that a fixed-t tenure policy has larger (but still modest effects) on the steady
state number of inexperienced teachers than does the ongoing firing policy I con-
sider here. Second, and much more important, is the role of labor market interac-
tions: The firing policy must be accompanied by substantial salary increases, and
the resulting reductions in turnover among experienced teachers largely offset the


                                             23
increases due to firing of new teachers. Thus, the main tradeoff that this policy
involves is not with experience but with salary costs, which rise by 5.9% under the
firing policy. Salary costs also rise under the bonus policy, by 1.8%, as base salaries
cannot be reduced enough to offset the cost of the bonuses themselves.
            It is useful to compare the cost effectiveness of the two contracts to a more
traditional way to use extra educational resources, for class size reduction. A cal-
culation based on Krueger’s (1999) analysis of the STAR class size experiment
suggests that a 1% reduction in class size would cost about 3.0% of the teacher
salary budget and would raise student achievement by about 0.004 standard devia-
tions.22 Both of the contracts considered here are substantially more cost effective
than this, at least in my stylized simulation. One implication is that it would be
possible to pay for each program by raising class sizes, rather than by raising total
expenditures, while still retaining positive student achievement effects.
            Another implication is that the policies could be expanded while remaining
cost effective. I focus here on the firing policy, as this is more naturally scaled. (Few
have proposed making more than about 20% of a teacher’s salary contingent on her
performance.) Figure 9 shows the output and cost effects of raising the retention
threshold so that ever larger shares of current teachers would be fired.23 Productiv-
ity benefits scale roughly linearly. However, the costs increase nonlinearly, reaching
about 50% of the total salary pool when the share of current teachers who would be
  22 This  is based on teacher salaries representing about one-third of total educational expenditures,
an assumption that outcomes are linear in the log of class size, and Krueger’s (1999) result that
reducing class sizes from 22 to 15 raised scores by about 0.15 standard deviations. My labor supply
model implies that hiring more teachers requires increasing all teachers’ salaries, but this effect is
negligible for class size reduction.
   23 I consider only firing rates below 50%. When f F exceeds 0.5, the retention threshold yF rises

above zero, and very many first year teachers – for whom the district’s posterior mean equals 0.4
times the first-year performance – are fired immediately.


                                                 24
fired approaches 45%.
       The dashed lines in Figure 9 present alternative simulations that assume
                                                                             1   1−ρ ,
lower labor supply elasticities (η = ζ = 1.5) and risk aversion (u (w) =    1−ρ w

with relative risk aversion parameter ρ = 3) on the part of teachers. This has rel-
atively little effect on the productivity benefits of increased firing rates, but more
dramatic effects on the costs: With these parameters – arguably more realistic than
my baseline – the costs explode when f F rises above about 30%. Importantly, costs
become quite large even with much lower firing rates. Setting a retention thresh-
old that would exclude one-fifth of current teachers would require increasing the
teacher salary budget by more than 20%.


4.3    Sensitivity to alternative parameters & policies

Of course, all of the results presented above are dependent on the specific parameter
values set out in Table 1. Table 3 presents estimates of the achievement effects and
costs of the policies – at the original scale – under alternative parameter values. The
first row repeats the estimates for the baseline parameters. Rows 2 and 3 expand the
amount of private information that prospective teachers have about their own abili-
ties. In row 2, a prospective teacher has the equivalent of one annual performance
measure, while in row 3 she has the equivalent of two annual signals. More private
information leads to larger achievement effects. It reduces costs under the firing
policies – it allows teachers to better predict firing outcomes, thereby permitting
those who would be fired to select out beforehand. But it raises costs slightly under
the bonus contract, under which more bonuses would need to be paid out.
       Row 4 shows estimates for a less noisy performance measure, with reliabil-


                                          25
ity 0.6 in place of the 0.4 used for the earlier results. This makes the bonus contract
much more effective, but has little effect on the firing contract.
        Rows 5 through 10 show the effects of varying the labor supply elasticities.
In general, both policies are more effective when labor supply is more elastic. The
bonus policy is more sensitive to the exit than to the entry elasticity and becomes
more expensive as the elasticities rise. Both relationships are of the opposite sign
for the firing policy.
        Row 11 shows an additional variant in which the entry elasticity is specified
to be an increasing function of µ: η = 3 + 2 σµτ . In a Roy model with corr (µ, ω1 ) >
0, entry of higher-µ potential teachers is more elastic than that of those with lower
µ. The function here is approximately what would obtain with a correlation around
0.5. It somewhat shrinks the costs of the policies, with little effect on the benefits.
        Rows 12 and 13 show the impact of risk aversion on the results. In row 12, I
assume that teachers are risk averse, with constant relative risk aversion parameter
3, over their annual incomes. One drawback of this is that it treats that idiosyncratic
annual risk (such as is generated by noise in bonus receipt) as just as costly as is
permanent risk like that generated by inaccurate firing policies. To partially address
this, in Row 13 I modify equation (3) to allow teachers to be risk averse over the
sum of their current income and their continuation values:



                      � �                                     1 �
                                                                 �      ��1−ρ
       Vt (θt−1 ; C) = E (wt + δ max (ωt+1 , Vt+1 (θt ; C))) 1−ρ � θt−1       .      (5)


This does not fully capture consumption smoothing, but it is a step in the right



                                          26
direction. Risk aversion of this type leads to much smaller cost increases and better
self-selection under the bonus policy, but makes firing a bit more expensive.
       Row 14 shows an alternative bonus contract in which larger bonuses are
given to fewer teachers. This attenuates the effect on student achievement. Row
15 shows estimates when firing is more costly to the worker – this makes the firing
policy more effective but also much more expensive.
       The appendix presents results for two additional contracts. One modifies
the bonus policy to condition on the full performance history rather than on just the
two most recent measures. This makes the policy dramatically more effective. The
second is a tenure policy in which firing decisions are made only after a teacher’s
second year. This is less effective and more expensive than my firing policy, but the
differences are small.



5   Misalignment of Performance Measure & Goal Distortion

I have assumed thus far that the performance measure is a noisy but otherwise
accurate measure of teacher ability. But this overlooks two important sources of
slippage between true and measured output. First, teachers’ output is multidimen-
sional – they should raise students’ math and reading scores, but should also teach
non-cognitive skills, other academic subjects (e.g., history, science, etc.), and non-
academic topics like citizenship and art. Even an excellent performance measure is
likely to capture the full range of outputs only imperfectly. Second, teachers facing
strong incentives may be able to raise their measured performance without improv-
ing their overall productivity, by redirecting effort from unmeasured to measured
dimensions (Glewwe et al., 2010) or simply by distorting the performance measure

                                         27
directly, such as by cheating (Jacob and Levitt, 2003) or teaching to the test.
        In this Section, I explore the implications of these issues under the firing
contract. Results are necessarily extremely speculative, as little is known about
either factor. Unfortunately, efforts to correlate measured performance with true
productivity are severely hampered by the lack of an agreed-upon, comprehensive
definition of productivity. But there is suggestive evidence that the correlation may
not be very high. The Gates Foundation’s Measures of Effective Teaching (MET)
project, for example, has found that teachers’ value added – net of measurement
error – for students’ scores on traditional standardized tests is correlated only 0.37
to 0.54 with the teachers’ effects on student scores on more cognitively demanding,
open response exams (Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, 2010; Rothstein, 2011).24
Correlations between value-added measures and teacher observations are generally
even lower than this (Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, 2012). It thus seems im-
plausible that any feasible performance measure will be very highly correlated with
a comprehensive understanding of a teacher’s true productivity.
        I first augment the model developed above to incorporate this. I assume
that each teacher performs two tasks and that her ability to perform the first, τiA , is
imperfectly correlated with her ability to perform the second, τiB . I further assume
that the two are jointly normal with identical variances and that the performance
measure is based on only the first output dimension, yit = τiA + εit .
        The first column of Table 4 presents baseline estimates when corr (τiA , τiB ) =
1.25 In the second column, I assume that corr (τiA , τiB ) = 0.4, consistent with the
  24 Theseare “disattenuated,” intended to estimate corr (τA , τB ) rather than corr (yA , yB ).
  25 Reported results in Table 4, column 1 differ slightly from those seen earlier. The augmented
model incorporating influence activities (discussed below and reported in columns 3-4) is more
computationally intensive and as a result I use a less accurate numerical approximation. See the


                                               28
MET evidence.26 Because the firing policy selects (imperfectly) only on τiA and be-
cause E [τiB | τiA ] < τiA , the effect of the policy on the second dimension of teacher
output is less than half as large as that on the measured dimension.
         This assumes, as I have so far, that teachers’ productivity is exogenous and
unalterable. But it is natural to expect that teachers have some latitude to distribute
their efforts across the different dimensions of output. If so, high-stakes incentives
based on one of the dimensions will cause teachers to focus on that dimension, even
if that comes at the exclusion of the other.
         Essentially nothing is known about the quantitative magnitude of goal dis-
tortions and other influence activities in teaching.27 Nevertheless, it seems impor-
tant to understand whether such distortions can plausibly be important components
of the response to high-stakes incentives, and even more so whether they under-
cut the intended effects. I thus adopt an extremely ad hoc model of the teacher’s
effort response. I assume that a teacher can each year choose an effort level E to
be devoted to influencing the performance measure, producing an output measure
yit = τiA + Eit + εit , but that the teacher must pay a cost c (E) = kE 2 to do so. I
choose k so that raising measured performance by one standard deviation of the
conditional distribution of τiA given τiB costs 20% of a first year teacher’s annual
Appendix for details. I use the relatively inaccurate approximation in columns 1-2 of Table 4 as
well, to facilitate comparisons across models.
   26 I assume that µ is unidimensional and that E [τ | µ ] = E [τ | µ ] = µ . If prospective teach-
                                                     iA  i        iB  i      i
ers had any information about their relative effectiveness on the two dimensions, the effect on
dimension-B output would be even smaller.
   27 Carrell and West (2010) present suggestive evidence from a very different context that it could

be important: They show that adjunct math instructors at the Air Force Academy produce better
outcomes on the measure on which they are evaluated than do tenured faculty but that the adjuncts’
students do worse in the long run. See also Glewwe et al. (2010), Campbell (1979), and Figlio and
Loeb (2011).

salary.28 This is extremely high – most forms of influence activities would be much
less personally costly than this.
        Teachers choose E to trade off the costs c (E) and the benefits of distort-
ing their measured performance, which depend on performance to date and on the
teacher’s information about her own ability. Manipulation raises measured perfor-
mance but makes it harder for the district to identify and fire the weakest teachers.
As a consequence, the benefits of the firing policy, net of the manipulation, are
attenuated. This is shown in column 3 of Table 4. The impact of the firing pol-
icy on average measured effectiveness is slightly lower than without manipulation.
But when the effects of distortionary effort are excluded – which they should be if
the influence activity takes an unproductive form such as cheating or teaching to
the test – the policy’s impact shrinks by a third. And the effects on dimension-B
effectiveness are even smaller, only 0.013 student-level standard deviations.
        Even this may understate the degree to which distortionary effort can un-
dercut the firing policy. Many forms of manipulation – e.g., narrowing of the cur-
riculum or diversion of class time to test preparation – take the form of transferring
output from unmeasured dimensions to those covered by the test. In column 4,
I present results when effort E reduces dimension-B output one-for-one with its
positive effect on measured dimension-A output. In this case, the impact of the
firing policy on dimension-B output is almost totally eliminated: The negative con-
sequences of teaching to the test offset nearly all of the improved selection on τiB
seen in column 3. Despite this, the district must continue to pay a substantial cost
in higher salaries to compensate teachers for the costs they bear from their manipu-

lation effort and from the firing that persists.
        It must be emphasized that the effort model here is not based on any specific
evidence of the cost or quantity of manipulation of the performance measure in
response to high-stakes incentives. But the importance of manipulative activity in
response to high-stakes incentives in education is well established and it seems quite
plausible that distortions of the measurement process could be even worse than is
assumed here. Understanding their form and quantitative magnitude is evidently
extremely important to predicting even the qualitative impact of teacher quality
policies.



6   Discussion

The simulations presented here suggest that the effects of many proposed teacher
quality policies will depend importantly on their interaction with the teacher labor
market. So long as prospective teachers are uncertain about their own abilities or
labor supply to teaching is less than perfectly elastic, both performance-based com-
pensation and performance-based retention policies require substantial increases in
total teacher compensation in order to produce meaningful changes in productivity.
        Assuming that the necessary funding is available and that teachers are un-
able to game the performance measurement process, both classes of policies appear
to be cost effective at modest scales relative to “traditional” uses of additional funds.
Indeed, recognition of the labor market effects can make non-retention policies even
more effective than when these effects are ignored, as the accompanying salary in-
creases help to attract and retain high ability teachers. My results also point to
the importance of policy design, as cost-effectiveness varies importantly with the

                                           31
specifics of the teacher contract.
         There are several important caveats to my results, however. First, and most
importantly, they rely on a best case view of the potential for teacher performance
assessment. As Section 5 shows, effects on unmeasured dimensions of teacher
productivity are likely to be much weaker than those on measured performance.
Moreover, even these effects depend crucially on the assumption that performance
measures are noisy but incorruptible. In the real world, every performance mea-
sure is susceptible to “influence activities” that raise the measure out of proportion
to changes in true performance. If teachers can improve their measured perfor-
mance by arranging to have the right students, by reducing the attention paid to
non-tested topics and subjects, by teaching to the test, or by outright cheating, then
the improvements in true learning that would obtain under high-stakes account-
ability policies are dramatically attenuated. Effects on unmeasured dimensions of
productivity could easily be negative. Two high priority topics for future research
must be the degree to which available performance measures are correlated with
other dimensions of teacher output and the extent to which the measures become
corrupted when the stakes are raised (Rothstein, 2011).29
         Even when the possibility of systematic divergence between measured and
true effectiveness is ruled out by assumption, the impacts of alternative teacher
contracts on student achievement are modest. Neither of the alternative contracts
considered here would raise average productivity by more than one-third of a stan-
dard deviation, even under extremely optimistic parameters. These kinds of benefits
   29 Chetty et al. (2011) relate teachers’ value-added to students’ later earnings. But their analy-

sis can only show that the correlation is positive; they do not estimate the magnitude. And their
estimates derive from a low-stakes setting.



                                                32
would be most welcome, but would not represent fundamental changes in our edu-
cation system. Larger benefits are possible if the scope of the policies is increased,
but only with prohibitive increases in the teacher salary bill.
       Finally, the calibration results of course depend importantly on my choice
of parameter values. In particular, if labor supply to the teaching profession is
less elastic than I have assumed — based on district-level studies that should be
expected to provide upper-bounds to the occupation-level elasticity — then each
policy becomes much less effective.
       There of course a number of important aspects of the teaching profession
that are omitted from my stylized model. I have already discussed the potential
for influence activities aimed at gaming the performance measure. Another omit-
ted consideration is the role of pre-service training as a component of the teaching
career. This can be seen as a fixed cost of entering the profession. Performance-
based retention policies would be much more expensive in the presence of large
fixed costs. Thus, my analyses that abstract from such costs almost certainly over-
state the benefits of these policies. They can perhaps be seen as validation for the
claim sometimes made by advocates of performance-based retention policies (e.g.,
Staiger and Rockoff, 2010; Gordon et al., 2006) that the cost to prospective teachers
of increased riskiness can be offset by reducing certification requirements, though
this claim rests importantly on the hypothesis that these requirements do nothing
either to screen out low ability potential teachers.
       A related issue is that of variation in hours of work over the career. Insofar
as early career teachers invest heavily in preparing lesson plans that they will reuse
later in their careers, the effective hourly wage in teaching is quite low at the begin-


                                          33
ning of the career and higher at the end. This age profile is further accentuated by
the backloading of teacher compensation through generous pensions and often quite
steep salary schedules. Like certification requirements, backloaded compensation
raises the cost to a teacher of early career displacement, as it means that she will
never be able to collect the high effective hourly wages given to experienced teach-
ers, and thus makes the profession much less attractive if firing is a real possibility.
It is less clear how this sort of fixed cost could be reduced.
       These caveats aside, the analysis here demonstrates that clear thinking about
the potential impact of teacher quality policy requires a careful, accurate model
of the roles of imperfect information and teacher labor supply decisions. More
research is needed on these factors, and on their impact on the optimal design of
the teacher contract. For now, though, it seems safe to conclude that plausible
policies aimed at changing the ability distribution of the teacher workforce through
improved selection are unlikely to have dramatic impacts on student achievement
absent a performance measurement system that is immune to manipulation and that
is accompanied by substantial increases in the resources devoted to teacher pay.

A     Appendices

A.1        Search model

Each teacher draws a single outside job offer each year. If she accepts the offer, she
exits teaching forever. The outside offer arrives after the teacher learns her previous
year’s performance (and is paid on that basis).
        Outside offers are indexed by the continuation value that they provide, ω. I
assume that the outside offer ωt , t > 1 has a censored Pareto distribution:
                                                           1/ζ �
                           
                            0                 if ωt ≤ Vt0 λ0 t
                                    � 0 �ζ �
                 Ft (ωt ) = 1 − λ0 Vt t if Vt0 λ 1/ζt < ωt < HVt0
                                                        �
                                                                                  (A.1)
                                     ωt              0
                           
                           
                             1                 if HVt0 ≤ ωt .

Here, Vt0 is the value obtained under the baseline, single salary contract (which is
constant across teachers), λ0 is the annual exit hazard under this contract, and H
is the maximum outside wage, expressed as a fraction of the inside continuation
value.30 Importantly, the distribution of ωt is independent of the teacher’s ability as
a teacher, τi . Thus, as the teacher learns about τi she does not simultaneously learn
about her future outside options.
          Under the outside distribution� (A.1), the probability   �          that a teacher who
                                                          1/ζ �
would obtain continuation value Vt ∈ Vt0 λ0 t , HVt0 in teaching will instead exit
                                      �       �ζ �
is λt (Vt ) = Pr {ωt > Vt } = λ0 Vt0/Vt t , with ∂ ln λt (Vt )/∂ lnVt = −ζt� . The model in the
main text was developed in terms of the negative of the elasticity of the exit haz-
ard with respect to the inside wage under the baseline contract, ζ ≡ −∂ ln λt/∂ ln w0 =
−∂ ln λt/∂ lnVt ∗ ∂ lnVt/∂ ln w0 = ζt� ∗ ∂ lnVt/∂ ln w0 . The latter fraction varies with t. I thus
solve recursively for this elasticity – which depends on ζs� , s > t, but not on ζt� itself
– and use it to define the elasticity parameter in (A.1) as ζt� ≡ ζ ∗ (∂ lnVt/∂ ln w0 )−1 .
          The distribution of the initial non-teaching offer, ω1 , is similar to that of
offers later in the career, though here the shape parameter is computed as ζt� ≡
η (∂ lnV0/∂ ln w0 )−1 .


  30 The  use of a censored distribution ensures that Vt is finite for any ζt� . It has no effect on the
results so long as the censoring point is high enough that offers at that point are always accepted. I
set H = 2, satisfying this criterion.

A.2       Solving the model

Equation (3) does not have a closed-form solution, but for any specified contract it
can be solved recursively. Under the learning model developed above, the distribu-
tion of period-t performance measure given θt−1 is
                                                                
                                                  1
                     yt | θt−1 ∼ N τ̂t−1 ,    1       t−1
                                                           + σε2  .          (A.2)
                                            (1−h)σ 2
                                                     + σ2
                                                         τ       ε


This is a univariate distribution that can easily be computed for any specified value
of τ̂t−1 . Given τ̂t−1 and yt , computation of τ̂t is trivial.
          The recursive solution thus has three steps. First, I compute wCT (y1 , . . . , yT ),
the final period wage under contract C as a function of the performance signals to
date. Second, I compute the value of remaining in teaching in period T , VT (θT −1 ; C),
as a function of θT −1 , by integrating wCT over the conditional distribution of yT given
by (A.2). Third, for each t < T , given estimates of Vt+1 (θt ; C) as a function of θt , I
compute wCt (y1 , . . . , yt ) for each possible yt , then integrate over the distribution of
yt (and therefore of θt ) given θt−1 to obtain Vt (θt−1 ; C).
          The state space θt is of dimension t + 1, creating a dimensionality problem
for careers of reasonable length. Note, however, that each of the contracts consid-
ered above reduces the state space for computation of wCt from the t-dimensional
distribution {y1 , . . . , yt } to a one- or two-dimensional distribution: {yt−1 , yt } for the
performance pay contract and {ȳt } for the firing contract. Meanwhile, the teacher’s
assessment of her own ability at the end of period t − 1 can be summarized ei-
ther by the single variable τ̂i,t−1 or by the pair {µ, ȳt−1 }. I can thus focus on
state spaces of only two dimensions, θ̃t−1 = {τ̂t−1 , yt−1 } for the bonus contract
or θ̌t−1 = {µ, ȳt−1 } for the firing contract. I approximate the joint distributions of
these two-dimensional state variables and yt with grids of 1493 points spaced to
have equal probability mass.31
          Having computed Vt (θt−1 , C) for each t, θt−1 , and C, I simulate the impact
of policies by drawing potential teachers from the {µ, τ} distribution, then drawing
performance measures {y1 , . . . , yT } for each. For each career, I compute θt−1 and
Vt at each year t, and use these to compute the effects of contract C on the proba-
bility of entering the profession and, conditional on entering, on surviving to year
t. Note that I need not model the distribution of {µ, τ} in the population of poten-
tial teachers – under my constant elasticity assumptions, changes in the returns to
  31 Inthe model of influence activities in Section 5, Ēt−1 is an additional state variable, and more-
over the optimal choice of Et must be solved for numerically. I use 493 points for the ability param-
eters {µ, ȳt−1 − Ēt−1 , yt − Et } and 24 points each for Ēt−1 and Et .

teaching induce proportional changes in the amount of labor supplied to teaching by
each type that do not depend on the number of people of that type in the population.



A.3    Market clearing

Alternative contracts may yield greater or lesser entry or persistence in aggregate.
For example, adding performance bonuses without reducing base pay will yield
more entry from high-µ teachers and greater persistence of high-τ̂t teachers, with-
out offsetting reductions from teachers with low µ or τ̂t . Under each alternative
contract, I compute the steady-state size of the teacher workforce, assuming that
the contract has been in place for at least T years and that the same number of en-
tering teachers have been hired in each year. I assume that the education system will
require the same number of teachers under the alternative contracts as are required
under the baseline contract; where my computation yields a larger or smaller work-
force than in baseline, I assume that the base salary is adjusted upward or downward
to yield the appropriate number of teachers. The α B and α F parameters in Table 1
are the adjustments required given the other parameters listed there; these are found
via a numerical search algorithm.


A.4    Additional contracts

The bonus contract discussed in the main text closely resembles many that have
been proposed and sometimes even implemented. The firing contract does not –
most selective retention policies that have been proposed would condition retention
decisions on just a short performance history, either at the time of an early tenure
decision or when layoffs are necessitated by budget shortfalls. I nevertheless present
the firing policy because it makes more intelligent use of the available information
in the context of my model. But this makes for an unfair comparison between
compensation and retention policies, as one is closer to optimal than the other.
         Here, I present results for two additional contracts that help to clarify the
comparison. The first is an up-or-out tenure policy, with a single retention decision
made after year 2; the second is a pay-for-performance policy that conditions annual
pay on the district’s full information about a teacher’s type.
         In the tenure contract, any teacher for whom (yi1 + yi2 ) exceeds a threshold
  T
y is given tenure and cannot be fired thereafter; teachers who are not tenured are
fired. yT is set so that a fraction f T of current new teachers would receive tenure.

                                         53
Base salaries are increased to attract enough teachers, and pay is not sensitive to
performance: wTit = α T w0it , with α T > 1. This contract resembles the ones consid-
ered by Staiger and Rockoff (2010) and actual policy in New York and elsewhere.
Like the bonus contract, it is prone to frequent errors, as two years of performance
is not enough to accurately identify ability.
        In the performance pay contract, pay in year t depends linearly on the
teacher’s average demonstrated performance to date, ȳi,t−1 , with a slope that grows
with t in proportion to the increasing reliability of ȳi,t−1 as a signal of τ. Specifi-
cally, compensation in year t > 1 for a teacher with average performance through
t − 1 periods of ȳi,t−1 is

                                             i1 = α wi1 ). The performance coeffi-
        PP
cient β multiplies the same district posterior mean that is used as the basis of the
firing policy in the main text. Although I am not aware of a district that has im-
plemented a policy of this form, it bears some resemblance to the permanent raises
awarded recently to high-performing teachers in Washington DC. The Washington
raises cannot be taken away if a teacher does not continue to perform well, but under
my performance pay contract they can; if the teacher consistently performs at the
same high level her pay will continue to rise as the district becomes more confident
in its assessment of her.
         Table A.1 presents results for the original two contracts and for the two new
contracts. It is clear that both compensation and retention policies benefit from
making better use of the available information rather than from limiting attention to
two years of performance. But the difference is much larger for the compensation-
based than for the retention-based policies. The pay-for-performance policy clearly
dominates even a carefully designed firing policy, with somewhat larger benefits
and half the costs.
         Table A.2 presents an analysis of the pay-for-performance contract with
multidimensional output and the potential for manipulation. This suggests caution
about the previous result: This policy is even more damaged by manipulation than
is the firing policy. Under a firing contract, low ability teachers have the most in-
centive to manipulate the performance measure; many of them wind up being fired
anyway. Under the pay-for-performance contract, it is the highest ability teachers,
who plan to stay the longest, who are most likely to engage in manipulation, and
they do much more of it. This does not damage the selection effects of the contract
– note that the effects of the contract on dimension-B effectiveness are similar in


                                          54
columns 2 and 3, where they were quite different for the firing contract in Table 4.
But if the manipulation itself is costly to dimension-B output, as in column 4, this
can more than offset the benefits of the policy coming from selection, reducing total
productivity below what it is under the baseline contract.
