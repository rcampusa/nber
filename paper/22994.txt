A Theory of Bundling Advertisements in Media Markets

                                        ABSTRACT

Watching TV and other forms of media consumption represent, after sleeping and working, the
main activity that adults perform in developed countries. We present a dynamic theory of
commercial broadcasting where the media trade utility-raising goods (programs, information, and
services) with audiences in exchange for their exposure to advertisements (utility-decreasing
bads), and where goods are otherwise free to the audience except for their opportunity cost of
time. Goods and bads are dynamically arranged, and as such traded in an intertemporal bundle.
No monetary transfers take place between media and audiences, and this barter exchange is not
contractually sustained. We study this dynamic problem in a model that captures the central
characteristics of how commercial media markets operate. The model is rich enough to account
for a variety of disparate evidence in television, radio, print media and the web.

1         Introduction
Using ve decades of time-use surveys that document trends in the allocation of time
in the United States, Aguiar and Hurst (2007) nd that during the last half a century
there was a dramatic increase in leisure time. From 1965 to 2003, leisure increased
by between 4.6 hours per week and 8.1 per week for the average non-retired adult
or, if one assumes a forty-hour work week, the increase in leisure is equivalent to 5.9
to 10.5 additional weeks of vacation per year. Not only in the US, but also in many
other countries the time spent by adults on leisure activities has steadily increased
during the last few decades, while at the same time the number of market hours
worked has remained relatively stable.

        A remarkable aspect of the data is that among all the potential leisure activities,
there is one that systematically accounts for about half of all the leisure time: watch-
ing television. Several studies document that, during the past fty years, in many
developed countries watching TV represents a stable share of about 40 to 50 percent
of all leisure time. Interestingly, Aguiar and Hurst (2007) nd that in the US more
than 100 percent of the increase in leisure from 1965 to 2003 can be accounted for by
the increase in the time spent watching television. This huge increase in television
viewing is mainly o¤set by declines in socializing (going to parties, bars, etc) and in
reading (books, magazines, letters, etc). In absolute numbers, the average number
of hours spent watching television per year for individuals aged 18 and over was es-
timated at 1,745 hours at the end of their period of study, 2003, and during the last
decade is estimated to have remained roughly the same.1 This amount is equivalent
to approximately 35 hours per week. In other words, non-retired adults spend today
just about as much time watching television as they do in the labor force.

        Thus, television viewing is not only the main leisure activity in modern economies.
After sleeping and working, it is also the main activity for adults in the US and other
developed countries. This paper is concerned with this and similar activities, in
particular with the distinct aspects that characterize how they are brought to the

market. A focus of the analysis is commercial broadcasting which represents the
main form of transmission of television programs for individual and general use.

       Broadcasters sell audiences. This is the most important activity of the business,
and virtually all other actions support this function. The people who buy these
audiences are advertisers interested in capturing their attention in order to inuence
their behavior in certain ways. In the last few decades commercial mass media has
greatly spread around the world and, accordingly, these audiences have become a very
valuable commodity that is sold to advertisers for billions of dollars. Today media
markets are a multibillion dollar industry that is mostly dependent on advertising
revenues, often almost exclusively on them.2

       The purpose of this paper is to formalize the unique characteristics that make
commercial broadcasting fundamentally di¤erent from other markets. While there
are important literatures on advertising, media, and leisure, the speci c dynamic
aspects we study have remained, to the best of our knowledge, mostly out of the
scope of consumer theory analysis. Further, although we will focus on how commer-
cial television bundles information and entertainment with advertising messages, the
main characteristics that we study are also present, and similarly drive, traditional
business models in radio, newspapers, magazines, and commercial websites, including
search engines. As a result, much of our formal analysis for television will also have
implications for these other media markets. The characteristics are the following:

       First, we want to capture the fact that a large proportion of advertiser-supported
programs and information is a free good to the audience, except for the opportunity
cost of audience time and the potential increased costs of advertised products. Indeed,
free television, radio, and internet do not charge individuals for advertisements or
for the information, entertainment or services that they provide. The media usually
pays for the cost of preparing and using the information, services, and ads.

       Second, advertisements are typically provided jointly with information and pro-
gramming in a bundle. Thus, a natural question is that since television, radio, and
   2
   Advertising revenues are estimated to represent about 92.5 percent of all revenues in the typical
TV station (excluding pay-TV) and about 91.5 percent in the radio industry (see Vogel, 2011).


                                                 3
other media could technically provide advertisements without costly information and
programming, why do they go to the expense of including them along with the ads?
Why do they bundle costly information and services jointly with ads when they could
be provided separately? Technological constraints and transaction costs often seem to
make it too expensive to sell ads separately. Prior to pay television, ads on television
or radio could simply not be sold directly since there was no way that the audience
could be charged for what they watched or heard.3 More importantly, if consumers
were paid to take ads, it might not be pro table to allow them to take all they want
at a xed (negative) price per unit. The special monitoring problem in media markets
in the consumption of ads means that consumers would surely want to buy a large
number of them and ignore as many as possible. As a result of these di¢culties, few
advertisements are sold separately and directly to consumers in broadcasting markets.
They may be given away, as in direct mail and in billboards, but they are typically
sold jointly with television and radio programs in a bundle. The result is that, despite
moneys apparent advantage in trades, no direct monetary transfers between media
and consumers take place. This is an important characteristic that we capture in our
dynamic model of advertising-based broadcasting.

       Third, we note that the bundle of goods and bads is simply a form of barter
exchange. Since consumers do not have to be compensated for utility-raising infor-
mation and services, the inference must be that most ads lower the utility of the
marginal consumer, after netting out the value of the time spent performing the con-
sumption. Clearly, the assumption that many ads lower utility is easier to reconcile
with consumer behavior than is the assumption that they raise utility. For consumers
do not seem to look forward to consuming advertisements, as indicated for instance
by observed behaviors such as zapping, using the fast forward to speed through com-
mercials in a taped program, or using pop-up blocking software to block intrusive
advertising while sur ng the web. As it were, in this barter exchange free informa-
tion and services generate the audience for utility-reducing ads and compensate the
individual in the audience for being exposed to the ads. This is the third characteristic
   3
   Ads in print can de nitely be sold separately but transaction costs are greatly reduced by selling
them in newspapers and magazines along with the news and articles.


                                                 4
that we capture in the theoretical framework we develop.

   Finally, the exchange of goods and bads is not sustained through any contractual
agreement between broadcasters and audiences. As it were, in this barter exchange
the utility gains from the consumption of goods must compensate individuals for the
utility losses associated with the consumption of bads and the opportunity cost of
time, and do so with no explicit agreement between the parties. The same moni-
toring problem that explains the lack of monetary exchange also explains the lack
of contractual arrangement. In other words, in broadcast markets there is a tension
between the interest of advertiser-supported media and the interest of individuals in
receiving utility-raising goods that is not contracted away. This tension is a central
component of our framework.

   These are the distinct characteristics that make this market fundamentally dif-
ferent from other markets. The exclusive focus on these characteristics in a dynamic
setting is what di¤erentiates our analysis from previous work in the literature on
advertising and media markets. Despite an extensive and important body of existing
work, we are not aware of previous research that studies the dynamic bundling of
goods and bads in a way that goods generate the audience for utility-reducing ads
and compensate for the advertising, with no contractual agreements sustaining this
exchange. In our framework, we use standard consumer theory and maintain the
principle of consumer sovereignty, although consumers will not be able to buy all
ads they want at a xed price. As just argued, when consumers are paid to take
ads, di¢culties in monitoring the consumption of ads means that it might typically
not be pro table to allow them to take all they want at a xed (negative) price per
unit of ads. We avoid this negative implication in our model since advertisers de-
termine jointly and endogenously with consumers the dynamic bundle of advertising
and utility-raising goods.

   The result of the analysis is a dynamic framework that is rich enough to account for
a variety of disparate evidence in the di¤erent media markets concerning the amount
and allocation of information, programming, and advertising. As such the theory
provides a uni ed way of thinking about the quality, quantity and positioning of ad

                                          5
and non-ad content in television and radio programs, as well as in print media and
websites. It also provides new insights into the reasons why and how available content
is organized and positioned di¤erently across di¤erent programs, and generates a
number of empirical predictions for possible extensions in future work.


2         Related Literature
Our analysis sets apart from recent literature on media markets in that it focuses
on the dynamic media consumption decision. As such it abstracts from issues that
have been already studied in important recent e¤orts (see Anderson, Waldfogel and
Strömberg (2016)). Bagwell (2007) also presents a thorough review of the extensive
literature on the economic analysis of advertising that virtually covers every topic
and area of study. It includes the di¤erent views of advertising (positive and nor-
mative theories), the welfare economics of commercial broadcasting (Anderson and
Coate, 2005), and several empirical regularities on the e¤ects on price, quality, entry
deterrence, market structure, and other aspects.4 Caves (2005) presents an economic
analysis of television broadcasting and the organizational changes that it has under-
gone in the past decades.

        Barnett (1966) and Comanor and Wilson (1974) o¤er some of the rst discussions
of advertisements on radio and television as bads, where a bad is something con-
sumers are willing to pay for to have removed or must be compensated to accept.5
As Becker and Murphy (1993) and others note, many early analyses of advertising in
the literature often assumed without much justi cation that advertisements are given
away at zero price, rather than sold to consumers, and that quantities are controlled
by producers of the goods advertised. This treatment, which is intrinsically tied to
what is called the persuasive approach that considers advertising as shifting tastes,
cannot explain why consumers choose among di¤erent advertising choices that require
    4
     Other aspects include the e¤ect of advertising on sales and pro ts, the reaction of audiences to
advertising, the inuence of advertising on the medias programming content, and the number, and
quality of programs o¤ered under di¤erent market structures. See also Baker (1994), Nilssen and
Sørgard (1998), Owen and Wildman (1992), Spence and Owen (1977), and other references therein.

     Depken and Wilson (2003) studies of the price of ads in magazines with and witout ads.

time, money, or other scarce resources, and thus among di¤erent bundles of goods
and bads. A model with a zero price of advertising may apply to direct mail adver-
tisements and billboards, although consumers can easily discard and ignore these ads.
But it does not appear to explain ads in television, radio, and the internet. Consistent
with this view, the demand for ad avoidance has seen the development of new tech-
nologies that allow consumers to siphon o¤ content and strip out the advertising. In
television, this is exempli ed by the digital video recorder (TiVo is the most famous),
which allows consumers to easily skip ads. Likewise, plug-ins for web browsers block
advertising to provide clutter-free content. A recent literature studies the content
providers reactions to such technologies (see, e.g., Wilbur (2008a,b), Anderson and
Gans (2011), Shah (2011), and other references therein). This is empirically impor-
tant as the recent proliferation of ad-blocking software has stirred a debate about the
implications for media companies that survive on ad revenue. How will markets react
to ad blocking? Will ad-blocking over time decimate the free web?6 Our model
will bear on this literature and these questions.

       Studying the dynamic bundle of goods and bads has implications not only for the
quantity but also for the timing (in TV and radio) and positioning (in printed media
and the internet) of ads. The timing and intensity of commercials has attracted re-
cent attention in the literature, in particular the competition among platforms (e.g.,
see Peitz and Valletti (2008), Ambrus, Calvano and Reisinger (2014)) and the game
theoretic aspects among multiple stations. Various studies on the radio industry, for
example, focus on understanding under what conditions multiple competing stations
may prefer coordination (choose the same times) or di¤erentiation (di¤erent times).
They have also been concerned with the empirical estimation of models with multiple
equilibria.7 For instance, Sweeting (2009, 2013) estimates a timing game with mul-

     In an American Economic Association research highlight, Hyde (2015) notes When Apples
new mobile operating system was released on September 16, 2015, millions of iPhone users rushed
to upgrade. But at least two groups werent so thrilled about the new release: mobile advertisers
and the publications who survive o¤ them. Thats because the new operating system included tools
that made it easy to detect and lter out ads on mobile websites. Sure enough, ad-blocking apps
rocketed to the top of the App Store in the hours after the new release.

     Epstein (1998), Zhou (2000) and Kadlec (2001), for instance, provide theoretical models where
two television stations choose to have their commercial breaks at the same time in equilibrium.

tiple equilibria, and Sweeting (2006) empirically examines the timing of commercial
breaks by music radio stations using panel data on more than one thousand stations.8
Our framework contributes to this literature by formalizing the more fundamental sit-
uation where there is just a single station.
        A more distant literature is concerned with how the bundling decisions of a monop-
olist providing two goods depend on the correlation between the consumers valuation
for the products, and their degrees of complementarity and substitutability.9 We add
to this literature the study not of two goods, but one good and one bad, in a dynamic
bundle where the exchange is bartered (does not use monetary transfers) and it is
not sustained through a contractual arrangement.

        Finally, there is a literature on barter arrangements which treats barter as an
ine¢cient form of exchange that is ultimately dominated by a commonly accepted
form of at currency. We note that media markets represent perhaps the main form
of barter exchange in modern economies, and that the special monitoring problem in
broadcasting markets may make the barter exchange between media and audiences a
more e¢cient form of trade than currency.


3         An Intertemporal Model of Bundling Goods and
          Bads
The model focuses on the microfoundations that determine the exchange between
goods and bads between media and audiences in a dynamic sense. As such it abstracts
from a large number of aspects and considerations already studied in the literature.

        Consider one broadcasting rm (a television station) and one individual in the
audience. The rms problem is to o¤er a bundle of goods and bads that this individ-
ual will nd at least as good as his opportunity cost of time. The individual derives
utility from two goods at any point in time t, during a nite time interval [0; T ] :
The rst consumption good C(t) is the ow of information, entertainment and other
    8
     Also, Sweeting (2010) is concerned with the e¤ect of mergers between close competitors on
product positioning.
   9
     See Ibragimov and Walden (2010) for a review of this literature.



                                              8
utility-raising goods that are provided by the rm. During the time the individual is
watching a television program he may be exposed to some advertisements A(t). The
maximum amount of goods and advertisements per unit of time that can be provided
is assumed to be 1, that is C(t) + A(t) = 1, with C(t)  0 and A(t)  0 at all times.10
When only advertisements are provided during time t the individual obtains C(t) = 0
when exposed to the ads. In consequence, the bundle of goods and bads at time t
can be simply denoted by C(t) 2 [0; 1]. Although other formulations can be readily
considered, this one provides a convenient and tractable way of characterizing the
bundle of goods and bads.
       The second good from which the individual derives utility at time t is the stock
of past consumption accumulated up to that point in time, S (t) : Consumption of
information, services and entertainment builds into capital following the accumulation
process:
                                      S_ (t) = C (t)           S(t);

where  2 (0; 1) is an exogenous depreciation rate. Being exposed to advertisements,
therefore, lowers individuals utility since S_ (t) < 0: The initial condition is given by
S(0) = S0 . This initial stock of past consumption S0 may be interpreted as habitual
capital, in the sense that audiences often seek out the same information sources over
time as they develop a set of favorite TV programs, radio programs, and websites.
Clearly, after the television and radio program has begun, t 2 (0; T ]; the stock S(t)
also includes the amount of previous consumption within the program. For example,
when watching a movie, it includes as the stock of movie how much movie has been
watched up to that time t:
       Lastly, we assume that the individual derives utility not only from the ow of
consumption of goods and from the stock of past consumption, but also from their
interaction. The instantaneous utility function of the individual is then given by:

                u [C (t) ; S (t)] =   C    C (t) +       S    S (t) +   CS    C (t)  S (t) :
  10
    Advertisements could also be readily assumed to directly reduce utility by a given amount per
unit of time.




                                                      9
       The parameters       C   and   S   are assumed positive. The interpretation of a posi-
tive      C   is straightforward, while a positive      CS   means that the marginal utility of
consumption increases with the stock of past consumption, as in Becker and Murphy
(1988) model of habits. Clearly, this interaction e¤ect may well be quite di¤erent
across di¤erent types of programs, audiences and, more generally, di¤erent media. In
movies, dramas, and similar TV programs where there is, broadly speaking, a sin-
gle theme or story running throughout the program, we may expect this interaction
e¤ect between the stock and ow of program to be important. In newspapers or in
TV and radio news programs which contain di¤erent types of news (local, national,
international, sports, weather, etc) that are largely independent of each other, we
may expect         CS   to be much less relevant.

       The preferences of the individual are denoted by:
                                       Z T
                            U [C; S] =     e t u [C (t) ; S (t)] dt;
                                              0

where the rate of time preference is : The individual is assumed to have an outside
opportunity worth v(t) utils at time t. As a result, he may watch a TV program,
listen to a radio program, read a newspaper, or consume the information and services
provided by a speci c website from t = 0 to t = T if and only if:
        Z T                          Z T
              t
            e u [C (t) ; S (t)] dt      e t v (t) dt;    for all  2 [0; T ] :
                                             

       In other words, the individual knows the entire path and must be compensated
for the value of his outside opportunity, in present value terms, at all times. If
the bundle of goods and bads does not meet this condition at time  , then the
individual will leave the TV program, stop listening to the radio program or leave
the website. Hence media companies must provide enough goods (quantity) and in
such a way (timing, positioning) so as to meet the conditions that would keep the
audience above his opportunity cost of time at all times in present value terms. Note
that this formulation abstracts from modelling explicitly the individuals abilities or
technologies at his disposal to try to avoid or ignore advertisements.11 It simply
  11
       Modelling these abilities (e.g., leaving to enjoy the outside option when ads are on and coming


                                                   10
requires the bundles fC (t)gTt=0 to be such that they provide the individual in the
audience watching the ads with at least the utils that he could obtain in an alternative
activity at all times.

    The media rm has to decide the optimal combination of goods and bads that
maximizes pro ts. We assume that income is only generated from advertising, and so
it does not charge the individual for the content it consumes.12 The rm is competitive
in the price of the advertisements, and the revenue per unit of time per unit of
advertisement at time t is  (t).13 Hence, his pro t function can be denoted as:
                                   Z T
                          [C] =       e t  (t) [1 C (t)] dt:
                                                     0
    The problem is how to choose the sequence of bundles of goods and bads over
time fC (t)gTt=0 that maximize pro ts. The medias problem can be written as:
                               Z T                      
                                       t
                         max        e  (t) [1 C (t)] dt ;

back when they are gone) and modelling access to ad-avoidance technologies involves making speci c
assumptions about v (t). Audiences do not need to be compensated for the ads they do not see,
and so the outside option term v(t) is interpreted as including the utility value of the individuals
skills and technologies to avoid advertisements. See, e.g., Wilbur (2008a,b), and Anderson and Gans
(2011).

     There is an important literature on two-sided markets. See, e.g., Armstrong (2006), Rochet and
Tirole (2006), Anderson and Gabszewicz (2006), Rysman (2009), and other references therein.

     In television, advertising time is generally priced competitively and largely independently of its
location during a program. Advertising rates basically depend on audience composition and ratings.
Goettler (2012) reports how typically 70 to 80 percent of commercial time is sold in the up-front
market during May for the upcoming in early September. The remainder is sold in the scatter
market during the season, ocassionally even hours before the show airs. Contracts specify the prices
to be paid for the commercial time and minimum guaranteed ratings, as measured in the US by
Nielsen Media Research. Guaranteed ratings often correspond to particular demographic segments.
When the guaranteed raitings are not attained, networks provide make-goods to compensate their
short-changed advertisers.

       For simplicity, we assume that  (t) = 1;14 and that v (t) = v.15 It is convenient
to de ne the function:
         Z T
 w( ) =     e( t) [ C  C (t) +         S    S (t) +       CS    C (t)  S(t)   v] dt;   8 2 [0; T ] :
              

       This function represents the discounted sum of utils net of opportunity costs that
the individual will receive from  until T . Thus, the condition that the individual
may continue consuming the bundle of goods and bads at  is that w ( )  0 for
all  2 [0; T ]. This is the standard incentive compatibility constraint. The medias
objective function attains its maximum at the point where:
                                                  w00 ( )
                                                = 0       ;
                                                  w ( )

and the participation constraint requires   w(0) = v.

       The problem can thus be written as:
                                      Z T
                                                         t

loss at T .

      Advertising pricing surveys in the television and radio industry show that commercial spots are
sold according to expected thousand viewers/listeners of a program, with little regard for whether
audiences are di¤erent at di¤erent points in the program. Similarly, for magazines and newspapers,
publishers typically sell positions on a contractual basis based on multiple insertions and their
circulation, not on the speci c location where the ad will be placed.
   15
      Goettler and Shachar (2001) report structural estimates of outside-alternative mean utilities for
di¤erent demographic groups of television viewers.

   In order to characterize the optimal path we apply the standard Maximum Princi-
ple of Pontryagin et al. (1966). Let the functions (t) and '(t) represent the shadow
prices of S(t) and w(t) respectively. The Hamiltonian is de ned as:

                                              t
H [C(t); (t); '(t); S(t); w(t)] =         e        C(t) + (t) [C(t)         S(t)] +
                                         + '(t) [w(t) + v               C C(t)       S S(t)   CS C(t)S(t)] ;

The conditions for optimality are:

   The linearity of the Hamiltonian in C(t) means that there are three possible
phases:

   1. In Phase I (Content Phase), the problem has a corner solution where only
programming is provided:

                                    t
                HC(t) [:] =     e        + (t)          [   C   +   CS S(t)] '(t)   > 0;
                   C(t) = 1:

   2. In Phase II (Advertising Phase), it has a corner solution where only ads are
provided:

                                    t
                HC(t) [:] =     e        + (t)          [   C   +   CS S(t)] '(t)   < 0;
                   C(t) = 0:



                                                   13
       3. In Phase III (Joint Content-Advertising Phase), the problem has an interior
solution where w(t) = 0 and 0 < C(t) < 1 at all times.


       The Content and Advertising Phases I and II are relevant for understanding the
amount, positioning and other aspects of advertising in TV and radio programs. Typ-
ically in these media either only programming or only advertisements can be provided
at a given time: programming is interrupted with commercials and commercials are
interrupted with programming.16 The same occurs in radio programs. This means
that these media rms must choose a sequence of bundles where C(t) 2 f0; 1g at
all times. Phase III is relevant for print media and the web since in every page of a
newspaper or a magazine, or in a computer screen, any proportion of goods and ads
is feasible at any time.

       We examine the optimal paths in each of these phases next: I and II for TV and
radio, and III for print media and the internet, respectively.



4        Dynamics for Television and Radio

We rst solve the model for the Content and Advertising phases I and II, and then
study the conditions under which the switching between phases (from consumption
to ads and viceversa) takes place. Finally, we provide some descriptive evidence.


4.1       Solving the Model
Content Phase I. In this phase the optimality conditions are:

                                        t
 M [ (t); '(t); S(t); w(t)] =       e        + (t)(1   S(t)) + '(t) [w(t) + v       C     S S(t)   CS S(t)] ;

  16
    This is not always true. In some TV programs, small commercial logos and ads may be shown
during a program in parts of the screen. This does not happen in radio programs since it is not
possible to listen simultaneously to programming and commercials.

       The model generates a number of interesting features. The rst is that, as we
might expect, there are no stationary solutions. Consider, for instance, the case
in which in the rst instant of the program w(0) = 0. If the initial stock of past
                                v
consumption S0 is below             C
                                S + CS
                                         , then either the audience will receive the maximum
consumption possible C(t) = 1 during the whole period (that is, w(t) > 0 with w(t)
                                                                              _    >
0), or w(t) will rst increase for some time and then, after crossing the locus w(t)
                                                                               _    = 0,
will decrease up to at most the point w( ) = 0; since the condition w(t)  0 must
                                                                           v
be met at all times. When w(t) = 0, S(t) cannot be above                       C
                                                                           S + CS
                                                                                    if programming is
to continue next period. In other words, given a stock S(t), the parameters                     C,   S;

and      CS   cannot be too low, and v cannot be too high, if the audience member is to
continue to receive programming.17 This means, not suprisingly, that the preference
parameters and S(t) play an important role in the dynamics of programming and
commercials. For example, take again the case that at the the beginning of a program
w(0) = 0: the length of the rst segment of programming (until it is interrupted with
commercials) is shorter when the initial stock of past consumption S0 is greater, when
the opportunity cost v is lower, and when          C;   S,   and    CS   are larger. These empirical
implications accord well with intuition.
       Lastly, the depreciation parameter  determines the region where S increases
or decreases with programming. Low values of  make it less likely that S will
decrease when consumers are enjoying the consumption good. Obviously, S can
never decrease if  = 0. And if S0 is above 1/; the stock of past consumption
always decreases with time, implying S(T ) < S0 . This situation, as the analysis
of switching between content and advertising phases will show later, does not seem
sustainable (unless the individual replenishes his  rm speci c stock when engaging
in alternative occupations within or, more generally, outside times 0 to T ).
       Summing up, as expected, di¤erent combinations of the preference parameters and
the initial stock contribute to determining the length of the programming segments,
both at the beginning of a program and throughout the program, in an intuitive way.

     Obviously, the problem is meaningful only if v >   C.   The qualitative discussion of case w(0) > 0
is similar.

   There are again a few features of interest. If the initial stock of consumption is
        v
below   s
             with w(t)  0, then providing only advertisements increases the medias
debt w over time. This is more likely the case, given initial values of S and w,
the lower the time preference parameter , the greater the value v of the outside
                                                                                                                v
opportunity, and the lower                   S.    For initial stocks of consumption above                       s
                                                                                                                     , w will
decrease either permanently or at most until reaching w(
                                                      _ ) = 0, after which the
medias debt increases again. Obviously, S can never increase when only advertising
is provided. Again, these dynamics appear to accord well with intuition.

4.2     Switching Between Content and Ads
To understand the switching between programming and advertising that takes place
during a TV or radio program, we need to study when the jump conditions that
determine when switching takes place from one phase to another are satis ed. These
conditions require that both the Hamiltonian and the shadow prices be equal in the
two phases at the points of switching. The Hamiltonian in the Content phase is:
                      t
   HI [:] =     e          + (t) [1          S(t)] + '(t) [w(t) + v                 C         S S(t)        CS S(t)] ;


and in the Advertising phase:

                           HII [:] =         (t)S(t) + '(t) [w(t) + v                     S S(t)] :


   The condition that HI [:]                    HII [:] = 0 implies:
                                                  t
                       HC(t) [:] =          e          + (t)       [   C    +   CS S(t)] '(t)   = 0:

   Note that:
               d
                  HC(t) = e           t
                                            + _ (t)       [   C   +             _
                                                                       CS S(t)] '(t)          CS '(t)S(t)
                                                                                                         _
               dt
which in the two cases of interest is:
  d                               t
     HC(t)                 = e         + ( + ) (t) + (               S   +   CS ) '(t)        CS '(t) [1      S(t)] ;
  dt         C(t)=1
  d                               t
     HC(t)                 = e         + ( + ) (t) +                S '(t)   +   CS '(t)S(t):
  dt         C(t)=0


                                                                  18
   Note that:
              d                    d
                 HC(t)                HC(t)              =        CS '(t)          CS '(t)   = 0:
              dt         C(t)=1    dt           C(t)=0

   This means that:
                d                 t
                   HC(t) = e          + ( + ) (t) + (           S   +       CS S(t)) '(t);
                dt
where '(t) = ' is constant over time. If we study the movements of (t) and S(t) in
phases I and II around their steady states, we nd that switching between C(t) = 1
and C(t) = 0 is feasible when S(t) is in the interval 0; 1 and (t) is in the interval

   The exponential behavior of S(t) and                  (t) in each of these phases means that
they move relatively slow when close to the equilibrium, and relatively fast as we
move away from the equilibrium. Importantly, it is de nitely possible to                            nd a
constant ' that makes HC(t) = 0. For instance, consider the values S(t) = 21 and

           HC(t) =       e                  S   +             '            C   + CS      ' = 0:

   Chattering is thus perpetual in these circumstances. In order to avoid chattering,
costs of switching between phases may be introduced. In the context of radio and
television, these costs may simply be interpreted as the minimum amount of time
necessary to deliver and absorb meaningful programming and commercials. What
is important is that it is certainly feasible for the system to move from:

       and then back to subphase I.1, I.2, II.1, and so on.

       With respect to the duration of the dynamics, di¤erent patterns are obviously
possible depending upon the speci c set of parameters. Needless to say, there may be
instances empirically in which Phases I or II may alternate with Phase III, which we
study in the next section. Before that we present some descriptive evidence.

4.3       Descriptive Evidence
We next report some data showing how in fact a large variety of patterns is observed
in media markets. This serves to stress the idea that a dynamic model of bundling
ads, which we have argued must include the ingredients we are studying, should
account for a variety of disparate evidence.
       We present data from TV programs that are di¤erent in many respects (content,
audience, duration), as these di¤erences may be helpful to provide intuition into the
potential determinants of the di¤erent bundles in the context of the model. The unit
of time in the programs in Figures 5-7 is a minute. There are two types of minutes:
programming minutes, de ned as those where only utility-raising program was
shown to the audience, and commercial minutes, which are those that had some
advertising time. The gures plot for each minute of the program the number of
programs that had a commercial minute.18

                                      [Figures 5 to 7 here]

       Among 30-minute programs, we see very di¤erent distributions of commercial
time both in terms of quantity and timing. Sitcoms and news are similar in the
percentage of ads and number of cuts, but strikingly di¤erent in the distribution of
their commercial time. Their distributions of ads are also di¤erent from those in soap
operas and children programs,19 which are also rather di¤erent from each other.
  18
      The data come from 1,017 programs shown on 62 di¤erent channels during the period September
1 - December 31, 2012 in Providence, RI. These channels are those included in the basic cable service
provided by Cox Communications New England in Providence, RI, for zip code 02906.
   19
      Children programs are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). In 1990,
Congress enacted the Childrens Television Act of 1990 (CTA), which currently regulates adver-
tising. Among other requirements, the CTA imposes that television broadcast licensees and cable


                                                 20
   Within news programs, there are some interesting di¤erences. For instance, week-
end and non-evening news appear to take several more minutes before interrupting
the program with the rst segment of commercial time, and weekend news typically
have one more segment of commercials. In the one speci c station we look at (CNN),
the rst commercial in sports news comes about two minutes earlier than in general
news, and its last commercial comes about three minutes later. Cartoons for chil-
dren are also substantially di¤erent from The Simpsons, often considered the classic
cartoon par excellence for adults, whose distribution of commercial time is similar to
that of a sitcom.
   Among 1-hour programs the di¤erences in ad distributions are also quite substan-
tial. Dramas and series are similar to sitcoms, and very di¤erent from the rest. Soap
operas are somewhat similar to talk shows in the second half of the program, but
quite di¤erent in the rst half. The gures also show interesting di¤erences between
weekend movies and weekday movies, and between older movies (which we de ne
as those rst shown in theaters at least 15 years ago) and new movies (those rst
shown in theaters no more than 5 years ago).

   This variety of programs and ad distributions may be intuitively linked to the
parameters of the model although, needless to say, the evidence that we observe is
the result of not only the ingredients we have studied but also di¤erent strategic and
market structure considerations outside our setting. While it is beyond this discussion
to provide a careful empirical analysis, here are some conjectures. For soap operas,
which are stories that last for months and some even for years, we may expect a low
degree of complementarity between the stock and the ow of program within a given
episode   CS   and a large degree of complementarity across episodes, as captured by the
stock of initial capital S0 . In news programs, which are, broadly speaking, a collection
of shorter and independent news (national, international, local, weather, sports) with
operators must limit the amount of commercial matter that may be aired during childrens programs
to not more than 10.5 minutes per hour on weekends and not more than 12 minutes per hour on
weekdays. In 2000, the FCC stated its expectation that the industry would honor the voluntary
advertising guidelines under which broadcasters were to air no more than 9.5 minutes of advertis-
ing per hour on weekends. Further details are available at the FCCs Media Bureau web site at
www.fcc.gov/mb/policy/cetv.html.



                                               21
no single story running through the program, we may expect                  C   to be an important
determinant of the characteristics of the bundle, whereas            S   and especially   CS   much
less so. The relevance of S0 will probably be quite di¤erent in movies (stories that
begin and end in the same program) than in sitcoms and dramas (di¤erent stories
involving the same characters shown over time, typically on a weekly basis, building
initial stock of capital). Similarly, we can think of the di¤erences between older
movies vs new movies, and between weekday and weekend movies.20 For children
cartoons, the fact that children appear to have a lower attention span () than adults,
and perhaps a greater complementarity parameter               CS   too, should help explain the
di¤erence with respect to cartoons appealing to adults, as The Simpsons, whose
distribution of commercials is, unsurprisingly, similar to that in sitcoms.


5     Dynamics for Print Media and Internet

In these industries any proportion of goods and bads is feasible at any point in time:
Goods and bads may share the same computer screen, and may also share the same
page in a newspaper or in a magazine.21 The analysis of phase III is much simpler.
We have an interior solution where w(t) = 0 and 0 < C(t) < 1 for all t. In this case
we have:
                                                  v      S S(t)
                               0 < C(t) =                          < 1;
                                                 +C      CS S(t)

                            _            v   S S(t)
                            S(t) =                          S(t):
                                         C + CS S(t)

   20
      For example, older movies, which are more likely to have already been watched when they were
  rst shown in theatres, in videos or previously on TV, are never interrupted with commercials in
the last eight minutes. Their distribution of ads may be driven by di¤erent parameters, particularly
  CS and , e.g., lower values would help to explain why they are never interrupted at the end, and
why new movies have one more commercial segments.
   21
      The temporal dimension of the model when applied to the web is not much di¤erent from that
in TV and radio, and so it is straightforward to interpret it (though, of course, the web is more
interactive and the consumer may move back and forth, up and down). With respect to print
media, the interpretation is not trivial as consumers have even more freedom to move in di¤erent
directions; they can even choose the initial period (the place when their consumption starts, e.g.,
the international news in a newspaper), and the nal period. Hence the temporal dimension applies
to each program (section or set of sections).



                                                22
These conditions imply the following two restrictions on the parameters of the model:
                                                       v
                                           S(t) <           ;
                                                       S

                                                   v        C
                                      S(t) >                         :
                                                   S   +        CS

which, not surprisingly, are the points at which w(t)
                                                 _    = w(t) = 0 in the Content and
Advertising phases I and II. These restrictions imply C  S + CS  v > 0. Note that
         _
the loci S(t) = 0 and w(t)
                      _    = w(t) = 0 cross at the point where:

                                               v           S S(t)
                                  S(t) =                                ;
                                               C   +       CS S(t)

that is:                                                                               1=2

   Figure 8 shows the dynamics in this case.

                                       [Figure 8 here]

   A number of features accord well with intuition. The media should o¤er more
programming, information or services the higher the depreciation rate (to keep the
stock high enough at every moment). Also, the stronger the individuals taste for
current and past consumption, including the extent to which they are complements,
the lower the steady state levels of programming. Similarly, the higher the outside
option, the lower the quantity of ads.

   Finally, we note the relevance of the model in the context of a novel idea in online
advertising, which accounts for 20% of the ad industrys total spending and over 90%
of the revenue for internet giants such as Google and Facebook. This idea concerns
the recent developments around the concepts of engaged time and time metrics,
the biggest buzzwords of late. Traditionally, ads are being bought and sold based
on CPI (cost per impression) and clicks. But the technology is ripe, and so it is the
idea that if an ad is not seen then it should not be paid for. This represents a big
breakthrough in the current online media world (italics ours):



                                               23
         The Financial Times recently announded that it will sell display ads
         based o¤ the time its audience spends with content. The British news-
         paper hopes it will solve the viewability problems that plague the online
         advertising industry .[...] This shift is part of the broader vision for the
         future of advertising. Using time as an advertising currency ts that
         mission perfectly. (January 2015)
         The Guardian overhauls its site in an anticipation of publishers selling
         ads based on time in ongoing e¤orts to sell advertisers on reader attention
         not clicks [...] The biggest question around view time is how do you insert
         ads dynamically down in the page. (December 2014)

       Consistent with this recent idea, in the model we have developed time is pre-
cisely the advertising currency, and time determines the performance of an ad in
terms of users attention.


6        Discussion, Applications and Extensions
The framework we have developed captures the tension between the interests of
advertiser-supported media and audiences interested in receiving utility-raising goods
in an intertemporal barter exchange that is not contractually sustained. This tension
is intuitive for audiences do not seem to look forward to consuming ads. In broadcast
television, zapping and using the fast forward on a DVD to speed through commercials
in a taped program are common behaviors. Modern technologies help these e¤orts
to avoid ads. In television the most famous is perhaps TiVo, which o¤ers a digital
video recorder that automatically nds and records ones favorite programs allowing
viewers to automatically skip the commercials when viewing the recorded program.22
A similar mechanism is often used in certain radio programs, not by audiences but by
the radio stations themselves, to push more commercials into their audiences. Radio
stations are able to speed up programming by applying time compression mechanisms
to make room for more advertising.23
  22
     Subscribers may also sit down to watch, for instance, a 60-minute live program 20 minutes
past the start time so they can skip past the commercials and catch up to real time by the
programs end.
  23
     For instance, the early sound processor called Cash snips out the silent pockets between words,
shortening the pauses, and generally speeding up the pace of the speech in recorded talk programs.


                                                 24
    Relative to TV and radio, the internet is more interactive on both the demand and
supply sides of goods and bads. Users can easily move away from passively receiving
information and entertainment, and actively seek the consumption of their goods of
interest. They can also block ads. Thus we would expect the tension in the internet
to be more apparent.24 In fact, with the advent of new technologies, it is. On the
one hand, the current situation pushing ads to viewers, seems to have exceeded rea-
sonable levels with consumers complaining about garish ads and intrusive trackers,
which make many sites bloated and increasingly slow to load:

      The ads that are being shown now on the Web have just gone overboard
      and people dont want to see them anymore in contrast to ads in other
      mediums like TV and on radio. Weve created this problem together,
      we created a bad experience and users are now voting everybody o¤ the
      island. Adweek, October 2015.

    On the other hand, with the advent of ad-blocking technologies into the web, in
particular to mobile devices, current discussion about ad-blockers are all the rage:

      Will ad-blocking over time decimate the free web? What role and form
      will advertising play on the web in the near future? (Cowen, 2015)

    The Reuters Institute Digital News Report (2015) reports that almost half of
all US internet users block ads, and that the ad revenue globally being blocked for
2016 may exceed $40 billion. To thwart some of the growth of ad blockers publishers
appear to have been banking on the growth of mobile devices, where the bulk of
Radio stations may add as many as four seconds per minute, that is four minutes of commercial
time per hour. The way it works is similar to TiVo. Instead of broadcasting a program live, the
radio station rst inserts four additional minutes of commercials. After these extra commercials, the
station starts playing back the program after removing the dead air spacing words closer together.
Within an hour, the clipped version catches up to the live feed. This type of device is used primarily
by local radio stations that apply it to syndicated programs (see The New York Times (2000)).
  24
     This tension has experienced substantial changes over time. In the 1990s websites used to give
individuals free information and services with virtually no ads and let users freely go their preferred
way with little or no attempts to manipulate their attention. Beginning in the early 2000s companies
began to push increasing amounts of advertising at them and actively engage in manipulation. The
movement away from pull technologies towards push technologies, also referred to as screen
bias, was well documented in a number of prominent legal cases where websites engaged excessively
in the manipulation of users attention. Even initially neutral search engines now direct individuals
toward speci c web sites that pay for prominent billing.


                                                  25
todays web audiences are and where, until recently, ad-blocking plugins either didnt
work or were cumbersome to install. But this is no longer the case. Popular software
such as AdBlock Plus is becoming available on mobiles, and Apples new operating
system iOS9, released last fall, allows consumers to put content blockers on its web
browser. Perhaps not surprisingly, a day after iOS9s launch, ad blockers topped the
App Store worldwide. It is unclear how media companies and consumers with ad
blockers will behave,25 but the model we have developed helps us think about the
di¤erent issues and gives us a way to study the trade-o¤s. As modeled in our dynamic
framework, both people and media want complete control to choose how they interact
with each other to determine digital advertising. Adweek (2015, italics added):

         The entire industry is predicated on a value exchange where everyone
         has to winconsumers, brands and publishers. But the pact has been
         corrupted with too much and ubiquitous, and frankly, terrible advertising.
         Our stance in general is that there are ads out there that can provide
         value onlineit is getting to those ads that should be the goal. ...The
         point is, weve got to nd a middle ground that allows consumers to get
         the content they want as fast as they want in all the ways that they want
         and still be able to create great advertising connected to it.

       This middle ground or pact (equilibrium) is precisely what we have attempted
to formalize. As such, the framework we have presented provides a way to approach
and investigate many di¤erent matters that future research should examine. For
instance, it is straightforward to modify the preference speci cation to reect the
even heftier ads by assuming that ads reduce utility by an amount a  0 per
unit of time. The utility ow of consumption becomes                 C   + a and this impacts the
experience, as well as the stock of initial and past consumption. Parametrizing how
ads may reduce utility is also useful to evaluate changes in regulatory standards with
interesting regulatory implications.26 More challenging undertakings may include
the study of changes in targeting technology to improve the quality of the match
between advertisers and the intended recipient of ads, including more general selection
  25
    See, e.g., Gans (2015) and Hyde (2105).
  26
    See Meyer (2015) on the new set of standards currently being developed for the digital advertising
industry, in particular to guide reasonable ad development on the mobile web.


                                                 26
issues, which may also be modeled through the preference speci cation (Athey and
Gans (2010), Athey, Calvano, Gans (2013)).27 The price of ads  (t), which we
assumed given, is de nitely determined under strategic and intertemporal competition
(Athey, Calvano and Gans, 2014) and the extent of coordination (Sweeting, 2006,
2009, 2013). Insight into the impact of changes in the technology to measure ads
consumption (from CPI and clicks to the concept of engaged time discussed earlier)
can be studied by examining changes in . And access to and new developments in
ad-avoiding technologies, including time-varying outside options, may be modeled
through v(t). Similarly, time-varying consumption intensity (or quality), perhaps
including hooks as in surprise and suspense e¤ects (Ely, Frankel and Kamenica,
2015) will operate through the process fC(t)g.


7       Concluding Remarks
We have developed a theory that formalizes the dynamic tension between the interests
of advertiser-supported media and consumers interested in receiving utility-raising
goods in a setting where the barter exchange between goods and bads is not contracted
away. We have argued that understanding how media markets operate, and how
media audiences form, requires a dynamic framework that includes these central
characteristics, and that such a framework is currently lacking in the literature.
      The papers contribution is essentially methodological. We believe our theory is
useful because it captures indispensable attributes that should be present in dynamic
models. As such we de nitely hope the theory will prove fruitful in future theoret-
ical and empirical work, in particular when integrated into models of strategic and
intertemporal competition. Our results may also help study various policy questions
which typically hinge on our understanding of the relevant trade-o¤s. We leave these
and other open extensions to future research.




 27
      Non-linear utility e¤ects of ads (ads that build their own stock of past ads) could also be studied.
