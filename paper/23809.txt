                                         ABSTRACT

A pre-specified set of nine prominent U.S. equity return anomalies produce significant alphas in
Canada, France, Germany, Japan, and the U.K. All of the anomalies are consistently significant
across these five countries, whose developed stock markets afford the most extensive data. The
anomalies remain significant even in a test that assumes their true alphas equal zero in the U.S.
Consistent with the view that anomalies reflect mispricing, idiosyncratic volatility exhibits a
strong negative relation to return among stocks that the anomalies collectively identify as
overpriced, similar to results in the U.S.

1.       Introduction

The attention received by equity return anomalies can span a wide range. At one extreme,
much influential research can follow an anomaly’s discovery. A notable example is the book-
to-market ratio, appearing as a return anomaly in the finance literature as early as the study
by Rosenberg, Reid, and Lanstein (1985). Book-to-market is subsequently used by Fama and
French (1993) to construct the popular three-factor model, and it is the focus of numerous
theoretical studies addressing the “value” effect.

      In contrast, many of the anomalies reported in the literature are likely to receive scant
additional attention. One reason, aside from the finance profession’s satiation with hundreds
of anomalies, is the recently heightened concern that many anomalies are spurious, essentially
the outcomes of data mining (e.g., Harvey, Liu, and Zhu (2016); Linnainmaa and Roberts
(2016); and Hou, Xue, and Zhang (2017)).

      A natural approach for investigating whether an anomaly is spurious is to examine its
returns in samples different from where it was discovered. Indeed, book-to-market’s pop-
ularity owes in part to its robustness in additional countries and time periods (e.g., Fama
and French (1998) and Davis, Fama, and French (2000)). Anomalies are not created equal,
however. Some have greater in-sample magnitudes and consistency across subsamples, and
some have stronger economic or behavioral motivations. If a large number of anomalies are
treated equally as data-mining suspects when examining out-of-sample returns, then con-
cluding that many of the anomalies are spurious is perhaps unsurprising. Few would argue
that the profession’s collective efforts to discover anomalies do not amount to at least some
degree of data mining. If all anomalies are then tarred with the same data-mining brush,
though, any genuine ones also get dismissed. Asking whether data mining is a major issue
for a large set of anomalies is different from asking the same question for a small set of
particular interest. Of course, the latter set must be credibly chosen ex ante.

      This study considers a pre-specified set of prominent U.S. anomalies and examines their
performance in Canada, France, Germany, Japan, and the U.K. The anomalies come from
the eleven used by Stambaugh, Yu, and Yuan (2012, 2014, 2015). The five countries above
have well developed stock markets whose data best enable the construction of the anomaly
variables, but data limitations nevertheless necessitate dropping two of the anomalies, leaving
nine: net stock issuance, composite equity issuance, accruals, net operating assets, asset
growth, investment to assets, momentum, gross profitability, and return on assets.1 This set
  1
      The two anomalies dropped from the original eleven are distress and O-score.

of anomalies satisfies the key requirement that it be determined ex ante with respect to our
investigation.

   The nine anomalies produce consistently significant abnormal returns in the five countries.
For each anomaly we compute alphas for the spread between the top and bottom quintiles,
within each country and averaged across countries. The cross-country average alpha for
asset-growth, although weaker than the other eight anomalies, has the same sign as its US
counterpart and is significant in a one-sided test. Its monthly Fama-French three-factor alpha
is 13 basis points (bps) with a t-statistic of 1.72. For the other eight anomalies, the cross-
country average monthly alphas range between 28 and 151 bps, with t-statistics from 3.15
to 9.50. Not only do the anomalies produce significant alphas averaged across countries, but
the overwhelming majority of the country-specific alphas for the anomalies are economically
and statistically significant as well. Of those 45 alphas (9 anomalies, 5 countries), only 3
(though all insignificant) have a sign opposite the US counterpart, and 31 have t-statistics
of at least 2.00. The results are qualitatively the same using just a single market factor or
no factor to adjust returns.

   The anomalies are significant in the five non-U.S. countries even if one assumes their
significance in the U.S. data reflects data mining. Our sample period, 1980 through 2015,
largely overlaps the U.S. history for which the anomalies are originally reported. In that
respect our analysis is not strictly out-of-sample. For example, suppose the true alpha on
an anomaly is zero in both the U.S. and the U.K. If the anomaly’s U.K. abnormal return is
positively correlated with its U.S. counterpart, and if the U.S. estimated alpha is positive,
then one expects the U.K. alpha estimated in the same sample period to be positive as well.
In other words, with cross-country correlation of an anomaly’s returns, inferences about that
anomaly’s significance abroad are potentially susceptible to U.S. data mining. We include a
control for this possibility when judging the anomalies’ significance.

   Our test that controls for U.S. data mining is especially strict. We ask whether an
anomaly’s sample alpha in another country is significant, conditional on the U.S. sample
alpha and an assumption that the anomaly’s true U.S. alpha equals zero. The test is easily
implemented by including the U.S. anomaly’s abnormal return as an additional right-hand-
side factor when estimating the anomaly’s alpha in the other country. The test is strict, in
that it will too often fail to detect an anomaly in another country if the anomaly truly exists
in the U.S. Nevertheless, most of the anomalies also clear this high hurdle in each of the
five countries.

   We also combine the nine anomalies into a single composite. The results further support

                                              2
the anomalies’ overall significance. Following the approach of Stambaugh, Yu, and Yuan
(2015), we rank stocks based on a mispricing measure constructed each month as a stock’s
average, across anomalies, of its percentile when ranked on each anomaly variable. As those
authors explain, averaging rankings across anomalies can diversify away anomaly-specific
noise, increasing the resulting measure’s ability to identify relative mispricing among stocks.
In each country, we form the spread between the top and bottom quintiles of the mispricing
measure. The monthly alpha for this mispricing spread has a cross-country average of 118
bps with a t-statistic of 16.2. The individual-country alphas range from 47 to 169 bps, with
t-statistics from 3.9 to 17.0. Even after the above data-mining control, the average alpha
is 97 bps with a t-statistic of 13.8, and the country alphas range from 40 to 148 bps, with
t-statistics from 3.3 to 12.4.

   The anomalies in these countries are also consistent with mispricing. In particular, id-
iosyncratic volatility (IVOL) plays a role similar to what Stambaugh, Yu, and Yuan (2015)
observe in the U.S. That study finds the previously observed negative relation between IVOL
and alpha is confined to stocks classified as overpriced based on the mispricing measure com-
bining anomaly rankings. As those authors explain, IVOL reflects risk for price-correcting
arbitrageurs. That arbitrage risk interacts with what the authors term “arbitrage asymme-
try,” meaning less capital is available to bear arbitrage risk when shorting overpriced stocks,
as compared to the capital bearing arbitrage risk when buying underpriced stocks. As a re-
sult, one expects IVOL to deter price correction more among overpriced stocks. Least likely
to be corrected is overpricing among high-IVOL stocks, so IVOL should exhibit a negative
relation to alpha among overpriced stocks.

   In each of the five non-U.S. countries, IVOL exhibits a strongly significant negative rela-
tion to alpha among the stocks identified as the most overpriced by the mispricing measure
discussed above. These negative IVOL effects, as in the U.S., are consistent with arbitrage
risk deterring the correction of overpricing. In contrast, IVOL exhibits little or no rela-
tion to alpha among the stocks at the opposite end of the mispricing scale, consistent with
arbitrage-asymmetry.

   A number of previous studies find that some of the anomalies we examine appear in non-
U.S. countries. Examples include Pincus, Rajgopal, and Venkatachalam (2007), McLean,
Pontiff, and Watanabe (2009), Chui, Titman, and Wei (2010), Titman, Wei, and Xie (2010),
Asness, Moskowitz, and Pedersen (2013), Watanabe, Xu, Yao, and Yu (2013), and Sun,
Wei and Xie (2014). Our study uses a larger pre-specified set of anomalies, with longer and
broader samples for the five developed stock markets we examine. Jacobs (2016) analyzes the


                                              3
Stambaugh, Yu, and Yuan (2015) mispricing measure in other countries, but in addition to
having a shorter sample period, the study does not examine individual anomalies separately
in each country. None of these studies include a data-mining hurdle that assumes the true
U.S. alphas are zero, and none examine the interaction between the IVOL effect and an
anomaly-based proxy for mispricing.



2.      Anomalies and returns

Of the eleven U.S. anomalies used by Stambaugh, Yu, and Yuan (2012, 2014, 2015), we are
able to investigate nine of them in each of Canada, France, Germany, Japan, and the U.K.:

  1. Net stock issuance (Ritter (1991); Loughran and Ritter (1995))
  2. Composite equity issuance (Daniel and Titman (2006))
  3. Accruals (Sloan (1996))
  4. Net operating assets (Hirshleifer, Hou, Teoh, and Zhang (2004))
  5. Asset growth (Cooper, Gulen, and Schill (2008))
  6. Investment to assets (Titman, Wei, and Xie (2004); Xing (2008))
  7. Momentum (Jegadeesh and Titman (1993); Carhart (1997))
  8. Gross Profitability (Novy-Marx (2013))
  9. Return on Assets (Fama and French (2006); Wang and Yu (2010))

  The other two anomalies, the O-measure of Ohlson (1980) and the financial distress
measure of Campbell, Hilscher, and Szilagyi (2008), require estimation of models using data
beyond what is available across the five countries for sufficient numbers of stocks and time
periods.

     Table 1 reports properties of the nine anomalies in each of the five countries. We examine
an anomaly’s performance in a given country only during months when there are at least
ten stocks in each quintile of the anomaly’s ranking. Panel A reports the earliest month
for which that condition is satisfied. For most anomalies in most countries, our samples
begin in the early 1980s, but others do not begin until later that decade. Panel B reports
the time-series average of the cross-sectional median of an anomaly’s ranking variable, and
Panel C reports the average of the ranking variable’s cross-sectional standard deviation.

     At the end of each month, in each country, we sort stocks based on the most recently
available value of a given anomaly’s ranking variable. We then form the monthly long-short
return spread between the portfolios of stocks in the top and bottom quintiles. Designating

                                               4
which of those quintiles is the long leg versus the short leg follows the same ordering that
produces a positive alpha in the U.S. In each country, we also compute three return factors—
market, size, and value (book-to-market)—applying the same procedure outlined by Fama
and French (1993) in computing their MKT, SMB, and HML factors. Our calculation of the
anomaly variables also follows previous literature. Appendix A gives details of data sources
and methods used in constructing the anomaly variables and the portfolio returns.

   We examine both equally weighted and value-weighted portfolios. Although our results
are robust to either specification, equally weighted portfolios are generally likely to offer
more precise inferences in this setting. The issue is essentially the number of available stocks
and the length of the sample period. As noted above, we require at least ten stocks per
quintile portfolio. Among each country’s anomalies satisfying that threshold each month,
Panel A of Figure 1 plots the average number of stocks per portfolio, and Panel B plots the
smallest number of stocks in any portfolio. We see that despite forming portfolios based
on quintiles (versus deciles, often used in the U.S.), the number of stocks in a portfolio
is often fairly modest. As a result, the greater diversification achieved with equal weights
yields substantially lower portfolio return volatility than value weights produce. Table 2
reports the standard deviation of each anomaly’s monthly long-short return in each country.
When averaged across anomalies and the five countries, the standard deviation of monthly
return is 3.36% for equally weighted portfolios, and 5.24% for value-weighted portfolios. The
corresponding quantities are 2.52% and 3.11% in the U.S., where there are generally more
stocks. Although both equally weighted and value-weighted portfolios in the five countries
have substantially higher standard deviations than those in the U.S., the value-weighted
portfolios are especially volatile. Given that the sample periods for these countries are at
least two decades shorter than in the U.S., the relatively low standard deviation of equally
weighted portfolios is preferred in this situation. Therefore, our discussion below focuses
on the results with equally weighted portfolios. Corresponding results for value-weighted
portfolios are reported in Appendix B.

   Table 3 reports estimated three-factor monthly alphas for each anomaly’s long-short
spread. The alphas are computed with respect to each country’s market, size, and value
factors, but the results are robust to using just a market factor or no factor (as reported
in the Internet Appendix.) Alphas are reported for the individual countries as well as for
the average across countries, with the latter computed by averaging the anomaly’s abnormal
returns across countries.




                                               5
     For all nine anomalies, the cross-country average alphas are consistently positive and
significant. As reported in Table 3, for asset growth, which is weaker than the others, the
cross-country average alpha is 13 bps per month with a t-statistic of 1.72. The cross-country
average alphas for the other eight anomalies have a mean of 57 bps; the eight t-statistics are
all above 3.00 and have a mean of 5.80.

   The cross-country average alphas diversify away country-specific noise for a given anomaly.
In contrast, the alphas for the composite mispricing measure, also reported in Table 3, di-
versify away anomaly-specific noise within a given country. The mispricing-measure alphas
for the five countries all have substantial economic and statistical significance: For Japan,
the monthly alpha is 47 bps with a t-statistic of 3.89. The alphas for the other four countries
all exceed 100 bps, with t-statistics all exceeding 7.00. Averaging the mispricing-measure al-
phas across countries diversifies away both country-specific and anomaly-specific noise. The
resulting overall monthly alpha is especially strong: 118 bps with a t-statistic of 16.21.



3.      Allowing for U.S. data mining

The results in Table 3 strongly support an inference that most of the anomalies in the pre-
specified set from the U.S. also exist in the other five countries. At the same time, these
results are not necessarily immune from a concern that the discoveries of these anomalies in
the U.S. reflect data mining. Suppose an anomaly’s true alpha is zero everywhere but its
realized abnormal returns are correlated between the U.S. and another country. Then if the
in-sample U.S. alpha is positive, one expects a positive estimated alpha in the other country
for the same sample period.

     We conduct a test addressing the above issue. Specifically, for each anomaly i in the
non-U.S. country j, we estimate the regression
                               (j)           (j)       (j) (j)         (j) (US )           (j)

                        (j)                                                                 (j)
where, in month t, Ri,t is the anomaly’s long-short return spread, ft                             is the vector containing
                                      US
country j’s factor realizations, and ri,t is the sample abnormal return in the U.S. This last
quantity is the sum of the estimated intercept and the residual in the regression,

the relation in (8) that if φ̂i > 0, i.e., if the cross-country correlation of abnormal returns

is positive, then the usual estimate of country j’s alpha, α̂i , is reduced by φ̂i times the
(positive) U.S. alpha estimated over the same sample period. The approximation in (8)
                                                                                                      (j)

ri,tincluded in equation (1). A significantly positive      supports an inference that the   α̃i
anomaly’s true alpha in the non-U.S. country is positive even if the anomaly’s significance
in the U.S. market is just a result of data mining.

    The above control for data mining is strong, in that equation (5) allows no true presence of
the anomaly in the U.S. If the true U.S. alpha is instead positive, then requiring significance
     (j)            (j)
of α̃i instead of α̂i becomes overly conservative, too often failing to detect a true anomaly

                                                                         7
in country j. Nevertheless, most of the anomalies also clear this high hurdle in each of the
five countries.

     Table 4 reports estimates of α̃i , presented in the same format as the estimates of α̂i
in Table 3. The cross-country average alphas of all nine anomalies have the same sign as the
U.S. counterparts, although two of the nine anomalies become insignificant. The anomaly
that exhibits marginal significance in Table 3, asset-growth, becomes insignificant in Table 4.

overall cross-country significance in Table 4 is return-on-assets, whose average α̃i       drops to
                                             (j)
5 bps per month, compared to 28 bps for    α̂i     in Table 3, with the t-statistic dropping from
3.15 to 0.55.

     In contrast to return-on-assets, the other seven anomalies that are significant in Table
3 remain quite significant in Table 4. The cross-country average alphas range from 16 to
83 bps, with t-statistics from 2.33 to 7.81. Of the 35 individual-country alphas for those
seven anomalies, only two are negative (but insignificant), and 23 have t-statistics of at least
2.00. A majority of these anomalies also experience a drop in alpha when going from Table
3 to Table 4, but the drop does not change the overall conclusion. In general, except for
return-on-assets, conditioning on assumed U.S. data mining appears to have a fairly modest
influence on inferences about the anomalies in the five non-U.S. countries.

    The mispricing measure described earlier, which averages the anomaly percentiles across
all nine anomalies, including asset-growth and return-on-assets, still produces a large and
significant alpha in each country, ranging from 29 to 134 bps, with t-statistics from 2.31
to 10.50. The cross-country average alpha for this composite strategy is 81 bps with a t-
statistic of 12.02, slightly weaker than in Table 3 but still very significant both economically
and statistically.

     In sum, the data-mining issue does little to weaken an inference that the pre-specified
set of prominent U.S. anomalies also produces strong abnormal returns in Canada, France,
Germany, Japan, and the U.K.



4.      Idiosyncratic volatility and mispricing

One interpretation of anomalies is that they represent mispricing. A key question con-
fronting that interpretation is why mispricing would survive the forces of arbitrage seeking

                                               8
to exploit it. Stambaugh, Yu, and Yuan (2015) advance one explanation that combines two
familiar concepts in the literature, arbitrage risk and arbitrage asymmetry. In that study,
idiosyncratic volatility (IVOL) represents arbitrage risk, i.e., risk that deters arbitrage and
its accompanying price correction. Arbitrage asymmetry is a greater ability or willingness of
investors to take long positions as compared to short positions. With arbitrage asymmetry,
there is less capital in the market sharing the risk in shorting overpriced stocks than the cap-
ital sharing the risk in buying underpriced stocks. As a result, price correction is deterred
by arbitrage risk (IVOL) more among overpriced stocks than among underpriced stocks. We
investigate the two main empirical implications of this argument.

    The first empirical implication is that, among overpriced stocks, there should be a neg-
ative relation between IVOL and alpha. Among the most relatively overpriced stocks in a
given country, the stocks with the highest IVOL should be those with the least price cor-
rection and thus the largest negative alphas. In other words, the alpha for the high-low
IVOL spread, which we term the “IVOL effect,” should be negative among stocks having
the highest values of the mispricing measure, representing the most overpriced stocks.

       The second implication is that the IVOL effect should be decreasing in the mispricing
measure. For lower values of the mispricing measure, overpricing is less likely, and thus the
likelihood that IVOL deters the correction of overpricing is less likely.

       We compute each stock’s IVOL as the standard deviation of the daily abnormal return
with respect to the country’s three-factor model, following common practice in U.S. data.
We then perform a two-way sort of stocks within each country, independently sorting on
the mispricing measure and IVOL, assigning stocks to the top, middle, or bottom third of
each variable. Assigning stocks to just 9 cells, instead of the 25 used by Stambaugh, Yu,
and Yuan (2015) in their 5 × 5 sort of U.S. stocks, is a concession to the smaller universes
generally available in the five non-U.S. countries.2 Table 5 reports, for each country, the
alphas on equally weighted portfolios constructed for each of the nine cells in the two-way
sort on IVOL and the mispricing measure. Also reported for each mispricing category is the
IVOL effect (i.e., the alpha for the spread between the highest and lowest IVOL portfolios).

       Consistent with the first implication above, the IVOL effect is significantly negative in
each of the five countries among the most overpriced stocks. The IVOL effect in that case
ranges from −44 to −92 bps, with t-statistics from −2.35 to −3.56. The cross-country
   2
    The Internet Appendix provides the sample period in each country for which we can conduct this analysis,
the average IVOL within each of the resulting categories, and the average number of stocks in each cell for
each country.


                                                     9
average of the IVOL effect among the most overpriced stocks is −73 bps, with a t-statistic
of −5.49.

   The second implication, a negative relation between the IVOL effect and the mispricing
measure, is also supported. Table 5 reports each country’s difference in IVOL effects between
the highest versus lowest mispricing measures. The difference is negative in each country,
as predicted, with t-statistics between −1.21 and −3.11. The cross-country average of this
difference is −49 bps with a t-statistic of −4.43.

   The estimated IVOL effects among stocks with the lowest mispricing measures, although
generally insignificant (with t-statistics from −0.08 to −1.89) are nevertheless negative in
each country. This pattern is consistent enough that, when averaged across the five countries,
the IVOL effect among these stocks becomes marginally significantly negative, having an
alpha difference of −24 bps with a t-statistic of −1.88. This result differs from that of
Stambaugh, Yu, and Yuan (2015), who find a positive IVOL effect among stocks with the
lowest values of the mispricing measure. As noted above, those authors use a 5 × 5 sort
instead of our 3 × 3 sort. They characterize stocks in the lowest fifth of the mispricing
measure as underpriced, and they explain that the IVOL effect among underpriced stocks
should be positive, not negative. For convenience, we label the bottom third of the mispricing
measure in Table 5 as “underpriced,” but such a characterization becomes more tenuous for
stocks in the bottom third as opposed to the bottom fifth. Arbitrage asymmetry also implies
that overpricing should be more prevalent in general than underpricing. If the lowest third
still contains some stocks that are overpriced to some degree, the sign of the IVOL effect
among that segment becomes ambiguous. Thus, the cleaner implication on which we focus
is simply that the IVOL effect should be negatively related to the mispricing measure.

   We also explore the sensitivity of our results to using a mispricing measure that includes
two other strong anomalies in the five countries we examine. To do so we replace return-
on-assets with return-on-equity (ROE), a related measure of profitability, and we add book-
to-market (BM). Both ROE and BM have many significant alphas in the five countries, and
their cross-country average alphas both exhibit strong significance, with and without the
data-mining control in the previous section. Table 6 reports the alphas for ROE, BM, and
the resulting ten-anomaly mispricing measure. This alternative measure, however, produces
IVOL effects very similar to those reported in Table 5. The results are provided in the
Internet Appendix.

5.      Conclusions

A pre-specified set of nine prominent U.S. equity return anomalies produce significant alphas
in Canada, France, Germany, Japan, and the U.K. The anomalies largely remain quite
significant even in a test that assumes the true alphas on the anomalies equal zero in the
U.S. That assumption is motivated by a data-mining concern, which our results thus serve to
lessen. Under the assumption of a zero U.S. alpha for an anomaly, the test of the anomaly’s
significance in the non-U.S. country simply includes the anomaly’s U.S. abnormal return as
an additional right-hand variable in the usual factor-model regression.

     As found previously in the U.S. by Stambaugh, Yu, and Yuan (2015), each of the five
countries examined here exhibits a strong negative alpha-IVOL relation among overpriced
stocks. Those stocks in each country are identified using a composite measure that combines
anomaly rankings, following Stambaugh, Yu, and Yuan (2015). As those authors explain, this
result is consistent with idiosyncratic volatility being a greater deterrent to price-correcting
arbitrage among overpriced stocks, as that arbitrage risk is shared by the lower amount of
capital available for shorting stocks, compared to buying them. These IVOL effects, now
documented in five additional countries, support a view that the anomalies, rather than
being spurious, at least in part reflect mispricing.

     containing stocks in the highest and lowest deciles of the ranking variable. In Panel A, the long- and short-
     leg portfolios are equally weighted, whereas in Panel B they are value weighted. Volatilities are shown
     for each individual anomaly as well as the composite mispricing measure that averages a stock’s ranking
     percentiles across anomalies. The “average” column reports the volatility of an equally weighted cross-
     country combination of the long-short spreads. The “average” row contains the average of the values in the
     preceding rows. Also reported in the last column, for comparison, are U.S. volatilities.

                           Alphas for Anomaly Long-Short Returns

The table reports the alphas (in percent) of the monthly return spread between the portfolios containing
stocks in the highest and lowest deciles of the ranking variable. Alpha is the estimated intercept in a regression
of the spread return on the country’s market, size, and book-to-market factors. The long- and short-leg
portfolios are equally weighted. The “average” column reports the alpha of an equally weighted cross-country
combination of the long-short spreads. Also reported is the long-short alpha for the composite mispricing
measure that averages a stock’s ranking percentiles across anomalies. Panel A reports the estimated alphas,
and Panel B reports the corresponding t-statistics based on the heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors
of White (1980).

                  Alphas for Anomaly Long-Short Returns Conditional
                             on U.S. Alphas Equal to Zero

The table reports the alphas (in percent) of the monthly return spread between the portfolios containing
stocks in the highest and lowest deciles of the ranking variable. An anomaly’s alpha in each of the five
countries is estimated under the assumption that the anomaly’s true alpha in the U.S. equals zero. Under
that assumption, alpha is the estimated intercept in a regression of the spread return on the country’s market,
size, and book-to-market factors as well as the U.S. anomaly’s abnormal return. The long- and short-leg
portfolios are equally weighted. The “average” column reports the alpha of an equally weighted cross-country
combination of the long-short spreads. Also reported is the long-short alpha for the composite mispricing
measure that averages a stock’s ranking percentiles across anomalies. Panel A reports the estimated alphas,
and Panel B reports the corresponding t-statistics based on the heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors
of White (1980).

                      Alphas for Book to Market, Return on Equity,
                          and the Revised Mispricing Measure

The table reports the alphas (in percent) of the monthly return spread between the portfolios containing
stocks in the highest and lowest deciles of return on equity, book to market, and a revised mispricing measure
that combines those two anomalies with the first eight in Tables 1 through 4. Panel A reports the alpha
estimated as the intercept in a regression of the spread return on the country’s market, size, and book-to-
market factors. Panel B reports the alpha estimated under the assumption that the anomaly’s true alpha in
the U.S. equals zero. Under that assumption, alpha is the estimated intercept in a regression of the spread
return on the country’s market, size, and book-to-market factors as well as the U.S. anomaly’s abnormal
return. The long- and short-leg portfolios are equally weighted. The “average” column reports the alpha
of an equally weighted cross-country combination of the long-short spreads. All t-statistics (in parentheses)
are based on the heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors of White (1980).

Appendix A. Data Description

This appendix provides details of data sources and methods. Section A1 describes the sources
and screening procedures for our data. We apply filters commonly used by previous studies
to clean the data and construct the nine individual anomalies in each country. Section A2
describes the construction of the anomaly measures and the corresponding mispricing scores,
with the latter following the method in Stambaugh Yu and Yuan (2015) for U.S. anomalies.
Section A3 describes the method for constructing each country’s three factors (corresponding
to those in Fama and French (1993) for U.S. stocks) and the idiosyncratic volatility (IVOL)
measure.


A1.     Data screening procedures

Our stock price data and accounting data come from Datastream and WorldScope. Our
sample contains all firms from January 1980 to December 2015 for five countries: Canada,
France, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom. We apply filters suggested by Ince and
Porter (2003), Karolyi, Hou and Kho (2011), and Griffin, Kelly and Nardari (2010).


Datastream price data

We apply the following filters to Datastream data:

  1. Country and Exchanges: We include all stocks traded on the major exchange for
     Canada (Toronto Stock Exchange), France (Paris Stock Exchange), Germany (Frank-
     furt Stock Exchange) and the U.K. (London Stock Exchange), and on the two major
     exchanges for Japan (Tokyo Stock Exchange and JASDAQ). Furthermore, we filter
     to include only the common stocks (TYP=EQ) and the ones traded at the major ex-
     change(s) for the five countries in local currency. We choose the primary security of
     each company (IsMajorSec=Y). Each observation must have country, exchange name,
     DScode, date, price, and a valid market value in the previous month to be included in
     our sample.

  2. Filter non-common equity securities using security names: Restricting TYP=EQ is
     not adequate to exclude all non-common equity securities. Datastream tracks security
     type information predominantly through the addition of text in the security’s name
     files. Following Griffin Kelly and Nardari (2010), we apply company name (DSSEC-
     NAME) filters to exclude non-common equity firms: We apply both the generic and
     the country-specific name filters to identify and exclude preferred stock, American De-
     positary Receipts (ADRs), mutual funds, index funds, warrants, investment trusts,
     Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and other forms of non-common equity. These
     filters are listed in Table A1.



                                            23
  3. Filter data errors in returns: We apply several screening procedures for monthly returns
     as suggested by Ince and Porter (2003) and others. First, any return above 300% that
     is reversed within one month is set to missing. Specifically, if Rt or Rt−1 is greater than
     300%, and (1 + Rt )(1 + Rt−1 ) − 1 < 50%, then both Rt and Rt−1 are set to missing.
     Second, in order to exclude remaining outliers in returns that cannot be identifiable
     as stock splits or mergers, we treat as missing the monthly returns that fall out of
     the 0.1% and 99.9% percentile ranges in each country. We also eliminate all monthly
     observations for delisted stocks from the end of the sample period to the first non-zero
     return date (based on local currency) since Datastream keeps padding the last available
     data after the delisting date. We use exchange rate data from Bloomberg to convert
     all returns into USD-denominated valuers.

  4. Filter by market capitalization: We exclude observations for stocks with market value
     below each country’s fifth percentile in the month of portfolio formation. According to
     Ince and Porter (2003), return related errors are concentrated among small stocks. Fol-
     lowing Jacobs (2016), we also exclude observations in which the market capitalization
     of a stock is larger than 90% of the country’s market capitalization.


WorldScope accounting data

Annual financial statement data used in this study come from WorldScope. Each record
must contain the country, fiscal year, and a positive value for total assets (AT, WC02999) to
be included in our sample. We convert all accounting variables to USD-denominated values
using exchange rate data from Bloomberg.


A2.      Anomalies and composite mispricing score construction

We first compute anomaly measures at the end of each month. To ensure that the accounting
information is available in the portfolio construction month, we require at least a four-month
gap between the portfolio formation month and the month of the fiscal year end, if accounting
data are used to calculate an anomaly value. In other words, at the portfolio formation month
of t−1, accounting data with a fiscal year end between t−5 and t−16 are treated as the most
recent information for computing anomaly values. For the asset growth, gross profitability,
and investment-to-assets anomalies, we apply a special treatment for outliers, discussed in
the calculation of those anomaly measures below. For all other anomalies, we trim at the
top and bottom 1% of anomaly values every month to remove outliers.

    We then form the monthly quintiles for each anomaly. Designating which of those quin-
tiles is the long leg versus the short leg follows the same ordering that produces a positive
alpha in the U.S. The long-short return spread between the portfolios of stocks in the top
and bottom quintiles for each anomaly is computed accordingly. For each anomaly (except
for net stock issuance), we sort stocks into quintiles every month in each country, and we
require at least 10 stocks in each quintile.


                                              24
   Some of the individual anomalies have been examined in the international setting by pre-
vious studies, including McLean, Pontiff, and Watanabe (2009) on net stock issues, Pincus,
Rajgopal, and Venkatachalam (2007) on total accruals, Watanabe, Xu, Yao, and Yu (2013)
and Titman, Wei, Xie (2010) on asset growth, Chui, Titman, and Wei (2010) on momentum,
Sun, Wei and Xie (2014) on gross profitability. To avoid any potential data mining concerns,
we adhere to the procedures in Stambaugh, Yu and Yuan (2015) to construct the anomaly
measures.

   Below we detail the construction of the anomaly measures:

    Anomaly 1: Net stock issues (NSI) We measure NSI as the log of annual changes
in split-adjusted shares outstanding. Specifically, NSI is the cumulative net stock issuance
from month t − 13 to month t − 1 , calculated using shares outstanding and the cumulative
adjusted factor (CumAdjFactor) from Datastream monthly data. NSI is computed as:

                                                                            
                                  Sharesoutstandingt−1 ∗ CumAdjF actort−1
              NSIt−1 = log
                                 sharesoutstandingt−13 ∗ CumAdjF actort−13
To balance the number of stocks in each quintile, we assign stocks with negative NSI to
quintile 1 and stocks with NSI equal to 0 to quintile 2. We divide stocks with positive NSI
into three groups, and assign an equal number of stocks to quintiles 3, 4, and 5.

    Anomaly 2: Composite equity issues (CEI) We compute the CEI measure by
subtracting the 12-month cumulative stock return cumrett−1,t−12 from the 12-month growth
in equity market capitalization. The portfolios are rebalanced every month based on CEI
calculated in the past 12 months. CEI is computed as:
                          P ricet−1 ∗ Shares outstandingt−1
              CEIt−1 =                                       − cumrett−1,t−12
                         P ricet−13 ∗ Shares outstandingt−13

    Anomaly 3: Total accruals (ACCR) We measure accruals as the annual change
in noncash working capital minus depreciation and amortization expense (DP, WC01151),
divided by average total assets (AT, WC02999) for the previous two fiscal years. Noncash
working capital is computed as the change in current assets (ACT, WC02201) minus the
change in cash and short-term investment (CHE, WC02001), minus the change in debt
included in current liabilities (LCT, WC03101), plus the change in current liabilities (DLC,
WC03051), plus the change in income tax payable (TXP, WC03063). If tax payable (TXP,
WC03063) is missing here, it is set to 0. ACCR in fiscal year t is computed as:
                                 CAt − Casht − CLt + ST Dt + T Pt − DPt
                 ACCRt = 2 ∗                                            ,
                                              ATt + ATt−1
where CAt = ACTt − ACTt−1, Casht = CHEt − CHEt−1, CLt = LCTt − LCTt−1,
ST Dt = DLCt − DLCt−1 , and T Pt = T XPt − T XPt−1 .


   Anomaly 4: Net operating assets (NOA) We measure net operating assets as op-
erating assets minus operating liabilities, divided by lagged total assets (AT, WC02999).

                                             25
Operating assets equal total assets (AT, WC02999) minus cash and short-term investment
(CHE, WC02001). Operating liabilities equal total assets minus the following: debt in-
cluded in current liabilities (DLC, WC03051), long-term debt (DLTT, WC03251), common
equity (CE, WC03501), minority interests (MIB, WC04055), and preferred stock (PSTK,
WC03451). (The last two items are set to zero if they are missing.) NOA in fiscal year t is
computed as:
                (ATt − CHEt) − (ATt − DLCt − DLT Tt − MIBt − P ST Kt − CEt)
      NOAt =
                                           ATt

   Anomaly 5: Asset growth (AG) We measure asset growth as the most recent year-
over-year annual growth rate of total assets (AT, WC02999). Following Watanabe, Xu, Yao,
and Yu (2013), observations with calculated AG above 10 are deleted.

    Anomaly 6: Investment to assets (INV) We compute investment-to-assets as the
changes in gross property, plant, and equipment (PPEGT, WC02301) plus changes in inven-
tory (INVT, WC02101), divided by lagged total assets (AT, WC02999). We delete observa-
tions with INV above 10 or less than −1. INV in fiscal year t is computed as:
                           P P EGTt − P P EGTt−1 + INV Tt − INV Tt−1
                  INVt =
                                            ATt−1

    Anomaly 7: Momentum (MOM) The momentum measure at the end of month t − 1
is the cumulative return from month t − 12 to month t − 2.

    Anomaly 8: Gross profitability (GP) Gross profit is sales minus the cost of goods
sold, scaled by total assets. We measure gross profitability as total revenue (REVT, WC01001)
minus the cost of goods sold (COGS, WC01051), divided by current total assets (AT,
WC02999). If current total assets, total revenue, or cost of goods sold is negative, then
GP is set to missing. Following Sun, Wei and Xie (2014), we exclude firm-year observations
with GP less than −100% or greater than 100%. GP in fiscal year t is computed as:
                                         REV Tt − COGSt
                                 GPt =
                                              ATt

   Anomaly 9: Return on assets (ROA) ROA is WorldScope item WC08326.

    Mispricing measure (MISP) For each of the previous anomalies, we assign a rank to
each stock that reflects the sorting on that given anomaly variable, where the highest rank
is assigned to the value of the anomaly variable associated with the lowest average abnormal
return, as reported in the literature. For example, the empirical evidence on the momentum
anomaly is that high past return is followed by high return (Jegadeesh and Titman (1993)).
We therefore rank firms in each month by the momentum measure (cumulative returns in
the past), and those with the highest past returns receive the lowest rank. The higher the
rank, the greater the relative degree of overpricing according to the given anomaly variable.

   A stock’s composite rank is then the arithmetic average of its ranking percentile for each
the anomalies. Among the stocks that satisfy our filters, we include all stocks with at least

                                             26
three valid anomaly variables to construct the mispricing score. We construct the mispricing
scores as the arithmetic average of the ranking percentile for NSI, CEI, ACCR, NOA, AG,
INV, MOM, GP, and ROA. We refer to the stocks with the highest composite ranking as
the most “overpriced” and to those with the lowest ranking as the most “underpriced.”

    In addition, we construct a revised mispricing measure as a robustness check. The revised
measure is computed as the arithmetic average of the ranking percentile for ten anomalies. In
the original nine we replace return-on-assets with return-on-equity (ROE), a related measure
of profitability, and then we add book-to-market (BM) as another anomaly. We measure
BM as the ratio of book value per share (WC05476) to year-end market price (WC05001),
with negative BM values set to missing. To measure ROE, we first compute profit as annual
revenue (REVT, WC01001) minus the following: cost of goods sold (COGS, WC01051),
interest expense (INTS, WC01075), and selling general and administrative expenses (SGA,
WC01101). Profit is then divided by book equity (CE, WC03501) for the most recently
ended fiscal year to obtain the ROE value. Interest expense (INTS, WC01075) and selling
general and administrative expenses (SGA, WC01101) are set to 0 if missing, while the
other variables are required to have a non-missing value to calculate the ROE measure. In
particular, ROE in fiscal year t is computed as ROEt = REV Tt −COGS   t −IN T St −SGAt
                                                                    CEt−1
                                                                                       .


A3.     Fama French factor constructions and IVOL calculation

Construction of the Fama French three factors

We construct both monthly factors and daily factors for each country. The market factor is
the value-weighted market return for each country minus the one-month U.S. Treasury bill
rate. To construct the SMB and HML factors in each country, we form six value-weighted
portfolios by sorting on size and the book-to-market ratio. Size is the market capitalization
at the end of the previous June. The book-to-market ratio is the book value per share
(WC05476) divided by the year-end market price (WC05001). We require a positive market
capitalization and a positive BM ratio for a stock to be included in a factor portfolio. We
first sort stocks into two size groups, using the 80th percentile of market capitalization as
the breakpoint. Within each stock-size group, we then sort on BM and form three groups
using the 30th and 70th percentiles as breakpoints. Finally, the monthly and daily SMB and
HML factors are constructed using the same approach suggested in Fama and French (1993,
2012).


Idiosyncratic volatility (IVOL)

We follow Ang, Hodrick, Xing, and Zhang (2006, 2009) to construct the idiosyncratic volatil-
ity (IVOL) measure for each stock. Specifically, IVOL is calculated with respect to the local
(country-specific) three-factor model using the following regression:

                    ri = αLi + βiLMKT L + sLi SMB L + hLi HMLL + eLi ,                   (9)


                                             27
where ri (the daily excess U.S. dollar return of stock i) and the local three factors are all
expressed in U.S. dollars. The IVOL for stock i is measured as the standard deviation of the
residual, eLi, when estimating equation (9) using daily excess returns over the past month.
We require the number of zero daily returns in the estimation month to be less than five
in order to compute IVOL for that month. For each country, we then form nine portfolios
(3 × 3) by sorting independently on the mispricing score and IVOL. We require at least
ten stocks in each of the nine portfolios to calculate a country’s portfolio returns in a given
month.

Appendix B. Results with Value-Weighted Portfolios

As a robustness check, Tables B1, B2, and B3 use value-weighted portfolios to repeat the
analyses in Tables 3, 4, and 5, respectively.

                                (Value-Weighted Portfolios)

The table reports the alphas (in percent) of the monthly return spread between the portfolios containing
stocks in the highest and lowest deciles of the ranking variable. Alpha is the estimated intercept in a regression
of the spread return on the country’s market, size, and book-to-market factors. The long- and short-leg
portfolios are value weighted. The “average” column reports the alpha of an equally weighted cross-country
combination of the long-short spreads. Also reported is the long-short alpha for the composite mispricing
measure that averages a stock’s ranking percentiles across anomalies. Panel A reports the estimated alphas,
and Panel B reports the corresponding t-statistics based on the heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors
of White (1980).

                  Alphas for Anomaly Long-Short Returns Conditional
                             on U.S. Alphas Equal to Zero
                             (Value-Weighted Portfolios)

The table reports the alphas (in percent) of the monthly return spread between the portfolios containing
stocks in the highest and lowest deciles of the ranking variable. An anomaly’s alpha in each of the five
countries is estimated under the assumption that the anomaly’s true alpha in the U.S. equals zero. Under
that assumption, alpha is the estimated intercept in a regression of the spread return on the country’s market,
size, and book-to-market factors as well as the U.S. anomaly’s abnormal return. The long- and short-leg
portfolios are value weighted. The “average” column reports the alpha of an equally weighted cross-country
combination of the long-short spreads. Also reported is the long-short alpha for the composite mispricing
measure that averages a stock’s ranking percentiles across anomalies. Panel A reports the estimated alphas,
and Panel B reports the corresponding t-statistics based on the heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors
of White (1980).

               Equally Weighted Anomaly Long-Short Return Spreads

The table reports the monthly return spread between the portfolios containing stocks in the highest and
lowest deciles of the ranking variable. The long- and short-leg portfolios are equally weighted. The “average”
column reports the return spread of an equally weighted cross-country combination of the long-short spreads.
Also reported is the long-short return spread for the composite mispricing measure that averages a stock’s
ranking percentiles across anomalies. Panel A reports the estimated return spread, and Panel B reports the
corresponding t-statistics based on the heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors of White (1980).

            Alphas for Equally Weighted Anomaly Long-Short Returns
           Conditional on U.S. Long-Short Return Spreads Equal to Zero

The table reports the alphas (in percent) of the monthly return spread between the portfolios containing
stocks in the highest and lowest deciles of the ranking variable. An anomaly’s alpha in each of the five coun-
tries is estimated under the assumption that the anomaly’s true return spread in the U.S. equals zero. Under
that assumption, alpha is the estimated intercept in a regression of the spread return on the U.S. anomaly’s
abnormal return (return spread). The long- and short-leg portfolios are equally weighted. The “average”
column reports the alpha of an equally weighted cross-country combination of the long-short spreads. Also
reported is the long-short alpha for the composite mispricing measure that averages a stock’s ranking per-
centiles across anomalies. Panel A reports the estimated alphas, and Panel B reports the corresponding
t-statistics based on the heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors of White (1980).

stocks in the highest and lowest deciles of the ranking variable. An anomaly’s alpha in each of the five
countries is estimated under the assumption that the anomaly’s true alpha in the U.S. equals zero. Under
that assumption, alpha is the estimated intercept in a regression of the spread return on the country’s
market factor as well as the U.S. anomaly’s abnormal return. The long- and short-leg portfolios are value-
weighted. The “average” column reports the alpha of an equally weighted cross-country combination of the
long-short spreads. Also reported is the long-short alpha for the composite mispricing measure that averages
a stock’s ranking percentiles across anomalies. Panel A reports the estimated alphas, and Panel B reports
the corresponding t-statistics based on the heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors of White (1980).
