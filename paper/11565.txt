                                               ABSTRACT

Conventional wisdom in economic history suggests that conflict between countries can be enormously
disruptive of economic activity, especially international trade. We study the effects of war on bilateral
trade with available data extending back to 1870. Using the gravity model, we estimate the contemporaneous
and lagged effects of wars on the trade of belligerent nations and neutrals, controlling for other determinants
of trade as well as the possible effects of reverse causality. We find large and persistent impacts of
wars on trade, on national income, and on global economic welfare. We also conduct a general equilibrium
comparative statics exercise that indicates costs associated with lost trade might be at least as large
as the conventionally measured "direct" costs of war, such as lost human capital, as illustrated by case
studies of World War I and World War II.

The most successful war seldom pays for its losses. —Thomas Jefferson

I. Introduction
What are the true costs of war and how can they be measured? One might consult the records of
statesmen, the popular press, or scholarly books and journals, but approaches to this question
vary as widely as the precision of the answers. Still, most analyses have at least one thing in
common: a focus on the direct costs, traditionally measured by loss of life and the resources used
to wage war—essentially, men and materiel. To these costs, occasionally, are added costs of lost
and damaged property, although the accuracy of these figures are much more doubtful.
           In this paper we examine some major indirect costs of war over the period 1870–1997
that have never previously been examined, namely the effect of belligerent conflict on the
volume of international trade and consequently on per capita incomes and economic welfare.
Using econometric methods we find a very strong impact of war on trade volumes. Moreover
these effects have two important characteristics. First, they are persistent: even after conflicts
end, trade does not resume its pre-war level for many years, exacerbating total costs. Second,
they have a multilateral dimension: unlike the direct costs of war, which largely affect only the
belligerents, commercial losses affect neutral parties as well, meaning that wars generate a large
negative externality via trade destruction. We use these results to make general equilibrium
comparative statics estimates of the impact of World Wars I and II on global trade and income.
           Our paper is part of the renaissance of research activity on the applied economics of
international trade. A growing theoretical and empirical literature relates bilateral trade flows to
measures of joint economic activity and costs of trade. These so-called gravity models have been
utilized as benchmarks from which to assess the trade impact of economic disturbances and
policy regimes, such as exchange rate variability (e.g., Thursby and Thursby 1987), preferential
trade arrangements (e.g., Frankel, Stein, and Wei 1996), and currency unions (e.g., Rose 2000).1
           On theoretical grounds, wars and other forms of militarized conflict should affect trade
among adversaries. Military conflict between countries is often accompanied by the imposition
of partial or total trade embargoes on the exchange of goods. Conflict may also reduce trade
flows by raising the costs to private agents of engaging in international business. However, the
relation of aggregate trade to political disturbances and conflict has not received much attention
among economists. Among the few extant studies, Blomberg and Hess (2004) analyze the impact

1
    In all three cases the literature is vast; we cite only one important example in each case.

                                                              1
on trade of various forms of violence, including war and terrorism, while Martin, Mayer, and
Thoenig (forthcoming) estimate the effects of military conflicts on trade. But these analyses
focus only on the latter half of the twentieth century; our data span a much longer period
including the two great wars of the twentieth century.2
        The interaction of conflict and international trade has been the focus of much more
attention among political scientists, who have been concerned with putative reverse causation—
the effect of trade (along with other political variables) on the likelihood of conflict among
countries—as well as the impact of conflict itself on trade.3 Among papers in this literature
estimating gravity models, Pollins (1989a, b) finds that less friendly bilateral political
relationships dampen trade, Mansfield and Bronson (1997) find that wars reduce trade, and
Kesht, Pollins, and Reuveny (2004) find that conflicts, defined as militarized interstate disputes
(MIDs) dampen trade. In contrast, Morrow, Siverson, and Taberes (1998, 1999) and Mansfield
and Pevehouse (2000) find the effect of MIDs on trade is not statistically significant.4 Time-
series event studies for selected country pairs have also yielded ambiguous results; for example,
Barbieri and Levy (1999) find no evidence that war involving non-major power countries
reduces bilateral trade over time, while Anderton and Carter (2001) find that wars involving
major powers dampen trade both with other major powers as well as minor powers.
        The absence of any uniform conclusions in these studies may be attributable to
methodological differences in terms of sample characteristics. Typically they restrict their
samples to short time-series samples in the post-World War era or to “politically relevant” cases,
defined as country pairs involving one or more major powers and/or geographically contiguous
states. The rationale is to exclude country pairs that are especially unlikely or unable to engage in
conflict. While this sample restriction limits data collection needs and raises the frequency of
conflicts in the dataset, it introduces the possibility of bias in the selected sample.5 More recent

  The sample periods of Blomberg and Hess (2004) and Martin, Mayer, and Thoenig (forthcoming) span 1968–99
and 1950–2000, respectively.
3
  For literature reviews, see McMillan (1997), Barbieri and Schneider (1999), Reuveny (2000), Mansfield and
Pollins (2001), Schneider, Barbieri, and Gleditsch (2003), and the papers in Mansfield and Pollins (2003).
4
  This literature analyzes the effects of other political variables on trade as well. For example, Gowa (1994), Gowa
and Mansfield (1997), and Mansfield and Pevehouse (2000) argue that national security interests influence
commercial ties and find that alliances promote trade.
5
  Comparisons across these studies are hampered by differences in various dimensions, including the measure of
conflict and sample characteristics. For example, Pollins (1989a, 1989b) uses a continuous measure of conflict
constructed from the Conflict and Peace Data Bank (COPDAB) and a sample consisting of 25 countries over the
periods 1955–78 and 1960–75. Mansfield and Bronson (1997) analyze the effects of war using a sample of cross

                                                         2
studies using longer datasets and all available country pairs have generally concluded that
militarized disputes do reduce trade (e.g., see Russett and Oneal 2001; and Oneal, Russett, and
Berbaum 2003, where the sample period spans 1885–1992).
         Past studies suffer from several other design defects. First, most of these studies do not
take account of the possibility that war may have lagged as well as contemporaneous effects on
trade.6 If the end of a war resolves disputes and allows for exchange, trade may resume rapidly.
However, depending on the destruction of production capacity and trading capabilities, it may
take a while to exploit these opportunities. In addition, if the threat of military conflict remains,
trade may recover slowly.7 Thus, even with the end of war, trade may remain depressed for
several years thereafter, due to the costs and inconveniences of postwar reconstruction,
diplomatic tensions, explicit price or quantity controls on trade, and other forms of disruption.
How quickly and how much trade rebounds is an empirical question that should be of interest in
understanding the overall effects of conflict on trade and economic welfare. In this paper we find
that, on a present discounted basis, the costs of war in terms of lost trade are three to four times
higher when lagged effects are added to purely contemporaneous effects.
         Second, these studies do not take account of the third-country effects of bilateral
conflicts. Wars affect not only bilateral trade between belligerent parties, but also trade between
war-involved countries and neutral countries. These negative externalities of war can be
substantial. In this paper we find cases where, on a global basis, the losses to neutrals are of the
same order of magnitude as losses to belligerents.
         Third, most studies use pooled, rather than panel, estimators that may not adequately
control for omitted country- or pair-specific attributes, nor distinguish between the effects of

sections of countries with available data at five year intervals over the period 1960–90. Mansfield and Pevehouse
(2000) examine the effects of MIDs, including wars, over the period 1950–85 for country pairs that are contiguous
or included a major power, while Morrow et. al. (1998, 1999) studies the effects of threats to use force, short of
actual war, on pairs involving 7 major powers over the period 1907–1990.
6
  Martin, Mayer, and Thoenig (forthcoming) and Oneal, Russet, and Berbaum (2003) are exceptions; both estimate
gravity models with distributed lags of conflict as explanatory variables. However, the former consider only the
post-war period in their study, while the latter find that the effects of militarized disputes on trade over the period
1885–1992, are short-lived, lasting for only one or two years. This finding is the combined result of several factors:
(i) the inclusion of the effects of all MIDs, including low intensity disputes as well as war events, (ii) the omission
from the sample of all but the first years of conflict and the specific exclusion of the aftermath years of both World
Wars (1915–20 and 1940–1949), which they regard as dramatically atypical, and (iii) the inclusion of a lagged
dependent variable in the gravity equation. All of these factors work to dampen the effects of lagged conflict on
trade. Reuveny and Kang (1998) and Reuveny (2001) also estimate gravity trade equations with distributed lags of
conflict, but only for a small set of country pairs.
7
  An exception is when victorious countries choose to help rebuild the economies of the losers after war, as in the
case of the Allied treatment of Germany and Japan after World War II.

                                                          3
conflict on trade across country pairs and the effects over time. We use a gravity model with
panel data using country-pair fixed effects, so that our identification of war’s impact depends
only on the time dimension, with full control for any time-invariant pair characteristics.8
        Fourth, none of these studies compute the aggregate costs of wars due to lost trade. In a
novel comparative statics modeling exercise with the gravity model, we account for the
possibility that war may endogenously affect the level of multilateral resistance and hence the
adjustment of aggregate world trade through both trade destruction and trade diversion. This
approach allows us to compute the “general equilibrium” effects of war on trade and income.
        Our paper is organized as follows. In the next section we describe our annual dataset
covering a large number of countries over the period 1870–1997. We find that wars are relatively
rare events, yet roughly 60 percent of countries have been involved in a war at some time in our
sample period. In Section III we estimate the effect of war on international trade. We compare
bilateral trade among belligerent and neutral countries during and after conflicts (holding fixed
other factors) to estimate the contemporaneous and lagged effects of war on trade. Our results are
robust in the face of numerous perturbations to the specification and the sample, and we find that
reverse causality is statistically insignificant and quantitatively unimportant for our analysis.
        In Section IV, we use our coefficient estimates in various counterfactual experiments to
calculate the aggregate effects of conflict on world trade, particularly the costs of the two world
wars of the twentieth century. We present estimates of the welfare costs of lost trade using an
income metric (following Frankel and Romer 1999). These costs are then compared to traditional
direct costs, such as the valuation of the loss of life (following Goldin and Lewis 1975). The
costs of war due to trade disruption, although typically ignored, were large and shared by
belligerents and neutrals alike. Our estimates of the costs of lost trade due to World War I are
twice as large as the awful costs of lost human capital. For the bigger, longer, and deadlier
conflict of World War II, estimated trade costs are about equal to the estimated human costs.
Section V concludes the paper, stressing that the effects of wars on trade should not be neglected
and are an important channel through which military conflict affects income and welfare.




8
  Oneal and Russet (2001) and Green, Kim, and Yoon (2001) are exceptions, though they focus on the effect of trade
interdependence (and democratic similarity) on the likelihood of conflict among country pairs, rather than the
reverse effect of war on trade, which is the focus of this paper.

II. Methodology and Data

A. Gravity Model Methodology

The effects of war on international trade are estimated using a conventional gravity model of
international trade. This is now the benchmark empirical model for this kind of exercise and the
specification can be derived formally from a general equilibrium model of production,
consumption, and trade, as in Anderson and van Wincoop (2003).9
         For empirical purposes, we model the average level of trade between any two countries
as a function of the log distance between them, the log of the product of their GDPs, and other
control variables, as well as the current and lagged effects of countries at war:10
         ln(Tradeijt) = β0 + Σk γk Warij,t–k + Σk λk Neutralij,t–k + β1ln(YiYj)t + β2ln(YiYj/PopiPopj)t
                  + β3lnDistij + β4Langij + β5Borderij + β6Landlij + β7Islandij +β8ln(AreaiAreaj)
                  + β9CurColijt + β10EverColij + β11CurUGoldijt + εijt

where i and j denotes countries, t denotes time, and the variables are defined as:11
   Tradeijt is the average value of real bilateral trade between countries i and j at time t;
   War is a binary variable which is unity if i and j were engaged in a war against each other
    (directly or via colonial relationships) in period t–k, for k = 0, 1, …M;
   Neutral is a binary variable which is unity if either i or j is neutral while the other is engaged
    in a war against some third country in period t–k, for k = 0, 1, …M;
   Y is real GDP;
   Pop is population;
   Dist is the (great circle) distance between the capital cities of i and j;


9
   Anderson and van Wincoop presume separability between the production and consumption decisions, on the one
hand, and bilateral trade allocation, on the other, while also assuming symmetric bilateral trade barriers. An
alternative approach to deriving the gravity equation (e.g., Bergstrand, 1989; Eaton and Kortum, 2002) presumes
that these decisions are inseparable and solves for equilibrium production and consumption as well as trade.
10
   Our specification is a log linearization representation of Anderson and van Wincoop’s theoretical gravity equation
in which trade flows depend on incomes, bilateral trade barriers, and (unobserved) multilateral resistance effects. As
discussed in the text, we obtain consistent estimates of the coefficients of the trade equation through the use of fixed
effects for the multilateral resistance terms. In the comparative statics calculations in Section IV we take account of
the general equilibrium dependence of trade flows on the multilateral resistance effects by perturbing and solving
the nonlinear system of equations for trade and resistance.
11
   Our set of control variables include the “usual suspects,” following Rose (2000) and Glick and Rose (2002), but is
not meant to be exhaustive. Other studies have estimated the effects of such factors as participation in free trade
arrangements as well as membership in international governmental organizations, such as the World Trade
Organization (see Rose 2004).

                                                           5
    Lang is a binary variable which is unity if i and j have a common language;
    Border is a binary variable which is unity if i and j share a land border;
    Landl is the number of landlocked countries in the country-pair (0, 1, or 2);
    Island is the number of island nations in the pair (0, 1, or 2);
    Area is the land mass of the country;
    CurCol is a binary variable which is unity if i and j are colonies at time t or vice versa;
    EverCol is a binary variable which is unity if i ever colonized j or vice versa;
    CurUGold is a binary variable which is unity if i and j are engaged in a currency union or,
     before 1945, if they are on the gold standard at time t;
    γk, λk, βi are coefficients; and
    εijt represents the myriad other influences on bilateral trade, assumed to be well behaved.
The coefficients of main interest to us are γk and λk, which have not been studied before. In fact,
in what follows, all the other coefficients take on typical values that are consistent with the large
empirical gravity literature.
         The γk coefficients describe the impact of war on log trade levels for adversarial
belligerent-belligerent (or BB) country pairs; the λk coefficients describe the same impact on
belligerent-neutral (or BN) country pairs. The contemporaneous effect of war on trade between
countries at war with each other is captured by γ0, while the lagged effects of a war ending k
periods previously is captured by γk , k =1,…M, where M is the maximum lag length. The
coefficients λ0 and λk analogously capture the contemporaneous and lagged effects of war on
trade between belligerents and neutral countries.12
         The model is estimated with a number of techniques below to test robustness. The
coefficients of main interest to us, the γk and λk, are qualitatively similar under different
estimators. For our main conclusions we rely on the more conservative and robust fixed effects
“within” estimator, which adds a set of country-pair fixed effects (CPFE) or intercepts to the
equation and controls for omitted country characteristics that do not vary across time, including
any time-invariant component of multilateral resistance (Anderson and van Wincoop 2003,



12
   In the case of multi-year wars, the lags of war are dated from the last year of the conflict. We assume that for a
war ending at time t, if a new war occurs at time t´ > t, the values of the war variable lags of the first war are “reset”
to zero at the time the subsequent war begins, i.e., Wart–k = 0 for k ≥ t´–t.

2004). Regrettably, serious data limitations, including a severely unbalanced dataset over more
than a century, preclude the inclusion of a full set of time-varying multilateral resistance terms.

B. Dataset
The bilateral trade data were assembled from three main sources: (i) the IMF; (ii) Barbieri
(1996a); and (iii) Mitchell (1992, 1993, 1998).
        The IMF Direction of Trade (DoT) data cover bilateral trade between 217 IMF country-
code geographical units between 1948 and 1997 (with many gaps). Measures of FOB exports
and CIF imports are recorded in U.S. dollars; we deflate these data by the U.S. CPI (based to
1985). Since exports and import figures may be available from both countries, there are
potentially four measured bilateral trade flows: exports from i to j, exports from j to i, imports
into i from j, and imports into j from i. An average value of bilateral trade between a pair of
countries is created by averaging all of the four possible measures potentially available.
Observations where all four figures have a zero or missing value are dropped from the sample.13
The Barbieri (1996a) dataset contains bilateral trade data in current U.S. dollars for some 60
countries during the period 1870–1947.14 Her data typically measure bilateral trade between
countries i and j by summing imports into i from j and into j from i; we divide these figures in
half to construct an average value of bilateral trade. We again deflated using the U.S. CPI index.
We used data from Mitchell (1992, 1993, 1998) to fill missing observations among major trade
partners during the period 1870–1947 and to correct errors in Barbieri’s data. The data are
typically reported in local currency. We converted to current U.S. dollar terms using exchange
rate data and then deflated by the U.S. CPI.15 Further details are provided in the Data Appendix.
        Other standard variables were then added to estimate a gravity model; these include real
GDP, population, and various country-pair characteristics, such contiguity, distance, etc. Real
GDP and per capita GDP data (in constant 1985 dollars) for the 1948–97 period are obtained

13
   The dataset is essentially the same as that used by Glick and Rose (2002). Using the average of bilateral exports
and imports (rather than just exports) as the dependent variable in a gravity model requires some restrictions on the
theoretically grounded model, as specified by Anderson and van Wincoop (2003), for example. Specifically, trade
barriers should be symmetric across country pairs. This may be less of a problem for a large shock, such as war,
which likely affects exports and imports equally.
14
   We use version 1.1 of Barbieri’s dataset obtained from the webpage http://pss.la.psu.edu/trd_data.htm. These data
actually extend to 1992; we rely on the original source data reported by the DoT for the 1948–97 period. Note that
Barbieri reports only combined exports plus imports between countries, not exports and imports separately. This
gives another reason for expressing our dependent variable as average trade.
15
   Our results would not be affected by deflating by some other common price measure, such as the price of traded
goods, since the difference would be absorbed by the time dummies we include in our estimation.

                                                         7
from three sources. Wherever possible, data from the World Bank’s World Development
Indicators (from the 2000 CD-ROM) are used. When the WDI data are unavailable, missing
observations are filled in with comparables from the Penn World Table (PWT) Mark 5.6,
Maddison (1995), and (when all else fails) from the IMF’s International Financial Statistics.16
For the 1870–1947 period we draw primarily from Maddison (1995; 2001), supplemented by
Mitchell (1992, 1993, 1998) and individual country sources. The resulting series are then put into
constant 1985 dollars and linked to the 1948–97 series (for details see the Data Appendix.)
        The CIA’s World Factbook is used to provide a number of country-specific variables,
including latitude and longitude, land area, landlocked and island status, physically contiguous
neighbors, language, colonizers, and dates of independence.17 These data are used to create
great-circle distance and the other controls. Whenever appropriate, we make adjustments to land
area to reflect territorial changes based on historical sources.
        For the 1948–97 period we use the currency union variable constructed by Glick and
Rose (2002), defined as country pairs whose monies are either common or interchangeable at 1:1
par for an extended period of time.18 For the pre-1948 period, we set CurUGold equal to one for
counties on the gold standard, allowing for a similar currency effect, following Estevadeordal,
Frantz, and Taylor (2003), and using data on gold standard arrangements from Meissner (2005)
and Obstfeld and Taylor (2003).19
        Our measure of war is constructed from the database on militarized interstate disputes
(MID) collected by the Correlates of War Project (COW) at the University of Michigan. We use
Maoz’s dyadic dataset DYMID1.1, a revised version of the COW dataset MID2.1 compiled by
Jones, Bremer, and Singer (1996).20 This dataset codes the level of hostility reached in a given
country’s conflict with opposing state(s), where 2 = “threat of force”, 3 = “display of force”, 4 =
“use of force” (short of war, but including formal declarations of war not accompanied by
fatalities), and 5 = “war.” We code our war variable as conflicts with hostility level 5 (which


16
   Maddison calculates his historical series on GDP and GDP per capita for constant 1990 territorial areas and
borders. Whenever possible we make adjustments to GDP to take account of territorial size changes due to wars, etc.
See the Appendix for details. The IFS-based series are calculated by converting national currency GDP figures into
dollars at the current dollar exchange rate and then dividing by the U.S. CPI.

(hostility level 4, and HiAct = 20). The dataset is extended from 1992 through 1997 with
information on “Major Episodes of Political Violence, 1946–1999” from the University of
Maryland’s Center for Systemic Peace (CSP) and The Statesman’s Yearbook.21 Countries at war
with a colonial power are treated as being at war with its current colonies, i.e., if country pair i-j
are at war, and j-k are in a colonial relationship, then i-k are also assumed to be at war.22
         Table 1 presents some summary statistics on the number of observations and the
frequency of war for the full sample 1870–1997, as well as for the two subsamples 1870–1938
and 1939–97. These statistics are conditional on the availability of data on bilateral trade and
GDP, the main constraints for the inclusion of observations in our gravity model estimation. Our
full sample contains 251,902 bilateral trade observations involving 172 countries and 11,535
different country pairs. Not surprisingly, the bulk of these observations are in the later sample, as
the number of countries proliferated and more data on trade and GDP have become available.
         War is a relatively infrequent occurrence in our sample. Conditional on the availability of
contemporaneous trade and GDP data, only 75 different country-pairs with 206 country-year
observations (since a conflict involving a particular pair may last more than one year) involve
war adversaries. However, many countries at war lack contemporaneous trade and/or GDP data
while engaged in conflict. When we extend the count by including observations of (up to 10
years of) lagged war, while still conditioning on trade and GDP data availability for these years,
the number of country-pairs at war (contemporaneously or in the previous 10 years) in the
sample rises to 338. Correspondingly, the number of pair-year observations rises to 2143,
amounting to 0.85% (=2143/251902) of the total sample. While the frequency of war
observations in the pre-World War II period is somewhat higher (2.97% = 410/13799), wars are
still rare events. Still, it is worth noting that even though major conflicts are infrequent, most


21
    The COW data arbitrarily limits the length of conflict at six months for countries that declared war but did not
actually fight against their declared adversaries (e.g., in World War II various Latin American countries declared
war against the Axis powers, but did not actually send troops to the war theaters). We assume that countries
declaring war during World Wars I and II were at war until the state of war was formally revoked or the declared
adversary was deemed defeated. “HiAct” is short for “highest action in dispute.” This is an index representing the
type of conflict and supplements the 1–5 hostility level index; the higher the number, generally, the more intense the
conflict. We have cross-checked our conflict coding with version 3.0 of the COW dataset, which was released after
our dataset was assembled; no changes were deemed necessary. Extending the sample beyond 1997 would have
little effect since there have been no major wars until the U.S. actions in Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003. See
the MID codebook at http://cow2.la.psu.edu. The CSP webpage is http://members.aol.com/CSPmgm/cspframe.htm.
22
   We do not consider other forms of conflict, such as civil wars. See, for example, Bayer and Rupert (2004).

countries in the sample have been involved in war at one time or the other. Of the 172 countries,
over 60% (104) have been engaged in war sometime during our sample period.

III. Gravity-Based Estimates of the Effect of War on Trade
We now proceed to show that wars, while relatively infrequent, have had large effects on trade.

A. Benchmark Estimates
We begin by estimating our gravity equation using a country-pair fixed effect (CPFE) panel
estimator with a full set of year effects included. Robust standard errors are clustered at the
country-pair level to address potential problems of heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation in the
error terms.23
         Results are shown in Table 2, column 1. Pair and year effects are not reported. The War
dummy is allowed to enter contemporaneously and with up to ten lags (denoted War1 to War10).
The Neutral variable and its lags are initially excluded from the regressor list. Since some
traditional gravity variables like distance, shared land borders, or island status, are both time-
invariant and pair specific, they are collinear with the pair fixed effects and drop out.24 However,
they will reappear in alternative specifications that we employ for robustness checks later on.
         The model proves successful on a number of different dimensions. The model fits the
data well, explaining almost one-half of the variation in bilateral trade flows. The added control
variables are economically and statistically significant with sensible interpretations. For instance,
economically larger and richer countries trade more. A common currency encourages trade, as
does a common, ongoing colonial relationship.25
         The key variables of interest in this paper are the γk estimates of the “trade destruction”
impact of war. The CPFE “within” estimator measures γk by comparing trade for a pair of
countries at war to trade for the same pair of countries when not at war. It exploits variation over


23
   All estimation is done with Stata. Clustering at the country pair level allows the variance to differ across pairs and
permits an unstructured covariance within the clusters to control for correlation across time. Bertrand, Duflo, and
Mullainathan (2004) suggest clustering as the best way to handle autocorrelation in panel differences-in-differences
estimation, which can be viewed as a variant of fixed-effect panel estimation; this approach has been followed in
other applications of CPFE estimators to the gravity model (see, e.g., Klein and Shambaugh 2006).
24
   Note that because we adjust for changes in territory over time, the land area variable does not drop out.
25
   We follow Rose (2000, 2004) in including (log) per capita GDP as well as GDP as separate control variables.
Note the individual effects of these variables are sensitive to the estimator employed, since the two variables are
collinear in log terms. The net effect of GDP on trade, given by the sum of these two coefficients, is generally near
the theoretically expected value of unity. Dropping GDP per capita would not affect any of the salient results of our
analysis concerning the effects of wars.

                                                          10
time and answers the time series question: “What is the effect on trade (now and in the future) of
a country being at war?”
        The coefficients in Table 2, column 1, indicate that the contemporaneous and lagged
effects on trade are all negative, with statistically significant effects persisting for 8 years (at the
5% significance level). The effects are also qualitatively large. The contemporaneous effect of
war on log trade is –1.78, implying that the level of trade between two adversaries at war falls by
over 80 percent (since 1–e–1.78 ≈ .83) relative to its peacetime prewar counterfactual level, a very
large reduction.
        Once a war ends, the extent of “trade destruction” declines roughly monotonically over
time, and trade returns to its peacetime level about a decade later. Trade is still 42% below the
peacetime level five years after the cessation of war and 21% below even after eight years.26 For
lags one to five the coefficients average –.99, implying a 63% destruction of trade (1–e–.99 ≈ .63),
while for lags six to ten they average –.19, implying an 18% destruction of trade (1–e–.19 ≈ .18).
        What are the consequences of this persistence? Although they have been overlooked
hitherto, we think the persistent effects of wars on trade are quantitatively significant. For
example, using a 5% discount rate, the present discounted sum of lost trade is about 3.7 times
larger when lagged effects for years 1 through 10 are added in as compared to the
contemporaneous effect alone.
        Why is there such persistence? If the end of conflict allows commercial exchange to
resume smoothly and promptly, trade may resume rapidly, but this is not always the case. In fact,
in unreported results we find less persistence for lower intensity and shorter conflicts, where
most of the effects on trade are contemporaneous. However, for particularly destructive and
long-lasting conflicts, such as World Wars I and II—which wreaked havoc on human capital,
infrastructure, production capacity, and international cooperation—recovery evidently took much
longer. Thus, even with the end of war, trade can remain depressed for several years thereafter,
due to the costs and of postwar reconstruction, diplomatic tensions, residual price or quantity
controls on trade, and other factors that raise the variable and/or fixed costs of engaging in trade.
All of these different channels are captured in our average lagged war effects.27


26
 Since 1–e–.55 ≈ .42 and 1–e–.24 ≈ .21.
27
  One other study which does examine both the contemporaneous and lagged effects of war is that by Oneal,
Russett, and Berbaum (2003). They also find the effects of war to be persistent, but only for one or two years, much

                                                        11
B. Robustness Checks: Different Estimators
To provide sensitivity analysis, the last three columns of Table 2 report the robustness of our
results to some alternative estimators.
         In Column 2 we present a random effects panel estimator, which assumes that the
regression error terms are uncorrelated with the random country-pair specific effects. The
coefficients of interest are nearly identical to column 1.
         In Columns 3 and 4 we present estimates with individual country dummies rather than
pair dummies. This specification most closely conforms to the so-called “theoretical” gravity
model which includes multilateral resistance trade terms for each country, since it provides a
consistent estimate of “average treatment effects” for border cost variables, like war (Feenstra
2002, 2003).28 Year dummies are also included in both cases.
         For the OLS estimator, shown in Column 3, the coefficients of interest are again similar
to Column 1, and the estimated effects of war are, if anything, even larger. Our results are thus
not dependent on which choice is made between the two standard ways of including fixed effects
in a gravity model.
         In Column 4 we address the fact that in panel data for bilateral trade many pair-year cells
are typically missing or zero. This raises two questions. First, when does one treat a missing
observation as missing or impute zero? Second, how should one address the existence of
censoring at zero in estimation?
         In answer to the first question, in Column 4, we impute a zero for all pair-years where at
least one positive-valued nonmissing trade observation has been recorded in any prior year in our
dataset. This augments our sample by an additional 73942 observations.29 (The results were not
sensitive to several alternative ways of imputing, such as imputing all missing data as zeroes, or
requiring two prior observations rather than one.)


less than we find here. Their smaller estimates are not unexpected, since their sample excludes World Wars I and II
and their aftermath, and their definition of war is broader and includes less violent disputes.
28
   Feenstra (2002, 2003) shows that the (exponential of the) direct trade barrier coefficient in a gravity equation
corresponds to the geometric average (over countries i and j) of the impact of the barrier (e.g., war) on the bilateral
international trade between i and j (relative to intranational trade within these countries). The fixed effect for each
country captures the common element in its trade with all other countries, which reflects its average trade barrier
referred to as “multilateral trade resistance.” It should also be noted that the theoretical gravity model implies that
the coefficient of GDPs should be constrained to unity; in our empirical work we find that the magnitudes of the war
coefficients are robust to imposing this constraint too.
29
   Including these missing data raises the number of war observations in our dataset for adversaries at war
contemporaneously from 206 to 450 and at war with a lag as well as contemporaneously from 2143 to 2925.

                                                         12
         In answer to the second question we present results of a Poisson quasi-maximum
likelihood estimator, as suggested by Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2006).30 The coefficients of
interest are reported in Column 4; they are very similar to Column 3, and slightly larger than
Column 1.
         The last column of Table 2 reports the results of an alternative approach to controlling for
multilateral resistance effects in gravity models, proposed by Baier and Bergstrand (2006). Their
Bonus Vetus OLS (“Good Old OLS”) method involves taking a first order log-linear Taylor
expansion to approximate the multilateral resistance terms. The method yields theoretically-
motivated and observable exogenous multilateral resistance variables that can be introduced into
the estimated gravity model specification.31 In this case, the impact of war on trade is somewhat
lower than was seen in Columns 1 and 3; nevertheless the decline in trade is still quite large.32
         In sum, the results of Table 2 show that the γ estimates are reasonably insensitive to all of
these different estimators. The war effects remain: they are consistently large economically, and
statistically significant throughout.33

C. Robustness Checks: Neutrals and Different Subperiods
We next perturb the model by including the Neutral regressor and its lags, by dividing the
sample into two subperiods (1870–1938 and 1939–97), and also by isolating the effects of World
War I and World War II from other wars.34 The results are reported in Table 3, where the
benchmark country-pair fixed effect (CPFE) estimator is employed in all cases.


30
    To address the problem of missing (censored) observations, we also computed OLS estimates with a Heckman
(1976) correction (Heckit), following Linders and de Groot (2006). The results are similar. (The Heckit estimates
employ Stata’s default MLE option; the first stage equation has the same regressors as the benchmark equation,
implying identification is by functional form. The estimate of the correlation of first and second stage error terms
was –0.06.)
31
    Under the assumption that the approximation can be taken around an equilibrium with symmetric, but non-zero,
trade frictions, involves effectively demeaning the trade cost variables τ as

                                              ln τ + (1/ 2C 2 )      ln τ , where C is the number of countries.

32
   The contemporaneous coefficient estimate of –1.14, implies a decline in trade of roughly 70 percent, compared to
83 percent in the Column 1 benchmark case.
33
   The theoretically-grounded gravity model implies that the coefficients on the War variables can be used to
calculate the ad valorem tariff equivalent of war as τ war = e γ / (1-σ ) − 1 , where σ is the elasticity of substitution
between domestic and foreign goods (see Anderson and van Wincoop 2004, p. 713, equation 14). Thus, for example,
assuming σ =5 and setting γ = –2.18 (the estimated coefficient on the contemporaneous War variable reported in the
last column of Table 3) implies τ war = e -2 .18 /(1-5) − 1 = 0.72, i.e., war is equivalent to a 72% ad valorem tariff.
34
   More precisely, we isolate the effects of all wars occurring over the periods 1914–18 and 1939–45. The modified
war variable then picks up World Wars I and II, plus some simultaneous local conflicts, such as Finland-Russia.

                                                          13
        The results for the full sample are presented in Column 1. The war effects are very
similar to those in Column 1 of Table 2, and are slightly larger. In Columns 2 and 3 we can
observe that the effects of wars are negative in both sample subperiods, with the
contemporaneous effects slightly higher (in absolute value), but the lagged effects decaying more
rapidly, in the 1870–1938 period as compared to the 1939–97 period. In the first period, a
significantly negative effect of war on trade lasts only four years, compared to nine years in the
latter period. Focusing on the effects of the two World Wars alone indicates that their effects on
trade are much larger than those of other wars. Holding other variables constant, the estimated
contemporaneous coefficient for World War I of –3.29 implies a decline in trade of 96%; the
corresponding coefficient for World War II of –3.46 implies a similarly high decline in trade of
97%. In the major wars, it would appear that trade between adversaries was almost totally
destroyed.35 Further sensitivity analysis (reported in Appendix Tables A1 and A2) confirms that
the effects of other wars are smaller though still very significant, but in the counterfactual
analysis that follows we shall focus on the two great wars.
        Whilst the War coefficients measuring trade declines among adversaries are essentially
unaffected relative to the Table 2 estimates, the negative coefficients on the Neutral variables
imply that war also depresses trade between belligerents and neutrals. For the full sample, shown
in Table 3, Column 1, trade with neutrals declines by 12% (≈1–e–0.13) in wartime, and the
negative effect of war on trade for these pairs persists with a lag for up to seven years with
statistical significance. Inspection of the subperiod results reported in the other columns of Table
3 reveals the same basic pattern, though the effects on neutrals for the 1870–1938 period appears
to be small and, for the most part, statistically insignificant. Isolating the effects of World War I
and II alone shows much larger effects on trade between neutrals and belligerents. The Neutral
contemporaneous coefficient for World War I of –0.54 implies a decline in trade of 42%; the
same coefficient for World War II of –1.06 implies an even larger decline in trade of 65%.
        The results in Table 3 lead to some of the major conclusions of this paper: historically,
wars have been very damaging for world trade; major wars have been especially damaging; the
damage to trade is felt by neutrals as well as belligerents; and the damage is highly persistent.

35
   Our country-pair, country-specific, and year dummy models represent severe specifications that control for many
possible omitted variables. We do not use up degrees of freedom with a full set of time-country interactions.
Focusing on various subsamples and isolating the effects of specific wars (e.g. World Wars I and II) should further
alleviate concerns associated with omitted variable bias.

                                                        14
            The average effects for all wars are shown in Figure 1 based on the “average”
coefficients for all wars (from Column 1 of Table 3). As might seem obvious, war depresses
trade between belligerents, but we can provide an estimate of this effect and it is very large: a
decline in trade of about 80 to 90 percent. Moreover, war creates negative externalities on trade
even for neutral countries: their trade with belligerents is also adversely affected, being subject to
a decline of about 5%–12% on average, although this effect is greatly enlarged to 42%–65% in
major wars. Furthermore, both of these effects decay slowly and persist for almost ten years.
            In practice, what has this meant for the impact of wars on the world economy? Small
wars involve few belligerents but many neutrals. These are likely to have a large global effect
only if the belligerents are large countries. But the major wars in history have had catastrophic
impacts on world trade: the belligerents accounted for a large share of world trade—with
themselves and with neutrals.
            To illustrate the potential magnitude of these effects we look at the two World Wars as
case studies using our model in Section IV. Before doing so, we conduct a final robustness check
by addressing possible concerns about the endogeneity of war and trade.

D. Robustness Check: Simultaneity Concerns
The analysis till now has treated the occurrence of wars as events that are exogenous to trade.
What if trade and war are endogenously related to each other? That is, trade may depend on war,
but the occurrence of wars may depend directly on the trade interdependence between members
of a country pair.
            There is a vast political science literature that addresses the question of how the
likelihood of conflict among nations depends on various measures of economic interdependence,
including the level of bilateral trade or trade openness, in addition to various geographic and
political regime variables.36 However, the theoretical and empirical findings suggest that the
effects of trade on war are mixed. The “realist” view argues that trade may create conflict by
intensifying competition and/or increasing dependence on strategic goods. Indeed, Barbieri
(1996a, 1996b, 2002), Beck, Katz, and Tucker (1998), and Barbieri and Peters (2003) find either
a positive or negligible effect of trade on the likelihood of conflict. On the other hand, a growing
number of studies support the opposing “liberal peace” view that trade interdependence deters


36
     For a survey of the political science literature on links between trade and conflict, see the citations in footnote 3.

                                                              15
conflict and promotes peace by generating economic benefits and raising the costs of conflict.
For example, Polachek (1980, 1997), Pollins (1989a, b), Oneal, Oneal, Maoz, and Russet (1996),
Oneal and Russett (1997, 1999, 2001), Mansfield and Pevehouse (2000), Gartzke and Li (2003),
Oneal, Russett, and Berbaum (2003), all find evidence that trade reduces the incidence of
conflicts.
         Nonetheless, in our case we have reason to believe that simultaneity is not a serious
problem for our gravity model results. Before we present the evidence, we offer some intuition.
         Most of the evidence of a significant effect of conflict on trade involves cross-pair
variation in the data (“between” estimation), not within pair variation across time (“within”
estimation). The former is of no concern to us since we use country-pair fixed effects as our
preferred model, a “within” estimator. Whether a given country pair is, on average, more or less
likely to engage in war is factored out through fixed effects. Our identification of the effect of
war on trade is purely in the time dimension. Since levels of trade between countries are very
slowly varying over time (and to a large degree explained by slowly-changing or unchanging
covariates such as country size and distance), the use of trade levels to forecast the timing of war
is a priori a hopeless cause. Trade measures may tell us something about which pairs are more or
less likely to go to war; they tell us nothing about when those countries will actually go to war.37
         To establish this result, we proceed by estimating a model of the likelihood that country
pairs engage in war in the spirit of the literature. The likelihood of war is specified as a function
of bilateral trade dependence, the number of years of peace since the last war (YrsPeace), the
major power status of one or more of the pair (MajPower), joint alliance membership (Alliance),
as well as of common land borders (Border) and (log) distance:

         Warijt = α0 + α1ln(Tradeij/YiYj)t-2 + α2YrsPeaceij,t-2 + α3MajPowerij + α4Allianceijt-2
                  + α5Borderij + α6LnDistij + εijt



37
  Some papers in the political science literature use simultaneous systems methods to take account of the
interdependence between trade and conflict, e.g. Polachek (1980, 1997), Reuveny and Kang (1998), Reuveny
(2001), Keshk, Pollins, and Reuveny (2004), and Kim and Rousseau (2005). However, none control for fixed pair
effects. As is typical of this literature, these studies utilize different measures of conflict, sample definitions, and
explanatory variables, making comparisons difficult. It should be noted that Kesht, Pollins, and Reuveny (2004) and
Kim and Rousseau (2005) find conflict affects trade, but do not find evidence that trade interdependence reduces the
incidence of conflict. However, these results have been shown to be sensitive to the inclusion of additional
explanatory variables, such as distance and relative power.

                                                          16
Countries that trade more bilaterally should—if the liberal argument holds—have a lower
likelihood of war because of the opportunity cost associated with the loss of trade gains. The
expected effect of major power status is a priori ambiguous. On the one hand, major-power states
are more likely to engage in military conflict since they have wide-ranging interests that
potentially bring them into conflict with a large number of states. On the other hand, their
military capabilities may work to deter actual conflict. The likelihood of conflict should be lower
for countries participating in alliances and higher for countries that are adjacent or closer
together, since geographic proximity facilitates confrontations over such matters as land borders
and enhances the ability to bring military force to bear.38
        We measure bilateral trade dependence as the log of bilateral trade relative to the product
of the pair’s GDP levels.39 MajPower is a dummy variable = 1 if any member of the pair includes
the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Japan, or USSR/Russia. The Alliance
variable is a binary dummy based on data from the Correlates of War project, which codes three
types of alliances or pacts in order of decreasing level of commitment: 1 = defense, 2 =
nonaggression/neutrality, 3 = entente. We code Alliance = 1 whenever countries are linked by
any of these forms of pacts or alliances.40 Given the binary nature of conflict observations, the
probability of conflict among any particular country pair should also depend on how much time
has elapsed since the pair was last in conflict. To control for this temporal relation we include the
variable YrsPeace that measures the number of years since the previous war between the pair.41
Time varying variables are lagged two years to limit simultaneity issues. A full set of year
dummies are also used in our specification.

effect panel logit estimators. Standard errors robust to clustering for common country-pair

   Of course, distances between potential adversaries can be overcome to a great extent by the ability to project
power by naval and air forces.
39
   Martin, Mayer, and Thoenig (forthcoming) suggest that, although countries trading more bilaterally have a lower
probability of conflict, countries that are more open to trade overall have a higher probability of war because
multilateral trade openness decreases dependence on trade with any given country.

Management Program (EUGENE), v 2.013, available from the website: http://eugenesoftware.org. This file extends
the original COW data from 1984 to 1992. We have augmented the dataset to include missing members of the Arab

   For countries in existence in 1870 the years of peace variable begins counting from 1812 or the most recent
occurrence of war prior to 1870. Former colonies and other states newly independent after 1870 “inherit” the war
memory of their parent colonizers.

observations are provided throughout. The pooled logit results reported in the Column 1 indicate
that the likelihood of conflicts increases when country pairs are contiguous, decreases when an
alliance relation exists or a major power is involved, and decreases the longer the period of peace
between any pair of countries (the coefficients for YrsPeace are divided by 100 to improve
readability of results); these effects are all statistically significant, typically at better than 1
percent, for the full sample and the more recent subperiod. Most importantly, Table 4 indicates
that trade dependence significantly decreases the risk of war at better than 1% for the full
sample. This suggests that there may indeed be some reverse causality between the extent of
bilateral trade relations and the possibility of war.
         However, the results in Column 2 with country-pair fixed effects (CPFE) show exactly
what is driving the pooled results, and they reveal a markedly different picture of the effects of
trade on war. (Note that fixed effects exclude all country-pairs where there are no wars during
the sample—there is no within-unit variation in the regressand—and this reduces the sample size
accordingly.) The CPFE estimator indicates no effect of trade on war.42 It is also worth noting
that the years of peace variable is positive with the fixed effect estimator, implying that the
longer the period of time since a particular country pair have engaged in war, the higher the
likelihood of a future war between them. These results cast doubt about the extent to which trade
interdependence affects variations in the likelihood of conflict for any given individual country
pair. That is, the explanatory power of trade in our war equations is entirely attributable to fitting
variations across country pairs (between effects) rather than explaining variations across time for
individual pairs (within effects).43
         The remaining columns of Table 4 report the results of including other explanatory
variables commonly employed in the political science literature to explain the likelihood of
conflict. These include the level of democratization (PolityL) and relative power capabilities


42
  These results hold for 1870–38 and 1939–97 subperiod regressions as well.
43
  This is confirmed in “between effects” estimates by (i) pooled logit war regressions in which the trade dependence
ratio for each country pair is replaced by the corresponding intra-pair mean (without time averaging the other
explanatory variables) and (ii) an OLS cross-section regression of the average frequency of war across pairs on the
intra-pair mean of the trade dependence ratio as well as the time averages of all other explanatory variables. In these
regressions the differences in trade across pairs exert a significant, negative effect on the likelihood of conflict. Zorn
(2001) also distinguishes between-pair effects and within-pair effects in pooled and draws similar conclusions for a
sample of “politically relevant” pairs over the period 1950–85 (and in fact finds that the over-time effect of trade on
conflict is significantly positive). Oneal and Russet (2005) claim that trade significantly reduces conflict both across
country pairs and across time in a larger dataset spanning 1885–2001. However, the latter effect is significant in
their analysis only at a 10% level (using an appropriate two-tailed test).

(RelCap). The “democratic peace” proposition hypothesizes that countries sharing similar
democratic values are less likely to engage in war (e.g., Oneal and Russet, 1997, 1999, 2001;
Oneal, Russet, and Berbaum, 2003). Our measure of democracy is drawn from the Polity IV
dataset (Jaggers and Gurr 1995, updated by Marshall and Jaggers, 2000) which codes democracy
levels and autocracy for individual countries on a 0–10 point scale. A political regime score for
each country is constructed from its democracy score minus its autocracy score plus 10, giving a
variable that ranges from –10 for the most autocratic regime to +10 for the most democratic
regime. Following Russet and Oneal (2001), we define our democratization measure, PolityL, as
the lowest democracy score among a country pair (the “weakest link”) and hypothesize that the
probability of war declines as this variable rises.
         Realists argue that a preponderance of power deters military action (e.g., Russet and
Oneal 2001) Our measure, RelCap, is defined as the absolute value of the log difference between
country indices of military capability for based on industry, population, and military forces, as
constructed by Singer and Small (1993).44 Note that limited data availability for these variables
severely restricts the sample size usable for estimation, particularly with fixed effects.
         As shown in Table 4, greater democratization and a larger preponderance of power each
lower the likelihood of conflict (though this effect is only significant in the former case with
fixed effects and in the latter case without fixed effects). Most importantly, our earlier conclusion
about the effects of trade on the incidence of conflict is unaltered by the inclusion of these
additional variables: trade reduces the likelihood of wars in pooled regressions, but not when
fixed effects are included.
         The estimated war equation provides helpful insights as we turn back to our original
problem of estimating a trade equation. We conclude this discussion by reporting in Table 5 the
results of a panel instrumental variable gravity regression, where we now instrument for
contemporaneous war with those variables found to be useful in explaining the likelihood of war
in Table 4: the number of years since peace, major power status, alliance relationships, and
distance (in addition to all of the regressors previously seen in the gravity estimates).45

44
   We downloaded version p4v2000 of the Polity IV dataset for Political Regime Characteristic and Transitions,
1800–1999 from the website www.bsos.umd.edu/cidcm/inscr/polity at the Center for International Development and
Conflict Management, University of Maryland. Our data source for the military capability indices was the file
“Cap93.csv” from the EUGENE program. These data extend only to 1993.
45
   We only instrument for contemporaneous war, not its lags. Note that the first stage of this procedure involves
estimation of a linear probability, rather than a probit, equation for war, with fixed effects. Not surprisingly in view

                                                          19
        For comparison, in Column 1 of Table 5 we report the corresponding fixed effect (CPFE)
results when not instrumenting for war.46 Year dummies are included but are not reported in both
estimations. Without loss of generality, neutral effects are excluded. The coefficient on war is
slightly higher (in absolute value) in the results from the instrumental variable procedure (2.02
versus 1.80), but all other coefficients are virtually unchanged. Thus controlling for simultaneity
has a qualitatively insignificant effect on our analysis. A Hausman test confirms that the
differences are also statistically insignificant; the hypothesis of a systematic difference between
the two sets of results in Table 5 can be rejected at better than 1 percent.47
        In sum, our estimates of war equations imply that the level of trade interdependence may
help to answer the question of which countries engage in conflict, rather than when countries
engage in conflict. Trade does not explain much of the time series variation in war for individual
country pairs when CPFE estimation is used. Thus simultaneity does not appear to be a serious
problem for our trade equations, and hence for our estimates of the effects of war on trade.

IV. Counterfactuals for World Wars I and II
Clearly war depresses world trade both between adversaries and with neutral countries. By how
much did World Wars I and II reduce aggregate world trade? In this section we answer this
question through use of our estimated gravity equations.

A. Counterfactual Methodology
To construct a counterfactual “normal” benchmark level for trade in the absence of war, we
assume that trade for each country pair would have stayed at the same level as that in the year



of the results in Table 4, the explanatory power of these first stage regressions is poor; R-squared values are less
than .10. Other regressions (not shown) show that the result in Table 5 is robust to the inclusion of PolityL and
RelCap as additional instruments. Indeed, the war coefficient is even larger when these instruments are added.
46
   These results are slightly different from those in Column 1 of Table 2 because the sample has been constrained by
the availability of instruments.
47
   Our IV estimates do not address possible bias due to selection on observables, i.e., where the decision to go to
war is determined by particular variables that also influence trade. As an example of positive bias, if “bad”
government institutions (say, autocracy) increase the likelihood of war while also dampening commercial trade ties,
the estimated effect of war on trade may be biased up in absolute value. As an example of negative bias, a common
border should bias this effect down in absolute value since it typically raises the likelihood of war, while also
enhancing trade. The border effect is dealt with here by including the observable control in the trade “outcome”
equation (see Heckman and Hotz 1989). A different way to address this issue, outside the scope of this paper, would
be to a employ a non-parametric technique with propensity scoring in order to construct and compare the trade
levels of matched samples of grouped observations with similar characteristics, where the “treatment” group
contains countries at war and the “control” group those at peace (see Rubin and Thomas 1992).

                                                        20
before the outbreak of war (1913 for WWI, 1938 for WWII), which we denote here as year 0.48
That is, we set T radeijnormal
                         t     = T radeij 0 for all t>0 in the interval encompassing the

contemporaneous years of war and the 10-year aftermath period over which our empirical
analysis has suggested lagged effects of war may exist.
         With these imputed “normal” trade levels in the absence of war, we then employ the
gravity model to compute the comparative statics effects of war barriers in two ways. In the first
approach we use our gravity model war coefficients from Table 3 (Columns 4 and 5) to calculate
the war-induced year-by-year reduction in trade among adversaries as well as belligerent-neutral
country pairs from year to year. We can then aggregate over all country pairs and compute the
ratio of aggregate world trade in the presence of war to the counterfactual level in the absence of
war.49 Because we do not take account of possible effects on multilateral resistance terms with
this method, we refer to this as a “partial equilibrium” (PE) approach. In a second new approach,
we take into account the possibility that war may endogenously affect the level of multilateral
resistance and hence the overall adjustment of trade. Accordingly, we refer to this second method
as a “general equilibrium” (GE) approach.
         Specifically, in our partial equilibrium approach we calculate the fractional wartime
reduction in trade for each pair as:50

                                                     ⎡                                       ⎤
                                  Δ T rad eijt
                                           war
                                                     ⎢ ∑ γ k Warij,t-k + ∑ λ k Neutralij,t-k ⎥
                                                 = e⎣ k                  k                   ⎦
                                    T radeij 0




48
   We have tried other approaches to check the sensitivity of this assumption. For example, we also tried a definition
of normal that is based on the trend level of trade between the first year before the war and the 10th year after the
cessation of war (i.e., 1928 for WWI, 1955 for WWII). From these endpoints, we can linearly interpolate “normal”
bilateral trade levels for the years 1914–27 and 1939–54 for all country pairs, and use that as the counterfactual
reference level of trade in the absence of war. This made negligible difference to the subsequent calculations, so we
elected to use the constant level of trade as a simple benchmark for illustration.
49
   Note that the gravity model estimates of the effect of war on trade require that we have data for actual trade and
the regressor variables for at least some country pairs while at war. However, our counterfactual approach allows us
to include the trade effects of war even for pairs where some or all such data are missing during these war episodes.
All it requires is that actual trade data exist at the beginning of the war episodes, i.e., 1913 and 1938. By assuming
that the estimated war coefficients can be applied even to pair observations not in the underlying estimation because
of missing data, we can infer the effect of war on the trade of these pairs as well.
50
   For multi-year wars the contemporaneous effects of war for belligerents and neutrals — γ 0 , λ 0 — apply for years
t=1, …t*, where t* is the last year of the war; the lagged effects kick in for the aftermath years t*+1, … t*+10.

Δ T rad eijwar        war

computed as a weighted sum:

        Although the decomposition is only approximate, we may use this formula to isolate two
separate impacts, first, the reduction in world trade due to lost trade among the belligerents (the
BB country pairs):

And, second, the reduction in world trade due to the impact of war on belligerent-neutral trade
(among BN pairs):


                                                           ⎛ ⎡⎢∑ λk Neutralij,t-k ⎤⎥ ⎞

        In our general equilibrium approach, we still use the same gravity model parameter
coefficient estimates, but when calculating the wartime trade level relative to the base year
equilibrium, we allow the multilateral resistance terms P to change in response to the existence
of trade barriers associated with war. To do this we employ the following compact form of the
gravity equation based on the specification of Anderson and van Wincoop (2003)

            We first determine the “no war” trade equilibrium of the model in our benchmark years,
1913 or 1938. More specifically, given observations in year 0 (=1913 or 1938) of output Yi0 , and

hence world output shares θi0 , as well as of bilateral trade levels Tradeij0 , we can solve for the

equilibrium set of trade barriers τij and multilateral resistance terms Pi in the base year that

satisfy the system. We denote these equilibrium values as τij0 , Pi0o , where the superscript “o”

denotes the “no war” equilibrium.52 Calibration of the elasticity parameter σ is also required.

war. More specifically, we define the perturbed trade barriers for a given year t as

and GDP data for C countries, there are C unknown Pi and C(C-1)/2 unknown τij (since trade barriers are
symmetric, i.e. τij =τji and it is presumed that there are no internal trade barriers, i.e. τii =1 ), implying a total of C(C-
1)/2 + C unknown variables. Given C/(C-1)/2 bilateral trade equations and C equations for the multilateral resistance
effects, the total number of equations and unknowns are equal. In actuality, the trade matrix is unbalanced because
of missing observations for many trade pairs, implying the actual number of unknowns and equations is less. For
every missing Tradeij we reduce the number of τij unknowns by 1 and the number of bilateral trade equations by 1,
so that there are still an equal number of equations and unknowns. For 1913 there are 55 countries with GDP and at
least one bilateral trade observations, and a total of 392 observations. For 1938 the system consists of data for 66
countries with 750 total observations. The numerical solutions were performed with Matlab’s equation solver.

                                                                                        23
where the war and neutral effect coefficients γ k , λ k are obtained from our gravity model
estimates. 53 We impose an assumption that all other variables in the trade cost function as well
as output are constant across equilibria in this exercise, so as to isolate the direct impact of war
on trade all else equal.54 Thus we use the same set of { Yi0 } and { θi0 } as in the base year 0 along

            We denote these counterfactual levels as T rad e ijt , Pitw ar .55 The resulting calculations

allow us to compute the counterfactual trade losses for each year t relative to the base year
equilibrium levels, T rad e iojt . As in the partial equilibrium exercise, we can also sum up to

compute the aggregate trade loss across all pairs, or subsets of pairs, at each point in time.56

B. World War I and II Trade Losses
Figures 2 and 3 present the results of these partial equilibrium and general equilibrium exercises
for World War I and World War II, respectively, with the impact on total world trade shown.
The general equilibrium results use a calibrated value of σ = 5 , as in Anderson and van Wincoop
(2003). Our calculations are based on coefficients estimated from the average effects of all wars
in the sample, reported in last two columns of Table 3, which reflect the estimated effects of
World War I and II alone. These are the correct parameters to use if the great wars were more
destructive of trade than other wars, a hypothesis for which we have found support.57


53
  Note that the coefficients from the gravity estimates are divided by 1 -σ because the latter enters as an exponent
of τ ij in the bilateral trade equations. Since γ k <0, λ k < 0 , 1 -σ <0 , trade barriers rise when the war (and/or neutral)
dummies are “on”, i.e. when Warjj,t-k = 1.
54
   Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) also take account of the valuation effects of changes in Pi on income shares,
but they find this effect to be small in their comparative statics when eliminating all trade barriers. Since we find that
the difference between partial and general equilibrium effects of war is relatively small, we assume that this
additional effect is second order in our model and can be neglected.

                                                                         (             ) (τ          (                   ))

   The partial equilibrium exercise essentially is equivalent to perturbing the trade barriers relative to period 0, but
holding the resistance terms Pi constant.
57
   The very destructive impacts of the great wars is apparent in columns 4 and 5 of Table 5, but the decline in trade
would have been only a little smaller had we used the more conservative coefficients in the first column of Table 5,
based on all wars.

                                                                              24
         Panel (a) shows the total destructive impact on world trade of war from the war-related
trade frictions captured by our γk and λk coefficients. We can also examine an approximate
decomposition of these impacts, as noted above. Panel (b) shows the impact of war on world
trade (for all pairs) resulting from just the war-related trade frictions γk between BB (belligerent-
belligerent) country pairs. Panel (c) shows the impact of war on world trade (for all pairs)
resulting from the war-related trade frictions λk between BN (belligerent-neutral and) pairs. In
the case of the general equilibrium calculations, these decompositions include the impact of
changing multilateral resistance felt by all country pairs, including not just the BB and BN pairs,
but also the belligerent-ally (BA) and neutral-neutral (NN) pairs. As expected, the general
equilibrium decline of trade is always lower than when considering partial equilibrium effects
alone.
         In Figures 2 and 3, a ratio less than unity implies that trade in the presence of war is less
than the (imputed) trade in the absence of war.58 We may note that the effects are, of course,
smaller than those shown in Figure 1 since not every pair consisted of two adversaries (or a
belligerent and a neutral). Referring to the general equilibrium effects, Figures 2 and 3 show that:
     o In the case of WWI, war among adversaries reduced world trade by roughly 14% in
         1914-15 and almost 18% in 1916–18; the effects then dampen monotonically. The impact
         on neutrals reduced world trade by an additional 10%–15% in the period 1914–18.
     o In the case of WWII, war among adversaries reduced world trade by 15% in 1941 and by
         almost 20% in 1945, as more countries entered the war. The impact on neutrals accounts
         for a fall off in trade of an additional 35%–40% during 1939–41; this effect then decays
         as the United States and other countries shift from neutral to belligerent status.
On the face of it these effects are potentially very large in terms of implied costs for the world as
a whole, and even more so for the countries concerned. Cumulating a 50% loss of trade over a 5-
year to 7-year wartime period, followed by a gradual recovery over the next 10 years, represents
a significant and persistent economic burden. But this is somewhat conjectural: lost trade isn’t
lost output. So we now attempt to measure the latter.




58
  Note that the ratio of trade in the presence of war to counterfactual trade in the absence of war is unity by
construction in the years before and after the intervals 1914–1927 and 1939–1954.

V. Tallying the Costs of War
Although we find evidence suggestive of large economic losses via lost trade, we cannot easily
attach a welfare measure to these losses. Moreover, it may be thought that these losses would
pale in comparison to the horrific losses of life that are included in the traditional direct costs of
war. In the major conflicts, when millions perished, or even in the minor ones, we hesitate to
place a pecuniary value on even one lost “statistical” life. Can millions of dollars of lost trade
really be compared on a balance sheet with millions of dead and wounded?
        Nonetheless, to make any comparison among the different costs of war, such a cold
calculus is unfortunately necessary. That said, we proceed to draw on the ideas of Goldin and
Lewis (1975) who made pioneering comparisons between the cost of waging the American Civil
War and the cost of alternative counterfactual schemes for settling the North-South conflict (e.g.,
buying out the slaves). In the Goldin and Lewis approach to valuing lost human capital, the cost
of a life lost in the war was valued at the prevailing average real wage, and the cost of a wounded
individual at one half of this wage. Such losses could then be amortized at some discount rate to
convert the annual lost wages every year (a flow) to a one-time cost (a stock).59

A. The Costs of World War I
Table 6 presents rough calculations of the costs of World War I on this basis, using the best
estimates for dead and wounded, proxy real wage levels based on Maddison’s internationally
comparable estimates of GDP per capita, and parameter assumptions for labor’s share of output
(including human capital) and the share of the population in the workforce. Specifically, we
assumed that the share of output earned by labor and human capital was two thirds (cf. Mankiw,
Romer, and Weil 1992), and the labor force was one half of total population (the rough 1910
average in the sample of Taylor and Williamson 1997). In this case, the percentage loss of output
would be exactly equal to 4/3 (2/3 divided by 1/2) times the percentage dead-equivalent
population loss, if all dead are assumed to be of working age.60
        As the table reports, at war’s end there were 8.6 million dead and 5.4 million wounded,
for a total of 16.3 million dead-equivalent lost. The losses were unevenly spread. For the Central
Powers, Germany and Austria-Hungary accounted for almost half of these losses, 7 million dead

59
   We can also compare the results of our calculations with other costs of war, such as government spending
necessary to engage in war as well as the value of property losses, although the data are fragmentary. See below.
60
   To a first approximation, the percentage loss of output would equal the “labor plus human capital” share (2/3)
times the percentage loss of workforce, which would in turn be twice the percentage loss of population.

                                                       26
equivalent. Among the Allies, France bore a heavy cost with 2.5 million, with Britain losing 1.5
million and Italy 1 million. However, judged with an eye to the scales of different countries,
whether population or GDP, the relative costs looked rather different. Tiny New Zealand lost 37
thousand (of 1.1 million) by the dead-equivalent measure; populous India lost 83 thousand (of
304 million).
           Applying the Goldin-Lewis metric, we find that the costs, measured as permanent
equivalent flow losses to GDP, were highest on the losing side. Germany (8.5%) and Austria-
Hungary (7.5%). Alternate, disputed death counts would also assign Turkey a large cost (see the
notes to the Table). France (8.0%) bore a heavy burden, while the other Allies’ costs were
somewhat lower: Britain (4.4%) and Italy (3.8%). On a proportional basis, three U.K. dominions
also paid heavily: New Zealand (4.4%), Australia (3.7%) and Canada (2.3%). Bulgaria (4.9%),
Serbia (4.9%), and Rumania (5.6%) witnessed large human costs on a GDP basis as well. In
contrast, India’s massive economy barely registered a change, and the United States was also
little affected. Summing over all these belligerents, we find a total flow cost to world GDP of
3.4%. It is important to note that this cost was a significant burden for the world as well as for
the belligerent countries; since they comprised approximately 73% of world GDP, the direct
human costs as a fraction of total world GDP amounted to around 2.5% of world GDP.61 Absent
demographic data for the war dead, we treat these flow costs as permanent as a first
approximation, since most of the combatants were young soldiers with their whole adult working
life before them, and the discounted value of their flow incomes 30 years or more into the future
are of second order importance for this type of calculation.
           Now let us try to compare these direct human costs of WWI with the indirect costs
arising from trade destruction using the estimates from our model. From the discussion in
Section IV, there is reason to believe that the trade-related costs of war are substantial. As
discussed earlier, Figure 2a shows the predicted size of “lost trade” during and after the war
relative to a counterfactual “no war” scenario where trade levels are assumed to persist at their
1913 benchmark levels. Total trade falls by approximately 30% during each of the 5 wartime
years relative to the benchmark. Figure 2b, attributes roughly half of the decline to war-related
trade frictions arising from BB (belligerent-belligerent) country pairs; Figure 2c, attributes the
remainder to the effects of the BN (belligerent-neutral) country pairs. In each case, the model

61
     Maddison’s estimate of World GDP for his sample of 56 countries in 1913 is $2,554,075 (in 1990 US$).

                                                         27
suggests that trade then recovered gradually over the next 10 years, before returning to its
“normal” peacetime level.
        Using the calculations underlying these figures for each country pair and year we can
compute the trade decline for any country or set of countries as a result of war and its lagged
effects, for both our partial and general equilibrium exercises. Still, lost trade is not lost income
(nor lost welfare). So these loss figures are not comparable to the direct war cost measures. Can
we convert lost trade into a lost output equivalent?
        One way to impute the implied loss of income is by using the Frankel and Romer (1999)
estimates of the partial derivative of income (or growth) with respect to trade (e.g, as in Frankel
and Rose 2002). In our notation, their basic cross-country regression model of the level of output
per capita (Y/N) takes the form:


                              ⎛Y⎞         ⎛ Trk
                                              a de ⎞
                           ln ⎜ ⎟ = α+ 2δ ⎜        ⎟ + θX i + ηi ,
                              ⎝ N ⎠i      ⎝ Y ⎠i
                                                    k / Y is the exogenous component of the
where X is a vector of other control variables and Trade
country’s trade share, which is constructed from an underlying first-stage gravity model using
distance and other geographic variables as exogenous explanatory regressors.62 This two-stage or
instrumental variable (IV) approach allows the authors to control for the endogeneity of trade in
these regressions, for without this step the OLS estimates of the coefficients are biased. The
coefficient of interest to us is δ, the slope of the output-trade relationship. Frankel and Romer
(1999, Table 3, column 2) give an IV estimate of δ = 1.97 for the trade share. We made this
calibration choice because the value of 1.97 is the authors’ preferred central estimate; but we
should note that the above expressions show that national or global costs are simply linear in the
coefficient δ, so we can quickly and easily obtain revised cost estimates under plausible
alternative assumptions about the coefficient δ, and we shall discuss such perturbations below.
        The Frankel-Romer (FR) specification is ideally suited for our purposes since, at least
with respect to the model used here, we may reasonably treat war as exogenous. Though the
distance between a pair of countries never changes, the state of belligerency may fluctuate. Thus,
δ is the correct parameter to use in our study to capture the impact of exogenous declines in

62
   In our notation Trade is defined as the average of exports and imports. For Frankel and Romer, it is the sum. For
this reason, using our definition, a factor of 2 must be added to the trade share coefficient.

                                                        28
openness, or trade share, such as would be caused by wars. We should note that this formulation
of the counterfactual impact deliberately holds fixed output levels in every country, thus avoiding
the question as to whether war creates a boost or a drag on the domestic economy of the
belligerent, an effect that would also show up in the gravity equation but which we do not seek to
estimate. Our focus on the trade channel allows us to finesse the issue, which is just as well given
the scarce data on real output during wars.63
         We proceed to assess the permanent income loss due to war and its aftermath relative to
an assumed counterfactual constant baseline level of trade corresponding to the actual trade
observed in period t = 0 prior to the start of war, here 1913. We can estimate the fractional loss
of income in country i at time t > 0 using a linear approximation implied by the Frankel-Romer
estimated equation:

                                                                                          ⎞ ⎛ T radeij0 ⎞

Here, as we defined it above, Δ T radeijwar
                                         t  is the estimated change in trade for the pair at time t

under wartime conditions relative to T radeij 0 , which is the assumed “normal” peacetime trade

level in all years (1913 for World War I). As we have discussed, the simulation also keeps GDP
levels at their peacetime constant level (Yi0) to isolate the trade-destruction channel.
         Denoting the set of all countries in the world as C, we next sum these GDP losses over
pairs (i ,j) for various (possibly time-varying) subsets of country pairs Vt ⊆ C × C and calculate
their present value cost

63
  This is not to say such effects are negligible. The magnitude of endogenous GDP shocks is the subject of
considerable controversy in a parallel literature; recent research suggests they might also be quite large (Hess 2003).

                                                           29
       In practice, we implement this cost calculation for various definitions of Vt, to capture the
breakdown of all costs across five mutually disjoint country-pair subsets:
      i. costs to belligerents from lost trade with belligerent adversaries (ij = BB pairs);
     ii. costs to belligerents from lost trade with allies (ij = BA pairs);
    iii. costs to belligerents from lost trade with neutral (ij = BN pairs);
     iv. costs to neutrals from lost trade with belligerents (ij = NB pairs);
     v. costs to neutrals from lost trade with neutrals (ij = NN pairs);
Some observations are required on this cost decomposition. Here ij = BA means a pair where i
and j are in a war as belligerents, but they are on the same (i.e. “A” for allied) side. We note that
in the partial equilibrium exercises, subsets (ii) and (v) are both zero, by assumption (we did
estimate ally effects separately but, in results not reported, we found them to be small and not
very statistically significant). However, in a general equilibrium calculation, all five costs can be
nonzero due to changing multilateral resistance.
       The base year (1913 or 1938) levels of trade and GDP used in these calculations presume
that the composition of the five country-pair subsets is fixed, with the status of a country as a
belligerent determined by whether it was ever at war during the conflict period (1914–18 or
1939–45). If all belligerent countries are involved in war for the entire conflict period (and do
not switch sides) the country-pair subsets would stay fixed over time, since no country ever
switches status between being neutral and belligerent (or vice versa). In actuality, some countries
become belligerents later in the conflict period (e.g. the United States entered WWI in 1917 and
WWII in 1941), while other countries ceased being belligerents before the overall conflict ends
(e.g. Russia exited WWI in 1917). This does not affect the calculation of total world trade losses,
but it does affect the decomposition of losses into the various subsets (BB, BN, BA, NB, NN);
hence year-by-year adjustments must be made to deal with these changing composition effects of
countries entering or leaving a war over time. As an example, the U.S. was neutral with respect
to Germany during the years 1914–16, but an adversary of Germany during the years 1917–18.
With a fixed composition, all changes in bilateral trade changes between the U.S. and Germany
would be allocated to the BB pair set; in our adjustments we allocate the trade changes for the




                                                 30
years 1914–16 to the BN and NB subsets. Similar adjustments are made for all countries which
change status (between belligerent and neutral) during the conflict period.64
         Table 7 reports the results of this exercise, applied to World War I, for both partial and
general equilibrium approaches. Trade losses are shown on a present discounted basis relative to
total world trade in 1913; GDP losses are shown on a present discounted basis relative to the
total GDP for the country group (see column label) in 1913. Trade impacts are based on the
gravity model in Table 3, column 4. GDP impacts are based on the Frankel-Romer regression
estimate of the impact of trade on GDP level. Present value costs are computed using an annual
discount factor of β = 0.95.65
         In WWI the belligerent nations accounted for about half of world population, three-
quarters of world GDP, and 80% of world trade. According to our general equilibrium estimation
method, both belligerents and neutrals suffered large economic impacts. To be conservative, we
focus our discussion on the general equilibrium results (partial equilibrium results are slightly
larger, as expected).



64
   More specifically, to account for changing composition effects on trade we first generate year-by-year trade
change results assuming both war and neutral trade barriers exist (i.e. the belligerent-belligerent and belligerent-
neutral war dummies are “on”). We then allocate these trade changes across the fixed composition of the five
country-pair subsets (BB, BA, BN, NB, and NN) based on whether countries were ever at war (where it should be
noted that changes in BA and NN trade occur only because of general equilibrium effects on multilateral resistance).
Second, we generate trade loss results assuming neutral trade barriers alone are in effect (i.e. only belligerent-neutral
war dummies are “on”). In the absence of any composition effects from the beginning of the war, there should be no
effect of these neutral barriers on trade for BB and BA pairs (aside from general equilibrium effects). Hence, any
trade changes in a given year found for BB or BA pairs in this second calculation necessarily reflect trade effects for
pairs in which one or both countries were neutral at that time, though they were belligerents before or after. As
discussed in the text, for example, the U.S. was neutral with respect to Germany and the U.K. during 1914–16, and
an adversary of Germany and an ally of the U.K. during 1917–18. Thus the trade change in response to neutral-
belligerent war barriers during 1914–16 for the U.S. and Germany ( Δ T rade neut         ral
                                                                                      US-GE ) and the U.S. and U.K.

( Δ T radeneutral
           US -UK ) capture BN/NB pair effects, while the trade change during 1917–18 for the U.S. and U.K. capture a
BA pair effect. We use the results from this second round of calculations (with only neutral barriers in place) to
adjust the trade loss changes for our fixed composition when both war and neutral barriers are in place. Thus, for
example, in the case of U.S. and Germany for 1914–16, we subtract the neutral-barrier change ( Δ T rade neut  ral
                                                                                                           US-GE ) from
the trade changes for the BB set and add it to the change for the BN/NB sets. In the case of U.S. and U.K. trade, we
add the neutral barrier change ( Δ T radeneutral
                                          US -UK ) to the BN and NB sets for 1914–16 and to the BA set for 1917–18.
65
   We scale the trade losses by world trade, and not country groups, since the calculations for some country
groups—e.g., BN and NN—are very sensitive to the country group trade totals used in the denominator. It was not
clear how to measure group totals in the base year when some countries (like the U.S.) switched from neutral to
belligerent/ally over time in the two world wars. To avoid this problem, we use total world trade in the base year in
the denominator. This has the added advantage of permitting the summing of effects across different groups without
any need for weighted sums. However, we scale GDP losses relative to group totals because the human costs are
normally computed this way, i.e., relative to country group GDP.

                                                          31
        Table 7 shows that lost trade was greatest among belligerents, as expected, leading to a
permanent flow loss of 2.60% of their GDP (cell d). The decline in trade involving neutrals
caused a further income loss of 0.89% of GDP (cell g). There was of course some “trade
diversion” in general equilibrium, as would be expected. The presence of war barriers between
BB and BN pairs also lowers multilateral resistance between BA and NN pairs in general
equilibrium. But these effects turn out to be rather small. Belligerents losses on BB and BN trade
were offset by a very small gain on BA trade of just –0.12% (cell j). The total flow loss to
belligerents was 3.37% relative to the belligerents’ own GDP (cell m).
        Neutrals suffered greatly due to the collapse of trade with belligerents, but this was a
large share of their own trade, explaining the substantial flow cost for them of 7.22% of their
GDP (cell e). The offset due to trade diversion between neutrals was paltry, a flow gain of only
0.43% of GDP (cell h). The net cost to neutrals was thus a massive 6.79% on a flow basis
relative to the neutrals’ own GDP (cell n).
        Summing up over all countries, the estimated cost to the world as a whole was 4.35% of
world GDP on a permanent flow basis (cell o).66
        On first sight it may seem odd that the small estimated impacts on neutrals seen in Figure
1 can generate such relatively large losses for neutrals compared to belligerents, but this follows
from two facts. First, not every pair of belligerents was an adversarial pair. Second, many
belligerents were large countries (in GDP terms) whilst most neutrals were small countries, and
(in peacetime) had a large fraction of their trade with belligerents, as the gravity model would
predict. The same absolute (real) bilateral trade loss shared by any two trading partners must
weigh more heavily on the smaller country in the pair, since it will dent that country’s trade to
GDP ratio much more, and hence have a bigger proportional impact on output via the Frankel-
Romer specification.
        One possible concern is whether the results would be robust if we used the FR model to
estimate the effect of lost trade on GDP growth rates, rather than GDP levels as above. We found

66
   The weighted sum of belligerent and neutral GDP losses is computed using Maddison 1913 GDP weights, as
reported at the top of the table. The belligerents’ weight is 71% ($1945.840/$2726.065) and the weight of the
neutrals is 29%. In our counterfactuals the implicit weight on belligerent GDP is higher, at 89%, since we have GDP
data for many fewer neutrals countries than are included in Maddison’s world total (which includes many
guesstimates). We prefer to use the Maddison weights here because they probably more accurately reflect the true
weights of each country group. Use of his 71% weight is also desirable because it is conservative for our purposes
and imparts a downward bias to our bottom line estimate; shifting to an 89% weight on belligerents would increase
our estimated world losses as it would put a greater weight on the larger percentage losses suffered by belligerents.

                                                        32
that our method was robust. As a test, we used the “all war” coefficients is Table 3, column 1,
and computed the implied costs of a hypothetical war two ways: first, using the above FR
estimate of δ = 1.97 for the impact of trade/GDP ratios on output levels; second, using the FR
estimate of δ = 1.31 for the impact of trade/GDP ratios on output growth rates (Frankel and
Romer 1999, Table 4, column 10). Figure 4 assumes, for simplicity, a peacetime growth rate of
2% per annum, a discount rate of 5%, a trade share of 10% of GDP divided equally among allies,
adversaries, and neutrals, and an initial income level of 1 in period 1 (shown as 100%). The
losses are computed using the partial equilibrium method. Using the example of a five-year war
(comparable to a major war like WWI) we find that the FR model in levels delivers a transitory
loss to output that is fully reversed after 10 years of peace. The model in growth rates delivers a
much smaller loss, but one that is permanent. It so happens that both trajectories deliver a loss of
output of about 2.5% in present discounted value. Thus, by coincidence, the exact form of the FR
model does not appear to matter for our welfare cost estimates.
       Compared to the human costs, also shown in Table 7, the economic costs of lost trade
were large. As a group, belligerents imposed a human cost on each other equal to 1.90% of lost
population, or 3.41% of lost GDP (the GDP impact is larger due to composition effects: among
belligerents, it was the richer countries that had higher casualties in WWI). Moreover, there were
no global negative externalities in that human costs were essentially zero for neutrals. The total
cost to the world as a whole, arising from the belligerents’ casualties, was a flow cost of 2.43%
of GDP—considerably smaller than the 4.35% attributed to lost trade. Under these assumptions
and metrics, the striking conclusion is that the costs of lost trade due to WWI were somewhat
higher than the horrible costs of lost human capital.

B. The Costs of World War II
We should not expect the same conclusion for World War II, which was a very different type of
war. World War I and previous wars were confined essentially to battle zones, with little
attention given to civilians as targets. World War II was the first high-technology “total war” on
a global scale, involving much larger losses of life, greater suffering among civilians, and much
more widespread and devastating losses of economic assets (particularly physical capital).
Compared to the first war, the second was a third longer in duration, encompassed about twice as
many belligerent countries, touched 4 continents instead of 1, and mobilized 110 versus 70



                                                33
million people into the armed services (Nesterov 1990). We should therefore expect all of its
attendant direct costs to have been that much higher.
       On the other hand, there is reason to question the magnitude of the indirect costs through
damage to world trade. After all, there was much less trade at the beginning of World War II.
Following World War I and the Great Depression, economic isolationism was rampant. By the
late 1930s tariffs and quotas had become widespread. In addition, transport costs had risen
significantly in the 1920s and 1930s, and the disintegration of the gold standard had also had a
significant impact on trade volumes. Compared to the low barriers and low costs of trade in
1913, the world of 1938 was much closer to autarky. Relative to world GDP, trade volumes were
about one half what they had been in 1913, and close to their 1870 levels (Estevadeordal, Frantz,
and Taylor 2003).
       These concerns notwithstanding, we press ahead and repeat the exercises of Figure 2,
Table 6, and Table 7 for World War II. The results are shown in Figure 3 and in Tables 8 and 9.
As noted earlier, Figure 3 is qualitatively very similar to Figure 2, although the trade losses are
noticeably larger in World War II. Losses mount up a little more slowly in 1939–41 for
adversaries, as the belligerency slowly spreads to include the European Lowland countries and
Italy in 1940 and the United States and Japan at the very end of 1941. Figure 3b shows that
during the war about 10%–20% of world trade was destroyed by the belligerent-belligerent (BB)
pairs; but Figure 3c shows that a further 25%–40% was destroyed by belligerent-neutral (BN)
pairs, which provides a graphic illustration of the importance of the negative externality effect.
Total trade destruction in Figure 3a was about 40%–50% overall in the wartime years, with some
evening out due to the change from neutral to belligerent status by some major trading nations,
notably the United States. Trade then recovers over the subsequent decade after 1945.
       Table 8 shows human costs, and now includes estimates of civilian casualties in the
baseline figures, since World War II involved so many killed and injured noncombatants. We
should interpret these figures cautiously, as the labor content of the civilian casualties was
probably less than that of military casualties, implying our methodology will exaggerate
somewhat the value of civilian losses. Given the margins of error on the casualty data, however,
this need not cause undue anxiety. The total dead equivalent amounted to 79.5 million by our
measure, where some missing data were imputed using the plausible assumption of a stable
wounded/dead ratio (Appendix Table A3 supplies the details). Without imputation, the figure


                                                34
falls to 46.2 million (penultimate row, Table 8), and military casualties amount to about half the
total, 34.7 million (final row).
        Losses for individual countries, on a population or GDP basis, are not surprising. The
U.S.S.R with 31.5 million dead equivalent tops the list with a 24.8% GDP flow loss, closely
followed by Yugoslavia (22.6%) and Poland (23.5%). Germany also suffered large losses
(16.7%), as did Hungary (10.5%). Japan lost about 8% and its adversary China 5% (but populous
China suffered an absolute loss of 19.7 million dead, compared to Japan’s 4.4 million). Occupied
France lost 3.3%, Belgium 2.4%, and Netherlands 5.5%, but Denmark only 0.2% and Norway
0.8%. Britain’s loss was 1.7%, less than New Zealand on a proportional basis. The United States
lost 0.7% by this measure. The loss for all belligerents, as a group, was 6.6% of GDP using the
full (imputed) dataset, 4.9% without imputed data, and 3.6% for military casualties only. The
latter figure may be compared with the 3.4% figure for World War I from Table 6, suggesting
that it was the spread of total war off the battlefield and into civilian life that seriously escalated
the level of damage to human capital in the second war.
        Using the same approach as in Table 7, Table 9 compares human costs to trade costs for
World War II. Trade losses are shown relative to total world trade in 1938; GDP losses are
relative to total GDP for the country group (see column label) in 1938. Trade impacts are now
based on the gravity model in Table 3, column 5. Computing human loss relative to world GDP,
not just belligerents’ GDP, leaves a bottom line figure of 5.43% on a permanent flow basis. If we
think the civilian component is overstated (due to its smaller labor share), the true figure might
be between 4% and 5%. Trade costs appear at the foot of the table and are much smaller, as
expected. Adversaries cost each other 1.45% of GDP (cell d) and also paid a further 1.11% due
to trade lost with neutrals (cell g). A small gain due to trade diversion with allies of 0.03% (cell
j) leaves a total loss to the belligerents of 2.53% of their own GDP (cell m). Neutrals suffered a
loss in trade that we value at 11.80% of their own GDP on a flow basis (cell n), a very large loss.
Again, as in World War I, neutrals were heavily hit because the countries that went to war were
large, the neutrals were small and open, and belligerents accounted for a large share of neutrals’
trade. Computing the weighted sum of these figures, we find an overall loss of 4.16% of world
GDP for the permanent flow costs of World War II, a similar magnitude to the human costs.
        These results, as compared with those for World War I, make sense. On a human level,
World War II was about twice as costly (5.43% in Table 9 versus 2.43% in Table 7) simply


                                                  35
because it was bigger, longer, and deadlier. With respect to the costs of trade destruction, World
War II was comparable to World War I (4.16% in Table 9 versus 4.35% in Table 7). There are
some offsetting effects at work here. On the one hand, more nations and a greater share of the
world’s GDP were caught up in World War II, and the estimated coefficients in Table 3 suggest
that the trade destruction was greater. On the other hand, overall world trade in the base year of
1938 (relative to GDP) had shrunk to about half its 1913 level.

C. What About Other Costs of War?
Of course, the value of lost human life is not the only cost of war. Total costs, though difficult to
calculate, must also take account of the destruction of physical capital, excess military spending,
looting, and many other types of loss. Yet even for wars that have been as meticulously studied
as World Wars I and II, such estimates are still very rough and subject to considerable
disagreement in the literature. Nonetheless, we now compare our trade related costs to the
available figures, subject to this caveat, and we will argue that the trade-related costs still look
quite large, and clearly so for World War I.
       One of the most comprehensive studies of the total costs of World War I remains that of
Bogart (1920), although it has been subject to recent criticism from Broadberry and Harrison
(2005). The latter object to Bogart’s calculation of human costs and prefer to use a “replacement
cost” approach to figuring human capital losses. However, this tends to produce a small figure
for human costs (much smaller than ours above) since the latter authors do not capture lost utility
but only child rearing costs; the true cost is probably also underestimated since the gestation
period for human capital (about 18 years) is much longer than that needed to build or purchase
and install a piece of physical capital, and an appropriate discount factor should be added. Since
we have already computed our own human costs above, using a broader utility type measure, we
avoid these problems. We capture the lost “consumer surplus” that would have been achieved by
the casualties. We also avoid the potential objection that we have biased the result in our favor
(of finding a relatively high trade-related cost) by using a human capital measure that looks “too
small.” Instead we focus on Bogart’s other measures of war costs. Granted, these too attract
objections from Broadberry and Harrison (2005), mainly due to a failure to correct for wartime
inflation, since Bogart computes nominal rather than real sums. But for our purposes, this gives
the right bias—if Bogart’s costs are too high and our trade costs still look significant in
comparison, then they would look even bigger compared to inflation-adjusted costs.

                                                 36
        According to Bogart, what he calls the “direct” costs of World War I (excess government
spending necessary to wage war) were $186 billion in 1913 prices (Broadberry and Harrison
2005, Table 8). Excluding lost human capital, he found the “indirect” costs (property losses, etc.)
were $84 billion. These are cumulative flows, or stock measures. For comparison we found the
trade-related costs of World War I were 4.35% of world GDP on a flow basis, which equates to a
stock value of $177 billion in 1913 prices. Our estimates of human costs were similarly $99
billion.67 Adding these four figures we obtain a grand total of $546 billion, of which trade-related
costs made up 32%. Thus, including the impact of lost trade would augment standard measures
of the total costs of World War I by almost 50%—a significant correction, we think.
        It would be desirable to be able to replicate these calculations with at least the same
(albeit limited) degree of confidence for World War II, but for the second war the extant figures
appear even more fragile and subject to wider suspicion. Broadberry and Harrison (2005, Table
13) report an attempt by Nesterov (1990) to apply an approach similar to Bogart. He estimated
direct losses at $1,433 billion in 1938 prices, and indirect losses (including not only property but
also lost human capital, not tabulated separately) at $2,567 billion, for a total of $4,000 billion (a
surprisingly round number). In these same units, we would calculate the stock value of the trade-
related costs of World War II at just $361 billion in 1938 prices, so that trade costs add less than
10% to the war’s estimated total cost.68 These provisional calculations caution that although our
measures of trade costs are similar in the two wars, there are probably many other significant
costs to be reckoned with in the massive conflagration of 1939–45.

D. Sensitivity Analysis
Our results suggest that the trade-related costs of war are of the same order of magnitude as the
“traditional” costs of war measured in terms of human capital lost through deaths and injury. Is
this finding robust? We think the link from war to trade is consistently large and of the
magnitude shown, given our extensive robustness checks. The link from trade losses to GDP
losses depends on our use of the Frankel and Romer (1999, Table 3) IV estimate of δ of 1.97
(s.e. = 0.99), the baseline coefficient we used to convert lost trade to lost income.


67
   World GDP of $2,726 billion in 1990 was deflated to 1913 dollars using a US CPI of 10/133.8; the resulting flow
costs for trade and human losses were multiplied by 20 to convert a flow to a stock assuming a 5% discount rate.
68
   Based on 1.54% of world GDP in 1938, using a U.S. CPI correction of 14/133.8 and again multiplying by 20 to
convert the flow to a stock assuming a 5% discount rate.

                                                       37
        A wide range of values of the FR coefficient δ appear in the literature, and alternative
values would alter our conclusion in a simple, proportional way, given that our costs are
proportional to δ. For example, if we switch from the FR full sample of 150 countries to a
subsample of 98 countries with potentially more robust data (see FR, Table 3, column 4), then
the IV estimate is less precise, but it is also much larger, rising by 50% to 2.96 (s.e. = 1.49). An
alternative to the 1985 FR cross-section analysis is the historical study by Irwin and Terviö
(2002), which found similar δ coefficient magnitudes, although with low precision given smaller
historical samples: IV estimates for 7 cross sections between 1913 and 1954 (Irwin and Terviö
2002, Table 4) gave an average estimate of 3.03.
        Thus, we can be reassured that, for the historical periods we consider, similar trade-
income coefficients have been detected. Still, to augment and qualify our bottom line results, we
propose two conservative alternatives to our baseline results where we assume a smaller value
for δ in the lower end of the consensus range from the literature, say, either δ = 1 or δ = 0.5.69
The flow costs of World War One (baseline estimate 4.35%) would then be revised down to
1.1%–2.2% of world GDP, compared to the human cost estimate of 2.43%. The flow costs of
World War Two (baseline estimate 4.16%) would be 1%–2% of world GDP, compared to the
human cost of 5.43%. Even then, the costs remain large: 40%–80% of the then-shocking human
costs of World War I or 20%–40% of the even-more-shocking human costs of World War II.

VI. Conclusion
Our work estimates the economic costs of war arising from the destruction of trade. Econometric
analysis suggests that these costs are quantitatively large, statistically significant, and highly
persistent. Case studies of the two world wars show that these costs can be large—of the same
order of magnitude as more traditional measures of the costs of conflict, such as loss of life.

69
   If one is willing to ignore endogeneity, the OLS coefficients are typically smaller in this literature. However,
Frankel and Romer (1999) reported that there is very little difference between their OLS and IV estimates, and that
OLS coefficients do not overstate the impact of trade on income. Also, as noted by Rodriguez and Rodrik (2002)
and confirmed in Irwin and Terviö (2002), the IV coefficients can be sensitive to the inclusion of latitude. In
response, additional specification checks conducted by Rose showed that latitude and other geography controls have
no deleterious impact on the size or significance of the trade coefficient in the GDP equation estimations in Frankel
and Rose (2002), where the basic IV estimates of δ range between 1.59 and 1.96, with an OLS estimate of 0.79. See
http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/arose/Rodrik.pdf. The basic estimates may be upward biased by omitted variables;
smaller coefficients than these do appear in Frankel and Rose (2002) but only when other, probably endogenous and
collinear controls, such as the investment ratio, are included as regressors in the income equation resulting in a
probable downward bias (see their pp. 447–48). On these grounds we argue that the “conservative consensus”
estimate of δ would be in the 0.5 to 1.0 range.

                                                        38
       War is hell: the human toll suffered by belligerents as a result of war was immense; but,
on narrow economic grounds, the losses due to trade were also of a significant magnitude and are
not as widely appreciated. Wars kill trade too. Moreover, the negative externalities were huge.
The belligerents wrecked the world economy not just for themselves but also for everyone else.
       Given the large trade costs of war that we find, it might seem reasonable to hope that they
would dissuade rational policymakers from armed conflict. But the two world wars certainly
offer a disturbing counterpoint to this vision: they affected an extremely large fraction of world
trade and engulfed some of the most open trading nations on earth. Perhaps other mechanisms
are needed to avert war, such as multinational institutions. An economic rationale for such
institutions might be gleaned from this paper, given the emphasis we place on the important and
neglected role of external effects. The large negative trade externalities imposed on neutrals by
wars ought to have encouraged neutral countries to try to set limits to the belligerent tendencies
of others. After the great wars, multilateral institutions (the League of Nations, the United
Nations) held out such a promise, even if they were not entirely successful. Perhaps this was the
only way to save neutrals from the large negative spillovers generated by the belligerents—as
well as to save belligerents from themselves.

Sources: See text and notes. Dead and wounded: Military casualties only. Data from Ferguson (1999), except Canada, Australia,
New Zealand and India from Bogart (1919), with authors’ adjustments (see below). Incomes and populations: Maddison (2004),
adjusted to 1913 land borders, using Maddison (1995, 2001), except Austria-Hungary: for Hungary the Maddison GDP per capita
is $2,098, for Austria it is $3,465; a population-weighted average for Austria and Hungary give $2,731. GDP is computed based
on a total census population in 1910 of 51.356 million from Mitchell (1992).
Notes: Notes: Dead equivalent are estimated as dead plus one half wounded. Cost (flow cost) is calculated as real wage times
dead equivalent. Real wage is proxied by real GDP per capita times labor’s share (estimated as 2/3) divided by labor share of
population (estimated as 1/2). Austria-Hungary: for Hungary the Maddison GDP per capita is $2,098, for Austria it is $3,465; an
average between Austria and Hungary gives $2,781.5. GDP is then computed based on a total population in 1910 of 51.356
million from Mitchell (1992). Variant estimates of the death counts were considered for several countries, as follows. We found
that the above Bogart-Ferguson casualty data closely match most the death counts for almost all countries in other studies, e.g.,
Broadberry and Harrison (2005), and the consensus is usually close to the figures presented in the original U.S. War Department
study of 1924. This is not surprising since Urlanis (1971) is an important original source for these studies. However, most sources
show wide disagreement with Urlanis in the case of four countries (see: e.g., http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/warstat1.htm),
where Urlanis has very high estimates of death. We cannot discount Urlanis, however, since he had special access to Soviet
archives, which may lend his counts greater precision in some cases. The four countries, with corresponding ranges of alternate
death toll estimates, are Belgium (low “consensus”: 13,000; high, from Urlanis: 38,000), Serbia (low: 45,000–128,000; high:
278,000), Greece (low: 5,000; high: 26,000), and Turkey (low: 236,000–450,000; high: 804,000). As a sensitivity check, we
recalculated costs for these 4 countries using the lowest of these ranges of estimates. Costs for these particular countries change
markedly in this case, but the overall costs of the war do not change (since these are countries with small GDP weights). The
table shows the results with the low estimates.

Notes: Trade losses are relative to total world trade in 1913; GDP losses are relative to the total GDP for the country group (see
column label) in 1913. Trade impacts are based on the gravity model in Table 3, column 4. GDP impacts are based on the
Frankel-Romer regression estimate of the impact of trade on GDP level. The discount factor is 0.95. The definition of belligerents
in the weighting data is those countries ever involved in WWI during years 1914 to 1918. This does not correspond exactly with
the gravity-model belligerent dummy at all times: some countries may be omitted, and not all were belligerents for the entire war
(e.g., the United States). Partial equilibrium results hold adjustment of multilateral resistance barriers constant; general
equilibrium results allow endogenous adjustment of trade flows and multilateral resistance barriers. These effects are adjusted to
reflect changes in the composition of which countries were belligerent, adversarial, allied, or neutral during the period.

Sources: See text and notes. Dead and wounded include both military and civilian casualties; some missing data are imputed
except for rows marked *. See Appendix Table A3 for details and sources. Incomes and populations are from Maddison (2004),
adjusted to 1938 borders using Maddison (1995, 2001); Czechoslovakia data are 1937 values and South Africa data are
interpolated using 1913 and 1950 values.
Notes: Dead equivalent are estimated as dead plus one half wounded. Cost (flow cost) is calculated as real wage times dead
equivalent. Real wage is proxied by real GDP per capita times labor’s share (estimated as 2/3) divided by labor share of
population (estimated as 1/2).

Notes: Trade losses are relative to total world trade in 1938; GDP losses are relative to the total GDP for the country group (see
column label) in 1938. Trade impacts are based on the gravity model in Table 3, column 5. GDP impacts are based on the
Frankel-Romer regression estimate of the impact of trade on GDP level. The discount factor is 0.95. The definition of belligerents
in the weighting data is those countries ever involved in WWII during years 1939 to 1945. This does not correspond exactly with
the gravity-model belligerent dummy at all times: some countries may be omitted, and not all were belligerents for the entire war
(e.g., the United States). Partial equilibrium results hold adjustment of multilateral resistance barriers constant; general
equilibrium results allow endogenous adjustment of trade flows and multilateral resistance barriers. These effects are adjusted to
reflect changes in the composition of which countries were belligerent, adversarial, allied, or neutral during the period.

Appendix Table A2: Trade Effects of Different Wars, 1870–1997, Heckit estimates
The table reports 66 coefficients for status-lag-type interaction terms from a Heckman OLS regression: for status as
war or neutral, for lags zero to ten years, and for three types of war (WWI, WWII and other).

Notes: See Appendix Table A1. Country-specific fixed effects used instead of country-pair effects. The Heckit estimates use
Stata’s default MLE option and the first stage equation has the same regressors (with identification by functional form). The
estimate of the correlation of first and second stage error terms was –0.06.

Sources: Casualty data were taken from http://www.worldwar2database.com/html/frame4.htm, with supplementary data taken
from http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/ww2stats.htm.
Notes on Imputed Data: As a preliminary step, missing data for dead or wounded (civilians and military) were imputed by four
methods: 1. All missing data set to zero; 2. Assume that for each country the number of wounded equaled 1.5 times the number
of dead; 3. Assume that the proportion of wounded to dead for countries with missing data was the same as for those with data.
For method 3, the following regression was run: WOUNDED = a + b*DEAD. For military casualties we found: 17 observations,
a = 56,207 (t=0.38) and b = 1.57 (t=10.33), R2=.88. For civilian casualties there were too few observations (7) so the regressions
produced insignificant estimates. Thus, the regression in method 3 justifies the rule of thumb used in method 2. In this table, we
show two counts based on methods 1 and 2, with the same rule of thumb applied to both civilian and military casualties.
Other Notes: Germany total includes Austrian casualties. According to some sources Austrian military deaths were 280,000 and
military wounded were 350,000, which would be 8% and 7% of the combined Austrian/German total, respectively. USSR total
does not include an estimated 2 to 2.5 million civilians who died fleeing the Red Army during the Soviet invasion and expulsion
from today’s Western Poland and Czechoslovakia. China civilian deaths are very rough estimates. It is very doubtful that civilian
deaths were zero under the Japanese occupation. One website mentions an estimate of 22,000,000 civilian deaths which is of
“doubtful accuracy”; another has an implausibly low figure of 115,000. Furthermore, the military casualties are only those of the
Chinese Nationalists and do not include those of the Communists. Another source estimates 11 million civilian dead due to
Japanese occupations in Asia, although this includes countries other than China, e.g. Burma. Based on the latter figure we make a
rough estimate of 10 million civilian dead in China. For this reason, our 5% GDP loss for China should be considered a very
rough upper bound. Poland’s figures are subject to disagreement; our figures may be low; Bullock estimates military deaths at
850,000.

Data Appendix

This appendix provides a more detailed description of the source and construction of the data for trade,
real GDP, GDP per capita, and land area. Details for all other variables are contained in the text.

Bilateral Trade
         As discussed in the text, trade data for the period 1948-1997 were constructed from the IMF’s
Direction of Trade (DoT). These data are essentially the same as in Glick and Rose (2002); the dataset is
obtainable from http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/arose/RecRes.htm#Software. The average value of
bilateral trade between each pair of countries is created by averaging all of the possible trade values
potentially available (exports from i to j, exports from j to i, imports into i from j, imports into j from i).
Observations where all four figures have a zero or missing value are dropped from the sample in our
benchmark regressions. The text describes how we impute missing values for the purpose of robustness
checks of our results.
         The primary source of trade data for 1870-1947 is Barbieri (1996a); her International Trade
Dataset Version 1.1 can be obtained from http://pss/la.psu.edu/trd_data.htm. Since her data measure
bilateral trade as the sum of exports and imports between each country pair (imports into i into j and into j
from i) exports), these figures are divided by two to create an average value of trade. When Barbieri data
are unavailable, bilateral export and import data from Mitchell (1992, 1993, 1998) for selected countries
with their main trading partners are used. As with the DoT trade data used for the 1948-97 period,
bilateral trade for each country pair is constructed from the Mitchell data by averaging all of the possible
trade values potentially available. Remaining data gaps are filled where possible from López-Córdova and
Meissner (2003).
         The Barbieri trade data are expressed in millions of current U.S. dollars. López-Córdova and
Meissner’s trade are expressed in real 1990 U.S. dollars and were converted into nominal dollar terms
using the U.S. consumer price index. The Mitchell data, which are expressed in current local currency
terms, were converted into current dollar with the official exchange rate series from Global Financial Data
(GFD), with exceptions noted below.
         Argentina: Official rate from Mitchell (1993) is used through 1910. Data from 1911 on comes
from Gerardo della Paolera, Alan M. Taylor and Carlos G. Bózzoli, “Historical Statistics,” in della
Paolera and Taylor, eds., A New Economic History of Argentina (Cambridge: Cambridge University
Press, 2003).
         Bulgaria: French Franc rate is used while Bulgaria was in the Latin Monetary Union (1880-1898,
1906-1911). An average of the 1898 and 1906 exchange rates is used for the intervening years. The 1911
rate is used for 1912 and 1913. The official Bulgarian Lev rate from GFD is used from 1920 onward.
         Chile: For all years, the data comes from Juan Braun et al., “Economía Chilena 1810-1995:
Estadísticas Históricas,” Documento de Trabajo no. 187, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile,
Instituto de Economía (Enero), Santiago (January 2000).
         China: Trade figures for 1905-1932 in Mitchell (1998) converted from Haikwan tael into dollars
using exchange rate from GFD. Figures for 1933-1938 converted into yuan at exchange rate of 1 tael =
0.72 yuan, and the yuan/dollar exchange rate from GFD then used for conversion into dollars.
         Colombia: Exchange rate implicit from gold content from GFD used while Colombia was on
gold standard (1871-1885, 1907-1913). For the years 1886 through 1906, we used the average of the 1885
and 1907 exchange rates; for the years 1914-1918 we used the average of the 1913 and 1919 exchange
rates. The peso exchange rate from GFD was used from 1919 on.
         Ghana: U.K. Pound exchange rate is used.
         Greece: French Franc rate from GFD is used while Greece was in the Latin Monetary Union
(1870-1876). Exchange rate figures for 1880-89 come from Michael Bordo. Figures for 1901-1945 are
from GFD; the DOT rate for 1948 is used for 1946 and 1947.
         Romania: French Franc rate from GFD was used while Romania was in the Latin Monetary
Union (until 1914).

        Serbia: French Franc rate from GFD used
        Uruguay: Data for 1885-. comes from GFD; the exchange rate for the years 1874-1884 is set
equal to the 1885 rate.
        Lastly, exchange rate data from the DoT for 1948 is used for 1946 and 1947 for the following
countries: Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Egypt, South Africa, Switzerland, Turkey.
        Occasionally missing Barbieri observations are left unfilled even when data from Mitchell or
López-Córdova and Meissner are available, because the data do not align well. Furthermore, in a limited
number of instances the Barbieri observations were replaced (“overwritten”) with data from Mitchell or
López-Córdova and Meissner, due to apparent inconsistencies in Barbieri’s figures. A list of these
instances is available upon request. After data from the various sources for the 1870-1947 period were
merged, the pre-1948 dataset is converted into 1985 dollars using the U.S. CPI index and then spliced
together with the 1948-1997 data.

GDP and GDP per capita
         As discussed in the text, real GDP and GDP per capita data (in constant 1985 dollars) for the
1948–97 period are obtained from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators, the Penn World
Table (PWT) Mark 5.6, Maddison (1995; 2001), and from the IMF’s International Financial Statistics.
These data are essentially the same as in Glick and Rose (2002), with the general exception that we use
Maddison data to fill in observations for 1948 and 1949.
         For the 1870–1947 period the data primarily come from Maddison (1995; 2001) and are
supplemented by information from Mitchell (1992, 1993, 1998) and individual country sources, as
described below. In general, real GDP data in national currency units from the supplementary sources are
converted first into the real 1990 dollar terms reported by Maddison using the ratio of figures for
overlapping year(s). GDP per capita is then calculated using population series implicit in the
supplementary source’s GDP and GDP per capita data. After adjusting for border changes (see below)
and using the U.S. CPI to put into 1985 dollar terms, the 1870-1947 series are then linked to the 1948-
1997 series using the average ratio of overlapping observations for 1948-1952 (the availability of
Maddison data beyond 1948 allows this overlap).
         Further details of the use of supplementary data sources is provided below:
         Argentina: Figures for 1875-1899 are taken from Gerardo della Paolera, Alan M. Taylor, and
Carlos G. Bózzoli, “Historical Statistics”, in della Paolera and Taylor, eds., A New Economic History of
Argentina (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003).
         Austria-Hungary: GDP and GDP per capital figures for 1870-1913 come from Max-Stephan
Schulze, “Patterns of Growth and Stagnation in the Late Nineteenth-Century Hapsburg Economy,”
European Review of Economic History 4:3 (2000). Maddison provides GDP data for Austria and Hungary
separately for 1913 within their 1990 borders. These data points were scaled up by the ratio of each
country’s population within 1913 borders to its population within 1990 borders and then added together to
give a Madison-based GDP estimate for Austria-Hungary in 1913. The Schulz GDP series was then
rescaled by its ratio in 1913 to this Maddison figure. GDP for 1914-1917 were imputed from the (real)
GDP figures for Austria within its 1990 borders in Maddison, scaled up by the ratio of Austria Hungary’s
GDP to Austria’s GDP in 1913. Real GDP per capita was computed using the population series implicit
in Schulze’s data for 1870-1913; for 1914-1917, we rescaled Maddison’s population data for Austria
(within its 1990 border) by the ratio of Schulze’s population figure in 1913 to Maddison’s figure for
Austria within its 1913 border
         Brazil: Figures for 1880-1899 come from Michael Bordo and Hugh Rockoff, “The Gold
Standard as a ‘Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval,’” NBER Working Paper no. 5340 (November

          Cuba: Figures for 1903-1949 come from Mitchell (1993), where data on GDP (pp. 750, 755) and
population (p. 58) are presented. Since the Cuban peso is pegged one to one to the U.S. dollar, the U.S.
price deflator is used to convert Mitchell’s peso series into 1990 dollars.
          Ecuador: Figures for 1939-1954 come from Mitchell (1993), which provides data for GDP (p.
765) and population (p. 58).
          Egypt: GDP data for 1886-1945 are taken from Tarik M. Yousef, “Egypt’s Growth Record
Under Economic Liberalism, 1885-1950: A Reassessment Using New GDP Estimates,” Review of Income
and Wealth 48: 561-579 (December 2002). GDP per capita is calculated using Yousef’s GDP series and
population data from Mitchell (1998, p. 47).
          Greece: GDP figures for 1927 and 1928 come from Michael Bordo. GDP per capita is calculated
using Maddison’s population series.
          Hungary: GDP data for 1942 and 1943 come from Mitchell (1992, p. 894). Population data is
from Maddison.
          India: Population and GDP per capita data for 1873-1899 are taken from Moni Mukherjee,
National Income of India, Trends and Structure (Calcutta: Statistical Publishing Society, 1969). The
implicit GDP series is computed from these data, converted into real 1990 dollars in the standard manner,
and then divided by population to generate real GDP per capita.
          Mexico: Figures for 1895-1899 come from Mitchell (1993, p. 749).
          Paraguay: GDP and population data for 1938-1954 come from Mitchell (1993, pp. 767, 63-64,
respectively).
          Phillippines: GDP figures for 1946-1949 are taken from Mitchell (1998, p. 1012); population
data are from Maddison.
          Portugal: Figures for 1880-1914 come from Bordo and Rockoff (1996).
          Soviet Union: The average of GDP for 1940 and 1945 from Maddison is used to fill in
observations for 1941-1944; the average of per capita GDP for 1940 and 1946 from Maddison is used to
fill in 1941-1945.
          Spain: Figures for 1870-1954 come from Leandro Prados de la Escosura, El progreso económico
de España: 1850-2000 (Madrid: Fundación BBVA, 2002).
          Uruguay: Figures for 1870-1954 are taken from Luis Bértola et al., El PBI de Uruguay 1870-
1936 y otras estimaciones (Montevideo: 1999). GDP and GDP per capita data are given in index level
form, with 1913 = 100. To convert into real 1990 dollars, the index series is multiplied by Maddison’s
GDP value in 1913. Likewise, the implicit population index series from Bértola et al is computed and
converted into actual population terms using Maddison’s 1913 population value. These population figures
are then used to calculate GDP per capita.
          Maddison (1995) reports GDP and GDP per capita series based on 1990 borders. We adjust these
data to take account of the effects of historical changes in borders on economic activity, under the
assumption (typically employed by Maddison) that such effects are proportionate to differences in
population. Maddison’s Appendix H provides population figures for selected countries in 1913 and 1939
for the borders existing at the time as well as for their 1990 borders. We adjust his GDP series based on
1990 borders by using the ratio of population within the 1913 and 1939 borders to the population within
1990 borders. (These adjustments are made only if the population difference was more than 3 percent.)
Adjustments based on the 1913 ratios were applied over the 1870-1917 period for Austria-Hungary,
Bulgaria, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Romania, Russia, Serbia/Yugoslavia, and the United
Kingdom. Adjustments based on the 1939 ratios were applied to the 1918-1944 period for Bulgaria,
Czechoslovakia, Germany, Italy, Poland, Romania, Russia/Soviet Union, and Serbia/Yugoslavia.
Adjustments were also made for border changes affecting Korea in 1945, India in 1948, and Pakistan in
1972.
          GDP per capita figures generally are assumed unaffected by these border adjustments, with the
exception of Germany and Italy, for whom Maddison reports separate per capita figures for 1913, 1939,
and 1990 borders.

         In conducting our general equilibrium counterfactuals we impute GDP levels in 1913 and 1938
for selected additional countries with bilateral trade data for those years in order to maximize the number
of observations in our calculations. Specifically, we imputed 1913 GDP levels for the following countries
by calculating the ratio of Maddison GDP data for that country and a reference group in the nearest year
with data for both, and then using this ratio to scale down the reference group’s GDP (in 1985 dollars) in
1913: Algeria (1913, Ind4), Bolivia (1945, LA8), Dominican Republic (1950, LA8), Ecuador (1939,
LA8), El Salvador (1920, LA8), Guatemala (1920, LA8), Haiti (1945, LA8), Honduras (1920, LA8), Iran
(1913, Ind4), Malaysia (1913, Asn4), Nicaragua (1920, LA8), Paraguay (1939, LA8),Romania (1913,
Ind4), where the year and reference group (Asn4 = China, Indonesia, Japan, Thailand; Ind4 = France,
Germany, U.K., U.S.; LA8 = Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, Venezuela) are
indicated in parentheses. Correspondingly we imputed 1938 GDP data for the following countries:
Algeria (1913, Ind4), Bolivia (1945, LA8), Costa Rica (1938, LA8), Dominican Republic (1950, LA8), El
Salvador (1938, LA8), Ghana (1913, Ind4), Guatemala (1938, LA8), Haiti (1945, LA8), Honduras (1938,
LA8), Iran (1913, Ind4), Iraq (1913, Ind4), Malaysia (1938, Asn4), Nicaragua (1938, LA8), Panama
(1945, LA8), South Africa (1913, Ind4).

Land Area
        Land area figures were taken from the World Factbook (Washington, D.C.: Central Intelligence
Agency, 2000). For the period 1870-1917 land area data for Albania, Austria-Hungary, Belgium,
Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Korea, the Netherlands, Norway, Romania, Russia/USSR,
Sweden, and Turkey were obtained from the online replica of the Encyclopedia Britannica, 11th edition
(Cambridge: University Press, 1911). Figures for the 1918-1944 period for Albania, Austria, Belgium,
Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, the
Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Sweden, Turkey, USSR (Russia), Germany, and Yugoslavia are
taken from the New World Looseleaf Atlas (New York: Hammond, 6th edition, no date, circa 1920s).
