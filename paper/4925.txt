       This paper investigates the relationship between pension coverage and the retirement

behavior of older men. Pensions are associated with higher work involvement for males in their

late fifties and early sixties but with lower rates of job holding for those aged 65 through 69.

Age of entry into pension employment is shown to be positively correlated with future labor

supply. When combined with evidence on age-specific changes in labor force participation rates,

this pattern casts doubt on the hypothesis that broadened pension coverage explains a substantial

portion of the tend toward earlier male retirement.

               Do Pensions Increase   the Labor Supply of Older Men?

        The labor force participation rates of older males have dramatically

declined in the United States since the end of World War II, falling from 90%

to 67% for 55 to 64 year olds and from 47% to 16% for those over 65 between

1948 and 1993 (U.S. Department of Labor, 1989, 1994). In explaining this

reduction, economists have recently focused attention on the role of private

pensions.1 Pensions often contain complicated incentives which encourage

workers to remain with the pension provider at some ages but to leave those

jobs subsequently. These incentives are typically strongest for defined

benefit (OS) plans, where pension payments depend on some combination of

seniority and earnings, and often include vesting periods, early retirement

options, and social security offsets.2

        The actuarial value of pensions is frequently maximized at fairly young

ages.3 The changes in pension incentives, occurring with age and length—of-

service, can be extremely large and there is strong evidence that workers

respond to these incentives.4 Furthermore, the number of full—time private

wage and salary workers covered by pension plans more than doubled between


  1 peracchi & Welch {1994) provide an in—depth discussion of the labor
supply trends of older men and women. Earlier research on retirement
emphasized mandatory retirement provisions, health limitations. changea in
wealth and earnings, and social security system incentives. For literature
reviews, see L,azear (1986), Quinn et. al. (1990), or Ruhm (1994a)
  2  68% of pension—covered workers were enrolled in primary DB plans in 1987,
a reduction from 87% in 1975 (Belier & Lawrence, 1992). Some of these persons
received supplemental coverage from defined contribution (DC) plans.
     Kotlikof I & Smith (1983) found that half of civilian employees could
retire at 62 and 15% by age 55, with no actuarial reduction in pension
benefits. Similarly, in Mitchell & Fields' (1984) survey of 10 pension plans,
lifetime benefits were maximized at 62 or earlier in 9 of plans and by age 60
in 5. Mitchell (1992) shows that the early retirement incentives became still
more prevalent during the decade of the 1980s.
      For instance, in their case study of one large firm, Rotlikoff & Wise
 (1989) calculate the accrual to pension wealth for an additional year of
service at $72,527 for 54 year old managers with 25 years seniority but
negative $14,936 for 65 year olds with 30 years on the job. They estimate
that workers were 30 percentage points more likely to depart the firm prior to
age 60 (44% vs. 14%) than if the company had offered an age-neutral pension
plan.

1950 and 1975, rising from 26% to 52% (Turner & Belier, 1989) .        Although
coverage rates have been static in recent years, the number of retirees with

pensions continues to increase. Many economists have concluded that this

combination of pension incentives and expanding coverage rates is responsible

for a significant share of the secular decline in the labor force

participaticn of older American men.

     As suggested by its title, this paper questions this conclusion and

argues that the effects of pensions are far more complicated than is commonly

understood. Although pensions hasten the retirements of some workers, they

delay the labor force withdrawal of others and so the net impact on retirement

ages is not clear.

     Pensions have ambiguous impacts for at least three reasons. First,

departures from covered jobs may be followed by subsequent full or part-time

work, rather than immediate retirement, thus moderating the effects of the

pension incentives.5 second, the incentives to leave the firm prior to normal

retirement ages are likely to be limited to persons entering the pension plan

at relatively young ages, since vesting provisions and length—of—service

requirements often discourage early departures for persons beginning pension-

covered employment later in life.6 Third, even for persons entering covered

employment at relatively young ages, defined benefit plans are likely to

discourage mobility prior to the age at which actuarial benefits are maximized

(Allen et. al., 1993; Gustman & Steinmeier, 1990), reducing the probability of

early, as well as late, retirement.7


     Continued work after the end of pension employment deserves greater
attention in light of recent research (e.g. Gustman & Steirimeier, 1984; Honig
& Reimers, 1987; Quinn, et. al. 1990; Rubm, 1990, 1991; Slau, 1994) indicating
the prevalence of postcareer employment and partial retirement.
  6 The     importance of age of     entry into the pension plan is discussed by
Kotlikoff    &   Wise (1989)
     Stock       & Wise   (1990) simulate the effects, in one large firm, of switching
                                              —3—




     The empirical analysis below confirms that pensions have more ambiguous
effects on retirement behavior than          has    generally been realized. In
particular,     pensions are associated with increased labor supply for men in

their late fifties and early sixties but with reductions in employment and

work hours after age 64. Delayed entry into pension jobs correlates with

higher labor supply among mature males and the pattern of age—specific changes

in labor force participation rates casts doubt on the hypothesis that

broadened pension coverage accounts for a major portion of the trend towards

earlier male retirement.

                       1. Pension coverage and Retirement Ages

     This section examines the relationship expected between pension coverage

and retirement ages.8 Following Mitchell &              Fields   (1984), V is the discounted

value of lifetime compensation, L the number of periods of retirement, and T

and R   the   ages of death and retirement respectively. Specifying Y and P as

the discounted values of lifetime earnings and pension benefits, workers

choose retirement ages to maximize the utility function U(V,L), subject to the

time constraint L = T —       R   and   the budget constraint V      '1 +   P.

     Retirement therefore occurs at:


                          R         argmax (J[V(t),L(t)].                                (1)
                                           t


from a DB to a DC plan. If the employer contributes to the latter plan at a
rate such that the annuity value for a 60 year old worker with 30 years of
service is the same as for the DB plan, annual retirement probabilities are
calculated to rise prior to age 59, fall between 59 and 64 and increase at
ages 65 and 66. Because of the high propensities to leave the firm at
relatively young ages, however, cumulative retirement probabilities are raised
at all ages studied. Simulations for a second firm by Lumadaine, Stock, &
Wise (1994) similarly indicate that switching from a DB to a DC plan would
increase retirements through age 58 and then lower them subsequently.
        The   results below do not depend upon a specific definition of retirement.

where y, the age of entry into the pension job, is set to T (the age of death)

for persons never holding pension employment. Individuals work at t if D(.)

is positive and retire when DC.)                 0, provided that D c 0. Optimal

retirement ages for each y, denoted by R1, occur where D(t,y) =                      0.

     The effect of pensions on retirement ages can be examined by comparing

persons obtaining covered positions in the first period of work to those

employed in non-covered jobs their entire working lives. The latter group are

paid their marginal product, y0(t), and receive no pension. If total

compensation is the same in pension covered positions as in noncovered

employment, y(t)i-P      y0(t) for all t, which implies that DC.) will be

independent of y and pensions will have no effect on retirement behavior. It

is only when pay in pension jobs differs from that in corresponding noncovered

positions that labor supply may be affected.

     For instance, assume that the compensation of covered workers, at time t,

exceeds that of noncovered individuals by a positive differential ir(t)

Persons never holding pension employment retire at age 0 where:

                      D(O,T) =          U                                                       (3)
                                            •(; (%] -            =L0•


Persona entering the pension sector at time 0 retire at R0 such that:


                   OCR •O =         U
                                            • (R0)+aCR )]—

     This implies that retirement occurs when the marginal utility of earnings
is exactly offset by the disutility of lost leisure.
                                       —5—


     In this situation, pensions may either hasten or delay retirement.

Covered workers receive higher lifetime compensation, creating an income

effect which lowers      (if     c 0) and speeds withdrawal from the labor

force. Compensation is also greater by w(Q) at Q, however, generating an

offsetting substitution effect. The ambiguous impact of pensions occurs even

if the actuarial value of pension wealth is declining over time. Although

covered workers exit the labor force earlier than if pensions were actuarially

neutral and earnings   remained unchanged, with competitive labor markets,   the

wage and pension profiles are inextricably linked.

     There are a number of reasons to expect higher compensation in pension

covered employment. Compensation premia and pension coverage may go together

in unionized employment. Pay differentials could also exist with competitive

labor and product markets. For instance, pensions might be provided, as a

means of preventing shirking, in jobs where output is sensitive to effort.

The intuition is that effort will only be maximized if sufficiently large

costs are imposed for detected shirking. As retirement approaches, the

penalty must take the form of reduced pension benefits, since the number of

periods over which earnings can be decreased is small. Pension jobs will also

be rationed because new job entrants will not have built up sufficient

deferred payments and so will have incentives to shirk if they can immediately

reenter a new pension jobJ0

     If jobs offering pension pay more than those that do not, persons will

repeatedly attempt to obtain covered employment and there will be

heterogeneity in the age of entry into the pension sector.11 In this


  10 See Ruhut (1993) for a theoretical model of partial pension coverage with
these characteristics.
  11 several types of evidence suggest that pension jobs offer pay premiums.
Gustman & Steinmeier (1990) indicate that turnover rates are lower in jobs
providing pensions because total compensation is substantially higher in these
positions. Similarly, Ellwood (1985) shows that pension coverage is
                                      —6—


situation, late entrants are likely to retire after their counterparts

starting in pension employment at younger ages. This occurs because the

substitution effect is equally strong for the two groups, whereas early

entrants have higher lifetime incomes and a larger (negative) income effect.12

     To summarize, pension coverage may be associated with either early or

late retirement, depending on the strength of the offsetting income and

substitution effects. Among workers ever employed in covered jobs, the ages

of entry into pension employment and of retirement should be positively

correlated. A key condition required to generate this result is that total

compensation is higher in covered than noncovered positions.

                                    2. Data

     Data for this study were obtained from the Social Security Administration

Retirement History Longitudinal Survey (RHS) .   The PBS contains a

representative national sample (for the United States) of males aged 58

through 63 in 1969, the initial survey year, with follow-up interviews at two

year intervals through 1979. The sample analyzed includes non—self-employed

men whose longest job was in the private sector.13 Data were pooled across

RUS survey years to increase the sample sizes of respondents of given ages.14

     Fairly detailed information is available on labor force histories during

the survey period (1969 to 1979), as is less specific data for the presurvey


disproportionately obtained by highly paid and highly educated workers and is
relatively rarely supplied to disadvantaged labor market groups. He also
provides evidence of the dispersion of entry ages into pension employment.
  12 Since D(R0,o) = 0, D(R011) > 0, for v > 0 (and u c 0), which implies
that retirement ages rise with the age of entry into the pension sector.
  13 women were excluded because information on unmarried females is
extremely limited in the PBS.
  14 For example, data on 63 year olds was obtained from the 1969, 1971, and
1973 interviews. Cohort differences were tested for in preliminary analysis
but are not accounted for in the estimates presented below.
                                         —7—


years. Importantly, it is possible to ascertain whether the individual was

covered by a pension plan in up to three jobs: the job (if any) held at the

time of the 1969 interview, the employment held iwnediately previously, and

the longest job, if different from survey date and previous employment.

       Men working at the 1969 survey date were defined as having pensions if

covered in any of the three jobs for which information is available and to

lack coverage if none of the three positions provided pensions. The pension

status of men not employed in 1969 was determined according to whether or not

they were covered in their     most recent or longest job. Coverage is calculated
to   begin at the start of the   first job identified as offering a pension.

       The   RHS contains a number of shortcomings. First, the data are quite old
and so may not     be fully representative of the cohort now approaching

retirement age. Second, details on the type of pension coverage are sketchy.

In particular, it is     not possible to determine whether   respondents were

covered      by DB or DC plans. This limitation is made less severe, however, by
the predominance of defined benefit pensions during the survey period. Third,
some workers may have obtained coverage in jobs for which the RHS obtains no

information or have been employed with firms providing pension plans for which

they ultimately did not qualify for benefits.

       Despite these deficiencies, the RES is a useful data set to analyze

because it contains a larger representative sample of retirement age men and

better retrospective information on presurvey employment than most other

longitudinal      sourcesj5 Furthermore, the RBS has been    widely employed to

study retirement behavior and so the results obtained are directly comparable

to much of the previous research on pensions.


     15 Although the new Health   and Retirement Survey will provide more current
information  in the near future, its sample members are presently too young for
the type of analysis undertaken below.

      Economists have variously defined retirement as occurring when

individuals classify themselves as retired, receive public or private pension

benefits, experience a discontinuous reduction in earnings or hours worked, or

exit the labor force, The last criteria is implicitly used when considering

the relationship between pension coverage and labor force participation rates

and ignores any impact of pensions on positive work hours. To avoid depending

on a single definition, four alternative measures of labor supply are

considered below. The first three are dummy variables indicating whether the

individual does not work, works full—time (more than 35 hours per week) •      or is

employed in a career' job (defined as a position which has lasted at least 10

years) .   The fourth is a continuous indicator of weekly hours of work.

               3.    Empirical Analysi. of Pensions   and Labor Supply

      Labor supply    declines monotonically with age for RHS   respondents.

Particularly sharp     reductions are observed at 62 and 65, reflecting a

combination of Social Security system provisions, mandatory retirement

requirements, and pension plan incentives (see table l).16 sle

nonemployment probabilities are somewhat higher than corresponding national

nonparticipation rates.17 This is partially explained by the exclusion of

unemployed workers from the latter measure.

      Figures 1 through 4 summarize information on the relationship between

pension status and the alternative measures of labor supply for 58 through 68

year old men. The patterns are fairly consistent and quite striking. Between


  16 The legal minimum mandatory retirement age was raised from 65 to 70 by
the 1978 amendments to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act and has now
been eliminated for most workers.
  17 For example, 17% and 18% of 58 and 59 year old RHS respondents were not
working at the survey date in 1969. The corresponding national
nonparticipation rates were 11% and 13%, in that year.
                                       —9—



the ages of 58 and 61, pension—covered males are substantially more involved

in the labor force than their counterparts. Differences of 7 to 14 and 9 to

17 percentage points are observed in the probabilities of working and of

holding full-time employment respectively. Men with pensions are also 22 to

27 percentage points more likely to remain on career positions and average 4

to 5 more hours per week on the job.

     By contrast, the employment probabilities and average work hours of 62 to

64 year old men are virtually unrelated to pension coverage. Small

differentials are still observed; however, when considering the probability of

working full—time (3 to 6 percentage points) and particularly of continuing on

the career job (6 to 13 percentage points).

     Beyond age 64, pensions are associated with significantly reduced labor

supply. For example, whereas 74% of covered 65 year olds did not work, 20%

were employed more than 35 hours per week, 12% held career jobs, and weekly

employment averaged 10 hours, the corresponding figures for 65 year old men

without pensions were 61%, 26%. 17%, and 14 hours per week respectively.

Pensions continue to be correlated with reduced labor supply through age 68.

with the differences in nonemployment, full-time work, career job holding, and

hours ranging from 6 to 12, 1 to 6, and 2 to S percentage points and 2 to 4

hours per week, respectively, depending on the exact age considered.

     To examine whether these patterns persist after controlling for

observable characteristics, probit models of the form;


                   Pr(Z =1)       •(X a .+ fi P ),.                             (5)

were (separately) estimated for subsamples of respondents aged 58 to 68. The

subscript refers to the j   respondent,      2 is a dichotomous outcome (i.e.

nonemployment, full-time work, or career job holding). t(.) is the cumulative
                                             —10—



normal distribution      function, X a vector of covariates including a quadratic

for years of education and dummy variables indicating whether the respondent

was nonwhite, married, a household head, or residing in an SMSA, and P is the

pension coverage dummy variable.

       The probit results were supplemented with an hours of work equation,

estimated as a tobit model;

                                    *
                                   H.
                                    3
                                        X.+$P÷ ,,
                                         3          j    3
                                                                                      (6)

for H indicating weekly work hours and IC a latent (unobserved) variable with

H equal to }1 (0) if H* is greater than (less than or equal to) 0.

      After estimating (5) and (6), the average effect of pensions on the

various measures of labor supply was calculated. The first three columns of

table 2 present the predicted impact on nonemployment, full—time work, and

career job-holding probabilities, while column 4 displays the corresponding

differential in weekly work hours.18 For example, the first row of the table

indicates   that 58   year old men with pensions were 11. 12, and 23 percentage

points   more likely than    their counterparts to work, hold fun—time jobs, and

to continue   in career positions, respectively,        and that   they worked an extra
2.3   hours per week.

       The results in table 2 are similar to those obtained without controls for

individual characteristics. Specifically, pensions correlate with increased

labor supply prior to age 62, with lower work propensities after 65, and with

small differences for 62 through 64 year olds. Thus, pension coverage was

associated with a 7      percentage point reduction in average nonemployment

                     averaged over all respondents, where a and
indicate probit coefficients. For the tobit models, the differences are
estimated by $(.), where 4 is the expected probability of censoring at zero
hours, evaluated at the regressor means.
                                           —11—


probabilities between ages 58 and 61, a 4 point increase for 62 through 64

year olds, and an 11. percentage point rise for those aged 65 through 68. The

corresponding changes in full-time work propensities averaged 9, 0, and —7

percentage points, for the three age groups, while the mean differences in

career job holding and weekly work hours were 21, 5, and -s        points   and 1.5,

-2.3, and -4.1 hours respectively.

        These findings show that estimated pension effects vary with age and are

sensitive to the measure of labor supply used. They further suggest that it

may be problematic to use only a single criteria (e.g. participation rates)

when evaluating the impact of pensions. For example, averaged over the 58 to

68 year age range, pensions are predicted to decrease employment probabilities

and average hours worked but also to slightly increase the frequency of full-

time employment and to considerably raise the likelihood of remaining in a

career job.

                        4. Delayed Entry into Pension Employm.nt

        We next examine whether the labor supply of mature men is positively

correlated with the age of entry into the pension sector. As discussed, this

is expected     if   compensation is higher in covered than noncovered employment.

since    the   income effect is weaker for individuals starting pension jobs at

later ages, while the substitution effect remains substantial.19 By contrast,

labor supply may be    independent of entry ages if    total compensation is the

same    in the two types of jobs.20

  19 If the pension plan has service requirements for *earlyl or "normal"
retirement, the substitution effect may be stronger for early than late
entrants, which will reinforce the positive relationship between entry ages
into the pension sector and labor supply of mature adults.
  20 Compensation could be equal even when the average earnings of covered
workers exceed those of persons without pensions if pensions are provided as a
compensating differential in jobs with particularly unpleasant working
conditions or if more productive workers choose to take a larger proportion of
their pay in the form of fringe benefits.

     To test whether later entry into pension employment is associated with

elevated labor supply in late middle age, the probit and tobit models

specified by equations (5) and (6) were reestimated. with the addition of a

covariate indicating the commencement age of the covered job. Results of

these regressions, summarized in table 3, support the hypothesized

relationship, at least for ages 62 and older. A one year delay in entering

the pension job reduces the probability of nonemployment by 0.1 to 0.7

percentage points, depending on the exact age considered (see column 1) .   The

corresponding increase in work hours ranges from —0.06 to 0.26 hours per week

and the probability of working full—time rises by as much as 0.6 percentage

points (columns 2 and    •21

     Postponed entry into pension employment has particularly pronounced

effects for 62 through 66 year olds, with a smaller impact continuing through

age 68. For example, a one standard deviation (12.5 year) delay in starting

the pension job raises predicted employment rates by 5.2 percentage points at

age 62, 7.8 percentage points at 65, and 3.0 points at 68. corresponding

increases in the probabilities of working full—time are 4.6, 6.5, and 2.4

percentage points, respectively. Persons entering covered jobs after their

early (middle) forties are more likely to be working or employed full-time at

age 62 (64) than their counterparts never obtaining pensions.

     If broadening pension coverage plays a key role in explaining the secular
decline in the labor force participation rates of older men, the decreases

  21 Since career jobs are defined as positions lasting at least 10 years,
persons recently beginning pension employment will automatically be precluded
from holding career jobs. When the sample is restricted to persons starting
survey date employment more than 10 years previously, a positive relationship
ts observed between pension entry ages and probabilities of working in career
jobs for most age groups.

would probably be most    pronounced   for men aged 6S and above. This would be

expected since pensions are associated with the greatest reductions in labor

surply for this group. Smaller declines would then be anticipated for younger

workers for whom pensions have more modest negative impacts or are correlated

with increased work involvement. Surprisingly, scant attention has been paid

to the pattern of age-specific changes in participation rates.22

      The first three columns of table 4 indicate levels and changes in

participation rates for men between the ages of 58 and 68. This information

was obtained from unpublished U.S. Department of Labor data and is presented

as three-year averages for periods centered around the dates listed in the

table (e.g. column 1 presents average rates for the years 1968 through 1970)

The use of three-year averages minimizes the (sometimes considerable) effects

of year-to-year variations in labor force participation.

      The second column shows changes in average participation rates occurring

between 1969 and 1979, the period covered by the RHS survey. Column 3

displays corresponding changes taking place between 1969 and 1988. Thus, the

labor force participation rate of 58 year old males averaged 891 during the

three-year period centered around 1969 and fell by $ and 10 percentage points

(to 811 and 781) ,   respectively,   by the periods centered on 1979 and 1988 (see

row 1) .   The participation rate of 58 to 68 year old men fell by an average of

13 percentage points between 1969 and 1979 and by 18 points over the 1969 to

1988 interval.23

      "Relative changes" in participation rates, shown in columns 4 and     S of
the table, were next calculated by taking the difference between the change


  22 The best previous analysis is by Quinn et. al. (1990).
  23 These are unweighted averages, which do not account for age—group size
differences.
                                       —14—


for the particular age group and the average reduction for all 58 to 68 year

olds. For instance, the 10 percentage point decrease in the labor force

participation races of 58 year olds, between 1969 and 1980, represents a

growth of 7 points (—0.104 - —0.178     0.074) relative to the average for all

58 to 68 year olds. The sixth column displays the predicted effect of pension

coverage on the probability that RBS respondents worked positive hours at

specific ayes. These estimates were obtained by reversing the sign of the

nonemployment effects displayed in column 1 of table 2.

     The table shows that 62 to 64 year olds experienced the largest declines

in participation (columns 4 and 5) .   At   these ages, however, pensions were

correlated with (at most) only modest reductions in labor supply (column 6) -

conversely,   the pension disincentives were concentrated among 65 to 68 year

olds, for whom the declines in aggregate participation rates were much

smaller.

     These results suggest that broadened pension coverage is unlikely to

explain much of the trend towards earlier male retirement but do not rule out

other roles for pensions. Since coverage rates grew rapidly between 1950 and

1975, recent cohorts will have been enrolled in pension plans for longer

periods of time than their previous counterparts at equivalent ages. This

could lead to a reduction in the age of peak pension wealth and disincentives

for continued work. Second, even holding entry ages into the pension sector

constant, the characteristics of Dli plans appear to have changed over time in

ways that encourage earlier retirement.24

                                 6. Conclusions

     Previous research suggests that private pensions reduce the labor supply

of mature adults and, when combined with higher rates of coverage, may account


  24 the percentage of the male wcrkforce eligible for full pension benefits
prior to 65 rose from 4% in 1970 to 15% in 1985 (Ippolito, 1990) .     Mitchell   &
                                       —15—


for an important share of the secular decline in the labor force participation

rates of older men. This paper questions these conclusions, arguing that

pensions are likely to reduce labor supply at some ages but to increase it at

others, resulting in a more complicated and ambiguous aggregate impact than is

frequently realized.

     Empirically, pension coverage is associated with higher labor supply for

RHS respondents in their fifties to early sixties, with negligible or small

effects for men aged 62 to 64, and   with   large negative impacts among 65 to 69

year olds. Disparate results are obtained using alternative measures of labor

supply, suggesting shortcomings with relying on any single criteria. The miS

data also provide strong evidence that the labor supply of mature males is

positively correlated with the commencement age of pension employment. This

last result is anticipated if pay premiums are provided in pension jobs and is

may be inconsistent with theories which require equality of compensation

across the covered and noncovered sectors.

     The evidence that pension effects vary with age may    explain   why earlier

analysis which constrains the impact to be constant (e.g. Hanoch & Honig.

L983; Elau, 1994) frequently uncovers a negative relationship between pensions

and work propensities.25 The age variation also raises the possibility of

important interactions between private pensions and other forms of retirement

wealth, such as Social Security. Recent research (e.g. Samwick, 1993;

Luinridairie, Stock, & wise, 1994; Ruhm, 1994b) suggests that these interactions

may be important   but provides little consensus on the direction or timing of
the effects.


Luzadis (1988) and Luzadis & Mitchell (1991) provide additional evidence that
the age of maximum pension wealth has been falling over time.
  25 Gordon & Blinder's (1900) analysis of age—specific pension effects,
using the miS, obtain results consistent with those reported in this paper.
                                         —16—


     The age pattern of changes in labor force participation rates also casts

doubt on the hypothesis that broader pension coverage explains a substantial

portion of the trend reduction in male retirement ages. Whereas the age—

specific decreases in participation are largest for 62 to 64 year olds, the

negative impact of pensions is most pronounced among men between the ages of

65 and 68. These divergent patterns do not rule out a role for pensions, and

in particular do not account for secular changes in the age-profile of pension

accruals; however, a closer correspondence would be expected if increases in

private   pension coverage are of primary importance.
     Previous research on pensions has    typically   focused on the microeconomic
incentives   implicit in pension plans. Plan incentives are only one component

of total compensation, however, and the latter are determined in the larger

labor market. Thus, pensions could contain incentives which discourage

continued employment of persons enrolled in the plans, while having no

aggregate effecc on or even increasing average retirement ages.

     The age of entry into pension employment has a substantial impact on

subsequent labor supply. This highlights the importance of better

understanding the process by which workers obtain jobs offering pensions.

Subsequent empirical work also needs to investigate the dynamics of entry into

and exit out of pension employment, the role of worker heterogeneity in

determining pension coverage, and the relationship between the broad labor

supply effects focused upon in this paper and the results obtained from

detailed analyses of individual plans.

     Future research should also attempt to ascertain the applicability of

this and previous studies for the áohort of workers who are currently

approaching retirement. Significant differences could result from the greater

use of defined contribution pension plans, an economic environment which is

increasingly characterized by stagnant earnings and high rates of labor

displacement, and the rising labor force involvement of women and other groups

receiving limited attention in prior work.

Note: See note on table 2. For the probit estimates, predicted effects are
calculated as the average change in the outcome variable, for persons with
pension coverage, from delaying the start of coverage from the sample mean
age it begins until one year later. For the Tobit model they are estimated
as t(.), for 5 the coefficient on the age of first pension coverage and
'H.) the predicted probability that an observation is censored, with the
regressors evaluated at their sample means.

Note: Age-specific labor   force participation rates were obtained from
unpublished Department of Labor Data and calculated as three—year averages,
centered on the year listed. The predicted pension effect is derived from
the probit results summarized in column 1 of table 2.
