Estimating Life-Cycle Parameters from Consumption Behavior at Retirement

                                            ABSTRACT

Using pseudo-panel data, we estimate the structural parameters of a life--cycle consumption model

with discrete labor supply choice. A focus of our analysis is the abrupt drop in consumption upon

retirement for a typical household. The literature sometimes refers to the drop, which in the U.S.

Consumer Expenditure Survey we estimate to be approximately 16%, as the “retirement--

consumption puzzle.” Although a downward step in consumption at retirement contradicts

predictions from life--cycle models with additively separable consumption and leisure, or with

continuous work-hour options, a consumption jump is consistent with a setup having nonseparable

preferences over consumption and leisure and requiring discrete work choices. This paper specifies

a life--cycle model with these latter two elements, and it uses the empirical magnitude of the drop

in consumption at retirement to provide an advantageous method of identifying structural parameters

--- most importantly, the intertemporal elasticity of substitution.

                       Estimating Life—Cycle Parameters from

                        Consumption Behavior at Retirement


                                    1. Introduction

      The life—cycle saving model is a cornerstone of modern economic policy analysis. Re-

searchers use the framework to study, among other topics, economic growth, business

cycles, social insurance, and trade and tax policies (e.g., Diamond [1965], Auerbach and

Kotlikoﬀ [1987], Lucas [1990, 2003], Hubbard et al. [1995], Altig et al. [2001], and many

others). In a number of applications, both the model’s ability to match data and the answer

it gives to economic questions depend critically on values of its parameters, especially the

intertemporal elasticity of substitution for consumption. For example, see Woodford [2003,

ch.4] on macroeconomic implications, Weil [1989] on the risk free rate puzzle, Lucas [2003]

on the welfare costs of business cycles, and Jones et al. [2003] on the relationship between

volatility and growth. The importance of the model’s parameters naturally generates in-

terest in credible and precise estimates of their magnitudes (e.g., Hall [1988], Campbell

and Mankiw [1989], and Attanasio and Weber [1993]). Controversy about parameter val-

ues nevertheless persists, in part due to data limitations. We believe, however, that the

recent literature documenting the drop in average household consumption expenditure at

retirement – the “retirement—consumption puzzle” – suggests a new avenue for progress.

With the goal of enhancing the life—cycle model’s usefulness for current and future policy

research, this paper reconciles the model with empirical evidence on the change in house-

holds’ expenditure at retirement and then uses the magnitude of that change as a novel

and, we argue, advantageous source of identification in estimating parameters.

      A number of recent papers describe a substantial drop in household expenditures at

retirement.1 Some authors view the sudden change in expenditures as a puzzle. Indeed,

      E.g., Banks et al. [1998], Bernheim et al. [2001], Hurd and Rohwedder [2003], Haider

                                             3
a central prediction of the life—cycle model is that agents should smooth marginal utility

across ages, and, in the simplest formulations of model, this prediction maps into an

optimal life—cycle path of consumption that is itself smooth. When, for example, retirement

is anticipated, and when utility is an additively separable function of consumption and

leisure, consumption should change continuously with age.

    However, preferences over consumption and leisure may not take an additively separa-

ble form.2 Furthermore, a number of economists argue that opportunities for market—work

hours are not continuous. We show formally below that a tractable life—cycle specifica-

tion with intratemporal utility that is nonseparable in consumption and leisure, with work

options that are discrete, and with a retirement age that emerges from household choice,

predicts a discontinuous consumption change at retirement.

    We then show that if one is willing to treat the change in household consumption at

retirement as a consequence of purposeful behavior, the magnitude of the change provides

useful information for estimating life—cycle model parameters. Consider the intertemporal

elasticity of substitution (IES). Suppose that consumption and leisure are complements

(i.e., that we have intratemporal nonseparability) and that a household anticipates a dis-

crete increase in leisure upon retiring. In that case, the household will want to change its

consumption abruptly at retirement; moreover, the direction and magnitude of the desired

change will depend on the household’s taste for smoothing utility over time, that is, on its

IES for consumption/leisure services. In particular, if a household’s taste for intertemporal

smoothing is high, it may choose to decrease its consumption at retirement so that lost

utility from consumption oﬀsets gains from additional leisure. If, on the other hand, it has

and Stephens [2004], and Aguiar and Hurst [2004]. The decline estimated in these papers

ranges from 7% to 35%.
  2
    Indeed Attanasio and Weber [1993] and Meghir and Weber [1996] argue that allowing

for nonseparability is crucial for fitting the data.

                                               4
a lower desire for intertemporal smoothing, a household might increase its consumption

at retirement – to take advantage of the complementarity of consumption and leisure.

The size, and sign, of the consumption change registered in the data can thus help us to

estimate households’ IES.

      By oﬀering an alternative method for identifying life—cycle parameters, especially the

IES, this paper contributes to a literature that has formed two basic strands. The first

calibrates the life-cycle model from (macro) data and various existing studies (e.g., Auer-

bach and Kotlikoﬀ [1987], Cooley and Prescott [1995], and Altig et al. [2001]). This strand

tends to favor a moderate IES for consumption, usually between 0.2 and 1.0. The second

strand of the literature typically identifies the IES for consumption with the coeﬃcient

on the, properly instrumented, rate of return on assets in a consumption Euler equation.

This strand includes analyses of macro data, which sometimes estimate an IES very near

zero (e.g., Hall [1988], Campbell and Mankiw [1989]), and analyses of micro data, which

typically estimate an IES between 0.5 and 0.8 (e.g., Attanasio and Weber [1993] and Banks

et al. [1998]). Our approach can contribute evidence on the robustness of IES estimates

to variation in method of estimation and decision domain.3

      Furthermore, our method has the advantage that it estimates the IES from changes
  3
      Other papers have provided alternative methods for estimating and IES parameter.

For example, Barsky et al. [1997] use the responses to hypothetical questions to estimate the

IES. Estimating fully specified structural models, Rust and Phelan [1997] identify an IES

from the labor supply and Social Security application decisions of older males; and Keane

and Wolpin [2001] identify an IES for services from the decisions of young men concerning

schooling, work and saving. Using aggregate data, Basu and Kimball [2003] implement a

model with nonseparable consumption and leisure and with income and substitution eﬀects

on labor supply that cancel. Their method indicates an IES of 0.5 since the 1980s, but it

is unstable for earlier data from the postwar period.

associated with a highly predictable and consequential life event, namely, retirement. The

standard strategy of instrumenting for asset returns in period t+1 using economic variables

known in period t suﬀers from two limitations. First, the relevant variation (anticipated

changes in real rates of return) is modest in size, in practice perfectly correlated across

individuals in a cross section and, therefore, seems unlikely to produce changes in behavior

that are large enough to be precisely estimated from available data. Second, changes in

asset returns are notoriously diﬃcult to predict. As a result, problems of weak instru-

ments arise.4 This paper’s identification strategy, in contrast, depends on a phenomenon

that is economically substantial, mostly anticipated, and independently repeated within

cross sections of data. In addition, our method has the advantage that it does not rely on

unmodeled sources of variation. Interpreting rate—of—return estimates may require a spec-

ification with household decision making under uncertainty, household prediction of the

distribution for future shocks, and even transactions costs – all elements beyond the scope

of many policy—simulation models. Our procedure, on the other hand, straightforwardly

employs a model designed for policy experiments.

      Our approach relies on interpreting the change in expenditure at retirement as in-

tentional. Haider and Stephens [2004] test an alternative idea that consumption declines

on average at retirement because retirement is often unexpected. Using subjective predic-

tions about retirement age as an instrument for anticipated retirement, they find that the

expenditure decline remains statistically and economically significant (though one—third

smaller than with non—IV estimates). In a related study, Hurd and Rohwedder [2003] use

novel survey questions about expectations and show that households anticipate that their

consumption will dip about 20% at retirement. Similarly, Laitner [2001] points out that
  4
      See Yogo [2004] for a thorough discussion. An advantage, nevertheless, of using an-

ticipated changes in asset returns to estimate the IES is that the validity of the estimate

does not depend on a particular functional form for the utility function.

                                             6
financial advisors have long said that retirees should plan for less consumption than work-

ing people: he quotes a TIAA—CREF brochure stating that “you’ll need 60 to 90 percent

of current income in retirement, adjusted for inflation, to maintain the lifestyle you now

lead,” and he cites a popular press article writing that “many financial planners say it will

take 70 to 80 percent of your current income to maintain your standard of living when

you retire.” These sources suggest that households anticipate a drop in consumption at

retirement and, therefore, that this change is intentional.

        We employ two data sets. We use pseudo—panel data from the U.S. Consumer Ex-

penditure Survey 1984-2001 to estimate a consumption-Euler equation. The estimated

coeﬃcients are composites of underlying parameters from a life—cycle model with nonsepa-

rable consumption and leisure. As in previous studies, we find a substantial average drop in

household expenditure at retirement. Combining the consumption coeﬃcients, a life—cycle

model, and lifetime earnings profiles from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) panel

data, we use an equation measuring the model’s predicted optimal retirement age against

HRS data on retirement to extract estimates of structural parameters. We estimate, quite

precisely, intertemporal elasticity parameter values that are on the higher end of those

found and used in the literature: our IES for services is approximately 0.67, and we es-

timate an IES for consumption of 0.87. We then assess the model’s “out-of-sample” fit

by comparing its prediction of average household wealth at retirement with HRS data on

middle class net worth (data which did not inform the estimation). Despite the inclusion

of a drop in consumption at retirement, our model matches the wealth data remarkably

well.

        The organization of this paper is as follows. Section 2 discusses several of our key

assumptions. Section 3 presents our model and estimation strategy. Sections 4—5 discuss

our data and present our estimates. Section 6 compares simulations from our model with

HRS data on household net worth. Section 7 concludes.

                                               7
                                      2. Assumptions

      In this paper’s model, every household chooses its saving and labor supply to maximize

its utility subject to a lifetime budget constraint. Our analysis assumes that (1) the

work day is indivisible, (2) private—pension formulas do not aﬀect workers’ retirement

age, (3) household preference orderings may be intratemporally nonseparable with respect

consumption and leisure, and (4) perfect markets exist for annuities, health and disability

insurance. Our rationale for assumptions (1)—(3) is as follows.

Assumption 1: The work day is indivisible.

      Households in our analysis must either work full time or retire. While in practice

employers do oﬀer part—time jobs, the rate of pay is, on average, substantially lower than

that for full—time work.5 As Rust and Phelan [1997, p.786] write,

          The finding that most workers make discontinuous transitions from full—

      time work to not working, and the finding that the majority of the relatively

      small number of ‘gradual retirees’ reduce their annual hours of work by taking on

      a sequence of lower wage partial retirement ‘bridge jobs’ rather than gradually

      reducing hours of work at their full-time pre-retirement ‘career job’ suggests the

      existence of explicit or implicit constraints on the individual’s choice of hours of

      work.

An indivisibility assumption is also consistent with the fact that U.S. data show little trend

in male work hours or participation rates after 1940, except for a trend toward earlier

retirement 1940-80 (e.g., Pencavel [1986], Blundell and MaCurdy [1999], and Burkhauser

  5
      Reasons for the wage penalty for part-time work include daily fixed costs of startup

and shutdown, scheduling and coordination problems, employer concern for timely re-

turn on training investments, and the fixed—cost nature of some employee benefits (e.g.,

Hurd [1996]).

                                               8
et al. [1999]).

Assumption 2: Pension formulas do not aﬀect retirement ages.

     Although some analyses stress the importance of workers’ private pension plans as

determinants of retirement behavior (e.g., Gustman and Steinmeier [1986], Stock and

Wise [1990]), we assume that a worker chooses an employer whose pension plan matches

his requirements; thus, in this paper, private pensions form a part of private wealth accu-

mulation and do not require separate attention. Arguments in favor of explicitly modeling

the distinct features of private pensions seem most applicable to defined benefit plans;

however, in practice defined contribution plans have become more important. Even in the

past, many of the features of defined benefit plans originated at union initiative or during

collective bargaining, and thus presumably reflected worker preferences.

Assumption 3: Utility is intratemporally nonseparable in consumption and leisure.

     Although, for the sake of simplicity, this paper’s analysis assumes household preference

orderings are intertemporally separable, it makes consumption and leisure intratemporally

nonseparable. Since intratemporal nonseparability is central to this paper’s focus, we

examine its implications in detail.

     To see the restrictions imposed by intratemporal separability, consider a specific ex-

ample. A single—person household lives from t = 0 to t = T , choosing to retire at t = R.

The household’s time endowment at each age is 1; when the household works, its leisure

falls to ¯ ∈ (0, 1). According to assumption (1), indivisibilities force ¯ to be a fixed pa-

rameter. The wage is w; the interest rate is r. A household’s consumption ct yields utility

flow u(ct ); its leisure   t   yields utility flow v( t ); and, its assets (net worth) are at . The

household’s behavior solves

                                                         ¯, for t < R
                             subject to:     t   =
                                                         1, for t ≥ R



                               ȧt = r · at + (1 − t ) · w − ct ,




                                        a0 = 0 = aT .


As utility depends on the sum u(c) + v( ), this is the separable case.

     Provided u(.) is concave, specification (1) predicts that, even with a discrete increase

in leisure at retirement, there should be no abrupt change in consumption at that time.

To see this note that, along an optimal consumption path, the additional utility at date

s from one extra dollar’s consumption, u (cs ), must equal the additional utility from the

dollar if it were saved until later date t, by which time it will have grown to an amount

er·(t−s) . That is,



                                  u (cs ) = er·(t−s) · u (ct ) ,                         (2)


the so—called “Euler equation” for consumption. Letting ct− be consumption the instant

before t, and ct+ the instant after, condition (2) yields



                                      u (ct− ) = u (ct+ ) .                              (3)


With u (.) continuous, equation (3) is inconsistent with a jump in consumption at any age,

including at the age of retirement.

     While intratemporal additivity is the most common specification for utility in the

life—cycle literature, a number of authors instead assume nonseparable preferences. A

                                                 10
well—known example is Auerbach and Kotlikoﬀ [1987].6 We can easily modify example (1)

to accommodate their alternative. Let a household have a constant returns to scale “neo-

classical” production function f : R2 → R1 that combines current consumption and leisure

to generate a flow of services, the latter yielding a flow of utility, say, u(f ). The first line

of (1) changes to


                                           8   T    D           i
                                   max             u f (ct , t ) dt ,                        (4)
                                    R,ct   0


though constraints can remain the same. Because a bivariate constant—returns—to—scale

neoclassical production function has f12 (.) > 0, inputs are complementary in the sense

that more leisure (consumption) raises the marginal product of consumption (leisure).

If u(.) were linear, this complementarity would make the household want to increase its

consumption at (and after) retirement to take advantage of the increased marginal utility

of consumption that derives from higher leisure. If, on the other hand, u(.) is suﬃciently

concave, the household would strongly desire a smooth flow of services at diﬀerent ages;

hence, it would plan more consumption prior to t = R to counterbalance its abundant

service flow from leisure later. In the end, with nonseparability, rational behavior may

lead to an age profile of consumption which discontinuously changes in either direction at

retirement.

      A specific parameterization with nonseparable consumption and leisure makes clear

the connection between the change in consumption at retirement and the structural pa-

rameters of the life—cycle model, and it will form the framework for our empirical analysis

later. Let the intratemporal household production function f (.) be Cobb—Douglas:



                              f (c, ) = [c]α · [ ]1−α ,       α ∈ (0, 1) .

                                                    11
Let u(.) take the familiar isoelastic form


                                                         [f ]γ
                                               u(f ) =         ,   γ < 1.
                                                           γ

Recalling that changes from ¯ ∈ [0, 1) to 1 at retirement, condition (3) at retirement date

t = R is


           ([cR− ]α · [ ¯]1−α )γ−1 · α · [cR− ]α−1 · [ ¯]1−α = ([cR+ ]α )γ−1 · α · [cR+ ]α−1 ⇐⇒

                [cR− ]α·γ−1 · [ ¯](1−α)·γ = [cR+ ]α·γ−1 ⇐⇒
                                 γ·(1−α)
                [cR− ] · [ ¯]−    1−α·γ    = [cR+ ] .                                             (5)

    Equation (5) shows that the change in consumption at retirement provides useful

information for estimating the parameter γ, which determines the IES. Specifically, given

α and ¯, the change in consumption at retirement pins down γ. It is straightforward to

show that the change in consumption at retirement is strictly increasing in γ. In particular,

if γ is nearly 1, u(.) is nearly linear; and we have noted that in this case consumption jumps

up at retirement. More generally, whenever 0 < γ, consumption discontinuously rises at

retirement:


                                              γ·(1−α)               γ · (1 − α)
               cR− < cR+           if [ ¯]−    1−α·γ    > 1 ⇐⇒ −                < 0 ⇐⇒ γ > 0 .
                                                                     1−α·γ

On the other hand, the preceding algebra indicates that



                                              cR− > cR+ ⇐⇒ γ < 0 .

Thus, whenever γ < 0, the model predicts a discontinuous drop in consumption at retire-

ment and, because (cR+ − cR− ) is increasing in γ, the decline in consumption at retirement

grows larger as the taste for intertemporal smoothing increases (γ decreases).

                                                           12
    To summarize, our analysis illustrates that an abrupt adjustment in consumption

at retirement is consistent with rational behavior. Equation (5) also shows that data

on the size of change in consumption can help us to identify the taste for intertemporal

substitution. We now turn to this task of estimation.

                                         3. Model

    This section presents the model that is the basis for our empirical analysis. We first

elaborate the framework above to facilitate comparisons with data as follows: we allow for

changes in household size and composition that may influence households’ preferences for

consumption; and, we consider the possible role of liquidity constraints. Then we lay out

our estimation strategy.

Equivalent Adults. To confront data, we take into account the fact that households gain

and lose members over their life spans, and presumably desire greater consumption at ages

when their membership is larger.

    Following Tobin [1967], let the number of “equivalent adults” per household of age t

be nt . Let nt satisfy



                                nt = 1 + ξ S · nSt + ξ C · nC
                                                            t ,                        (6)

where the household’s head constitutes one equivalent adult, nSt is 1 if there is a spouse

and 0 otherwise, nC                                                  S     C
                  t is the number of children in the household, and ξ and ξ are equiv-

alency weights (relative to the head’s weight of 1). If a household’s age—t expenditure on

consumption is ct , let the household’s corresponding flow of utility be


                                           D ct      i
                                     nt · u f ( , t ) .                                (7)
                                               nt

The idea is that households internally allocate their lifetime resources “fairly.” To un-

derstand the outcome, consider a household facing interest and subjective discount rates

                                              13
of zero and suppose that      s   =   t.   Then in our framework, the household would want to

allocate budget x between periods s and t to solve


                                     D cs                 i           D ct      i
                          max {ns · u f ( ,          s)       + nt · u f ( , t ) }
                          cs , ct        ns                               nt


                                      subject to: cs + ct ≤ x .
      D          i
When u f (. ,   s)   is concave, a solution requires cs /ns = ct /nt ; so, utility maximization

implies


                                                     nt
                                              ct =      · cs .
                                                     ns

In other words, if the household consists of the head alone at s, five members at t, and the

latter constitute two equivalent adults, the household will allocate twice as much budget

for consumption at t as at s. If there are scale economies to household operation or public

goods that household members can share, the weights on spouse and children will be less

than 1. The smaller are ξ S and ξ C , the larger the advantages of scale. We will estimate

ξ S and ξ C .

Liquidity Constraints.     A large literature studies the potential eﬀects of liquidity con-

straints on life—cycle saving (e.g., Mariger [1986], Zeldes [1989], Hubbard and Judd [1986]).

To analyze actual behavior, we separately consider two cases. In the first, financial markets

are unwilling to extend loans without collateral; thus, if at is household net worth at age

t, we incorporate into our model a constraint



                                            at ≥ 0 all t .                                 (8)

In the second case, we allow at take any value (provided only that a0 = aT = 0). For

example, it is conceivable that unsecured credit—card debt has, at least in the last several

                                                     14
decades, enabled U.S. households to carry negative net worth balances. Or, inter vivos

transfers from parents to their grown children might largely eliminate the eﬀects of liquidity

constraints.

Model. The life—cycle maximization model upon which we base our empirical analysis is

as follows: for household i,


                                      8      T                  D cit             i
                            max                  e−ρ·t · nit · u f ( ,     it )       dt            (9)
                            Ri ,cit      0                          nit


                                                               F
                                                                   ¯, for t < Ri
                               subject to:            it   =
                                                                   1, for t ≥ Ri



          ȧit = r · ait + (1 −   it )   · eit · w · (1 − τ − τ ss ) + ssbit · (1 − τ /2) − cit ,




                                                 ait ≥ 0 all t ,




                                                  ai0 = 0 = aiT ,

where ρ is the subjective discount rate, and equivalent adults, nit , come from (6). House-

hold i supplies eit “eﬀective hours” in the labor market per hour of work time; hence, if w

is the economy wide average wage rate, the household earns eis ·w per hour of market work

at age s. Earnings include both the wages of the head and those of the spouse, if present

and working in the labor market. We assume a proportional income tax τ on earnings,

interest, and one half of Social Security benefits, ssbit . The real interest rate r is given

in net—of—tax terms. There is also a proportional Social Security tax τ ss . As above, we

take f (.) to be Cobb—Douglas and u(.) to be isoelastic. In our first case, we incorporate

                                                           15
liquidity constraint (8), as shown. In a second case, we analyze (9) omitting the constraint

ait ≥ 0 all t.

     The isoelastic utility function u(.) is standard. Our Cobb—Douglas specification for

f (.) has a number of advantages over a more general CES function that is sometimes used

in the literature: it does not imply secular trends in the average retirement age due to

technological progress; it is consistent with our aggregative approach in the sense that it

does not lead households of diﬀerent earning ability (i.e., diﬀerent eit in (9) at the same age

t) to behave diﬀerently; and, it allows exact identification below without disaggregative

data, time series variation in tax rates, etc.

Identification. This paper estimates two equations based on model (9). The first is the

Euler equation from utility maximization with respect to consumption; the second stems

from utility maximization with respect to retirement age. The parameters of ultimate

interest form a vector



                                     θ ≡ (α, γ, ρ, ξ S , ξ C ) .


With both estimating equations together, the elements of θ are exactly identified.

Euler equation. Suppose for a given retirement age Ri that we solve (9) for the utility—

maximizing life—cycle time path of consumption. We then face a concave maximization

problem with a convex constraint set. Liquidity constraint (8) introduces complications,

but Mariger [1986] provides an algorithm. The algorithm divides a lifetime [0, T ] into a

sequence of closed intervals Ii . On alternate intervals either the liquidity constraint binds,

in which case ct equals the household’s current resource inflow, or the constraint does not

bind, in which case the Euler equation, described next, holds. In practice, in every case

that we consider, the algorithm finds at most two intervals. In the last, the Euler equation

holds; if there are two, the liquidity constraint binds in the first. For simplicity, henceforth

                                                 16
our exposition assumes two intervals, [0, S] and [S, T ], with S < Ri .

      Consider s ∈ [S, Ri ). The arguments of Section 2 imply

So,


                                                    ciS    −(r−ρ)·(s−S)   cis
                                                        = e 1−α·γ       ·     .

In other words,


                                                    (r−ρ)·(s−S)

      The preceding expression, and the reasoning of (5), determine our consumption Euler

equation:

                                       ψiS · e 1−α·γ ·(s−S) · nis ,                if S ≤ s < Ri ,
                          cis =                 r−ρ                     −γ·(1−α)                                                   (10)

Integrating the budget constraints of (9), setting

for s < S, and setting cis from (10) otherwise, we obtain

Thus, ψiS reflects a household’s entire life course – including its earning ability, number

of children, and retirement age.

    Our empirical specification takes logarithms of both sides of (10) and appends a term

νis to the right side to reflect consumption measurement errors. From (6),



                                    ln(nis ) ≈ ξ S · nSis + ξ C · nC
                                                                   is .



Writing (10) at s ≥ S and again at s + 1, taking logs, and diﬀerencing, we have



                                     r−ρ
         ln(ci,s+1 ) − ln(cis ) =         + ξ S · [nSi,s+1 − nSis ] + ξ C · [nC        C

where we use the indicator function

                                                     0, if s < R,

    Diﬀerencing eliminates ψiS from (11). Removing the influence of, among other things,

varying earning abilities, is extremely convenient in practice – our Health and Retire-

ment Study data provide lifetime earning records for only one cohort of households, and,

although we have Consumer Expenditure Survey consumption data for many cohorts, the

latter data’s overlap with the cohort having complete earning information is short. Sec-

tion 4 estimates (11) as a linear regression equation.

Optimal retirement age. The four coeﬃcients of diﬀerence equation (11) are composites

of the five structural parameters of the underlying model: letting the vector β denote the

coeﬃcients of (11), we have

                                                     18
                                              r−ρ                γ · (1 − α) · ln( ¯)
              β ≡ (β1 , β2 , β3 , β4 ) ≡ (         , ξS , ξC , −                      ).   (12)
                                             1−α·γ                    1−α·γ

Even if we have estimated β, we need one more condition to identify α, γ, and ρ separately.

To complete our identification, we turn to a second equation stemming from maximization

of (9) with respect to retirement age Ri .

      For any parameter vector θ, one can solve model (9) for a household’s optimal retire-

ment age. After maximizing (9) with respect to consumption – our Euler—equation step

above – call the criterion V (Ri ). Our next step chooses the R which maximizes V (R).

Although V (.) may not be concave, our numerical calculation maximizes V (R) by trying

every monthly retirement age from 0 to T .7 Denote the optimal retirement age as g(θ).

Given our functional forms, even if households have diﬀerent wage rates, reflecting diﬀerent

inherent earning abilities, their desired retirement ages are the same. Preferred retirement

ages could, nevertheless, diﬀer in practice because households anticipate diﬀerences in

longevity due to heredity; households have diﬀering numbers of children; occupations dif-

fer in their physical and emotional stress, leading to occupational diﬀerences in eit at

advanced ages; households have diﬀerent health status; households have diﬀering tastes

for leisure; etc. To model possible variations in preferences, health, and demography, we

could modify the lifetime utility function of (9) to


                         8    T                                              8   T

accuracy we then solve the first—order condition V (R) = 0 – for the local maximum. A

derivation of the first—order condition is available from the authors on request.

preference for leisure. The optimal retirement age is then



                                      Ri = g(θ) + ηi ,                                   (13)

where Ri is the household’s actual retirement age, and ηi is a random error reflecting

deviations from average in ϕi .

Estimating the Structural Parameters Suppose our Euler equation generates an estimate

β̂ of vector β. We calibrate ¯ below. Letting x ≡ −β4 / ln( ¯), the fourth term of (12) yields


                               γ−α·γ              x
                          x=         ⇐⇒ γ =                 .                            (14)
                               1−α·γ        (x − 1) · α + 1

If we knew α, (14) would determine γ. The first term in (12) would then pin down ρ.

    Our strategy is as follows. We estimate β̂ from consumption Euler equation (11). Then

expression (14) shows that θ = θ(α , β̂). Combining the latter with (13), we estimate α

Fortunately, one can expect to be able to match any retirement age Ri with an α ∈ [0, 1].

For example, if α = 0, leisure but not consumption yields utility; so, households would

choose never to work at all. If α = 1, on the other hand, consumption but not leisure

yields utility; so, households would choose never to retire.

on equation (11). This section describes our data and results.

CEX Data. The primary data source for this section is the U.S. Consumer Expenditure

Survey (CEX). It is the most comprehensive source of disaggregate consumption data for

                                             20
the U.S. The CEX obtains diary information on small purchases from one set of house-

holds; for a second set of households, it conducts quarterly interviews that catalog major

purchases. The survey also collects demographic data and data on value of the respon-

dent’s house. At any given time, the sample consists of approximately 5,000 (7,000 after

1999) households each of which remains in the survey for at most 5 quarters. The survey

was conducted at multi—year intervals prior to 1984, and annually thereafter. This paper

uses the CEX surveys from 1984-2001.8

      Table 1 compares National Income and Product Account (NIPA) personal consump-

tion for 1985, 1990, 1995, and 2000 with weighted totals from the CEX.9 We exclude

household expenditures on pensions and life insurance from the CEX: the former consti-

tute saving, and our concept of earnings is net of insurance. Looking at the last row of

Table 1, total consumption measured in the CEX is only about 50-70 percent as large as

the NIPA equivalent, with the discrepancy higher in later years.10 This paper assumes that

the NIPA numbers are accurate; that item—nonresponse and other measurement errors of

the survey typically make CEX totals too low; and, that the relative magnitude of survey

errors does not systematically vary with age. Thus, for each year we scale CEX consump-

    We abstract from the empirical diﬀerence between consumption and expenditure (e.g.,

Aguiar and Hurst [2004]). Except in the case of housing, this paper draws no distinction

between consumer durable stocks and flows.

    There is a particularly large gap for “apparel” in 1985. The 1984 and 1985 data

files omit a number of apparel subcategories. We assume this does not create biases with

respect to age – so that our scaling procedure below is suﬃcient to eliminate the problem.

detail three additional adjustments concerning the treatment of housing services, health

care, and personal business expenditures.

    Deflating with the NIPA personal consumption deflator, we derive an adjusted con-

sumption amount for each age i and year t. This is our measure of cit . Due to the

construction of the CEX from separate interview and diary surveys, we do not have con-

sumption figures for individual households; however, we can form a pseudo panel of average

household consumption for each age and year. The number of interviewed households per

cell that we use below varies from 127 to 981. The left—hand side variable for our Euler

                                            22
equation is




                             ∆ ln(cit ) ≡ ln(ci+1,t+1 ) − ln(cit ) .


We organize the data so that a household’s age is the age of the wife for a married couple,

and the age of the single household head in other cases.

      The CEX provides information on whether the household is married. The latter

provides our regressor nS ∈ {0 , 1}. Although the CEX also reports number of children

ages 0-17, we are interested in the consumption of older children; hence, we construct our

own measure of children per household as follows. Using Census data on births per woman

at age i, i ∈ {15, ..., 49}, in year t ∈ {1920, ..., 2001}, we simulate the number of children

of each age for women of separate ages i in 1984,...,2001.11 As stated, our data set assigns

household observations to each age cell according to the age of the adult woman for all

but single male households. We append numbers of children to each cell on the basis of

the ages and birth dates of women.

      Similarly, the CEX survey questions on retirement are not ideal for our purposes.

The CEX interview questionnaire (e.g., http://stats.bls.gov/cex/csxce30201.pdf) only asks

whether the respondent is “retired” if he or she had zero weeks of work in the last twelve

months; therefore, we turn to the March Current Population Survey 1984-2001 for our

χs (Ri ) variable.12 , 13 We consider a household retired if the head is at least 50 years old

and answers that he or she is out of the labor force at the time of the March survey. For

male-female couples, the household is retired for our purposes if the male is at least 50 and

out of the labor market (in the March survey). We focus on male behavior because males

were more attached to the labor force in the cohorts of our data that reach retirement age,

and because our analysis abstracts from a detailed model of decision making within dual

earner households and home—work/market—work choices.

Regression Results. Tables 2-3 present regression results for (11). We use households of

age 20-80 for 1984-2001, so that our diﬀerences ∆ ln(cit ) cover ages 20-79 and years 1984-

2000. Each regression includes separate time dummies for 1984, 1985,..., 1999. The other

independent variables are a constant; presence of a spouse, nS ; retirement status, χ(R);

and, number of children 0-22, nC .

      Table 2 provides our estimates of β = (β1 , ..., β4 ). The first column includes households

as young as 20, but we worry that liquidity constraints may bind at the early ages. When

constraints bind, household consumption grows at the same rate as earnings – and faster

than the Euler equation dictates. Columns 2-4 successively exclude ages under 25, 30, and

35. The estimates in columns 2-4 diﬀer substantially from those of column 1 but not from

one another.

      Table 3 considers liquidity constraints more systematically. It incorporates all age

groups, but it includes separate dummy variables for ages 20-34. If liquidity constraints

bind in practice at a given age, we expect the corresponding dummy variable to have a

      diﬀerent from zero; however, the eﬀect seems to run its course by age 25.

rate for per capita consumption of 2.6%/yr. That suggests that between, say, ages 25 and

62, in the absence of retirement a household’s consumption per equivalent adult would

rise by a factor of 2.62. In Auerbach and Kotlikoﬀ [1987], for instance, the corresponding

factor is about 1.54; in Gokhale et al. [2001], it is 1.74; in Tobin [1967], it is 13.33. For

an infinite—lived representative agent model (e.g., Cooley and Prescott [1995]), the growth

rate of consumption in a steady—state equilibrium would, of course, match the growth rate

                                             26
of GDP.

      We estimate that the addition of a spouse raises household consumption by 44 percent.

This closely agrees with the U.S. Social Security System’s award of 50 percent extra benefits

for a spouse. Our estimate implies substantial returns to scale for larger households. Many

papers in the literature set ξ S = 1.0, and Table 2 suggests that such a calibration may be

misleading.

      Column 3 estimates a 16 percent drop in consumption at retirement. This is consistent

with, though at the smaller end of, estimates in Bernheim et al. [2001], Banks et al. [1998],

and Hurd and Rohwedder [2003] and the retirement brochures cited in Laitner [2001].14

      While our estimate of the decline in expenditure at retirement is relatively mod-

est, it may still represent an overestimate if the timing of retirement is, to some extent,

unanticipated and disproportionately driven by shocks that decrease lifetime income. Our

certainty equivalent model assumes that the relevant risk is fully insured and therefore

does not aﬀect the shape of the age—consumption profile. In reality, however, there may be

uninsured shocks. Unanticipated retirements driven by positive shocks to health or asset

returns, and therefore lifetime income, would likely be associated with discrete increases

in consumption. These cases would tend to bias our estimate of the anticipated change in

consumption at retirement upwards. Conversely, retirements driven by negative, uninsured

shocks would likely be associated with discrete decreases in consumption. To the extent

that retirement is unanticipated, and disproportionately driven by shocks that lower ex-

pected lifetime income, our estimates would overstate the degree to which the decline in

consumption at retirement derives from the nonseparability of consumption and leisure.

      The non—zero coeﬃcient and large t statistic on “Retired” in Table 3 reject intratem-

      Earlier drafts of this paper with less disaggregate treatment of medical expenditures

rejection does not heavily depend upon the form of our production function.

    Table 3’s fourth row indicates an increase in household consumption of 14 percent

for each child age 0-22. Since two parents correspond to 1.44 “equivalent adults,” a child

adds about 20 percent as much as each parent. Mariger [1986] estimates that children

consume 30 percent as much as adults; Attanasio and Browning [1995, p. 1122] suggest

58 percent; Gokhale et al. [2001] assume 40 percent; most of the analysis in Auerbach and

Kotlikoﬀ [1987] implicitly weights children at zero; Tobin [1967] assumes teens consume

80 percent as much as adults, and minor children 60 percent.

    One would expect that estimating the coeﬃcient for children would be diﬃcult. Al-

though the date at which a child enters a household is precise, in practice diﬀerent children

leave home at diﬀerent ages. Unfortunately, liquidity constraints may bind exactly when

many children are born (recall that our Euler equation only perceives changes in numbers

of children). Nevertheless, our estimated coeﬃcients on “Child 0-22” have small standard

errors and large t statistics. Our treatment does not, of course, measure reductions in

parental market work hours due to children. Although this omission surely aﬀects one’s

interpretation of our coeﬃcients, Section 5’s earning profiles do reflect women’s actual la-

bor force participation and hours – so this margin of choice enters our analysis in another

way. It may be true as well that parents spend a great deal on children but simultaneously

reduce expenditures on themselves, vicariously enjoying their children’s consumption. The

latter would not invalidate our analysis, but it might, again, suggest a diﬀerent interpre-

tation of the “cost” of children.

    One might worry that economywide shocks could aﬀect both general retirement be-

havior and consumption. Our regressions include year dummies – and they have little

eﬀect on the coeﬃcients of primary interest. Because macroeconomic shocks conceivably

aﬀect consumption diﬀerently at diﬀerent ages, we also perform GLS on a version of (11)

                                             28
in which we average every variable at each age over all years. Although the t statistics

drop because the number of degrees of freedom falls almost 95 percent, the coeﬃcient esti-

mates reconfirm Table 2: for ages 20-79, the new coeﬃcient estimates are, for the constant,

spouse, retired, and child variables, respectively, 0.0276, 0.8398, -0.0698, 0.1367; for ages

25-79, they are 0.0258, 0.4481, -0.1625, 0.1332; for ages 30-79, they are 0.0253, 0.4318,

-0.1589, 0.1298; and, for ages 35-79, they are 0.0230, 0.3025, -0.1507, 0.1137.


                                      5. Retirement

      We employ equation (15) to complete the estimation our model’s structural param-

eters. To determine the utility—maximizing retirement age for (15) from our model, we

need to specify earnings profiles, taxes, and interest rates; for the dependent variable of

a regression of (15), we need empirical retirement ages. For both earning profiles and

empirical retirement ages, this section turns to our second major data source, the Health

and Retirement Study (HRS).

Life Cycle Details. We assume a constant gross—of—income tax real interest rate of

5%/yr.15

 15
      Our real interest rate comes from a ratio of factor payments to capital over the market

value of private net worth. For the numerator, NIPA Table 1.13 gives corporate business

income, indirect taxes, and total labor compensation. The first less the other two is our

measure of corporate profits; the ratio of profits to profits plus labor remuneration is

“profits share.” We multiply the latter times corporate, noncorporate, and nonprofit—

institution income less indirect taxes. We add household—sector income (NIPA Table

1.13) less indirect taxes and labor remumeration. Finally, we subtract personal business

expenses (brokerage fees, etc. from NIPA Table 2.5.5, rows 61—64). The denominator

is U.S. Flow of Funds household and non—profit institution net worth (Table B.100, row

19), less government liabilities (Table L106c, row 20). We average beginning and end

                                             29
    We disregard government transfer payments besides Social Security. Our income tax

rate τ comes from government spending on goods and services less indirect taxes (already

removed from profits, and implicitly absent from wages and salaries below). Dividing by

national income, the average over 1952—2003 is 14.28%/year.16

    We assume a payroll tax of 15.3% per year. One—half of Social Security benefits are

subject to the income tax. In the calculations below, the Social Security benefit formula,

including the ceiling on taxable annual earnings, follows the history of the U.S. system.

    We assume that adults work 40 hours per week until retirement and 0 hours per week

after retirement. With 16 × 7 waking hours per week, we set17



                                ¯ = 16 × 7 − 40 = .6429 .
                                       16 × 7

    Our retirement—age calculation uses a representative household consisting of a hus-

band, wife, and two children. The wife reaches age 65 in the year 2000; the husband is 2

years older; the husband starts work at age 22 and marries at 24, with the latter being the

time at which the household begins; both children are born two years after the marriage;

and, both children leave home at age 22.18 Following U.S. mortality tables, the husband

dies at the end of age 74; the wife dies at the end of age 80. All of our calculations use

2000 dollars; our price index is the NIPA consumption deflator.

of year figures. The average ratio 1952—2003 is .0504. For comparison, Auerbach and

Kotlikoﬀ [1987] use 6.7%/year, Altig et al. [2001] 8.3%/yr., Cooley and Prescott [1995]

7.2%/yr., and Gokhale et al. [2001] use post—tax rates of 4%/yr. and 6%/yr.
  16
     Auerbach and Kotlikoﬀ [1987], for example, use 15%/year.
  17
     See also Cooley and Prescott [1995] – who, on the basis of time—use studies, determine

that households devote 1/3 of waking hours to work.
 18
     Notice that assuming two children per household produces a rough match with recent,

slow U.S. population growth.

                                            30
    We derive earnings profiles and retirement ages from the original HRS survey cohort,

consisting of households in which the respondent is age 51-61 in 1992. A majority of par-

ticipant households signed a permission waiver allowing the HRS to link to their Social

Security Administration (SSA) earnings history. Each history runs 1951-1991; the HRS

itself covers 1992, 1994, 1996, 1998, 2000, and 2002. In this paper, we use the HRS and

linked SSA records. For men, we estimate a so—called earnings dynamics model regressing

log earnings on a quadratic in age and dummy variables for time. Our regression error has

an individual eﬀect as well as a random term. The data is right censored at the Social

Security tax cap prior to 1980 and the Medicare tax cap 1980-1991, and our likelihood

function takes this into account. Assuming full—time work until retirement (and no work

thereafter), we predict an average earnings profile for a man who reaches 65 in 1998. Ta-

ble A1, Appendix II, presents predicted annual earnings. For women, we use the same type

of statistical model to predict earnings above the censoring limit. To allow for women’s

part—time work and absence at some ages from the labor force, we compute average earn-

ings in all other cases from the actual data. We then use the regression time dummies to

deduce an average earnings profile for women who reach 65 in 2000. Again, see Table A1.

Finally, since HRS earnings are net of employer benefits (including health insurance, pen-

sion contributions, and employer Social Security tax), we multiply household earnings for

each year by the ratio of NIPA total compensation to NIPA wages and salaries.

    We derive Social Security benefits after retirement from the statutory benefit formula

for 2000. Table A1, Appendix II, shows household benefits if the male retires at age 62

and his wife retires simultaneously, at age 60. Given our treatment of consumption, we

must also incorporate a stream of Medicare benefits after age 65, less participant SMI

cost. To do this, for each adult 65 and older, we add to household resources Medicare

benefits equaling the SMI annual premium for 2000 (i.e., $546) multiplied by the ratio of

HI and SMI total expenditures to SMI premiums for 2000 (i.e., 10.7282, less 1). Again,

                                           31
see Table A1.

Mean retirement age. We use the HRS as our source for empirical retirement ages; and,

for reasons described above we focus on male retirement. Measuring the empirical average

(male) age of retirement for this cohort is not entirely straightforward because the retire-

ment date of many respondents is not observed. Even in the 2002 wave of the HRS, not

all men have retired, and many men die or leave the survey before retiring. It follows that

an average of the retirement ages among only those observed to have retired will yield a

biased estimate of the population mean.

     We use a censored regression to extract an unbiased estimate. Of the 6214 men who

appear in one or more waves of the HRS, 727 retire before age 50 or provide insuﬃcient

information for our analysis. Excluding these, the sample is 5487. Among the latter, 3661

retire by the last available HRS wave, 2002. Their mean retirement age is 60.25. The

remaining 1826 men either (i) died before retiring, (ii) left the survey before retiring, or

(iii) continued to work as of the last interview in 2002. Our analysis treats the 1826 men

as right—censored at their age of death or last interview. The regression equation is



                                       Ri = µ + ηi ,                                    (16)


with dependent variable and error as in (15). Table 4 presents our estimate of the average

retirement age, µ̂ = 62.57.

Structural Parameter Estimates. Although the preceding discussion might seem to sug-

gest that we need to estimate (15) using a Tobit likelihood function, we can achieve exactly

the same outcome with a two—step procedure as follows: estimate µ̂ from (16); then solve

for the alpha, α̂, that satisfies


                                           D         i
                                     µ̂ = g θ(α , β̂) .

Our estimate of theta is θ̂ = θ(α̂ , β̂). The so—called delta method – which uses the

estimated covariance matrix for β̂ and the estimated variance for µ̂ – yields an estimate

of the asymptotic covariance matrix for θ̂.

    Table 5 presents our estimates of the structural parameters, with and without liquidity

constraint (8). The estimates of gamma vary from -.49 to -.58; the estimates of alpha vary

from .27 to .28. These correspond to estimates of an IES for services, 1/(1 − γ), of 0.63 to

0.67 and an IES for consumption itself, 1/(1 − α · γ), of 0.86 to 0.88. The estimates of the

subjective time discount rate, ρ, fall between .0117 and .0139. All are statistically diﬀerent

from zero at the 5 percent significance level. As explained above, we favor Euler—equation

estimates that employ data only for ages 25 and beyond; consequently, Table 5 presents

results based on Table 2 coeﬃcients for samples with ages 25-79, 30-79, and 35-79. The

bottom panel of Table 5 shows that liquidity constraint (8) makes little diﬀerence to our

estimation.

    As noted in the introduction, our estimates of gamma, alpha, and rho are similar to

a number of calibrations in the literature. For example, Auerbach and Kotlikoﬀ’s [1987]

γ = −3, α (roughly) = .5, and ρ = .004; and, Cooley and Prescott [1995] set γ = 0,

α = .36, and ρ = .053.

      Our results may be compared with estimates that have identified the IES from ex-

pected changes interest rates. Using aggregate consumption data Hall [1988], Cambell

and Mankiw [1989], and Patterson and Pesaran [1992], for example, estimate the IES for

consumption to be very nearly zero. Micro studies tend to estimate larger intertemporal

elasticities. Banks et al. [1998], for instance, estimate the average IES for consumption to

be approximately 0.5. In another example, Attanasio and Weber [1993] estimate an IES for

consumption of approximately 0.75 from micro data.19 Although we use a very diﬀerent

source of variation to identify the IES, our estimates are similar to, if on the larger end

of, those obtained in micro studies from the change in consumption growth with expected

changes in interest rates.

      As a check of the validity of the model, we note that if our a priori beliefs imply that

the subjective rate of time discount must be non-negative (ρ ≥ 0), our constant term in

Table 3 alone puts a lower bound on γ (c.f. Weil [1989]). In particular, suppose that ages

s and t fall before retirement but after liquidity constraint (8) has ceased to bind and that

household composition is the same at both ages. As in (2),



                                  u (cs ) = e(r−ρ)·(t−s) · u (ct ) ;

 19
      Barsky et al. [1997] use hypothetical questions to estimate an IES distribution for

their sample. They find an average IES of 0.2, with less than 20% of respondents having

an IES greater than 0.3. Others who have attempted to estimate a distribution of in-

tertemporal elasticities of substitution find evidence that the IES is increasing with wealth

(e.g., Blundell et al. [1994]).

                                                 35
so, if β1 is our estimated constant from Table 2, we have


                                                                    r−ρ
              u (cs ) = e(r−ρ)·(t−s) · u (cs · eβ1 ·(t−s) )   ⇐⇒         = β1 .
                                                                   1−α·γ

If ρ ≥ 0, it follows that


                                         r
                                            − 1 ≥ −α · γ .
                                         β1

With r = .05 · (1 − .1428), β1 = .0261 from Table 3, and α about .25, we then expect

γ ∈ [−2.56, 1.0]. All of the estimates of Table 5, in fact, fall comfortably within this

interval, though the derivation of Table 5 in no way imposes ρ ≥ 0.

    As stated, our estimate of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution is closer to

1.0 than many in the literature. Haider and Stephens [2004] argue that earlier—than—

anticipated retirement on the part of some households may bias one’s estimate of the av-

erage decline in consumption at retirement upward by one third. Aguiar and Hurst [2004]

argue that the decline tends to be overstated because increases in home production, includ-

ing shopping time, allow retirees to obtain more consumption per dollar of expenditure.

On the one hand, the latter may be interpreted as somewhat similar in spirit to increased

time for leisure in our model. On the other hand, a smaller empirical decline in consump-

tion at retirement would tend to move our estimated IES even closer to the zero—change

logarithmic case, where the IES is 1.0. For example, if we diminish our consumption drop

by one third in the middle column at the top of Table 5, our point estimates for gamma and

alpha become -.37 and .28, respectively; thus, our point estimate of the IES for consump-

tion/leisure service flows rises from .63 to .73, and our estimate of the IES for consumption

alone rises from .86 to .91.

    Finally, we believe that our analysis suggests a coherent description of the practical role

of liquidity constraints in the life—cycle model. Ostensibly, our results seem contradictory:

                                                  36
Tables 2-3 show evidence of binding liquidity constraints only through (female) age 22, but

Table 5 finds binding constraints through (female) age 30. One pattern in all solutions of

our model, however, is that constraint (8) binds, if at all, only at the beginning of life. If it

binds then, the reason is that future earnings are high in youth relative to current earnings

– making young households wish they could borrow against their future prosperity. In

comparing our diﬀerent tables, notice that the simulations of Table 5 apply to a cohort

that began working in the mid 1950s. At that time, especially in the 1960s, technological

progress was unusually fast, causing exceptionally rapid earnings growth. The young

households of Tables 2-3, in contrast, began working in the mid 1980s and the 1990s. The

time dummy variables from the male earnings regression generating Table A1 suggest an

average annual rate of technological progress 1960-1970 about 3 percent per year faster

than over 1980-2000. If we fix preference parameters from the middle column of Table 5 but

lower household earnings growth for 1960-69 annually by 2 percent, renormalizing the level

over all years to keep average lifetime earnings the same as before, we find that liquidity

constraint (8) binds only through (female) age 27. If we reduce the growth rate 1960-69

by 3 percent using the same steps, the liquidity constraint never binds at all. Evidently,

having the constraint bind in youth is a knife—edge phenomenon heavily dependent upon

the general rate of earnings growth at the time. In the end, we believe that Tables 2-3 and

5 are fully consistent: according to the model, peak growth rates over the period 1950-2000

can cause young households to hit liquidity constraints for almost their first decade; more

normal macroeconomic growth can make constraint (8) virtually irrelevant.



                                6. Household Net Worth

    In each wave, the HRS collects data on household net worth. This section compares

simulated net worth from our model with the survey data. As preceding sections make

no reference to wealth data, the reader can view the new comparisons as providing an

                                               37
out—of—sample evaluation of our model and parameter estimates. There is a second reason

the new comparisons are interesting: in contrast to many existing studies, our frame-

work incorporates “consumption paradox” behavior, which should tend to decrease wealth

accumulation prior to retirement.

     Table A2, Appendix III, presents summary statistics on HRS net worth. Survey “net

worth” consists of financial assets, equity in own business, real estate, and automobiles

– less debt. Our model focuses on married couples, and the table shows that they have

more wealth than average. Although our model implicitly includes private—pension equity

in household net worth, pre—retirement HRS net worth excludes defined—benefit pension

plans; thus, we further specialize our attention to married couples who are retired, and

we capitalize the pension flows that they report. Row 3 of the table shows that retired

couples are somewhat wealthier than couples in general; row 4 shows that private pensions

augment other wealth by about one quarter. Row 5 capitalizes Social Security Benefits as

well, which provides a measure of net worth that is nearly always positive.

     We then regress log comprehensive net worth on year, male age, and years since

(male) retirement – see Table A3, Appendix III. The regression restricts the sample to

couples whose male retired at age 59-65, and for each such couple, it uses the first valid

net worth observation. We use log net worth as our dependent variable (omitting the five

observations for which net worth is zero or negative – see Table A2) because we believe the

regressors should register percentage changes. Section 5 estimates an average retirement

age of 62.5; thus, we use the regression of Table A3 to predict comprehensive net worth at

male ages 62 and 63. We make the predictions for households in which the wife (assumed

two years junior to her husband) reaches 65 in the year 2000. In the case of retirement

age 62, for instance, if the standard error for our new net worth regression is s, the new

regression coeﬃcients are (ζ1 , ..., ζ22 ), v ≡ (1, 0, .5, .5, 0, ..., 0), and the matrix of regressors

in Table A3 is X, predicted net worth is

    than their husbands, we predict net worth for households whose wife turned 65 in 2000.


          Table 6 compares our model’s simulated net worth at retirement to our corresponding

     estimates from the HRS. The estimates of comprehensive net worth at retirement ages 62

     and 63 from the data, $719,000 and $736,000, respectively, closely match the corresponding

     values from simulations with liquidity constraint (8) – with simulated values from the

                                                    39
model being about 5 percent lower than estimates from the data. Simulations based on

formulations of the model without the liquidity constraint are about 10 percent lower than

values from the data. Household heterogeneity, and perhaps measurement error, make the

95 percent confidence intervals for our predictions from the data extremely wide (as the

coeﬃcient of variation in Table A2 foreshadows).

      In the end, our simulations quite closely agree with point estimates of comprehensive

net worth from the HRS. We should note, however, that, as is the case with most surveys,

the HRS does not pay special attention to the wealthiest families. The best known survey

that provides a high income sample is the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF). The SCF

2001 (e.g., Aizcorbe et al. [2003, Table 3]) seems to show noticeably more net worth than

Table A2.20 We think of our model as being calibrated to the U.S. population excluding the

extreme upper tail of the wealth distribution – with an analysis of the latter presumably

requiring a description of intentional bequests (e.g., Modigliani [1986], Laitner [2001], and

others).


                                     7. Conclusions

      A number of recent papers describe a substantial drop in household expenditures at

retirement, a drop that some argue demonstrates the limits of a strictly rational life—cycle

model. This paper reconciles the life-cycle saving model with the “retirement-consumption

puzzle,” and then uses the empirical change in expenditure at retirement to provide a new

and, we believe, attractive source of identification for parameters of the life—cycle model.

      We show that a tractable life—cycle specification with nonseparable intratemporal

 20
      We can compare the mean of $342,000 and median $143,000 from row 1 of Table A2

with SCF family net worth (see Aizcorbe) for head 55-64 (2001 dollars): 1995, mean

$442,000 and median $133,000; 1998, mean $579,000 and median $139,000; 2001, mean

$727,000 and median $182,000.

                                             40
utility, and with work options that are discrete, predicts a discontinuous change in con-

sumption at retirement. We then show that if one is willing to thus treat the change in

household consumption at retirement as a consequence of purposeful behavior, the magni-

tude of the change provides useful information for estimating life—cycle model parameters,

especially the elasticity of intertemporal substitution. Intuitively, if a household’s taste for

intertemporal smoothing is suﬃciently high, it will choose to decrease its consumption at

retirement so that lost utility from consumption oﬀsets gains from additional leisure. If it

has a lower desire for intertemporal smoothing, on the other hand, the household might

want to increase its consumption at retirement to take advantage of the complementarity

of consumption and leisure. The size, and sign, of the consumption change play a crucial

role in our estimation of households’ IES.

    Our strategy of using the consumption-retirement puzzle to estimate life-cycle param-

eters provides information about the robustness of existing IES estimates to variation in

method of estimation and decision domain. In addition, our method has the advantage

that it estimates the IES from changes associated with a highly predictable and consequen-

tial life event – retirement. The standard approach, which instruments for asset returns

in period t + 1 using economic variables known in period t, suﬀers from the problems of

weak instruments. We argue that, in this sense, changes in consumption at retirement

oﬀer a more robust and credible source of variation from which to estimate this critical

parameter.

    We implement our identification strategy using pseudo—panel data from the U.S. Con-

sumer Expenditure Survey 1984-2001 to estimate a consumption-Euler equation. The es-

timated coeﬃcients from that equation provide composites of the structural parameters

of our life—cycle model. As in previous studies, we find a substantial average drop in

household expenditure at retirement. Combining the consumption coeﬃcients with life-

time earnings profiles from Health and Retirement Study panel data, we use the model’s

                                              41
prediction of the optimal retirement age, together with HRS data on retirement, to extract

estimates of the structural parameters of the model.

      Despite our distinctive method, we estimate intertemporal elasticity parameters that

are consistent with, if on the higher end of, those found and used in the literature. We

estimate, with considerable precision, an IES for services of approximately 0.67 and an

IES for consumption of 0.87.

      Our estimated model performs well when we compare its predictions about retirement

wealth holdings with actual wealth data from the HRS (which did not inform our estima-

tion), and the model interestingly suggests that liquidity constraints may play a role in

determining the path of consumption at young ages. Because the model is especially well

suited for studying retirement behavior, our future work will use our estimates to perform

policy experiments to obtain quantitative predictions of, for example, the eﬀects of possible

Social Security reforms on the labor supply of older Americans.


            Appendix I: Three Further Adjustments of the CEX Data

      1. We subdivide “shelter” into “services from own house” and “other.” We scale

the latter as we do other categories, but we drop the CEX “services from own house”

and impute a substitute that allocates the annual NIPA total service flow from residential

houses to the CEX in proportion to CEX reported house values.

      2. CEX medical expenditures omit employer contributions to health insurance and

services that Medicare covers. We annually, proportionately, and for every age adjust

CEX expenditures on private health insurance to match the Department of Health and

Human Services total for all premiums for private health insurance; and, we adjust out—

of—pocket health spending from the CEX to match annual DHHS totals.21 Turning to

 21
      See http://www.cms.hhs.gov/statistics/burden-of-health-care-costs/table01.asp. The

annual figures cover 1987-2000. We extrapolate to 1984-86 and 2001 using the growth rate

                                             42
Medicare, funding for the benefits comes from a hospital insurance (HI) tax on wages

and salaries, monthly premiums for supplementary medical insurance (SMI) from people

currently eligible for benefits, and contributions from general tax revenues to SMI. The

CEX registers only SMI premiums from participants; so, we allocate the yearly total of

Medicare benefits (both HI and all SMI expenditure) to the CEX sample in proportion to

SMI premium payments (principally for people over 65).22

    3. The NIPA “personal business” category includes bank and brokerage fees, many

of which are hidden in the form of low interest on saving accounts, etc., and hence absent

from expenditures which CEX households perceive. We assume that bank and brokerage

fees make their way into the life—cycle model in the form of lower—than—otherwise interest

rates on saving; therefore, we normalize annual personal business expenditures measured

in the CEX to match the corresponding NIPA amount less bank and brokerage fees, and

omit bank and brokerage fees from our measure of consumption.

    Mortality: male age 74; female age 80. If survey reports “pension continues at death,”
    spouse receives full pension share after respondent’s death; if “pension reduced at death,”
    spouse receives half share after respondent’s death; otherwise, we assume pension flow
    stops with respondent’s death. We multiply all survey pension flows by 1 − τ .
f. After age 62, spouse receives larger of one—half husband’s Social Security benefit and own benefit.
    After husband’s death, spouse receives larger of own and husband’s benefit.
    We multiply all Social Security benefit flows by 1 − τ /2.
