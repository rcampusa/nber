Aggregate Savings in the Presence of Private and Social Insurance

                               ABSTPJCT

        In   the presence of uncertain lifetimes, social security has the

characteristics of an annuity: a consumer pays a tax when young in exchange

for receiving a social security benefit if he survives to be old. If

consumers have identical ex ante mortality probabilities, then a fully

funded social security system would offer a rate of return equal to the

actuarially fair rate available on competitively supplied private annuities.

In this case fully funded social security would be a redundant asset and

would have no effect on consumption or national saving.

        In this paper, consumers have different (publicly known) ex ante

mortality probabilities and consequently can buy actuarially fair private

annuities offering different rates of return. If the social security system

does not discriminate on the basis of cx ante mortality probabilities, then

the introduction of social security induces a redistribution of income

from consumers with a high probability of dying young to consumers with a low

probability of dying young. Under homothetic utility this redistribution

reduces aggregate bequests and aggregate consumption of young consumers in the

steady state; the steady state national capital stock can either increase

or decrease. If consumers display at least as much risk aversion as the

logarithmic utility function, then average steady state welfare is increased

by the introduction of fully funded social security.

I.     Introduction

           Over the last decade there has been a lively debate over the effects

of social security on consumption and capital accumulation. This debste has

distinguished between a pay-as-you—go social security system and a fully

funded social security system. A balanced-budget pay-as-you-go systei

levies taxes on young consumers and uses the tax        revenue to pay   the social

security benefits of old consumers. In a standard overlapping generations

model    in which     consumers have no bequest motive (e.g. Diamond (1965)), the

saving of young consumers is reduced both by the tax they pay when they

are    young and   by the benefit they receive when they are old. Thus, the private

(and    national) capital stock is reduced by the introduction of pay—as-you—go
social security (See Feldstein (1974)). However, if consumers obtain

utility from the utility of their heirs, as well as from their own cor.su.mDtion,

then the introduction of        pay-as-you-go social security will not affect
consumption      or   private capital accumulation; as shown by Barro (1974),

consumers will adjust their bequests in order to offset the lump-sum

intergenerational transfers imposed by the social security system.

           In contrast to pay—as-you-go social security, the introduction of

fully funded social security has no effect on        consumption or the national
capital stock, regardless of whether or not consumers have bequest motives.
The reason for the irrelevance of fully funded social security is that the

implicit rate of return on social security is the same as the rate of return

on private wealth. Consumers will offset an increase in social security

taxes and benefits by reducing private saving while maintaining unchanged

consumption.

           In   order for fully funded social security to affect consumption and
the national capital stock, the rate of return on social security must differ
                                            —2—




from the rate of return on privately traded assets. If consumers have

random dates of death, then a social security system which taxes young

consumers and gives benefits only to consumers who survive to old age has the

characteristics of an annuity. The gross rate of return on this publicly

provided non-tradable annuity will exceed the rate of return on private

assets which are not contingent on survival. If there is no private annuity

market, and if     consumers   have no   bequest   motive, then the introduction

of fully funded social security reduces the steady state national cajital ztock

and narrows the distribution of wealth (See Abel (l985a)). However, if

there were a competitive annuity market, then the rate of return on private

annuities would equal the rate of return on social security and hence social

security uld have no effect.

          The possibility for fully funded social security to have an effect

on the consumption and portfolio decisions           in   the presence of a competitive

annuity   market   arises when we introduce heterogeneous ex. ante mortality

probabilities.      If, as in actual     practice, the social    security systen does
not   discriminate across individuals in a cohort according to the probability

of death, then social security has real effects under two alternative

information structures. First, if annuity companies know the ex ante mortality

probability of each individual, then a competitive annuity market will

provide annuities with different rates of return to consumers with different

mortality probabilities. Clearly, in such a case, some individuals must

face different rates of return on private annuities and on social security.

In general, the consumption and investment decisions of these people will

be affected by changes in social security. Alternatively, if an individual's

ex ante mortality probability is private information observable only by that

individual, then heterogeneity introduces adverse selection into the private

annuity market. However,the social security system is immune to the problem
                                          —3—




of adverse selection because of the compulsory nature of social security

taxes and benefits. Again, for at least some consumers, the rate of return

on social security differs from that on private annuities so that the consumptior

arid   portfolio   decisions of these people are affected by changes in the level

of     social security. In    this paper, I assume the first structure

of     information   i.e., public information; in a companion paper (Abel (1985b))

I make the alternative assumption of private information.

           In order to analyze the effects of social security on steady

state welfare, it is not sufficient to determine the effect on the steady

state capital stock, especially in an economy with heterogeneous consumers.

The effects    on the    aggregate capital stock and aggregate welfare can be in

opposite directions for two reasons: first, well-known Golden Rule

considerations       imply that aggregate consumption and the aggregate capital
stock    can move in opposite directions; second, and more importantly, it will

be shown that social security narrows the steady state cross-sectional

distribution of consumption which tends to increase average steady state

welfare.

           Much of the existing literature on uncertain lifetimes examines the

consumption    and portfolio behavior of an individual, taking as given any
wealth received by the individual in the form of bequests.1 In the next
two sections of this paper, I also analyze the individual consumer's decision
problem. In section II, I state and solve the consumption and portfolio
decision problem of a consumer who lives for either one period or two periods
and who can hold his wealth in the form of riskless bonds and actuarially

fair annuities. As a step toward analyzing the aggregate behavior of hetero-

geneous consumers, I show in section III that consumption and bequests are

increasing functions of expected lifetime wealth. In addition, for a given

value of expected lifetime wealth, consumption and bequests are increasing
                                        —4—




functions of the probability of dying young.

          After examining individual behavior, I then analyze steady state

behavior allowing for the eridogenous adjustment of bequests using an

extension to uncertain lifetimes of the Modigliani-Bruxnberg (1954) -

Samuelson (1958) - Diamond (1965) overlapping generations model. Previously,

Abel (1985a,b), Eckstein, Eichenbaurn and Peled (1985) and Sheshinski and Weiss

(1981) have examined uncertain lifetimes in an overlapping generations

framework. Sheshinski and Weiss (1981) assumed that all consumers in a

given cohort have identical ex post mortality experiences whereas Abel

(1985a,b) and Eckstein, Eichenbaum and Peled (1985) allow for consumers with

the same ex ante mortality probabilities to have different mortality

experiences ex post. By allowing ex post mortality experiences to differ, these

models generate intra-cohort variation in bequests and have implications

for the intergenerational transmission of inequality. In this paper, I allow

for different ex post mortality experiences, but the presence of actuarially

fair annuities eliminates the intra—cohort variation in bequests received

and left by members of a given cohort with identical ex ante mortality
                 2
probabilities.

          In section IV, I analyze steady state consumption and bequest

behavior and present sufficient conditions for the existence of a unique

steady   state. Then I demonstrate that the steady state values of consumption
and bequests are higher for families with a high probability of dying young.
In addition, I   show   that fully funded social security narrows the steady-state
intra—cohort   distributions of consumption and bequests. In section V1 I

restrict the analysis     to homothetic utility functions and show that fully
funded   social security reduces steady state aggregate bequests and steady

state aggregate consumption of young consumers. The steady state aggregate

private capital stock is crowded out by a degree greater than, equal to,
                                      —5—




or less than one-for-one depending on whether the steady state consumption

of young consumers is less than,   greater   than, or equal to the inheritances

received. Then in section VI, I show that if utility function is sufficiently

concave (more concave than logarithmic utility), then average steady state

welfare is increased by the introduction of fully funded social security.

     ConsumrtiOfl and Portfolio Behavior of an Individual

          In this section we analyze the consumption and portfolio behavior

of an individual consumer who does not know when he will die. We show that

f the consumer can buy actuarially fair annuities, and if the utility

from leaving a bequest is independent of the consumer's date of death,

then the consumer will leave the same          bequest   whether he dies young or old.

Furthermore, as shown by Sheshinski and Weiss (1981), the consumer will

hold riskless bonds to provide for his bequests and will hold annuities to

provide for consumption when old.

         Consider consumers with the following life-cycle of events:

At birth, each consumer receives an initial inheritance I from his parent.

During the first period of his life the consumer earns a fixed labor

income Y, pays a social security tax (T<Y) and consumes an             amount c1. At

the end of the first period, the consumer selects a portfolio to carry his

wealth, I+Y-T-c1, to the next period. There are two assets: an actuarially

fair annuity and a riskless bond. One unit of output invested in the

annuity yields A units of output to the consumer if the consumer survives

to the second period; if the consumer dies after one period, his estate

receives nothing from the annuity. Let Q denote the number of units of

output   that the consumer invests in an annuity. The consumer invests the
remainder of his wealth 14-Y-T-c1—Q in a riskless bond which pays a gross
rate of return R to the   consumer   if   he   survives, or   to   his estate if he
dies after one period.
         At the beginning of the second period, the consumer gives birth
to G>l children. There is a probability p          that   the consumer dies at the
beginning of the second period after giving birth to G heirs. If the
consumer dies at the beginning of the second period, each of his heirs
                                           —7—




  receives a bequest BD/G, where ED is equal to the consumer's riskiess

  bonds with accrued interest,


                              ED                                                       (1)
                                   =(I+Y-T—c1—Q)R

            If the consumer survives in the second period, he receives a

 social security payment S (5>0) in addition to the principal and interest on

 his portfolio of bonds and annuities. The consumer then consumes an

 amount c2 and gives the remainder of wealth, BS, to his heirs, where


                           BS (I+YT        Q)R + QA + S -                                (2)
                                                          c2

This    total bequest, ES, is divided equally among       the   consumer's G children.

          At the end of the   second period, the consumer dies. Because we have
assumed that the consumer does not live beyond the second period, all uncertainty
is resolved at the beginning of the second period. Therefore, the bequest,
BS, can be given to the consumer's heirs at the beginning of the second period,
i.e.,    at the beginning of the first period of his heirs' lives. Thus, we can

assume, as stated above, that all inheritances are received at birth.3

          The consumer's utility function is assumed to be additively separable.

In particular, the utility function is specified as

                 U(c1) + (l—p)6U(c2) + p5V(BD) +     (l—p)V(B5)                          (3)


where ó>o is the one—period discount factor, U( )          is   the utility index of the

consumer's own consumption and V( ) is the index of utility derived from

leaving a bequest. We assume that U( ) and V( ) are strictly concave and

satisfy the Inada conditions urn tJ'(c) =        = urn    V'(B) and lini U'(c) = 0 =
                                   c0               B-O
lizn   V' (B).
B-
The utility function in (3) can be viewed simply as the expected value of utility
                                            —8—


where the only uncertain element is the consmer's date of death. Since the

 utility function is a function of the bequest left to the consumer's heirs, it

 is an example of what Yaari (1965) has called a "Marshall utility function".4'5

        The consumer's optimization problem is to maximize (3) subject to (1)


 and (2). Substituting (1) and (2) into (3) and then differentiating with

 respect to C1, C2, and Q, respectively, yields


                  U'   (c1) =   6R[pV' (BD) + (].—p)V'   (BS)]                     (4a)




                                U' Cc2) = V.     (ES)                              (4b)



                        pRV' (BD) = (l—p)   (A—R)V' (BS)                           (4c)




 We now assume that annuities are actuarially fair which implies that


                                   R = (l—p)A                                      (5)


 That is, the eçected return on an annuity is equal to the return on a
 riskless bond. Substituting (5)       into (4c) yields


                                V1 (BD) =   Vt   (BS)                              (6)



The strict concavity of V( ) then implies that BD = BS.          Let B = ED = BS

denote the optimal level of bequests. Since BS = ED, it follows imrnediatel

from ecuations (1)     and (2) that


                                                                                   (7)
                                 c2=QA+S

        Thus, in the presence of a market for actuarially fair annuities,
annuities are used to provide for second-period consumption and riskiess

bonds are used to provide for bequests, and shown by Sheshinski and Weiss
                                            —9—




(1981). The interpretati.on of (7) that second-period consumption is

equal to the payoffs from annuities recognizes that the social security

payment S is contingent on survival and thus is appropriately viewed as

an annuity. It is clear from (7) that if the social security benefit S is

less than second-period consumption c2, the consumer will hold a positive

amount of annuities. Alternatively, if S is greater than c2, then the

consumer  would want a negative position in annuities. If actuarially fair
-life insurance (which pays a gross rate of return to the consumer's estate
if he dies young and pays zero if he dies old) is available, then the consumer
can,   by holding   life   insurance   and bonds,6   achieve the same   payoff structure
as   provided by a negative holding of annuities.

III.   The Effects of Changes in the Probability of Death and Changes in Wealth

         In   this section we calculate the effects of variation in the
probability   of death and variation in expected lifetime wealth on consumption

and portfolio decisions. We will show that consumption at each age and

bequests are increasing functions of the expected present value of lifetime

wealth. Also, for a given level of expected lifetime wealth, consumption at

each age and the amount of bequests are increasing in p. These results will

be useful in later sections when we aggregate over consumers with different

probabilities of dying.

        The income expansion path is easily derived from (4a,b) and (6)


                      U'(c1) = fSRV'(B) =   RU'(c2)                               (8)



The strict concavity of U( ) and V( ) implies that    dc2 >
                                                            0   and dB   > 0   along
                                                         1           1

the income expansion path. Furthermore, because consumers can buy actuarially

fair annuities, the income expansion path is independent of p.

        The choice of c1, c2 and B is constrained by a lifetime budget

constraint. Using (1), (2), (5) and the fact that B = BS = BD, the lifetime

budget constraint can be written as7


                       c1 + (l—p)R1c2 + R1B =     W                               (9)




                       where W E I + Y - T + (l-p)R1S.

According to (9), the expected present value of lifetime purchases (of

consumption and of bequests) is equal to expected lifetime wealth. The

optimal values of c1, c2, and B are determined by the intersection of the

income expansion path in (8) and the lifetime budget constraint in (9).

        Given the fixed value of R, the optimal values of c1, c2, and B can

each be expressed as functions of W and p. Clearly, c1, c2 and B are each
                                     —"-




increasing functions of W. As for the effect of an increase in p,

note that if some bundle (c1, C2, B) satisfies (9), then an increase in

p holding W constant will make the relevant expected present value of

purchases on the left hand side of (9) smaller than W. Hence, c1, C2,

and B will all be increased along the expansion path until the budget

line (9) is satisfied. Therefore,we have

           c. =   c.(W,p);              >o,           > o; i =   1,    2            (iDa)




           B = B(W, p);
                                 -   >0,      > 0.                                  (lOb)




We have shown that the partial effect of an increase in p, holding w constant,

is to increase c1, c2, arid B. However, since W =     I   + '   -T   + (l-p)R is,


an increase in p will, if S > 0, decrease W and tend to offset the increases

in c1, c2, and W. Of course, if S = 0, then this offsetting effect is absent.

In general, the total effect of an increase in p is to increase (decrease)

c1, C2, and B if S is less (greater) than c2. If S = C2, then the consumer

holds no private annuities or life insurance and the optimal values of c1, C2,

and B are invariant to p.

       in addition to determining the qualitative effect of W on E as above,

it will be useful to calculate the magnitude of this effect. Totally

differentiating the lifetime budget constraint (9) with respect to c1, c2,

B and W yields


                     dc1 + (l-p)R1dc2 + R1dB =   dW                                 (ii)



Logarithmically differentiating the income expansion path (8) yields

IV. The Steady State Cross-Sectional Distributions of Consumption and Bequests

            In this section we demonstrate that if R<G, then there exists a

unique positive steady state         level   of bequests. It is well-known from the

Golden Rule literature that R<G characterizes a dynamically inefficient

steady state, and hence we would also like to analyze steady state behavior

under the alternative assumption that R>G. However, if R>G, then the

existence of a positive steady state level of bequests depends on the

parameters of the utility function as well as on R and G; we defer

discussion of the existence of a positive steady state level of bequests

with R>G until section V where we restrict attention to homothetic utility.

However, before restricting the utility function to be homothetic, we are

able to show in this section that the introduction of fully funded social

security narrows the steady state distributions of consumption and bequests.

            In   previous sections we derived the optimal consumption and
portfolio behavior of an individual with probability p of dying after               one

period.     Henceforth, we assume that all descendents of an individual face
the same probability p as the        individual.      However, we allow for   heterogeneity

of   p across members of the same cohort and we index          consumers   by their
probability       of dying after one period. We will say that a consumer is a

type   p   consumer   if   his probability of an early death is equal to p. In

order to rule out a known date of death, we assume that 0 < p <               1.   Let H(p)

be the fraction of consumers in each cohort who have a probability of

early death less than or equal to p. Let             p be the population average
                                                 1
probability of early death so that p =           I pdH (p). In order to rule out
                                                 0
aggregate uncertainty, we assume that a fraction p of type p consumers does

indeed die early. Thus p is the fraction of consumers of each cohort who die

early.

            Since each consumer has G children, the assumption that a consumer's
                                                          —14—

bequest is divided equally among his heirs implies that I =
                                                                                  B/G.     (The

consumer born in period t receives an inheritance I and leaves a total

bequest B.) Using (lOb) it follows that the sequence of bequests in a

family with a given probability of dying, p, evolves according to the first-

order nonlin€ar difference eution


                                  =
                                            t-l         + Y - T +   A'S,   p)                     (14)


         A steady state level of bequests, B*, must satisfy the difference

equation (14) with                                B. Below we specify a siTnjle sufficient

 condition for the existence of a unique positive steady state level of

 bequests.

           Proposition 1. If R<G, then there exists a unique steady state

 level of bequests B*>O.

           Proof. Existence: Since urn V' (B) =, the optimal bequest is
                                                     B-O

 positive if (B_i/G) +                Y —   T +   A'S>O.     Therefore, since Y — T + A'S>O,

 if B=O, then Bt>Bti. Observe from (9) that, setting I =                            Bi/G
 we have

                c1 +     (
                                 p)R'c2+ R'Bt =              t_i/G     Y-T+A15


where           is the consumption of a consumer of age i born in period t. Using

(15) we obtain


               Be_i —        =                      +            + (l_P)c2, - R(Y—T+A1S)          (16)
                        Bt        (l_R/G)Bt_i

 Since lim V'(B) = 0 and U'(c)>O for finite c, it follows that Rc, +                       (l_p)c2
        B-'°

 exceeds R(Y-T+A1S) for sufficiently large Bt1. Therefore, for large

 enough Bt1 the right hand side of (16) is positive and hence Bt<Bti.

 Since Bt= B((Bu/G) + Y—T+A1S,p) is a continuous function, there exists

 some B*>0 such that B* =              B(B*/G+Y_T+A'S,p).
                                                 —15—




        Uniqueness: It suffices to show that dBt/dBt 1<1 at any positive

steady state level of bequests. It follows from (13a) and (14) that


                         dB
                                      =
                         dBtl               G'                B)                        (17)
                                                  (p,c1, C2


It follows (l3b) that G(p, c1, C2, B)>GR1 so that if G>R, then

G(p, C1,   C2, B)>l.               q.e.d.


        To establish the existence of a unique steady state when R>G we

need some additional restrictions on the utility function. We postpone

the analysis of this case until section V when we introduce homothetic

utility. The following useful proposition allows us to characterize the

steady state cross-sectional distributions of consumption and bequests. Note

that it does not require R<G.


        Proposition 2. If there exists a unique positive steady state level

of bequests, then B/aW<G when evaluated in the steady state.

       Proof. Since urn V'(B)=°, it follows that if BtiO then Bt>B1=O.
                       B-*O


In addition, the existence of a unique             positive   steady state, Bt=Bl=B*,

implies that

                              —l                    >
                   + Y-T+A
       B((Bu/G)                    S,p) -
                                            B1.O          as B1..B*                     (18)



The proposition follows immediately from (18).                     q.e.d.

       We can now compare the steady state behavior of families with

different probabilities of dying young. We begin by comparing bequests.

Let B*(p) denote the steady state level of bequests for a type p family.

       Proposition 3. If there exists a unique B*(p)>O for every p, and if

the social security payment S>O is sufficiently small, then dB*(p)/dp>O.
                                            -16-




             Proof. Observe fron (14) that B* satisfies


                                   E((B*/G) + Y-T +   (l-p)R   1S,p)               (19)

 Ttalv differentiating         (9 with respect to B* and p yields



                       (1 -   C'       )   dB   = (    -   R1S     ) dp             (20)



 The existence of a unique positive steady state level of bequests implies
               dB
 that G      =        < 1 when evaluated at B* (Proposition 2) . Therefore,
               dE
                  t-l
 the coefficient of dB* in (20) is positive. Recall from (lob) that 2. > o

 so that for small enough S, the coefficient of dp is also positive.

 Therefore dB*/dp>O.          q.e.d.

           One may be tenpted to explain Proposition 3 by arguing that an

increase in p is an increase in the frequency with which people die

young leaving large bequests. However, we have shown that with a market

for actuarially fair annuities, consumers leave the same bequest whether

they die after one period or after two periods. The explanation for

Proposition 3 is that, provided S is small, an increase in p reduces the

expected present value of expenditures on the left side of the budget constraint

(9) for given values of c1, c2, and B. Provided that s>o is small, (in

particular, if S<c2), the reduction in expected expenditure exceeds the

reduction in expected lifetime wealth on the right hand side of (9)       ,   thereby
permitting the consumer to increase C1, C2 and B. This reasoning suggests

the following Corollary.

     0,       > D and          >           q.e.d.

          We now consider a fully funded social security system. In such

a system, the total benefits to a cohort are eaual to the return on the

system's investment of that cohort's contribution. We will limit our

attention to a social security system which does not discriminate on the

bsis of an individual's probability of dying early.8 Therefore,in an

actuarially fair system, the taxes and benefits satisfy

                                        RT = (l—p)S.                                       (21)



 It follows from (5) and (21) that the expected net present value of social

 security benefits for a type p consumer is


                                                       p-p
                                    -T+A-l S=-T —                                          (2
                                                       1-p

According to (22) ,   the     introduction of fully funded social security increases

the expected lifetime wealth of consumers with a low p (less than p) and

decreases the expected lifetime wealth of consumers with a high p (greater

than p). The effects on the steady state distributions of consumption and

bequests are given by the following proposition.

          Proposition 4. Suppose that there exists a unique positive steady

state level of bequests for families of every type p. Then, provided that

S>0 is small, an increase in fully funded social security, RdT=(l-p)dS>O,

WI]] narrow the steady state cross—sectional distributions of c1, c2 and B*.

          Proof. Substituting (22 into (19) yields

 T. Since dC,*(p)/dp > 0 (Corollary 3.1),                                  it follows     that an   increase
 in T causes ci*(p) to move toward c.*(p).                                       q.e.d.

         The intuition underlying Proposition 4 is quite straightforward.

 For   consumers           with a low probability of dying early, the annuity offered
                                            -19—




by social security system has a rate of return,              ,   which exceeds the

rate of return available from private annuity companies                .   Thus

an increase in social security effectively raises the wealth of the ccrsuxriers

with p <   p.    Hence these consumers increase consumption and bequests.

As for consumers with p >     P'   an increase in social security forces them

to hold annuities with a lower rate of return than on annuities in the

private market; for these consumers, an increase in T effectively lowers wealth

and leads to a reduction in bequests and consumption. Finally observe that for

consumers with p=p, an increase in social security has no effect since these

consumers can undo the effects of an increase in social security by reducinc

their holdings of private annuities.

       In Abel (1985a) it was also shown that an increase in the level of

actuarially fair social security will narrow the steady state distributions

of bequests and consumption. It is worth noting how Proposition 4 differs

from the result in Abel (l985a) .      In   the previous paper, there are no

annuity markets, no bequest motive and no heterogeneity of ex ante mortality

probabilities. In the model presented there, all bequests are "accidental";

bequests are equal to the wealth of consumers who die after one period.

The introduction of social security reduces the need to save for retirement

consumption and thus reduces the siz.e of accidental bequests. Since all

)r4tra—cohort variation is due to intra-cohort variation in becuests,

the reduction in all positive bequests reduces intra—cohort variation.

However, in the current paper with actuarially fair annuities, consumers

with the same wealth and the same ex        ante   mortality probabilities leave the

same bequest    whether they die young or old. Thus, for consumers with a given
p, there   is   no intra—cohort variation in bequests or consumption. The intra-
cohort variation is across consumers with different ex ante ucrtality

probabilities.    the extent that the social security system forces' everyone
to hold a particular asset in their portfolios, it reduces the intr-cohort
variation in portfolios and hence in bequests and constnption.

 V.    The Effects of Social Security on Steady Statc Aggregate Capital and
          S urn   t ion
        Much of the literature on the effects of social security has focussed

 on its   effects         on   the   long-run aggregate capital stock. Presumably the

 reason for examining the effects on the capital stock is that if the long—

 run   capital     stock is below        the   Golden Rule capital stock, then if social

 security reduces the long-run aggregate capital stock, it will also reduce

long-run aggregate consumption. The implication of the reduction in aggregate

consumption is evidently that aggregate welfare is reduced. We argue in this

section and the next section that, for two reasons, the emphasis on the long-run

capital stock is misplaced if one is actually interested in Social welfare.

First, as is well-known from the Golden Rule literature, the long-run aogregate

capital    stock and long-run            aggregate consnption can xve in opposite

directions    in response to social security. Second, and zrre inortantly,
with heterogeneous consuners, it can happen                            that aggregate consuntion is
reduced    but aggregate welfare is increased by social security. This
apparent contradiction can be explained by observing that social security
narrows the       distribution         of consumption.
          We restrict our attention henceforth to                        the case of homothetic utility

as in Hakansson (1969), Fischer (1973), and Richard (1975) .                           There are two

reasons for restricting the utility function to be hornothetic. First, we can

present necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a unique

steady state which do not require R<G. Second, homothetic utility implies

linear decision rules which are easily aggregated.

         Suppose that U(c) and V(B) are characterized by constant and

equal coefficients of relative risk aversion G


                                               U(c) =
                                                        C

                                                            1-0



                                                      = A   Bl_Cl
                                               V(B)                                                    (28b)
                                                             1-a
                                                —22--




Note that U( ) and V( )         are   each strictly concave and satisfy the Inada

conditions. Therefore, Propositions 1—4 apply to this specificationof

the utility function.

         Homothetic utility is particularly convenient because it implies that

the income expansion path is a ray through the origin. Using (28a,b) ,                        the
income expansion path in (8) can be expressed as


                            =           where                 (6XR)°                            (29a)
                                01B                01




                       C2    = 02B      where      02 =   A°                                        (29b)


Substituting (29a,b) into the lifetime budget constraint (9) yields


                            B(p) =    _!_ (I
                                        (p)
                                                 + Y — T +        A'S)                              (30a)




         where           (p) 0 + (l-p)R102                    +   R1                                (30b)



it follows from (13b) and (29a,b) that 4(p) in (3Db) is simply

(p, c1, c2, B) evaluated under the assumption of homothetic utility. In

this   case,   '(p, c1, c2, B) is independent of C1, c2, and B and is simply

a decreasing function of p. Recall from the proof of Proposition 1 that

the steady state will be unique if G>l. The analogous result for homothetic

utility is given below.

         Proposition 5. Suppose that U( )               and   V( )   have   equal constant

degrees of relative risk aversion as specified in (28a,b) .                      There will

be a unique positive steady state level of bequests, B*(p), if and only if

G(p)>1, where (p) is defined in (3Db).

         Proof. Setting I equal to B/G in (3Da) yields


                            B*(p) =               (Y-T+A'S)                                     (31)

           In the remainder of this section
                                                         we analyze the effects of changes in
 fully funded social security on various
                                                         aggregate magnitudes in the steady
state. We adopt the notational convention of
                                             using two asterisks to denote
th€ avra€ valuE of a variable in the steady state. For exairtle,

               1
B**        / B*(p)d}i(p).        We will demonstrate below that an increase in fully
           0
funded social security decreases aggregate bequests and aggregate consumption

of young consumers in the steady state. The steady state national capital

stock will be increased or decreased depending on whether consumption of

the young is greater or less than the inheritance they receive. Whether

aggregate consumption in the steady state increases or decreases depends on

whether the interest rate exceeds the growth rate as well as whether the

consumption          of the young is greater or less than the inheritance they
receive.


A.    Steady State Bequests

          To       examine the effects of fully funded social security on steady state
bequests,          substitute (22) into (31) and integrate over all types p to obtain


                                  1
                         B** =   I G(p) -l  G        -

It   is evident from (32) that an increase in T redistributes resources away
                                                                                  G

relative risk aversion as specified in (28a,b) and that G(p)>l for all

p in the support of H(p). Then an increase in fully funded social security

reduces aggregate bequests in the steady state4 B**.

B. Steady State Consurnption

            Now we examine the effects on aggregate consumption of consumers of

each age. The steady state aggregate (per capita) consumption of the
                             1
young cohort is c1 E1c1*(p)dH(p). Since the ratio of c1 to B is f3] for

all consumers, it follows immediately that


                                        =
                                            e1B                                    (33)



Equation (33) and Proposition 6 lead to

            Proposition 7. Under the assumptions of Proposition 6, an increase

in fully funded social security reduces the aggregate consumption of the

young.

            Although social security unambiguously reduces the steady state

consumption      of   the young, it can either reduce, raise, or leave unchanged

the steady state aggregate consumption of the old cohort. To understand

why the effect on the consumption of the old is ambiguous, recall that,

in the long run, social security raises both the first-period and

second-period consumption of consumers with p<p and reduces the first-

period and second-period consumption of consumers with p>. Consumers with

p<p represent a larger share of the old generation than of the young

generation because of their higher survival rates. Thus, even though
                                                        —25-




 average first-period consumption is unambiguously reduced in the long

 run, it is possible for average second—period consumption to be incxeaseó

 in the long run.

          Let    c2** denote    the steady state consumption (per capita) of the

 old generation and observe that

                                    1
                           c2* =    f    (i_p)G1C2*(p)dH(p)                                               (34)

 The    factor   (l-p)G1 reflects the facts that (a) only a fraction (l-p)

 of    type p coruxners survives,             and (b) each cohort is only G                 tirrs as

large as the succeeding cohort. Substituting (25) into (31) . and using

 (29b) and (31) ,     equation      (34) may        be rewritten as

                                1

The factor —                , which      is the steady

                         (l-p)02                    l-(01 +  R1)G                R

                                                             (l—p) 02
It is clear from (36) that the factor                                    is decreasing in p if and
                                                          c(p)—l
only if (0] + B ')G>l. Therefore, since social security transfers resources

from high p consumers to low p consumers, the redistribution is from
                                                               (i—p)0 2
consumers with a low value of the factor                                       to consumers with a high

value of this factor if and only if (01 +                       R1)G>l.          Therefore we have

C. The Steady State Cpital Stock

         Let K*(p) be the steady state capital stock of type p consumers and

     1
K** f K*(p)dH(p) be the aggregate steady state private capital stock. We

will measure K** at the end-of-period, that is, before interest is accrued.

At the end of a period, all privately owned capital is held by young

consumers; the surviving old consumers have already consumed c2 and have

already given the remaining wealth to their heirs. Thus, the private capital

stock is equal to inheritances received by the young, I**, plus net labor




                                         I
income, Y—T, minus first-period consumption, so that


                                    =        +    Y—T —
                                                              c1                              (38)



Since I**=B**/G and c1 = 61B**, equation (38) can be rewritten as


                                    = Y — T +       (G1       —                               (39)
                                                                   01)B**

Equation (39) and Proposition (6) imply

         Proposition 9. Suppose that U( ) and V( ) have equal constant

relative risk aversion as specified in (28a,b) and that G(p) > 1 for

all p in the support of H(p). Then the effect on the long-run aggregate

private capital stock of an increase in fully funded social security is


                         dK** >     —l       as           0
                            dT <                              1<                              (40)


         In   a fully funded social security system, the long—run aggregate

national capital stock K.L*, is equal to K** +                    T,   the sum of aggregate private
                                                   —27—




capital K** and the government capital stock. Therefore, the following

corollary to Proposition 9 is obvious.

          Corollary 9.1. If the assumptions of Proposition 9 hold, then

under fully funded social security


                    dK *   *

          To interpret the condition in (40) and (41), observe that since

c1** = O1B** and B**= GI**, we have c1**=G011**. ThaTt is, in comparing

steady states, GO1 is the response of consumption of young consumers to

changes in the inheritances they receive. The introduction of fully funded

social security reduces B** and hence reduces I** and c1**. If GO1 is less

than 1, the reduction in first period consumption is smaller than the

reduction in inheritances and the national capital stock falls. Alternativey,

if GO1 is greater than 1, the reduction in c1 exceeds the reduction in

inheritances and the national capital stock rises.

          It is useful at this point to present the aggregate resource constraint

of the economy. In the steady state, the aggregate disposable resources

of the private sector are given by Y + (R/G)K** + (l—p)S/G - T where Y - T

is the net labor income of the young, (R/G)K** is the per capita gross

income accruing to privately-held capital carried over from the previous

period, and (l-p)S/G is the per capita social security income of the old.

The private sector uses these resources for consumption c**Ec** +
                                                                           c2
and (gross) capital accumulation K**. Equating c**+K** with total disposable

resources yields

                   c =         Y-T   +   (1—p)S/G + (R/G —     l)K**            (42)



Using condition (21) for fully funded social security we obtain
                                             —28—




                              y   + (P/c — 1)       (K** +   T)                         (43)



 Equation (43)displays the well—known result from the Golden Itile literature

 that an increase in the steady state national capital stock leads to an increase,

 decrease, or no change in aggregate consumption depending on whether

 the net rate of return to capital is greater than, less than, or equal to

 the population growth rate.

          Equation (43) and Corollary (9.1) imply the following:

          Corollary 9.2. Suppose that the assumptions of Proposition 9 hold.

 Then, under fully funded social security



                   dc** >
                          C             as                           0

The condition in (44) has a simple interpretation12. The direction of

the effect of social security on the national capital stock is given by

the sign of 6 -    G1   (Corollary 9.1) .           The direction of the effect of a change

in the   capital stock on   aggregate consumption is given by the sign of

P—C,   as is well known from      the   Golden Rule literature.
         Propositions 6 through 9        and   their corollaries describe the
conditions under       various aggregate magnitudes either increase or
                   which

decrease in response to an increase in fully funded social security.
Only bequests and consumption of the young have unambiguous responses

to social security. The effects on consumption of the old, aggregate

consumption, and the national       capital stock are sunwarized in Figure 1.

existence of a steady state depends or €2   A   and max (the largest value

of p in the population) as well.

       It is not obvious how one might best choose an estimate for the crucial

parameter 0 in the two-period lifetime model presented above. However,

I will offer a casual guess without pretending it is anything more than a guess.

As is clear from Proposition 9 and its Corollaries, the critical value of

   is G'. Recalling that       is the steady state ratio of aggregate

consumption of the young to aggregate inheritances received at birth, a

reasonable guess is that the bequest motive is sufficiently weak so that

this ratio is greater than one, which implies that 01>G')3 In addition,

it appears that the marginal product of capital is greater than the populaticn

growth rate so that R1<G1. As is clear from Figure 1, these two guesses irn1y

that the national capital stock, consumption of the old, and aggregate

consumption are all increased by fully funded social security, whereas

aggregate bequests and aggregate consumption of the young are decreased.

 VI.    Steac,y State Welfare

           In this section, we examine the effect of an increase in social

 security on the steady state level of aggregate welfare. Our measure

 of aggregate welfare is simply the sum of the individual utilities of

 all consumers in a given cohort. We demonstrate that if consumers are

 sufficiently risk-averse, then the introduction of social security will

 increase steady state aggregate welfare.

           Let (p) be the maximized value of the individual utility

function (3) subject to the constraints in (1) and (2) .               Restrictin
U( ) and V( ) to have equal constant relative risk aversion as in


(28a,b) , we can use the income expansion path in (29a,b) to obtain

                                      -c
                                    ____                1-c —   y(p)
                                     1—c
                                           (p) [B(p)J
                                                                                          (4)
 where y(p)        1 +   (l—p+X).
 Let   c?*(p) be   the steady state value of c2(p).



 It is clear from (45) that         for a given p steady state welfare Q*(p) is
an   increasing function of the steady state bequest B*(p). Therefore, in view

of Proposition 4, an increase in fully funded social security increases steady

state utility for consumers with p<p and reduces steady state utility for

consumers with p>p.

           To examine the effects of social security on social welfare, we

of course, need to specify a social welfare function. We use a utilitaria

social welfare function which is the sum of the utility of all consumers

in a given cohort. The steady state level of social welfare                    is

       E      *(p)j(p)       so that evaluating (45) in the steady state we have


                    =                                                               (46
                                (p) [B*(p))l_GdN(p) -
                                                           (P)

We will limit our attention to the                    introduction        of a small amount of social

security into an economy without social security. Substituting (31) into

(46) ,   differentiating       with respect to T, and evaluating the derivative

of T=D yields

 where                      3(p) =   -()          G(p)-l
                                                                   )lo                                        (47b)

          We n state and prove

          Proposition 10. Suppose that tJ(                       ) and   V( )       have   equal and constant
 relative       risk aversion as specified in (2Eab) and that G(p) > 1 for all

 p in the support of H(p). Then if G(p) >                                , the       introduction of actuarially

 fair social security increases steady state welfare.

          Proof. From (47a) and the Lemma, it is clear that dT                                           0
                                                                                                  T0
 if J'(p) > 0 for all p in the support of H(p). Differentiating (47b) with

 respect to p and simplifying yields



                             (p)                                                :     1                       (48)
                                         G(p) -   1                 G(p)

 Since        ' (p)   < 0   and G(p) —l > 0, it is clear that if GG(p) —                               1 >   0, then
 3' (p)   >    0.      q.e.d.

          Corollary 10.1. Suppose that G(p) > 1 for all p in the support of H(p)

 and that c         > 1.    Then the introduction of actuarially fair social security

 increases steady state social welfare.
                                          —33-.




       We have shown that the introduction of actuarially fair social security

 can reduce steady state aggregate consumption but, if the CRRA            utility
 functions U( ) and \T( ) display at least as much risk aversion as the

 logarithmic utility function, it increases steady state social welfare.

 Although a reduction in aggregate consumption may seem, at first, to be

 inconsistent with an increase in social welfare, these results are

 easily reconciled by the observation that social security reduces the

 variation in bequests and consumption (Proposition 4). If the individual

 utility functions are     sufficiently   risk averse, the welfare-improving

 effects of reduced variance outweigh the welfare-reducing effects of

 reduced aggregate consumption.

       Corollary 10.1 indicates that if the coefficient of relative

risk aversion is greater than or equal to one, then the welfare-improving

effects of reduced variance are strong enough to raise social welfare.

Alternatively, if the coefficient of relative risk aversion is sufficiently

small, then the introduction of social security will reduce steady state

welfare. A sufficient condition is given in the following corollary.

       Corollary   10.2.   Suppose that 1 <       G(p)   <   for   all p in the support

of H(p). Then the introduction of fully funded social security reduces

steady state welfare.

VII.   Conclusion

          The social security system essentially forces all workers to hold an

annuity    in their portfolios. If the rate of return on this annuity is equal
to the rate of return on the private annuities which a consumer holds, then      the

consumer    can offset the effects of social security simply by reducing his
holding of private annuities. However, if the rate of return on social
security differs from the rate available to the consumer in the private annuity
market, then changes in the level of social security will, in general, force
the consumer to change his cons urrtion      portfolio behavior. Thus,
                                          and/or

in a world in which consumers all face the same rate of return on social
security   but face different rates of return   on private annuities, changes
in social security will affect the behavior of at least some individuals.

       In this paper, we have assumed that each consumer can    buy private
annuities   at an actuarially fair rate of return. After presenting sufficient

conditions for the existence of a unique steady state equilibrium, we

then established that increased social security narrows the steady state

distributions of bequests and consumption. We showed that fully funded

social security will crowd out steady state private wealth by more than,

less than, or exactly one-for-one depending on whether steady state

consumption of the young is less than, greater than, or equal to steady state

inheritance received by the young. We also established simple conditions

which determine whether steady state aggregate consumption rises, falls,

or remains unchanged. Finally, we showed that if individual utility functions

are sufficiently risk—averse, then fully funded social security increases

steady state social welfare because it reduces inequality; however, if

individual utility functions display very little risk-aversion, then social

welfare is reduced by social security.

1. See, for example, Yaari (1965), Hakansson (1969), Fischer (l973).

    Richard (1975), Barro and Friedman (1977) ,      Levhari   and Mix-man (1977)

    and Kotlikoff and Spivak (1981) .     Kotlikoff   and Spivak (1981) analyze

    the role of the family in providing annuities but stop short of a general

    equilibrium model in which the distribution of bequests is determined

    endogenously.


2. If there are annuities and if consumers derive some utility from

    leaving bequests, then in general there will be intra—cohort variation in

    bequests received and left by members of the same cohort with

    identical ex ante mortality probabilities. (See Abel (1985b) .)           Only if
    the   rate of return on   annuities is actuarially fair will there be no

    intra-cohort    variation in bequests by consumers who can live either one
    period or two periods.

3. We are using the term "inheritance" to        refer to a transfer received from

    one's   parent, regardless   of whether the parent is alive.


4. We follow Yaari (1965), Hakansson (1969), Fischer (1973) and Richard (1975)
    in   specifying utility as a function of the size of the bequest left

    to one's heirs. An alternative formulation which gives rise to a

   bequest motive is to specify utility as a function of the utility of one's

   heirs' as in Barro (1974)


5. More generally we might specify the utility of bequests as a function V(B,G)

   where B is the size of the total bequests and each child receives B/G.

    However, since G is assumed to be fixed exogenously, we can write the

   utility of bequests simply as a function of B.
