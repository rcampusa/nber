                                              ABSTRACT

This study uses a human capital model to estimate the societal cost of producing a physician service.
Physician human capital consists of the underlying human capital (productivity) of those who become
physicians and the job-specific investments (physician training) added to this underlying capital. The
value of physicians' underlying human capital is estimated by forecasting an age-earnings profile for
doctors based on the characteristics in youth of NLSY cohort participants who subsequently became
doctors. Published estimates are used to measure the total cost (wherever paid) of investments in physician
training. These data are combined to compute the societal cost per primary care physician visit. The
estimated societal cost per primary care physician visit is much higher than the average co-payment
per primary care service and generally higher than the current Medicare compensation rate per service
unit The private return to primary care physician training is relatively low, in the range of 7-9%. At
current levels of supply, the marginal social costs of primary care visits appear to be equal to or greater
than marginal social benefits.

       A spate of recent studies has drawn attention to looming shortages of physicians,

and particularly of primary care doctors. Cooper et al. (2002) estimate that by 2025 the

US will experience a shortage of 200,000 physicians. Colwin et al. (2008) predict a

shortage of between 35,000 and 44,000 primary care physicians by 2025. In response to

these predictions of shortage, health workforce planners have been calling for an infusion

of public funds into the education and training of physicians and medical educators have

begun to take steps to expand physician supply (Iglehart, 2008).

       The market for physician services in the United States is distorted on both the

demand side and the supply side. Very few consumers of physician services pay the full

cost of their visits. The vast majority are covered by health insurance and subject to

modest copayments. Some of the remainder receive publicly subsidized services. Thus,

the demand for physician visits need not reflect the willingness to pay for these services.

       The supply of physician services is also distorted. The number of available

physicians and their distribution across specialties is constrained by the availability of

residency positions in US hospitals and, for US medical students, by the number of slots

available in US medical schools.       Conversely, substantial government subsidies to

undergraduate and graduate medical education may artificially expand the supply of

training slots and the supply of physicians. Thus, the price physicians charge for their

services need not reflect the social opportunity cost of producing these services.




                                                                                              1
       The existence of these supply and demand distortions suggests that neither the

observed market price for physicians’ services nor the equilibrium quantity of services

provided is necessarily (or even likely to be) socially optimal. These distortions in the

market for physician services are further exacerbated by licensure-associated restrictions

on the nature of medical training and on the scope of practice of alternative providers.

These regulatory restrictions on the availability of lower cost alternatives to customary

physician services further limit the extent to which the market-derived price and quantity

of physician services can be assumed to be optimal.

       The distortions throughout the physician service market, together with the

extensive public role in subsidizing undergraduate and graduate medical education and

the publicly-sanctioned role of physician organizations and medical colleges in

determining the number of available slots in medical school, mean that formal workforce

planning continues to be important in this market. Prior efforts at workforce planning

have had, at best, mixed success in correctly anticipating how many physicians ought to

be produced (Snyderman, Sheldon, and Bischoff, 2002).

       This paper offers a novel approach to workforce planning in the physician market.

Rather than projecting the future demand for physician services, we use a human capital

model to assess the societal cost of producing a physician service. The social planner

will choose a quantity of physicians such the societal cost of producing a physician

service is equal to the (societal) benefit of such a visit. The human capital approach also

provides direct estimates of the degree to which physicians earn rents.

       We compute estimates of the opportunity cost and direct cost of developing and

deploying primary care physician human capital. Our estimates suggest that the marginal




                                                                                         2
cost of a primary care physician visit is between $51 and $77 and the marginal cost of a

primary care physician-provided Medicare relative value unit (RVU) of work is between

$37-$50. These estimated costs are substantially higher than the average co-payment for

a physician visit and generally above the price of a Medicare RVU or the full price of the

marginal primary care service. At current levels of supply, the marginal social costs of

primary care visits appear to be equal to or greater than marginal social benefits. We

estimate that the private return to primary care practice is between 7-9%.          These

estimates suggest that substantial increases in primary care physician supply are unlikely

to be socially beneficial. Moreover, at current fee levels, such increases are unlikely to

occur. Alternative, lower cost, strategies are needed for supplying primary care services.



History of Workforce Planning

       The supply of new physicians in the United States is determined by the number of

students who complete medical residency programs. New medical residents may be

graduates of American medical schools or graduates of foreign medical schools. All

must complete a residency before they may practice medicine in the United States.

       The number and size of medical schools and the number of funded residency slots

in the United States have varied over time with workforce projections. Planners in the

1960s, responding in part to the introduction of the Medicare program, anticipated an

enormous increase in the demand for doctors. This expectation led to substantial federal

support for the establishment of new medical schools and a doubling of the national

medical school class size (Salsberg and Forte, 2002). The full effect of these increases

was not realized until 1980.




                                                                                         3
       By 1980, the introduction of managed care had led to a re-evaluation of the

demand for medical services.     Two influential studies (Graduate Medical Education

Advisory committee, 1981 and Council on Graduate Medical Education, 1992) argued

that there was likely to be a surplus of physicians. In response, federal support for the

development of new medical schools ceased, and the Association of American Medical

Schools [AAMC] advised its members to refrain from expansion (AAMC 2006).

Congress ceased providing general funding to undergraduate medical education

(Blumenthal, 2004). The total M.D. class remained constant for the next 25 years.

       Residency programs receive subsidies from the Medicare program, and from

many state Medicaid programs and other state government programs. In the mid-1990s,

the expectations of a future physician surplus led the major medical and medical

education societies to call for a reduction in the number of federally funded residency

positions to one closer to that of the number of graduating medical students (Dunn,

Miller, and Richter, 1998).    This goal was realized through the cap on Medicare

residency funding established under the 1997 Balanced Budget Act.

       Current estimates of future shortages of physicians are based largely on a new

econometric forecast model developed by Cooper, Getzen et al. (2002). This model

predicts the future demand for physicians based on both demographic factors and income.

The model incorporates a substantial income elasticity of demand for physician services

and, thus, projects an increased demand for physician services in an era of economic

growth. In response to these new predictions of physician supply shortages, the AAMC

has called for a thirty percent increase in medical class size and the number of students

admitted to US medical schools has increased for the first time since 1982. The AAMC




                                                                                       4
is also calling for a substantial infusion of public funds into the expansion of physician

supply, through an increase in Medicare funding for residency (graduate medical

education) programs (Iglehart, 2008).

           .

A Human Capital Approach to Workforce Planning

           A physician service is produced through physician labor and human capital,

combined with other labor and capital goods (office space, office staff, stethoscopes,

nursing staff, etc.). The average cost of a physician service is the total cost of the

physician’s human capital and of all the other labor and capital goods used over the

physician’s career, divided by the number of patient-valued services delivered by the

physician throughout his career.

           Physician human capital consists of the inherent ability of those who become

physicians, combined with the cost of the education and training they receive (high

school, college, undergraduate medical school, and a residency program). The basic

human capital earnings equation states:

       T                S
                            ( s + Y 0) R ( r + Y 0)
(1)   ∑     Y 1−Y 0 =
      t = R (1+ i )
                    t ∑
                      t = 0 (1 + i )
                                     t
                                       +∑
                                        t = S (1 + i )
                                                       t




Where Yo is the opportunity cost of physician time in the best alternative career; Y1 is the

level of earnings of physicians after they have been trained; T are years of worklife; S are

the number of years of undergraduate medical education at a direct cost of s each; R are

years of residency (graduate medical education) at a direct cost of r each and i is the

discount rate.

If we assume that Y0 and Y1 are constant over the worklife, and that doctors and non-

doctors work the same number of years, this implies that:


                                                                                          5
        T                S                 R                 T
                                s                 r                Y0
(2)    ∑       Y1 =
       t = R (1+ i )
                     t ∑
                       t = 0 (1 + i )
                                     t
                                       + ∑
                                         t = S (1 + i )
                                                       t
                                                         + ∑
                                                           i = 0 (1 + i )
                                                                          t




            This implies that the average cost of a physician visit (C) can be expressed as:

                S                     R                     T
                         s                     r                    Y0
              (∑                     +∑                    +∑                )
               t =0   (1 + i )
                                 t
                                     t =S   (1 + i )
                                                       t
                                                           i =0   (1 + i ) t
(3) C =
                                             V

            where V is the number of visits a physician produced over a physician’s worklife.

            Many of the inputs into physician services – particularly education and training --

are fixed. Over their employed lifetimes, we expect physicians to choose the scale at

which they operate – that is, hours worked – to minimize average cost. At the most

efficient scale, the marginal cost of an additional service should be equal to the average

cost of services. From an optimal societal investment perspective, then, the average cost

of services provided by a given physician (which, in equilibrium, should equal marginal

cost) should equal the marginal value of services generated by that physician.

            Regulation, licensure, and other institutional impediments have largely fixed the

attributes of physicians and the training they receive. We assume that neither the average

opportunity costs of prospective physicians nor the per-physician cost of physician

training vary with the number of physicians over the policy-relevant range1.

            Most medical services appear to exhibit diminishing marginal benefit. Increasing

the number of physicians produced will allow services of lower benefit to be added to the

mix of services, bringing down the average valuation. Conversely, reducing the number

of physicians available will raise the average value of those services produced. Thus, the

social planner equates the costs and benefits of physicians’ services by changing the

number of physicians produced.

        Based on this set-up, we can estimate the value of Y1, by constructing estimates

of Yo and finding estimates of the other parameters from the literature. Using published

sources to estimate s, r, S, R, and V, we can estimate the societal cost of producing a

physician service.

Measuring Opportunity Cost

        The largest element in the cost of physician services is the opportunity cost of

physician time. Physician productivity in medical service delivery must be sufficient to

offset the opportunity cost of time while practicing and the opportunity cost of time spent

in earlier training.

        We calculate the opportunity cost of physician practice by estimating what the

earnings of future physicians would have been had they chosen an alternate profession.

To do this, we rely on the fact that the demand for admission to medical school exceeds

the supply of medical school positions. Entry into medical school is rationed primarily

by applicant test scores and grades. Students who are good at standardized tests and get

good grades are most likely to get into medical school. In 2008, for example, the average

matriculant at an American medical school had an MCAT score of about 30.8 (the 80th

percentile) and an average total GPA of 3.65. Medical school matriculants had high

GPAs in both their science and non-science courses, suggesting that they were good all-

around students, as well as strong in biological and physical sciences. [AAMC: Facts

Table 17]




                                                                                         7
       Unfortunately, only students who hope to attend medical school take MCAT tests,

and medical school aspirants also take different classes in college than do other students.

To estimate opportunity costs, we would like to have a measure of aptitude and

achievement before students differentiate themselves according to future occupational

choice. We do this by using data collected in high school to forecast the ‘alternative

profession’ earnings of high school students who went on to become doctors using

information on those who completed college but chose careers other than medicine.

       We conduct these analyses using the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth

(NLSY79).     The NLSY79 is a nationally representative survey of 12,686 men and

women, which contains extensive information about the characteristics of sampled youth

in their late teens (ages 14-22). The survey tracked these youth annually through 1994

and biennially since then. The NLSY79 collects an extensive array of information,

including family socioeconomic characteristics, respondent background, occupational

information, and annual income. The study also contains information about respondent

aptitudes and achievements measured before they made choices about future occupations.

The aptitude and achievement measures we use are the Armed Forces Qualification Test

(AFQT) and High School GPA. The AFQT is a measure of trainability and is a major

criterion for armed forces enlistment. The AFQT score is derived from select sections of

the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB), using a methodology

developed by the U.S. Department of Defense. Of the entire sample, a total of 11, 914

youths (94%) completed the AFQT test. We compute high school GPAs from data

gathered during a High School Transcript Survey conducted as part of the NLSY79

during 1980-1983. Transcript information was collected for respondents who were 17




                                                                                         8
years of age or older (at the time of the survey) and who had finished or were expected to

finish high school in the US. Credits and final grades were collected for up to 64 courses,

across all 4 years of high school. We used this information to compute a high school

GPA. Of the NLSY79 sample, 8,778 (70%) of respondents provided complete transcript

information. We compare future physicians to other college completers (since both

physicians and non-physicians make comparable investments in college-level education).

We also limit the sample to men who work full time (35 hours a week or more), since we

will use data on physicians who are full time labor force participants.

       Of the 12,686 youths sampled by these NLSY in 1979, 25 men and 18 women

went on to become physicians. Figure 1 below shows the mean and interquartile ranges

of test scores and GPAs of these 43 eventual physicians, compared to those who went on

to graduate college and work full time. Eventual physicians have higher GPAs and

AFQT scores than most other college graduates.

       Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for a range of characteristics for male

college graduates who worked full-time but were not physicians and for “Eventual

Physicians (male)”.    These data suggest that, on other dimensions, as well as GPA and

AFQT, doctors are drawn from those with very high expected future earnings. They are

more likely to be non-Black and non-Hispanic, more likely to have grown up in an Urban

setting, more likely to come from households with both parents, have fewer older

siblings, and have parents with higher educational attainment, than do those who do not

become doctors.

       We use these data to forecast future physician’s earnings in an alternative

profession based on their inherent characteristics, not their subsequent investments in




                                                                                         9
education and training. Thus, we include in our analyses only characteristics at birth,

characteristics at age 14, family background, and aptitude and intelligence scores. We

also include an interaction between AFQT scores and GPA, as we anticipate that it is

those who score very highly on both measures who are most likely to be admitted to

medical school. We use these data in regressions on earnings over the 1979-2004 period,

including each respondent in each year that he is working full time. The dataset includes

multiple observations for each respondent, reflecting earnings at different ages.

       As with most surveys that ask questions about income, the NLSY79 employs top

coding of high incomes to maintain the confidentiality of its respondents. This is a

serious problem for our study, because both physicians and the comparison group of

college-educated full time working men are likely to have high earnings. The NLSY79

uses different methods to top code data over the years. From 1979 to 1984, every

response above $75,000 is truncated to $75,001; from 1985 to 1988, every response

above $100,000 is truncated to $100,001; from 1989-1994, all values above $100,000

were replaced with the average of outlying values; and finally, from 1996 onwards, the

top 2% of valid values were averaged and this average value replaced all the values in

that top range. In our sample, the effect of top coding is more relevant in later years then

in the early years. In other words, more people are ‘captured’ in the top coded section in

later years then in the early years. This is to be expected, as incomes increase with age.

       We employ two strategies to address this top-coding problem. First, we use the

censored normal regression. To do this, we modify our data to create a truncated income

variable.   For the years 1979-1988, when the data are truncated at pre-specified

thresholds, we maintain the existing truncation values ($threshold+1). For example, from




                                                                                             10
1985-1988, the threshold is $100,000 and all values above that are coded $100,001. For

the years 1989-1994, the threshold is $100,000, but all values above this are replaced

with the average of those values, not $100,001 as was the case previously. For these

years, the topcoded values are all replaced with $100,001, the level at which censoring

begins. Somewhat similarly, in the years 1996-2004, the top 2% of valid income values

are censored, and replaced with the average of the these values. In these years, there is no

fixed censoring level. We replace the censored income variables for these years with a

figure that is $1 more than the 2nd highest value in the dataset (since all values equal to or

greater than this fall in the top 2%, and are censored). Finally, we compute hourly wage

rates using data on annual hours worked. We adjust top-coded values to reflect the top-

coding in the underlying income data2.

       Table 2 reports results of four regression specifications: a regression on log hourly

wages using topcoded values (to take advantage of the information in the top 2% values

for 1996 forward), a regression on log annual income using topcoded values, a censored

normal regression on the log of truncated hourly wages, and a censored normal regression

on the log of truncated annual income,

       The regressions control for: age, age square and age cube; High school GPA;

AFQT Score; an Interaction between GPA and AFQT score; dummies for Black and

Hispanic ethnicity; a dummy for birth in the South region of USA; dummies for whether

each parent was born in the US; total years of education for each parent; dummies for

  For those individuals with the highest values (ie censored values) in each year, wage
rate is constructed from income and an annual hours worked figure of 1750hrs
(35hrs/week, 50 weeks or Full time Equivalent). This provides an upper estimate for the
wage rate at which censoring begins (since the true wage rate will be higher, given the
censoring of incomes).


                                                                                           11
residence characteristics at age 14 - whether in the South, in Urban setting, farm setting,

and whether in the same town/city/county since birth; dummies for household

characteristics at age 14 - whether living with both parents, living with no parents,

foreign language spoken in household; number of older siblings; a dummy for whether

had easy access to reading material; and finally dummies for religion in which raised

(Protestant, Catholic, or other). Each regression also contains year dummies (1981-2004).

We run each regression on the sample of men, who are not ‘eventual doctors’, who went

on to graduate college and work full time (defined as 35hrs/wk for 50wks/yr, or 1750

hrs/yr).

           As expected, we find that socioeconomic characteristics of youth predict their

future earnings. High school achievement and ability also play an important part in

future earnings. The regression coefficients suggest that a 1-standard deviation increase

in high school GPA is associated with a 4% increase in hourly earnings. A 1-standard

deviation increase in AFQT score is associated with an 11.3% increase in hourly

earnings.

           We use these regression equations to predict the annual incomes/hourly wages of

the physicians in our sample at each age based on the physician sample’s characteristics

at the initial interview3.   These estimates are based on a sample of full-time workers,

where full-time work is defined as 35 hours a week for 50 weeks a year. Physicians, on

average, work substantially longer hours (AMA Socioeconomic Monitoring Survey).

The American Medical Association’s Socioeconomic Monitoring Survey collects

 To the extent that people self-select into professions other than medicine based on
attributes that increase their returns to these professions (and that are not shared by future
physicians), these estimates may overstate opportunity costs.


                                                                                           12
information on physician hours of work by specialty (available through the Bureau of

Healthcare Professionals)4. We use information on physicians’ hours of work each year

to compute predicted annual incomes based on the predicted hourly wages of the

‘eventual doctor’ sample. The use of predicted wages and actual physician hours in this

context makes this estimated opportunity cost estimate analogous to a Paasche price

index measure and is therefore an underestimate of the true opportunity cost (Lindsay,

1973;1976). That is, the actual wages that would be commanded by someone working as

many hours as doctors do is likely greater than the estimate derived from the comparison

group5. The predicted incomes derived from these analyses are reported in Table 3 and

Figure 2. These equations predict about ¼ of the variation in income among male, full-

time employed, college graduates over time. Age, high school grades, test scores, and

year dummies provide most of the explanatory power in the regression. Figure 2 also

includes an estimate of primary care physicians’ actual incomes, from the 2004 Medical

Group Management Association Physician Compensation and Productivity Survey.

       The data in Table 3 can be used to estimate the lifetime opportunity cost of

pursuing medical education. At a 4% discount rate, the lifetime earnings of a potential

physician amount to between $1,685,000 and $2,222,000.




4
  We further adjust these hours estimates upward by 8% to reflect the fact that male
physicians (our sample) work about 15% more hours than do female physicians, while
the AMA figure combines hours for both groups.
5
  We repeated our analysis using a comparison group that worked more than 45 hours a
week, more closely comparable to physician earnings, and found that hourly wages of
this (much smaller) group were not substantially higher than those reported here.


                                                                                       13
Direct Costs of Medical Education and Training

       Future primary care doctors must complete four years of medical school and

approximately three years of residency (family medicine) training after college. But

other college graduates also go on to further education. We use the forecast method

above to determine how many years of post-college education were attained by non-

physicians with similar characteristics. We find (not reported in tables) that future

physicians would have attained, on average, one year of post-college education had they

not gone to medical school. Thus, physicians obtain substantially more formal education

and training than do their non-physician counterparts.

       The estimates above provide evidence on the opportunity cost of this education

and training. We now turn to estimating the direct cost of education.

       The direct cost of educating a physician is most easily sorted into two categories:

1) those costs associated with medical school, and 2) those costs associated with medical

residency training. The total educational resource costs associated with training students

within medical schools include those associated with medical research, general

scholarship, patient care, and instruction (Jones and Korn, 1997).       Several studies,

reviewed by Jones and Korn (1997), use cost-accounting techniques to estimate those

elements of cost directly related to instruction. The mid-point of the studies examined in

this review suggests that these costs amounted to about $45,000 per student per year in

1996. We inflate these costs to 2008 dollars using the overall CPI, for an estimate of

$64,000. This likely leads to an underestimate in costs because medical school tuition

inflation has been nearly twice as high as the CPI (Jolly, 2005). Much of this cost is




                                                                                       14
covered by grants and government subsidies.           Medical school tuition in private

universities in 2003 averaged about $34,550 (Jolly, 2005; 2003 dollars).

       Medical residency training is an on-the-job investment in general education

(Newhouse and Wilensky, 2001; Marder and Hough, 1983). Investments in general

education are generally paid for by workers through reduced wages. In the case of

residency training, however, the relationship between earnings and the cost of education

is distorted by the existence of substantial subsidies. We use two methods to compute the

societal cost of medical residency training in primary care.

       First, we estimate the costs of residency training based on cost-accounting studies.

Franzini et al. (1999) conducted a cost-accounting study of the family practice residency

program of the University of Texas. They found that the instructional costs of the

program per year per resident were about $127,000 (adjusted to $2008 using the CPI).

These instructional costs exceeded the value of services provided by junior residents,

suggesting that if they bore the full costs of training, their earnings would have been

negative.   Senior residents provided services valued at about $32,000 above these

instructional costs.

       Second, we use estimates of the size of the Medicare subsidy, the cost of

replacing residents with other workers, and the stipends paid to residents to back out the

instructional cost of resident training.   The Medicare subsidy per resident in 2000

averaged $73,000 (National Conference of State Legislatures, 2000), about $91,000 in

$2008. Franzini et al. (1999) estimate the value of services provided by residents at

about $96,000 ($2008). Alternatively, Green and Johnson (1995) estimate the cost of

replacing residents with mid-level practitioners at about $151,000 ($2008) per resident.




                                                                                        15
Finally, based on the opportunity cost estimates above, the outside opportunity cost of a

resident working 80 hours per week is approximately $115,000 per year. The third

component of the analysis is the stipend paid to residents. In 2008, these stipends

averaged $45,000 (http://mdsalaries.blogspot.com/2005/10/residency-salaries.html). We

compute the instructional cost of residency training by summing the replacement cost of

residents and the subsidy to residency training and subtracting the stipend. This yields an

estimate of $142,000 - $197,000 per year, about 11-55% above the Franzini cost-

accounting estimate.




Amortizing these Costs

       The direct and indirect costs of medical education are amortized over a

physician’s worklife. We assume that primary care doctors work full time through age

65 (beginning regular employment on the completion of residency at age 29). We use

data from the American Medical Association and the Medical Group Management

Association to compute the number of visits and Medicare resource-value units produced

by a full-time employed physician each year. These figures are in Table 4. Primary care

doctors produce between 5000-5700 visits per year and about 4040 Medicare work RVUs

per year.

       Physician visits include both physician labor costs and capital costs. The non-

labor costs of physician visits are calculated in computing total resource value units.

Primary care practitioners average about 1.95 total RVUs (combined work and practice




                                                                                        16
cost RVUs) for each work RVU. Thus, a physician must bill $1.95 for a visit to net $1

toward the cost of labor.


The Societal Cost of a Physician Visit

       We combine information on opportunity costs, direct costs of education and

training, productivity, and practice costs to compute the social cost per primary care

physician visit or per primary care RVU. These estimates are provided in Table 5. We

report results using the high and low estimates of all the components of cost. The low

estimate uses the lowest opportunity cost estimate, the cost-accounting based residency

estimate, and the high visit estimate, while the high estimate uses the opposite

combination of assumptions. Together, these estimates suggest that the societal cost of

the labor associated with primary care physicians is between $151,000 - $200,000 per

year. This translates into a primary care visit cost of between $51-$77 (including both

physician and facility costs) and a per work RVU cost of between $37-$50.



Comparing Cost and Value

       It is difficult to ascertain the marginal value of a primary care visit. Estimates

from the RAND Health Insurance Experiment suggest that the health value of the

marginal visit is close to zero (Newhouse, 1993). If care is currently rationed by out-of-

pocket cost, the marginal value of a privately insured visit should be close to the

copa1yment rate, about $19 for privately insured patients (Kaiser Family Foundation and

Health Research and Educational Trust, 2007). The Medicare program may ration care

using its payment for RVUs. The current RVU payment is about $38

(http://www.cms.hhs.gov/PhysicianFeeSched/01_Overview.asp). Finally, the emergence



                                                                                            17
of retail clinics which provide primary care provides a market-based estimate of value.

The fees charged by these clinics average about $60 per visit

(http://minuteclinic.com/en/USA/Treatment-and-Cost.aspx;

http://www.sutterexpresscare.com/services/index.html. Table 6 summarizes information

on the value of visits.

        In general, estimates of the marginal value of the visit lie near the bottom of the

estimated range of social cost. These estimates do not support the idea that there is

substantial excess societal demand for primary care services relative to the cost of

producing these services using primary care physicians.



Private Returns

        Physicians themselves bear only a portion of the cost of medical training and

education. They pay all opportunity costs, but only about ½ of medical school tuition

costs, and only a small portion of training costs. We use our estimates to compute the

private return on primary care education.

        We estimate that the private return on primary care medical education is between

7-9%. Investments in education are relatively risky and must be made when people are

quite liquidity constrained. These private returns, while substantially above the social

returns, are quite low, and suggest, as experience bears out, that few physicians will

choose to specialize in primary care.




                                                                                          18
Conclusions

        Physicians are very costly. They are selected from the most talented students in

our nation and substantial investments are made in their education and training.

Economic efficiency requires assigning these valuable resources to high productivity

activities. Our analyses suggest that the cost of producing the marginal primary care

service using physicians likely outweighs the societal benefits of these services. Our

estimates are conservative, in that they amortize the cost of education over the worklife

of a physician who works full time, without career interruption, averaging over 105 visits

per week, through age 65. To the extent that many physicians now work shorter hours or

retire earlier, the estimated societal cost per visit would be greater.

        Many primary care services currently delivered by physicians, however, can be

provided by less costly personnel. An alternative to making an increased investment in

primary care training would be to increase the use of complementary, lower-skilled

practitioners. Practices that make greater use of lower cost practitioners, perhaps in

combination with highly skilled physicians, are likely to provide higher returns on the

societal investment in physician education.

Source: In the NLSY 1979 cohort, 25 males eventually become doctors. Predictions are made using the
regression estimation equations described in Table 2. Variables controlled for are: Age, Age Square and
Age Cube; High school GPA; AFQT Score; an Interaction between GPA and AFQT score; dummies for
Black and Hispanic ethnicity; a dummy for birth in the South region of USA (as specified in the NLSY);
dummies for whether each parent was born in the US; total years of education for each parent; dummies for
residence characteristics at age 14 - whether in the South, in Urban setting, farm setting, and whether in the
same town/city/county since birth; dummies for household characteristics at age 14 - whether living with
both parents, living with no parents, foreign language spoken in household; number of older siblings; a
dummy for whether had easy access to reading material; and dummies for household religion, whether
Catholic, or Other (non-Catholic, non-Protestant). Additionally, each regression contains year dummies
from 1981-2004.
