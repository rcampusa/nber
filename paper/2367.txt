     Recent Estimates of Time-Variation in the Conditional Variance
                    and in the Exchange Risk Premium




                                ABSTRACT



   The optimal-diversification model of investorst portfolio behavior can give

a linear relationship between the exchange risk premium and the conditional

exchange rate variance. This note surveys recent empirical work that allows

for the conditional variance itself, and therefore the risk premium, to vary

over time. In particular, it examines the implications of recent empirical

estimates for earlier arguments, based on the assumption that the conditional

variance was constant over time, that the exchange risk premium had to be small

in magnitude and variability.

     A variety of recent empirical evidence suggests that conditional variances

of exchange rates vary over time. Examples based on observed second moments

of exchange rates are Cumby and Obstfeld (1984), Hsieh (1984), Domowitz and

Hakkio (1985), Diebold and Pauly (1986) and Diebold and Nerlove (1986). Lyons

(1986) and Hsieh and Manas-Anton (1986) have extracted implicit variances from

foreign exchange options data, and they confirm that investors' perceived

variances vary over time.

     The behavior of investors in the foreign exchange market depends on the

conditional variance. In past work on the implications of mean-variance

optimization by investors, I explicitly assumed that the conditional variances

and covariances of returns were constant over time: ".. . [The] model employed

here makes several simplifying assumptions.. .It assumes that the

variance-covariance matrix is stationary... Each of these simplifications

could, in theory, invalidate the results, and it would be desirable to relax

each of them in future research." (1986, p. 260). From the first, I recognized

that second moments can in fact change over time; but I argued that it was more

important to begin by focussing on how first moments vary over time with asset

quantities, such variation being crucial, for example, to the question of the

effects of foreign exchange intervention.

           It is certainly true that parameters such as the
           variances in our asset demand functions can change
           over time. . . . But this paper is written under the
           supposition that fluctuations in expected returns
           are more of a problem than fluctuations in variances.
           After all, the former are the variables in the asset
           demand functions, and the latter are the parameters.
           Allowing expected returns to vary was first priority.
           Allowing the parameters to vary is a subject for future
           research.

     The major thrust of these papers was that mean-variance optimization,

because it implies a linear relationship between the exchange risk premium and

the variance of the exchange rate, implies three propositions about the risk

premium:

     (1)   it is small in absolute magnitude

     (2) foreign exchange intervention or other changes in the supply

           of assets, has a small effect on it

     (3) it does not vary much over time.

     Several recent papers, largely inspired by the empirical findings that the

conditional variance does indeed vary over time, explore what happens to

arguments like mine regarding the magnitude of the risk premium when one relaxes

the assumption that the variance is constant. This direction of research is a

welcome acceptance of the invitation extended in the passages quoted above.

      Adrian Pagan challenges my use of the sample variance, as an upper bound

on the conditional variance which investors use to think about risk, on page

S63 of my 1986 JItIF paper. The variance for monthly changes in, for example,

the pound/dollar rate around the forecasts of the forward rate is .010 on an

annualized basis (page S56, col. (4)2). Given a coefficient of relative risk

aversion of 2 and the assumption that only the exchange rate is stochastic,

mean-variance optimization can be seen to imply that the risk premium rp is

given by -V[a +    ] + 2Vx ,    where   V is the conditional variance, a is the

share of foreign goods in consumption, and x is the share of foreign assets

in the portfolio.2 To simplify, assume that a ,            which is in any case between

0 and 1 ,     is     .   Then



(1)                rp     -v + 2Vx




I used .010 as the upper bound for V .         Thus my argument was that if the supply

of marks is increased by one percent (Ax =        .01),   then an upper bound on the

change in the risk premium Arp is .02 percent per annum, or 2 basis points.

If the level of x is close to 1 or 0 (even though it is unlikely that x would

in fact be that different from a) ,     then   the magnitude of the risk premium could

still be only as large as V = 1 percent. See the earlier papers for the

necessary assumptions, the derivation, and other citations.

      Pagan gives an example of a statistical distribution that can have a

conditional variance, for a particular realization in the preceding period, that

is larger than the unconditional variance. The upshot of his comment is that

    The expression gives the vector of risk premiums on n assets if a
    is the vector of n consumption shares, x the vector of n portfolio
    shares, and V the n x n variance-covariance matrix.

I have not succeeded in putting an upper bound on the variance of the exchange

rate and therefore I have not succeeded in putting an upper bound on the risk

premium.

       I would have thought uncontroversial my statement that the conditional

variance "should be smaller than the unconditional variance," which is estimated

by the sample variance. Let e÷1 be the change in the spot rate (in excess

of the forward discount) in period t+l ,                   Var(e)   be the unconditional variance,

Ee+1 be the conditional expectation and                               be the expectational error.

Then




           e+1 =             +
                     Ee÷1

                 =           -
      Var(e+1)       E(e÷i       Eet+i)2

                 =                         -           2
                             +
                     E(÷1        Ete÷i         Ee+1)


If we expand, use the fact that the conditional and unconditional expectations

of          are zero and use E(Eet+i) =
                                                       Ee÷1    ,    then we get


                                      +
(2)         Var(e+1) =   E(÷i2)            Var(Ee+1)

The unconditional variance is equal to the variance of the expectational error

plus the variance of the conditional expectation. If the conditional variance

Vt
       Et(t÷i2) is constant over time, then it is equal to E(ct+12) ,                      which
from the equation above is clearly less than Var(e)

       How then is Pagan's counterexample possible? His concocted distribution

is in fact an instance of a much more fundamental (and obvious) point. If the




                                                                                               4
conditional variance is at some times bigger than at other times, then the risk

premiums will also be correspondingly bigger. A more transparent example than

Pagan's is the case where the variance itself follows an autoregressive process,

as in Robert Engle's (1982) ARCH model, so that a large squared realization in

one period implies a large conditional variance in the following period. When

I used the unconditional variance, estimated by the sample variance, as an upper

bound on the conditional variance, I was thinking of both as constant over time,

in which case my claims hold. If the conditional variance varies over time,

then it is evident that my bound can be exceeded in those periods when it is

especially large. Estimates in Engel and Rodrigues (1987), explained below,

indeed show the conditional variance at times during the 1973-85 sample period

substantially exceeding the bound of the unconditional variance (Figures

lA-iD).

     If we allow the conditional variance Vt to vary over time, then one can

still apply the upper bound to the average conditional variance, EVt

E[E(t+i
          2
              )J   =
                       E(c   2
                                 )   , which appears in the above equation, and therefore
                                         .




to the average risk premium. If the conditional variance is 10 times larger

than .010 one period in ten (for example, when the preceding squared realization

was particularly large), then it is true that a one percent change in the

portfolio in that period will change the risk premium by as much as 0.2 percent

per annum, and that the magnitude of the risk premium could theoretically be

as large as 10 percent per annum (if close to 100 percent of the portfolio is

in one asset or the other). But in the other nine periods out of ten, these

magnitudes would have to be zero for the variance to average out to .010.

     Thus the conclusion is that if we allow for the variance to vary over time,

claims (1) and (2) above remain true if interpreted in the appropriate sense

of averages over time. A consequence of allowing the variance to vary over




                                                                                            5
time, however, is that variation in asset supplies x is not the only source

of variation in the risk premium rp , so that claim (3) above is now suspect.

This point is made by Giovannini and Jorion (1987a), to whom we now turn.



                   II. Conditioning on the interest rate.



     To evaluate the implications for the variation of the risk premium, as in

claim (3), we need to quantify somehow the variation of the conditional

variance. The variation in daily or weekly squared exchange rate changes is

very large. Giovannini and Jorion (1987a) report a variance of weekly squared

changes equal to .001725 (a standard deviation of 4.2 per cent) for the

mark/dollar rate, 1979-84 (p. 111). Even when squared daily changes are

averaged within a month, the monthly variances still vary greatly. For 100

months from December 1977 to April 1986, the mark/dollar variances of daily

changes appear to range from .00074 (a standard deviation of 2.72 per cent) in

the most stable month to as large as .70619 (a standard deviation of 49.87 per

cent). (The source is Frankel and Meese (l987).) The question is what fraction

of the variation in these squared exchange rate changes could investors

have foreseen based on available information.




 These are the second moments computed around zero. We will in fact be
 interested in the second moment computed around the first moment. But
 there is wide agreement that only a very small proportion of exchange
 rate changes can be explained by either the forward discount, investor
 expectations, economists' models, or anything else. My argument,
 addressed by Pagan, that the sample variance can be taken as an upper
 bound is again relevant.



                                                                              6
    Giovannini and Jorion (l987a) model the conditional variance by assuming

a linear dependence on domestic and foreign interest rates.4 They obtain

an R2 of .063 for squared weekly exchange rate changes, on mark/dollar data

for 1979-84 (p. 111). The implication is that the variance of the predictable

component of squared weekly exchange rate changes is .063 x .001725 =      1.1 x lO

(not 1.1 as reported in their original paper).

     It may be worth pausing to consider how Giovannini and Jorion (1987a) may

have made their arithmetic mistake, because many others have made similar

mistakes in this context. The danger, it seems, comes in from the beginning

expressing exchange rate changes in per cent terms (e.g. 10) instead of absolute

terms (.10). When standard deviations are squared to get variances V , a factor

of l0 is introduced (100 instead of .01). This seems perfectly harmless

because the intent in the end is to use Vt to match a risk premium or rate

of return expressed in per cent per annum (say 3 instead of .03). But having

squared in the meantime, we end up still off by a factor of 102       .   (This   is the

way the mistake in expressing variances is usually made. Giovannini and Jorion

were off by a factor of   l0   ,   probably   because they work with the variance of

the variance.)

     I propose a simple convention be followed in estimates of mean-variance

optimization to avoid this problem in the future. Variances of exchange rate

changes should be computed in absolute terms, e.g. .01. At the same time, the

standard deviation can be parenthetically expressed in percentage terms (e.g.

10 per cent), so as to provide the necessary reasonableness-check for the author

and the necessary intuition for the reader. Only after the implications for




  Giovannini (1986) offers a theoretical justification for the
  relationship between the level of the interest rate and the time-varying
  volatility.


                                                                                      7
the risk premium are worked out should the author multiply by i02 if he wants

it to be expressed in per cent, or 1O4 to be expressed in basis points. If the

variance is originally computed on shorter-term data than annually, say weekly

data, on the common assumption that investors reshuffle their portfolios that

often, then the effects on the risk premium will also be multiplied by 52 at

the end, to convert the risk premium to a per annum basis. The weekly exchange

rate changes should not be multiplied by 5,200 (to get returns in per cent per

annum) before the variances are computed.

           What variability of the risk premium is implied by Giovannini and Jorion's

(corrected) estimate of the variance of the conditional variance? To state the

strongest possible case for the risk premium, let us take the portfolio share

x =    1    .
                Then, equation (1) becomes



(1')                 rp =   V

the risk premium is given very simply by the conditional variance Vt .         Thus

the Giovannini-Jorion estimate implies that 1.1 x l0 is also the variance

of the risk premium on a per-week basis, which is a large standard deviation

of 54.5 per cent (.545 = 52 x
                                     F          -4
                                             x 10 )
                                                                        .5
                                                      on a per annum basis.




  The variance of the per annum risk premium is .297. Another way to
  get the same answer that is more in keeping with convention in finance
  is first to multiply the conditional variances at each point in time by
  52 to express them in per annum terms.   If investors are assumed to
  determine their portfolios once a year rather than once a week, this
  might be precisely the correct way to express the variances, on the
  theory that if the exchange rate process follows geometric Brownian
  motion in continuous time, then the variance grows linearly with the
  time interval. In any case, the estimate of the variance of the
  variances, and therefore the variance of the risk premium, comes out
                                  -4        2
  the same: larger (than 1.1 x 10 ) by 52.



                                                                                  8
                    III. Conditioning on lagged volatility.



      A number of papers estimate the conditional variance time series by

conditioning on lagged variability, as in the ARCH model of the variance,

instead of on interest rates. Let this periodts conditional variance depend

linearly on last period's squared error:



(3)                 Vt = V0 +



Hsieh (1985) finds that after an innovation in the variance of the mark/dollar
rate, the peak effect on the conditional variance occurs eight days later.6

Mark (1987) estimates a first-order ARCH process on monthly exchange rate data

for four currencies; the estimate of p for the mark/dollar rate is .240 (Table

2). Engel and Rodrigues (1987) estimate a first-order ARCH process on monthly

data for five currencies; their largest estimate of p for the mark/dollar rate

is a somewhat smaller .3842 = .148 (Table 2). Allowing for longer ARCH lags

tends to give an estimated variance process that dies out more slowly. Domowitz

and Hakkio (1985), also working with monthly data, estimate a 4th-order ARCH

process; the sum of the four (squared) lag coefficients for the mark/dollar rate

is .521. Diebold and Nerlove (1986) estimate lags that go back almost as far,

but on weekly data; the sum of the lags on their 12th-order ARCH process is .766

for the mark/dollar rate (Table 7). Given that some of the .766 effect on the




6
    A unit innovation in V is reported to have an effect of .225 on the
    conditional variance V8 , and an effect .087 on V30 .       Similarly,
    Frankel and Meese (1987, Table 3) compute monthly correlations of daily
    variances for the mark/dollar rate; the autoregressive coefficient on
    the first month lag is .14. But the effect of an innovation in
    as specified in equation (3), should be greater than the effect of an
    equal innovation in Vt

                                                                              9
first week's variance must die out by the fourth week, the estimate seems

roughly in line with the Domowitz and Hakkio estimate.

      We now derive the relationship between the (unconditional) variance of the

conditional variance and the autoregressive parameter p from the ARCH process

(3). First we need an expression for the (unconditional) mean of the

conditional variance.




            V EVt =V0 + PECt12


                    =        + pV
                        V0



(4)             V0 =    V(l-p)


We use equation (3) again in deriving an expression for the variance of the

variance:



                                            -
               Var(V) = E(V2)                   (EV)2

                             =          +          2)2 - V2

                             =
                                 cv02 + 2VopEt 12 + P2EEt14) - V2


                             =       + 2V0pV + -V2 + P2ECt14



       Using (4),            =   V2(l-p)2       + 2V2(l-p)p - V2   + p2Eci4


 In what follows we use the assumption that the unconditional moments
 are constant over time, even though the conditional moments vary.




                                                                              10

       We   cannot eliminate the fourth-power term without additional information.

But if we are willing to assume that the conditional distribution of -1 is

normal (we already know that it has mean zero and variance Vt1), then we can

    Engel and Rodrigues and the other ARCH estimates generally assume a
    conditional normal distribution anyway. Note that with a time-varying
    variance, the unconditional distribution will not be normal. (So
       4    2
    Ec    3V , for example.) A number of authors have suggested that the
    common finding of "fat tails" in the unconditional distribution could be
    explained as such a mixture of normals over time. Boothe and Glassman
    (1986, Table 3) find evidence that the daily distribution of the
    mark/dollar rate may switch back and forth between a normal with a
    standard deviation of .399 per cent and a normal with a standard
    deviation of 1.103 per cent.

Even though the mean of            is zero under rational expectations, the mean of

e is not zero unless the mean of the risk premium is zero (which is what we

are trying to discover). The question is how much of the sample variance of

e (.001) is due to the variance of the risk premium and how much to the

conditional variance.

        We repeat our equation for the risk premium under mean-variance

optimization and simple benchmark values for x and risk-aversion:



(1')             rp = Vt


Equation (1') and our ARCH equation (8) give us



                 Var(rp) =   Var(V)


(9)                        = 2p2V2/(1-3p2)



On a monthly basis, if we take the Mark (1987) estimate of the ARCH parameter

p = .240 and the estimate of the unconditional variance of the forward discount

prediction error Var(e) = .001         ,   it   follows that the variance of the risk

premium is on the order of



                 Var(rp) =   2(.058)(.0O1)2/(l3(.058))


                           = .140 x   io6


and    the standard deviation is      .374 x l0 , on a monthly basis. This implies

that the standard deviation of the risk premium on a per annum basis is .00449




                                                                                        13

similar annualized standard deviation of 52 1.85788 x 10      .0048.

The latest Engel-Rodrigues estimate (p =     .148) implies a somewhat smaller
standard deviation. On the other hand, the standard deviation of the risk

premium implied by the Giovannini and Jorion (1987b) estimate appears much

larger.




                  IV. Variances extracted from options prices.



       Estimates of implicit variances extracted from options prices are

potentially superior to the ARCH and other statistical methods in that they do

not depend on any specific assumptions about what information investors use to
                           11
forecast squared errors.        Lyons (1986) reports annual variances for

the log mark/dollar rate that vary over time over a range of approximately .01

to .04 (1983-1986), implying in our framework a risk premium that varies over

a similar range. Hsieh and Manas-Anton (1986, Table 4) find that the estimated

implicit volatilities differ considerably between put and call options and

depending on the strike price and maturity of the contract.'2 But the daily

variance implicit in a typical call contract maturing in September 1984 showed




10
     The calculation, reported to the author by Diebold, is based on the
     model on their p. 18, as estimated in Table 7. The time series for the
     conditional variance is graphed in Figure 3.
11
     On the other hand, the Black-Scholes option-pricing formular was
     derived under the assumption that the variance is constant; its
     applicability to time-varying variances is not clear. Garman and
     Kohlhagen (1983) show how the Black-Scholes formula must be altered to
     be correctly applied to foreign currency options, in particular to
     allow for uncertainty in foreign interest rates in addition to domestic
     interest rates.


                                                                                14
a standard deviation across 81 price observations of .00094. In our framework

this implies a per day risk premium with a standard deviation on the

order of .00094. The standard deviation of the per annum risk premium is then

.343, somewhat smaller than the Giovannini and Jorion estimate but still much

larger than the ARCH estimates. It is a little disturbing that such different

estimates of the variability of the conditional variance emerge, depending

whether the variances are conditioned on the interest rate (Giovannini and

Jorion), conditioned on lagged squared errors (Mark, Diebold and Nerlove, Engel

and Rodrigues, and other ARCH estimates), or estimated from options prices.



          V. Can risk premiums derived from mean-variance optimization
                  explain the behavior of the forward discount?



       How can we judge whether these numbers represent large or small variation

in the risk premiums? A relevant standard of comparison for deciding what is

"small" is the variation in the forward discount. Regressions of ex post spot

rate changes against the forward discount commonly produce coefficient

estimates closer to 1/2 or 0 than to the unit value implied by the null

hypothesis of forward rate unbiasedness. The many authors who assume that

investors' expectations can be represented by ex post exchange rate changes in

finite samples (up to a random error) thus infer that most, or even all, of the

variation in the forward discount constitutes variation in the risk premium.

See, for example, Fama (1984), Hodrick and Srivastava (1986), and Bilson (1985).

(For elaboration, see and Froot and Frankel (1986).) The forward discount of

the dollar against the mark has moved in the range 2 per cent per annum to 5




12
     This tends to undermine the confidence one has in the option-price
     method of measuring the conditional variance.



                                                                           15
per cent per annum in recent years. The one-month forward discount had a

standard deviation of 1.7 per cent per annum over the period January

1981-December 1986 (2.4 per cent over the period January 1974-December 1986).

Thus some of the standard deviations of the conditional variances estimated

above, do seem big enough potentially to explain the bias in the forward
            13
discount.

       Saying that movements in the variance are big enough to explain movements

in the forward discount is not the same thing, however, as saying that these

two variables do in fact move together, as they would need to if the risk

premiums were to explain the forward discount's systematic prediction errors.

Domowitz and Hakkio (1985) have used the ARCH estimates of the variance to try

to explain the errors made by the forward discount in predicting spot rate

changes, and Lyons (1986) has used the option-price estimates for the same

purpose. Each has some (limited) success with some currencies. But one needs

a hypothesis as to whether an increase in the variance should in theory raise

the risk premium on the foreign currency or should raise the risk premium on

the dollar. This requires some idea of what the supply of the foreign asset

is relative to the minimum-variance portfolio. The asset whose supply exceeds


13
     Giovannini and Jorion (l987b) come to the opposite conclusion once they
     correct their arithmetic error, that variation in the conditional
     variance is not big enough, afterall, to explain the behavior of the
     forward discount. But they use a smaller estimate of the share of the
     portfolio allocated to foreign currency, .1 rather than 1.0, so the
     estimated variance of the risk premium is 100 times smaller than ours.
     An argument for a larger mark portfolio share such as .5 is that, even
     if marks are only 1/10 of the world portfolio, dollars are far less than
     9/10 and the remainder is other currencies with which the mark/dollar rate
     is correlated. If x = a = .5 then the risk premium is zero regardless
     what the variance is (because the supply of marks is equal to the demand
     arising from the minimum-variance portfolio). We are using x = 1.0 to
     state the strongest possible case for the risk premium. Indeed, the
     risk premium standard deviations that then come out of the
     Giovannini-Jorion or option-pricing estimates, with x = 1.0 , appear too
     large to be plausible, rather than too small.



                                                                           16
the minimum-variance portfolio is the one that needs to pay a positive risk

premium to be willingly held. Finding statistical evidence that the apparent

effect of the variance is of the correct sign is more difficult than finding

that it is non-zero.

       Perhaps the most careful econometric study of mean-variance optimization

across currencies that both uses asset supply data and allows for time-varying

variances is Engel and Rodrigues (1987). Their use of the ARCH model of the

variance-covariance matrix is to introduce it into the Maximum Likelihood

technique from my 1982 paper, which imposes a constraint between the matrix of

substitutability coefficients on the one hand, and the variance-covariance

matrix of the error term in the same regression equation on the other hand.14

As in earlier papers, Engel and Rodrigues reject the hypothesis that the

systematic prediction errors in the forward discount can be explained by

mean-variance optimization. We are thus not yet at the point where we can claim

to have found the risk variables that explain the behavior of the forward

discount prediction errors.

     In    .
        addition to using the ARCH model, i.e., conditioning the
     variance-covariance matrix on lagged squared errors, they also try
     conditioning on lagged squared innovations in the U.S. money supply
     and in oil prices. The conclusion regarding the hypothesis of
     mean-variance optimization is the same.
