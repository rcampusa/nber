                                             ABSTRACT

Urban density both facilitates consumption opportunities and encourages individuals to drive less and
walk and use public transit more. Using several data sets, we document that high quality of life consumer
center cities are low carbon cities. We discuss possible causal channels for this association.

Introduction


        Climate change looms as a threat to quality of life in the United States. In the absence of

carbon pricing, urban economic growth has increased greenhouse gas production. Urbanization

raises per-capita income through learning and specialization effects. Richer people drive more

and use public transit less.     In growing metropolitan areas, the bulk of employment and

population growth tends to take place in the suburbs. Such “sprawl” is associated with increased

per-capita vehicle use.    The transportation sector produces roughly 40% of the nation’s

greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

        One potential counter veiling trend has been ongoing improvements in center city quality

of life. Crime is falling in center cities and this attracts the skilled to live downtown (Berry-

Cullen and Levitt 1998, Levitt 2004). Urban air pollution tends to be higher in the densest parts

of a metropolitan area but in recent years, air pollution downtown has declined (Kahn 2011) and

Superfund sites (that tend to be disproportionately located in center cities) are being cleaned up

(Gamper-Rabindran and Timmins 2011).

        Glaeser, Kolko and Saiz (2001) document the rise of “consumer cities” featuring

educated, wealthy people choosing to live downtown even when they work in the suburbs.

Urban mayors seeking to attract and retain such taxpayers are investing in local beautification

projects, increased policing and other efforts to improve local public goods. When educated,

wealthy people cluster, this creates a consumer externality effect such that high quality stores

and restaurants will appear nearby to sell to them (Waldfogel 2008). In this sense, the process

feeds on itself.



                                                 2
         In this paper, we document that a socially beneficial consequence of the rise of consumer

cities is to reduce a metropolitan area’s transportation carbon footprint. Public transit, walking

and center city visits are complementary goods.2                 A more robust center city will increase the

desire of all of the metropolitan area’s residents to live a lifestyle that is oriented to visiting and

spending time in the center city. While many suburban households may work in the suburbs and

rely on their cars, they will be more likely to use public transit for discretionary trips to the

center city. The center city households will use public transit and walk in their day to day lives.

         The intra-city quality of life literature has not related the spatial distribution of local

quality of life to the global challenge of mitigating carbon emissions. In the absence of Pigouvian

gas pricing, there are social benefits when households choose to use public transit rather than a

private car (Parry and Small 1998). By focusing on the differential in quality of life between the

center city and the suburbs within the same metropolitan area, we build on the cross-

metropolitan area quality of life literature. Starting with Roback (1982), Blomquist, Berger and

Hoehn (1988), Gyourko and Tracy (1991), and through Albouy (2008), researchers continue to

use hedonic methods to create index weights to rank metropolitan areas with respect to their

bundle of non-market local public goods. In this paper, we use the share of center city residents

in a metropolitan area who are college graduates as a proxy for the center city’s quality of life.

         Controlling for standard urban form variables such as metropolitan area density and the

share of metropolitan area jobs that are located downtown, we document that a standardized

household creates less greenhouse gas emissions from transportation in those metropolitan areas

  Detroit offers a salient example. In December 2012, a New York Times reporter wrote “Along with these real
estate projects, Midtown Detroit is also helping to attract or develop the amenities that city dwellers want around
their apartments, like bike paths, parks where residents can walk their dogs, and places to eat and shop. A Whole
Foods is to open in midtown next year, and a light rail project is in the planning stages.

with a larger downtown share of college graduates. Using a second data set, we document using

public transit panel data from 1991 to 2009 that public transit ridership has increased more in

those metropolitan areas where a larger share of downtown adult residents are college graduates.

In the final section of the paper, we use another data set to rank public transit systems with

respect to the carbon intensity per rider. These new estimates are useful for determining the

carbon externality mitigation when riders substitute from private car to public transit.



Main Hypotheses

       Throughout this paper, we assume that within metropolitan area quality of life is higher

in those areas where the college educated cluster. This outcome is likely to be due to selection

and treatment effects. In a Tiebout model of migration, the educated have the information and

resources to identify those areas within a metropolitan area that offer high quality of life. Taking

the intra metropolitan area real estate pricing gradient as given, the educated will choose the

most desirable areas. Once the high skilled cluster in a specific geographic area, this area’s

quality of life is likely to improve.       The educated are more likely to vote and to be

environmentalists (Moretti 2004, Kahn 2002). This group will engage in political activities to

encourage local government officials to provide higher quality services.          Spatial clusters of

educated, high income individuals will attract better restaurants, shops and culture to locate

nearby (Waldfogel 2008).      Educated, richer people are more likely to invest in improving the

residential real estate capital stock and this contributes to center city gentrification (Bruekner and

Rosenthal 2009). While the urban poor have a comparative advantage at commuting using

public transit (Glaeser, Kahn and Rappaport 2008), richer people will be more willing to use this

transit mode as street safety increases and downtown opportunities increase.



                                                  4
       We recognize that the disutility from commuting will play a key role in determining

residential locational choice of the skilled. In recent years, job growth has taken place in the

suburbs rather than in the center city. Based on data from the Census Zip Code Employment

files covering the years 2000 to 2005, we find that in zip codes less than five miles from

downtown, employment growth was -11%, and in zip codes more than five miles from

downtown, employment growth was 5%.           Major companies such as Google and Facebook that

employ many high skilled individuals are located far from center cities. The rise of corporate

campuses would tend to re-enforce the suburbanization of the skilled unless there were offsetting

center city consumption amenities.


       This paper’s empirical work focuses on testing the following three hypotheses. We first

list them and then discuss some key points.


Hypothesis 1: When the skilled cluster in the center city, the metropolitan area has a lower
transport carbon footprint.
Hypothesis 2: If the center city has binding land use regulation that inhibits new construction,
then this reduces the carbon reduction effects of center city skill concentration.
Hypothesis 3: The extent of the carbon reduction due to mode substitution from private cars to
public transit differs across metropolitan areas because the carbon externality associated with a
passenger mile of public transit use varies across cities.


       With regards to the second hypothesis, in an unconstrained housing market,

improvements in center city quality of life would encourage housing developers to build more

housing units in this increasingly desirable area. Such increased compactness would encourage

overall sustainability as more of the population would be living at higher density. The emerging

literature on housing supply regulation has noted that leading consumer cities such as Boston

(Glaeser and Ward 2008), San Francisco (Kahn 2011) and New York City all inhibit new


                                                  5
construction (Quigley and Rosenthal 2005). An open question concerns whether these cities are

vibrant consumer cities because of their housing regulation.             From a sustainability point of a

view, a consequence of this housing regulation is that it may be difficult to scale up urban

development in those consumer cities with binding regulation.




Empirics

        In this section, we present three pieces of empirical work that test the hypotheses stated

above. Our first data source is the Department of Transportation’s 2009 National Household

Travel Survey (NHTS). The NHTS is a distinctive micro data set because it reports gasoline

consumption for a large representative sample of households. We have been able to access a

special version of the data that has census tract identifiers. For each household, we observe

which metropolitan area it lives in, its distance to the city center, and the population density of

the census tract in which it resides. We also have data on MSA density, and a variety of other

variables that we discuss later. We restricted our sample to households living within 35 miles of

each MSA’s central business district (CBD).3

        The dependent variable is gallons of gasoline consumed by the household annually,

which we convert into GHG emissions. Our primary approach to modeling GHG emissions

from transportation involves estimating OLS regressions using observations on 68,685

households based on the equation below, which is presented in equation (1). 4


3
  MSA definitions change every few years. We use the 2006 MSA definitions and the principle cities identified by
the U.S. Census Bureau. The location of each MSA’s central business district (CBD) was obtained by recording the
geocode returned when entering the central city name in Google Earth.
4
  To ensure that anomalous households or computer errors do not skew our results, we followed several data rules.
First, we top coded the top one percent of the sample for the dependent variable. We also restricted the sample to

                                                        6
                                                                                         (1).



        In this regression, the dependent variable is the level of annual household GHG emissions

produced by household ,           refers to the value of characteristic in tract ,              refers to the

impact of those variables,         refers to the value of individual characteristic         for household ,

is the coefficient on that characteristic, and the last two terms are tract and household level error

terms, respectively.

        We calculated GHG emissions from driving for each household in two steps. First, we

obtained the estimate of annual household gasoline consumption contained in the NHTS, and

then we converted gallons of gasoline into carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by multiplying by

20.98. A standard conversion factor used by the Department of Energy is 19.64;5 however, this

conversion factor includes only the direct emissions from burning a gallon of gasoline, not the

indirect emissions associated with refining and transporting gasoline to the pump.6 Therefore, we

increase the factor by seven percent, and assume that each gallon of gas is associated with 20.98

lb of CO2 emissions. The dependent variable has a mean of 24,289 and a standard deviation of

16,864.

        The results from estimating equation (1) are reported in Table 1. This table does not

report the income fixed effects; the estimated coefficients on these variables were monotonically


households whose head is between the ages of 18 and 65, and for whom we have complete demographic and
geographic data.

http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=2000_register&docid=00-14446-filed.pdf. Therefore,
20.98 is conservative in that it reflects efficiency of about 0.93, and thus likely understates the actual emissions
associated with a gallon of gasoline.

increasing with income. The standard errors are clustered by MSA. In Table 1, the key

explanatory variable is the downtown’s share of adult residents who are college graduates. We

calculated this measure using tract-level data from the 2000 Census. Here, as with the other

“downtown” variables, we define downtown as the area within five miles of the CBD. This is a

revealed preference measure of the desirability of the center city because the college-educated

could afford to live anywhere in the metro area.          We also include the share of other metro area

adults (beyond five miles from the CBD) who are college graduates. The correlation between

the downtown 2000 share and the suburban share is 0.46. We include both to highlight that our

results do not simply reflect a “skilled metro area” effect. A second downtown vibrancy measure

captures downtown employment, specifically the fraction of all MSA jobs downtown. This data

comes from the 2005 Zip Code Business Patterns (ZBP).7

        We recognize that the observed effects of urban form on travel behavior are not due

exclusively to the effects of density, transit access, or centrality per se but also to the fact that

those who have an innate preference for certain travel behaviors self-select into communities that

permit these preferences to be expressed.8 Concerned about the endogeneity of the within

metropolitan area residential choice decision, we present our estimates of equation (1) with and

without the within metro area locational choice variables.

        The land-use variables all have the predicted signs and are statistically significant.

Population density, whether at the tract or MSA level, reduces GHG production. More distance

to the MSA’s center is associated with higher average gasoline consumption. To address

concerns that low density cities may be home to political conservatives while liberals concentrate

in more compact metropolitan areas, we control for the metropolitan area 2008 share of voters

who voted for President Obama.

         Table 1 reports five OLS estimates of equation (1). In column (1), we include the intra-

metropolitan area urban form variables while in column (2) we use the same sample but exclude

the log of the household’s distance from the city center and the log of the household’s census

tract’s population density. Controlling for standard household demographics such as household

income categories, the head’s age, the number of people and the number of drivers in the

household, we find that there is negative and statistically significant coefficient on the percent of

downtown adults who have a college degree.9 Based on column (2), all else equal, a household

who lives in a metro area with a 10 percentage point larger downtown share of college educated

households produces 911 fewer pounds of CO2 per year. Given the summary statistics for

household carbon dioxide emissions, this represents 1/20th of a standard deviation. In contrast,

the suburban share of college educated households is much smaller in absolute value and is not

statistically significant in any of the regressions. Other coefficients on urban form have the

standard interpretation. Northeast households have a smaller carbon footprint than other regions,

while households in the South have a much larger transport footprint.

         As shown in column (3), when we restrict the sample to metropolitan areas with more

than 500,000 people the downtown job share coefficient is negative and statistically significant.

Metropolitan areas with one more standard deviation of employment downtown (19%) and one

more standard deviation of college graduates downtown (10.2%) are associated with 1/8th of a


9
  Recall that this variable represents the ratio (count of adults with a college degree in the year 2000 who live within
five miles of the metro area’s CBD)/(count of adults in the year 2000 who live within five miles of the metro area’s
CBD). We also include the metropolitan area’s percent of remaining adults who have a college degree. This is
defined as the ratio (count of adults with a college degree in the year 2000 who live more than five miles from the
metro area’s CBD)/(count of adults in the year 2000 who live more than five miles from the metro area’s CBD).


                                                           9
standard deviation reduction in the average metropolitan area resident’s carbon emissions from

transportation. In interpreting these results, it is important to keep in mind that we always

control for the metropolitan area’s population density. This variable has a negative and highly

statistically significant coefficient. Columns (4) and (5) stratify the sample into metropolitan

areas where President Obama received less than 50% of the vote in the 2008 election and more

than 50% of the vote. We present this stratification to test whether liberal and conservative

areas exhibit different relationships. The downtown college graduate share has a negative

coefficient in Republican metro areas but the coefficient shrinks towards zero. Interestingly, as

shown by column (4), households create more carbon emissions when more jobs are downtown

in the conservative metropolitan areas while the coefficient remains negative in the liberal areas.

       In Table 2, we report additional estimates of equation (1). In columns (1) and (2), we

contrast OLS and instrumental variables estimates for the same subsample.       Recall that the

NHTS data are from the year 2009 and that we use year 2000 Census data to create the human

capital shares. We recognize that if the error term in equation (1) has a subcomponent that is

serially correlated that this could induce an endogeneity bias such that the factors that attracted

college graduates to live downtown in 2000 could be correlated with unobserved determinants of

carbon dioxide emissions in 2009. To address this concern, in column (2) we instrument for the

downtown college graduate share in the year 2000 using micro data from the 1930 Census of

Population. These data indicate whether a household lives in the center city. For each

metropolitan area’s center city, we calculate the adult male’s average Duncan Socioeconomic

Index (a measure of economic status based on a worker’s industry and occupation). We use this




                                                 10
1930 variable to instrument for the year 2000 college share.10 This 1930 variable is not available

for every metropolitan area. In Table 2’s column (1), we re-estimate equation (1) for the subset

of households for which we can construct our 1930 instrument and in column (2) we report the

IV estimates. Both the OLS and IV estimates of the percent of downtown adults who have a

college degrees are negative and statistically significant. The IV estimate is roughly 40% larger

in absolute value than the OLS coefficient.

        To test hypothesis #2, we use data from the Wharton Land Use Regulatory Index and

merge for each metropolitan area the index for the center city (Gyourko, Saiz, Summers 2008).

We create a dummy variable that equals one if the center city’s regulation is greater than the

median WRLURI score for the full sample of center cities and this dummy equals zero

otherwise. We interact this dummy with the downtown and suburban college graduate shares. If

regulation makes the downtown costly by limiting supply and college graduates downtown bid

up demand then high real estate price should lead to a deflection effect such that more people

live further from the city center and drive more.

        Since we do not have WLURI data for all the metro areas, in Table 2’s column (3), we

estimate the same specification of equation (1) that we reported in Table 1’s column (2) but in

this case we focus on the subset of observations for which we know the metro area’s center city

WLURI index.        The estimates in Table 2’s column (3) are qualitatively quite similar to the

results reported in Table 1’s column (2). In Table 2’s column (4), we include the three additional

regulation variables. All else equal, we find that metropolitan areas featuring less downtown

housing regulation have a smaller carbon footprint as the share of downtown college graduates

increases. For metropolitan areas whose center cities feature high regulation, the marginal effect

10
  This would not be a valid instrument if there are time invariant features of downtowns that attract college
graduates and are correlated with transportation patterns. A univariate regression of the downtown college graduate
share in 2000 regressed on the center city’s average 1930 Duncan Index yields a R2 = .031.

                                                        11
of downtown college graduates is (-13,039 + 6,810) while in the low downtown regulation

metropolitan areas this marginal effect is -13,039, or roughly 50% larger in absolute value.

This finding is intuitive. If the downtowns where the college graduates cluster is desirable and if

the center city features low regulation, then more housing can be built downtown and close to

this area.



Time Trends in Public Transit Use and Downtown Human Capital Agglomeration



           In this section, we test whether public transit ridership has increased between 1991 and

2009 in those metropolitan areas where a larger fraction of downtown adult residents were

college graduates in 1980. Our claim is that the cities with a larger baseline share of college

graduates are more likely to be robust center cities and such cities will be more likely to

experience public transit growth as this mode of travel is focused on serving the city center. We

use data from the National Transit Database’s Service Data and Operating Expenses Times

Series file.11 This data source provides us with data on the passenger miles travelled (PMT) by

mode by urban area by year. We aggregate this into total PMT per year for each urban area and

we run OLS regressions of the form:



                                                                                  (2).



           In equation (2),    is the urban area fixed effect, is the time trend (1991 is set equal to

1) and       is the coefficient on this variable,    is an indicator variable equal to one if the

                                                     12
population of the urban area is greater than one million and         is a coefficient to be estimated,

is a vector of metropolitan area attributes, and        is the error term. In this equation, we focus on

the two interaction terms. The first is the interaction between the time trend and a dummy

variable that equals one if the UZA’s population is greater than one million, and the second is the

interaction between the time trend and the 1980 share of downtown college graduates. As

documented by Levitt (2004), the early 1990s was when urban crime started to decline sharply.

       Table 3 reports the results. We find statistically significant evidence that the positive

time trend in public transit use is higher for cities with larger shares of downtown human capital.

In Table 3, we report two estimates of equation (2). In both regressions, we include urban area

fixed effects. The regressions include data for 214 urban areas from 1991 to 2009. As shown in

column (1), passenger miles travelled have increased by 1.8% per year on average. In column

(2), we re-estimate equation (2) and include the two interactions. Urban areas with a population

greater than 1 million have experienced a time trend of 2% per year. Those urban areas with a

larger share of college graduates living downtown in 1980 have experienced greater growth. The

coefficient of 0.094 indicates that a 10 percentage point higher downtown share increases the

trend growth rate by 0.9% per year, so a city with more than 1 million people and with a 10

percentage point higher share of college graduates downtown would have PMT grow by 2.9%

per year more than a city with fewer than a million people and less human capital downtown.



Which Major Urban Areas Feature Low Carbon Public Transit?



The final hypothesis we test focuses on the inter-city variation in the public transit system’s

carbon intensity. Across cities, there is variation in public transit trip modes (i.e. subway versus


                                                   13
bus) and the inventory of capital that cities have (i.e. bus size and vintage and fuels used for bus

trips). Subways, in urban areas that have them, rely heavily on electricity. The carbon

emissions from such consumption hinges on the local emissions factor of the state’s electric

utilities. If the state’s power is generated using coal, then the same amount of electricity creates

more carbon than if the state uses renewables or natural gas. Most bus systems use fossil fuels to

power their vehicles. Depending on a public transit system’s inventory of buses, the carbon

emissions per passenger mile of bus use will differ.

        In this section, we quantify the average carbon dioxide production per mile of passenger

travel using public transit data for urban areas. The 2011 National Transit Database provides

aggregate system wide information by urban area by public transit mode on energy consumption

and passenger miles travelled.12        We use the following equation to calculate total pounds of

carbon dioxide from fossil fuels (measured in gallons).13



CO2 from fuel = 22.38*Diesel + 19.64*Gasoline + 13.23*LPG + 16.11*LNG + 9.06*Methane

   The NTD was established by Congress to be the Nation’s primary source for information and statistics on the
transit systems of the United States. Recipients or beneficiaries of grants from the Federal Transit Administration
(FTA) under the Urbanized Area Formula Program (§5307) or Other than Urbanized Area (Rural) Formula
Program (§5311) are required by statute to submit data to the NTD. Over 660 transit providers in urbanized areas
currently report to the NTD through the Internet-based reporting system. Each year, NTD performance data are used
to apportion over $5 billion of FTA funds to transit agencies in urbanized areas (UZAs). Annual NTD reports are
submitted to Congress summarizing transit service and safety data. http://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/ntd.htm
and http://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/datbase/2011_database/NTDdatabase.htm

   Our data sources for these emissions factors are Knittel (2012) and the US Energy Information Administration –
Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gasses Program (http://www.eia.gov/oiaf/1605/coefficients.html#tbl2).

           We calculate total megawatts of electricity used for public transit. To convert these

megawatts of power into pounds of CO2 we use 2009 EGRID data to calculate each state’s

average electric utility carbon dioxide emissions factor.14 The 2009 EGRID provides power

plant level data on each utility’s emissions factor and power generation. We use these data to

calculate a weighted mean for each state. By multiplying the system’s total electricity in MW by

the state level emissions factor (pounds of carbon per MW), we then can add the fossil fuels

consumption from transport to the carbon from electricity. We then calculate each city’s carbon

dioxide emissions per passenger mile. For urban areas with multiple public transit systems and

commuter rail, we sum up the various systems within the jurisdiction.

           In Table 4, we present our city specific emissions factors based on the 2011 data for 26

major urban areas. A city can have a high public transit carbon per mile because of fossil fuel

used by state’s utilities or because using high carbon fuels for buses that don’t carry many

passengers. If public transit is a constant returns to scale technology, then we can use the

estimates reported in Table 4 to infer what is the net environmental gains from substituting a

mile of private vehicle travel to a mile of public transit travel. If a car has a fuel economy of

27.5 MPG then it requires 0.036 gallons per mile. Using an emissions factor of 19.64 pounds per

gallon yields a per mile carbon production equal to 0.036*19.64 or 0.714 pounds of carbon

dioxide per mile. This is roughly six times higher than major public transit systems such as NYC

or San Francisco. Table 4 presents the ranking of major city carbon emissions factors. San

Francisco and New York City are the top two at 0.122 and 0.136. Perhaps surprisingly, Houston

is number 3 at 0.152 while Seattle’s public transit has the largest carbon emissions factor at

0.719.

Conclusion



   Given that climate change is a global public bad, no metropolitan area has strong incentives

to unilaterally seek to be a “low carbon” city. In contrast, in this footloose age where cities are

transitioning from being producer cities to consumer cities, center cities have strong incentives to

offer a high quality of life. Such cities that offer significant local public goods and consumption

opportunities are more likely to retain the skilled to live in their jurisdiction. This paper has used

several data sets to document that there is an association between attracting the highly educated

downtown and the overall metropolitan area having a smaller carbon footprint from

transportation. Building on past research, we have made the intuitive assumption that

downtowns that have a large metropolitan area job share and that have large shares of adults who

are college graduates are areas offering opportunities for work and leisure. In short, consumer

center cities contribute to creating low carbon metropolitan areas (Glaeser and Kahn 2010).

   Throughout this paper, we have taken the spatial distribution of households as given. Future

research could consider introducing a general equilibrium model of zoning in which the center

city chooses its zoning intensity and this both affects the local public goods bundle and the

equilibrium price of housing in the center city and the suburbs. Heterogeneous households

would take this pricing gradient as given and choose where in the suburbs to live as developers

build in such locations (Anas, Arnott and Small 1998). As center city vitality increases, the

model would yield predictions about the new spatial distribution of households throughout the

metropolitan area and this could be used in conjunction with estimates such as what we report in

Table 1 to predict the carbon emissions reductions.

The omitted category is a household who lives in the Northeast in a metropolitan area that does
not have a subway and is below the median WLURI. The regression includes control variables
for household income categories, age, household size, number of drivers. Robust standard errors
are reported in parentheses. The standard errors are adjusted for metro area clustering.
