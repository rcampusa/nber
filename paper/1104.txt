              CHARACTERISTICS OF U.S. MANUFACTURING COMPANIES
         INVESTING ABROAD AND THEIR CHOICE OF PRODUCTION LOCATIONS



                                 ABSTRACT


      The purpose of this paper is to examine the relations among charac-
teristics of U.S. firms, their tendency to invest abroad, and their choice
of production locations. The larger the firm, and the higher its profitabi—
lity, capital Intensity, technological Intensity, and the skill level of
its labor force, the higher the probability that it was a foreign investor.
Some of these factors were largely associated with the industry the firm
was in but size, R&D, and profitability were characteristics of investing
firms within individual industries.

      Despite its importance in determining the probability that a firm
would invest abroad, size of firm appeared to have no relation to the
importance of foreign investment; among firms that invested at all, large
firms did not produce a higher proportion of their output abroad than small
firms. The concentration of manufacturing abroad in a small number of corn-
panies Is largely a reflection of the concentration within the United
States. The influence of size, we conclude, reflects economies of scale
not In production but in investing.

      We found no evidence that, in general, low—wage U.S. firms tended to
invest in low—wage countries or that R&D—intensive firms tended to operate
more in countries with highly sophisticated or educated labor. In fact,
investors in developing countries, and particularly those in some Southeast
Asian countries, tended to be more R&D intensive than investors in devel-
oped countries. There was some indication that in industries other than
machinery R&D—intensive firms were more inclined than others to license
technology, while in the machinery industries, R&D—intensive firms tended
to license less:  to exploit their technological capital In foreign markets
by producing there rather than by licensing.

Introduction
      One common thread that runs through most explanations of the role of

multinational firms is that their distinctive characteristic is possession

of some technological advantage over other firms. This could be the

possession of a patented or difficult to imitate process or product but it

might also be knowledge about production or marketing or servicing a

complex product. It could be a particular quality of product or its

suitability in particular uses or the firm's ability to assist buyers in

using the product or to persuade buyers to purchase the product. The

advantage is usually difficult to identify and measure, because it rarely

takes the form simply of measurably higher output for the same amount of

identifiable inputs. The difficulty of demonstrating the existence of or

measuring the extent of this mysterious factor of production, which we can

broadly identify as "technology," is one reason why It tends to be

exchanged   in internal markets——that is, within a firm——rather than traded
among firms. By the same token, this difficulty of measurement makes it

hard to learn whether technological advantages are the basis for direct

investment or to know what results would flow from limitations on

investment.

Who Invests Abroad?

      A parent firm's distinctive characteristics are presumably what enable

it to produce in a host country in competition with local firms that may

have advantages of being at home:   the favor of the government, knowledge

of the language and customs of the country, consumer goodwill, and so on.

The attributes of the multinational firm are composed of several elements:

those associated with the country that is the home base of the firm, those

associated with the industry, and those specific to the firm (Kravis and

Lipsey, 1982). The home country attributes must be those that are absorbed

by the company, embodied in mobile factors of production, such as the

management or scientific or marketing staff, and carried over to production

abroad. The industry attributes are those common to firms in an industry

regardless of national origin, and the firm attributes are those that

distinguish the company from others in its own country and industry, such

as leadership in innovation or in quality of product. The same

characteristics may appear in each category; for example, a high level of

R&D is a characteristic of U.S. firms in general, as compared to those from

other countries, but firms in the pharmaceutical industry have high levels

of R&D relative to those in other industries in the United States and in

other countries, and some firms within each country's pharmaceutical

industry have much higher levels of R&D investment than the industry

ave rage.

     In this paper we deal mainly with what we describe as industry and

firm characteristics. There may be some country characteristics mixed in,

but we cannot distinguish them in a study relying on one country's data.
                                      —3—

 We do point out some similarities to, and differences from, Swedish

  investors, the only other national group studied extensively. Even with

  respect to Sweden and the United States, however, there has not yet been a

 careful comparative study.

      The accepted notion of what characteristics distinguish multinational

 parent firms from others, as summarized in Hufbauer's (1975) survey, is

 that they are a mixture of technological—rent and
                                                     industrial—organization
 factors, not completely independent of each other. Multinational firms are

 set apart from others by, among other
                                         characteristics, their large size,

 high profitability, and heavy expenditures on R&D and advertising.

 Hufbauer quotes Horst (1972) as having established that within industries

 only size distinguishes multinational firms from others in their

 industries, at least among U.S.—based firms. The implication is that all

 the other characteristics are industry attributes. Thus size of firm is a

 rival to technological characteristics as an explanation of foreign

investment decisions among parents within an industry.

     Comparing the attributes of investing firms with those of other fIrms

is a more complex problem than might appear at first glance. While we know

a good deal about U.S. firms investing abroad, from the direct investment

surveys of the Bureau of Economic Analysis (U.S. Department of
                                                                 Commerce,
1975 and 1981), there are no comparable data, using the same Industry

classifications,   parent firm definitions, and firm attributes, for

noninvestors. Data sources with information for large numbers of

individual firms that include both investors and noninvestors, such as

Moody's Industrials or the Standard and Poor's Compustat tapes, do not
                                  —4--


identify all foreign direct investors arid do not distinguish between

domestic and foreign activities of individual firms. We use both of these

sources of data to characterize firms we identify as investors or

noninvestors.

     In Table 1, we compare U.S. parents of majority—owned manufacturing

affiliates with their industries with respect to several measures of R&D

intensity and average compensation (which we take in comparisons within the

U.S. to be a measure of average skill level of the labor force). The

parent data refer to the consolidated domestic operations of manufacturing

industry parents of affiliates in all industries. For comparability, we

restricted our industry data to those which excluded foreign operations,

although this limited the kinds of comparisons we could make. We were

unable, for example, to include any industry profitability measures because

these included profits from foreign operations. It was not possible to

obtain comparability between parent and industry data in industry

classification, unfortunately. The parent data are classified by major

industry of the enterprise, as are the industry data in the section of the

table referring to R&D expenditures and personnel. The industry data in

the section on employee compensation are classified by establishment. They

thus more accurately represent industry characteristics but are less

comparable to the parent data.

     A comparison of the absolute numbers reported by the various sources

points up some of the difficulties in this comparison. One is that the

investors made up a large part of the universe of manufacturing

enterprises, 84.4 per cent of employment and 87.6 per cent of the R&D

Notes to TABLE 1

      All parent data are from U.S. Department of Commerce (1981) Tables
III.R1, IIl.S2, III.S3, and III.U1. Industry data on R&D expenditures and
employment are from U.S. National Science Foundation (1980) and industry
data on other variables are from U.S. Bureau of the Census (1981), Section
1, General Summary, Tables 1 and 2. All parent data and industry data in
section on R&D refer to the consolidated U.S. operations of enterprises.
Industry data in section on employee compensation refer to establishments
in the United States.

scientists and engineers. The characteristics of parents could not,

 therefore, diverge much from those of enterprises in their industries.

Parents accounted for a much smaller share of manufacturing establishment

employment——only 60 per cent. If comparability were perfect we could

subtract    the parent values from those for enterprises in their industries
to   obtain estimates for noninvestors, and we did make such a calculation

for total manufacturing. However, it is clear that at least for the

industry groups there are differences in classification or measurement,

since parent numbers exceed the industry numbers in three of the six

industries.

      We   measured skill intensity by levels   of employee compensation,

assuming that the more skilled workers command higher salaries. In every

industry but   food   products, the parent companies paid higher than average

levels of total compensation per employee. Average payroll per production

worker (total compensation was not available) shows the parent companies

higher in all but two industries: food products, again, and chemicals.

The magnitude of the difference in compensation per employee between parent

and industry for total manufacturing is larger than that for any individual

industry. This would suggest that the difference results not only from

individual industry differences, but also from a different industry mix——

the parent firms must have been concentrated in higher paying industries,

as well as paying above average wages for their industry. Thus the

multinational firms appear to be relatively skill—intensive within

relatively skill—intensive industries.

      We cannot, on the other hand, draw any strong conclusions from these
                                     —8—



data   about the R&D intensity of the multinationals. One gets the general

impression that the parents were, overall, slightly more R&D intensive, and

they appeared more R&D intensive in twice as many comparisons as they

appeared less so. However, the ratios are often extremely close, or equal

to each other. Among the four measures in Table 1 there is none that

points consistently one way or the other. For only three industries is

there any general agreement among them: in both the metal manufactures and

nonelectrical machinery industries, the parents' R&D levels were higher

than average, while in the chemical industry, they were lower. For the

rest of the industries, as well for total manufactures, the parents' R&D

intensity was very similar to that of their industries. One would have to

conclude from this set of data, for most industries, and for manufacturing

in general, that there were no major differences between multinational

parents and their industries in R&D intensity.

       Calculations for noninvestors, that is industry minus parents, were

performed only for total manufacturing, because we did not think the

industry classifications were comparable. They show consistently that

parents were higher—wage companies and, by three measures Out of four, more

research—intensive as well. The lack of any difference for the rate of

total R&D expenditures to sales may reflect the fact that there were some

very R&D—intensive industries with major government financing of R&D, such

as aircraft and missiles, that invest very little abroad. We cannot say

whether these differences in R&D intensity are to be attributed to intra—

industry   differences or to industry mix. There are also some differences
in definition between the parent   and industry definitions of R&D
                                    —9—

 expenditures, the importance of which we do not know. One of these is the

 inclusion in the parent data of company—financed R&D performed outside the

 company.

     Another measure sometimes used as a proxy for skill levels of the

 labor force is the proportion of nonproduction workers. The data showed

 the parent companies to have had much higher levels than their industries—--

almost 50 per cent higher for manufacturing as a whole and over 50 per cent

in some industries. However, we did not consider this difference

believable for two reasons. One was that parents were such a large part of

their industries that the ratios would have to be close if they were

measured properly. The other was that the data showed parents having much

higher proportions of nonproduction workers even in industries in which

parents' average compensation levels were lower.

     Another way of studying the characteristics of investing firms is by

using information on individual companies from standard sources of company

financial data within which we attempted to distinguish foreign direct

investors. One advantage over the calculations of Table 1 is that the

characteristics for investors and noninvestors are from the same source and

are therefore comparable. Another is that the companies can be compared

with their industries at the 4—digit SIC level rather than at the very

broad industry groups of Table 1. The comparison with the more detailed

industries should tend to raise the importance of industry differences and

reduce the influence of company divergences from their industries.

     The comparisons of firms with their industries are done in two ways.

For most items, the industry measures, referred to as enterprise data, are
                                  — 10 -



from the same sources as the firm data and are unweighted averages of the
measures for the firms in the sample. For a few items, referred to as

establishment data, the industry measures are calculated separately for

each firm by weighting industry characteristics derived from the Census of

Manufactures by the proportion of the firm's domestic (TJ.s.) employment

that is in each industry. These are thus measures of the characteristics

each firm would have shown if in each industry in which it operated it was

exactly like the average firm. The establishment data are better than our

enterprise data in two respects. One is that they apply only to

establishments in the industry, rather than to all establishments, whatever

their industry, of every firm classified in that industry. The second is

that the individual firms are assigned the attributes of all the industries

in which they operate rather than only those of the principal industry for

each firm.

     The data suffer from a number of disadvantages. One is that we can

only characterize firms here by the attributes of their worldwide

operations, assuming for this purpose that these attributes determined

investment decisions and were not simply a reflection of them. Thus an

investing firm paying high wages in the United States may appear here as

one paying lower wages in the aggregate if foreign operations in low—wage

countries were important in the total. However, since the bulk of foreign

operations were in comparatively high wage countries and since they were

not a very large part of total employment for most companies, although they

were for some, we suspect that the inclusion of foreign operations does not

produce very different results from those we would have arrived at from an
                                     — 11 —




 analysis   in which characterizations of firms   were based on domestic (u.s.)
 attributes.
   Another drawback of these data is that to avoid incomparabilities in

 definitions of characteristics between firms and their industries we do not

calculate differences between firms and industries or ratios of firms to

industries using the establishment—based industry characteristics, but only

using "industry" averages for the firms in our data set. Since the firms

usually cover several industries, these "industry" averages may tend to

blur the distinctions among more precisely defined industries such as could

be calculated from establishment data. For that reason we do show a few

establishment—based industry characteristics of firms for comparison. As

was pointed out in connection with Table 1, the investors tended to

dominate most of the industries. That problem is exacerbated in the

company data by the incompleteness of the sample, which probably omits more

small noninvesting firms than investors. The industry averages are thus

biased to resemble the larger firms.

     Table 2 compares U.S. firms that invest abroad with those that did not

have any such operations, not even sales subsidiaries. Columns (1) and (2)

compare the two sets of firms directly, without regard to their industry

affiliation. In columns (3) and (4) we compare the industry

characteristics of the two groups by attributing to each firm the average

characteristics of the industry or industries to which it belonged. In

effect this comparison assumes that there are such things as attributes

that are common to firms in an industry regardless of their foreign

investment or other individual characteristics. The industry

Notes to TABLE 2

Col. (I) and (2):          NBER   company data for manufacturing firms, mainly based
           on   publicly available financial information, were matched with our
           listing of investors and noninvestors, as identified for a period
           around 1971—72, and with our tabulation of the industry distribution
           o1 company employment in the United States. For a description of the
           data sets see Lipsey (1978).
                 Numbers of observations range from 204 for Compensation per
        employee and 650—770 for R&D intensity, Noncomperisation VA per
        employee, and Rate of growth of employment to 900—1,000 for the other
        var I a hi. e s.



Col. (3) and (4): Enterprise data (Rows 1—9, 11—14, and 17) are derived
      from our own data and therefore include information only for those
      companies that were included in that set. Each firm is therefore
      assigned the characteristics of the average of all the firms in the
      same 4—digit SIC industry in our data set rather than the charac-
      teristics of the industry as a whole. For this purpose, each firm is
      included only in its principal industry.

            The establishment data (Rows 10, 15, 16, and 18) take advantage
       of the information for whole industries collected on an establishment
       basis for the Census of Manufactures and similar surveys. For each
       firm, the attributes of its industries are weighted up by the
       employment distribution for the firm. Thus, the figure for
       Scientists and engineers/Employment shows the ratio each firm would
       have had if in each of the industries in which it operated it used
       the same proportion as the average for the industry.

            Numbers of observations are as in Col. (1) and (2) for
       enterprise data and over 1,250 for establishment data.

characteristics    are calculated in two ways, from enterprise data and from

establishment data, as explained above, and we consider the latter more

reliable. Unfortunately, they are also more difficult to compare directly

with the data for firms in columns (1) and (2), because they are from

different sources, and we therefore do not make direct comparisons.         In

columns (5) through (8) we compare each firm to its own industry, using

only the industry data on an enterprise basis. We do not directly compare

investors with noninvestors since the industries may be quite different.

     Among the variables related to the technology of firms the most direct

measures of input into technology are those of R&D intensity. They show

that investors spent more heavily than did noninvestors. The differences

in R&D    input shown here are much larger than those in Table   1.   Another

variable we take to represent an aspect of     technology is the physical
capital    intensity of production, as measured by various ratios of nonhuman

capital input to employment. The investors were more capital intensive, by

every measure. A counterpart to the nonhuman capital intensity is the

human capital or skill intensity. We have, on the firm level, only average

compensation per employee as a measure, and even that is poorly covered in

the sample. The noninvestors appear to have been higher—wage, presumably

higher-skill, firms. Since the total compensation figures are based on

only about a fifth of the firms and since the data in Table 1 point to the

opposite result——that investors paid high—compensation per worker——we have

to describe the issue of skill levels as not settled.

    Investors were more profitable than noninvestors, and by a large

margin. This is a variable that is difficult to classify with respect to
                                     — 15 —



its    relation to technological factors. It could represent the exercise of

market power derived from size, rather than from technological leadership.

On the other hand, it could represent higher than normal profits, true

rents, on technological investment, in which case it would be a

technological output measure, reflecting the success of R&D investment.

       Rates of growth, another possible reflection of technological success,

but also of many other factors, differed little between investors and

noninvestors except in the case of employment growth.

       The largest difference between investors and noninvestors was in size,

which can be, as we said earlier, an alternative to technological factors

as an explanation of investment. The investors were, on the average, six

to nine times as large as the noninvestors by the three size measures.'- As

in the case of profitability, there is some ambiguity about the reason for

the relationship. The size of investors may reflect economies of scale in

investing, as Caves suggests.2 Large size may open up the possibility of

economies achieved by splitting up a product line or stages of production

into   parts suitable for different economic envIronments, as In the division
between wafer production in developed countries and assembly in developing
countries   by semiconductor companies. It might, on the other hand,

represent mainly the market power of the large investor, or its desire to

exercise that power more effectively in foreign countries.

       These differences between investors and noninvestors may reflect

simply the industry composition of the two groups or, on the other hand,

differences between investing or noninvesting firms and their industries.

We try in various ways to make that distinction in Columns 3 through 8 of
                                    — 16 —



of   Table 2.

       The large differences in R&D intensity between investors and

noninvestors are mirrored in the four measures for the industries of the

two groups. That is, the investors were clearly from more R&D—intensive

industries. The two measures for which we have firm as well as industry

data suggest that about half of the difference was associated with the

industry composition and about half with firm   differences   from their

industries, with perhaps some indication that the latter source of

differences was larger.

      The technology input measure that shows the largest difference between

investors and noninvestors that is associated with industry composition is

the ratio of total scientists and engineers to total employment. This may

measure not R&D input but the technological complexity of the industry or

the pace of technical change, which determines the manpower required for

imitation. Unfortunately we do not have a corresponding measure for

individual firms.3

      We find that investors were more physically capital intensive than

non.investors but in this case the bulk of the difference reflects the

industry composition of the two groups. Relative to their industries the

noninvestors were slightly (4—8 per cent) less capital intensive.

      The surprising higher compensation per worker we found for nonin—

vesting firms turns out to be entirely an industry characteristic. There

was no difference between the two groups relative to their industries.

However, the two industry measures of compensation per worker disagree.

The enterprise measure, more comprehensive in the types of compensation
                                      — 17 —




covered, says that it is the lower—skill industries that tended more to
invest abroad. The establishment measure, covering only wages and salaries

per worker but not other forms of compensation, but based on observations

for many more firms, suggests that the investors came from industries of

slightly higher skill levels.4

     The higher profitability of investing firms, while it partly reflects

the fact that they came from more profitable industries, mainly reflects

the characteristics of the individual firms. That is, the investors were

more profitable than the average firms in their industries. On the other

hand, the higher rates of growth in employment of investing firms were

largely an industry characteristic.

     Size is partly an industry variable. The investors were from

industries in which average firm size was high.5 In addition, investors

were, within their industries, about twice as large as noninvestors.6

     The industry differences in average size of firm could reflect the

extent of scale economies in production, a characteristic of the

Industries' technologies. However, the presence of scale economies in

production is usually considered an obstacle to production abroad. In the

case of Swedish foreign investors, scale economies, as an industry

variable, were negatively related to foreign investment propensities

(Swedenborg, 1979, pp. 128—130).

     Since most large firms had some foreign activity, either manufacturing

or marketing, it is of interest to look at the characteristics of those

that did not. Of the 2,300 manufacturing firms in our company data, only a

little over ten per cent had no foreign subsidiaries. The proportions
                                       — 18 —



differ    greatly among the industries, ranging from 0 to over a quarter among

two—digit SIC classes (Table 3).

      The industries in which the United States does not enjoy a comparative

advantage in trade and that have had severe problems with import competition,

such as leather and products, apparel, primary metals, and transportation

equipment were also the ones with the highest proportions of noninvestors.

The industries that had very few firms that did not invest abroad, such as

instruments, chemicals, and nonelectrical machinery, were those in which

the U.S. comparative advantage is concentrated. The industries with the
                                     — 19 —


 highest   skill levels and R&D intensity were also concentrated at the bottom

 of the list with very few noninvesting firms, while the low—skill and low

R&D—intensity industries were mostly among those with higher numbers of

 noninvestors. There is no clear relationship to physical capital inten-

sity. Chemicals and petroleum refining were in the group in which almost

all firms invested abroad, but primary metals, also physical—capital inten-

sive, had a high proportion of noninvestors. Leather and products and

apparel, both labor—intensive, had many noninvestors, but machinery, also

fairly labor-intensive, had very few.

     One industry characteristic we thought might distinguish firms likely

to invest abroad was the cost of transporting the product, conceived

broadly to include any factors that required production close to consumers.

An industry in which U.S. firms possessed the technological advantages

needed to sell abroad hut in which exporting was difficult because the

product was bulky or needed extensive attention at the consumption location

would be likely to produce extensively abroad. We attempted to measure the

difficulty of long—distance marketing from data on the U.S. market, hoping

that it would be associated with industries in which establishments shipped

their product relativey short distances. The logic of the hypothesis

requires a division between firms with and without foreign manufacturing

rather than those with and without any foreign subsidiaries, but we did not

have the manufacturing information. The effect is probably to blur our

results since firms which centralize production and only export from the

United States may nevertheless establish foreign sales affiliates and

therefore appear in our data as foreign investors.

    The data give no confirmation at all to the role of this variable.

The investors shipped over a longer distance on the average, rather than a

shorter one, by both measures. Unless the results are dominated by the

operations of trading subsidiaries, we can drop this variable from

consideration   as an important determinant of investment.
    Foreign investment has also been associated with the degree of
concentration   in an industry. We can test that relationship in our data by

comparing the average concentration ratios among the industries of the two

groups of firms. The differences are not large but they are consistent

 from one measure to another. The investing firms were from industries with

 higher levels of concentration than those of the noninvesting firms, as has

 been   suspected.
        All these analyses up to this point of the probability that a firm
 would be a foreign investor have been univariate. They have ignored the

 possibility that the apparent influence of one variable may   reflect   that of

 another correlated with it or the possibility that several variables in

 combination explain the probabilities. A way of investigating this issue

 is with a multivariate logit analysis in which the dependent variable is

 the probability that a firm will be an investor or a multinational firm, or

 the per cent of a group of firms that will be investors or multinational

 firms,   and the independent variables are the ones listed in Tables 1 and 2.
We can also add industry dummy variables and, for the pharmaceutical
 industry, certain measures of a company's innovativeness developed in an
earlier study.
        For our own measure of the probability of being any type of foreign
investor, the logit analysis pointed to only one variable, the size of the
firm. Neither the other characteristics of Industries or firms or industry
dummies improved on this variable. Because of the high proportion of

investors by this definition overall and in most industries we thought the

logit equation might not provide a good fit and we experimented with the

much more restrictive definition of a multinational firm used In the

Harvard studies (Vaupel and Curhan, 1973, p. 2), principally that the firm

should have equity interests of 25 per cent or more In manufacturing firms

located in six or more countries outside the United States. This criterion

was met by fewer than 200 firms.

     The main variable determining multlnatlonality in this sense was again
                                    — 22 —



size,    but profitability, as measured by the ratio of net income to sales

(and with possible relationships to technology and/or monopolistic power,

as mentioned earlier), was also significant. Some industry dummy variables

were significant, positive for chemicals and foods, negative for primary

metals. The measure distinguishing "innovative" pharmaceutical companies

from others and those purporting to measure the innovativeness of these

companies (Cohen, Katz, and Beck, 1975) did not help to distinguish multi-

national manufacturing investors from others within that industry.

        To summarize, we have strong evidence supporting earlier findings that

size of firm is of great importance in determining the probability that a

firm will invest abroad. Profitability and technological intensity also

seem to encourage foreign investment.

        Most of the industry and firm characteristics worked together, as can

be seen in the following table which shows the per cent of differences

between investors and noninvestors that is explained by differences in the

characteristics of the industries they are in:

  High skill levels, if they served at all to distinguish investors from

noninvestors, were almost entirely an industry determinant of the

probability of being an investor rather than an influence on the firm's

behavior relative to its industry. The same was true to a smaller extent

of physical capital Intensity. Depending on the size measure used, we find

that 40 to 60 per cent of the difference in size between investors and

noninvestors could be attributed to industry, and the rest to the deviation

of companies from their industry average. While most of the industry and

firm characteristics worked together there was one exception, the rate of

growth of assets, in which they pulled in opposite directions: the
                                   — 24 —


investors   were from slightly slower—growing industries but they were the

faster—growing companies within those industries. However, the differences

involved were too small to deserve much attention. On the other hand, the

investors were from industries growing faster in employment than those of

the nonirivestors and were the faster growing employers in those industries.

     The two characteristics for which the behavior of firms relative to

their industries was more important than the behavior of industries were

technological intensity and profitability. In both cases the deviation of

investing firms from their industry averages accounted for about 60 per

cent or more of the overall difference between investor and noninvestor

firms. Thus, aside from industry differences and that of size of firm

within industries, we found, in contrast to earlier studies, two variables

that influence the selection of foreign investors within industries. One

is the extent of input into R&D, which is a technological input, and the

other is profitability, which might reflect input into technology, the

other sources.

     One way of attempting to explain the results of our comparisons of

investors and noninvestors is by referring to theories that treat

technology as a changing, rather than a fixed, characteristic of

commodities. Among these are the "availability" hypothesis of Kravis

(1956) and the product cycle hypothesis (Vernon, 1966, and Gruber, Vernon,

and Mehta, (1967). To do this we must stretch these theories to associate

the life cycle of firms with the life cycle of commodities.

    The noninvestors, according to this interpretation, are comparatively

new firms producing new or innovative products in the early stages of the

product cycle. Such products tend to be manufactured in the United States

by U.S.—based firms because at that stage of their lives they are still
                                     — 25   —




being    experimented with, modified, and adapted to markets and need the high

skill levels and particularly the skill at innovation of the U.S. labor

force.     The investors are larger, more mature firms producing older
products that have moved into the large—scale   production stage. These

products   are possibly capital intensive, and now adaptable to production
abroad   with less skilled labor.   In fact, since the production process has

become more routine and does not need the skill of U.S. technical labor,

the U.S. firms must produce abroad where unskilled labor is cheaper or face

losing the market for the product.

     We do find the noninvestors to have been small relative to investors

within and among industries and less capital intensive, both as might be

expected from the life—cycle notion. However, several of the results do

not seem to be in accord with the theory: investors were more R&D or

technology intensive, by every measure, both within and among industries,

were the faster growing firms within their industries, and did not differ

substantially from noninvestors in average wage levels, presumably an

indication of skill level. Some of these calculations point to another

explanation of investment. Not every industry manufacturing older

products can transfer its production abroad because production abroad

requires some advantage over local firms such as that conferred by high

technological intensity. In an industry without such advantages, or for a

firm with no technological advantages, production moves from the United

States not to foreign affiliates of U.S. firms but to non—U.S. producers.

That possibility would explain our finding that overseas investors tend to

be from R&D—intensive industries and to be R&D—intensive firms within

industries.

 Size of Firm and the Propensity to Invest Abroad

     The distinction between the probability of being a foreign investor

and the extent of foreign investment, or propensity to invest or produce

abroad, was made in Hufbauer's (1975) survey. He pointed out that the

evidence available for the United States was on the influence of size on

the likelihood that a firm would be a foreign investor but not on the

extent of such Investment. The distinction was tested in a study of

Swedish firms (Swedenborg, 1979) which confirmed Horst's finding as to the

probability of being a foreign investor but "contradict the common notion

that large firms invest relatively more abroad than small firms do, due to

advantages of firm size or oligopoly considerations." In fact, the elasti-

city of foreign sales with respect to domestic sales size was reduced

below one in an equation relating foreign affiliate sales not only to

domestic sales but also to R&D intensity, physical—capital intensity, labor

skill (or human capital intensity), and age of foreign operations.

     We have not made as thorough an analysis of the U.S. data but a

preliminary look at the 1970 cross—section suggests the same conclusion.

In all manufacturing industries combined the foreign investment

propensities, as measured by median ratios of manufacturing affiliate net

sales to parent domestic sales, did not increase with firm size among those

firms that were investors, as can be seen below. The relationship was

erratic, with the highest foreign sales ratios in the class of firms with

only $50 to $100 million in domestic sales, and lower median ratios of

affiliate to parent sales at the larger parent firm sizes than at the two

smallest   ones shown.

      Table 4 shows the results of a set of linear regression equations

 across all manufacturing industries, all excluding transportation

 equipment, and within 5 broad industry groups, the best breakdown we could

 get with this limited number of observations. Two measures of foreign and

domestic size are used: fixed assets and employment.

     The equations for all manufacturing firms in the sample have a small

negative constant term, and those for all firms except transport equipment

have a positive one. None is significant, however, and we can interpret

the results as indicating that the equations go through the origin; there

was essentially no relationship between parent size and propensities to

invest abroad. That is, the foreign operations of large parents bore the

same proportion to their domestic operations as did those of small parents.

     When we divide the sample into five industries we get mixed results.

Only two constant terms are statistically significant at the 5 per cent

level, a positive one for parent employment in metals and a negative one

for parent employment in metals and a negative one for parent fixed assets

in nonelectrical machinery. The former suggests a negative size effect on

the propensity to invest abroad and the latter a positive one.

    It is possible to run   a   greater variety of equations with data from

the   National Bureau's collection for individual companies. The better ones

for each size variable and each form are shown in Table 5. They show more

evidence for a decline than for a rise in the propensity to invest abroad

as size of firm increases. All the significant coefficients for the

squared size term in arithmetic equations are negative. Of the

coefficients for log of size in the logarithmic equations, all significant

at the 5 per cent level, three are below one and two are above.

      The equations for individual industries in Table 6 also give little

support for the idea that size of firm is related to foreign investment

propensities. For the industry with the largest number of observations,

machinery, the best equation includes a significant negative term for the

square of the size variable and the other two arithmetic equations have

insignificant squared terms. The log equations, which fit the data less

well, include two size coefficients below one and one very slightly above.

The chemical industry results are similarly unfavorable to a positive

relation of size to propensity. The arithmetic equations again fit much

better than the log equations and all include negative squared terms for

size. The log equations produce two coefficients for the log of size that

are above one, but only slightly, and one substantially below one. For the

other two industries, foods, and metals and mining (partly outside the

coverage of our industries), we have only 10 to 13 observations for each

equation. The arithmetic equations, again the better ones, include no

significant squared terms. The log equations, which do not fit as well, do

have some coefficients for log of size substantially above one. The only

significant evidence we have for a positive relationship between size and

the propensity to invest abroad is for the oil industry, which is outside

the range of our study. In that case the log equation is the better one

 and the coefficient for log of size is well above two. However, there are

 only 10 observations for this equation.

       Our general conclusion on the influence of size of firm is to support

 the belief that it is an important influence, but only as a threshold

 effect: an effect on the decision to invest abroad but not, once foreign

 investment has been established, on the fraction of the firm's resources

devoted to foreign activity. It reflects economies of scale, not in

production, but in foreign investing, and such economies of scale account

for the higher frequency of foreign investors among larger firms.      However,

they seem to be in the nature of indivisibilities which have little or no

influence once a firm has surmounted the initial barrier to becoming a

foreign investor.


The Location of Investment

       Another question we can ask is whether the technological

characteristics of industries and firms influence their choices among

locations for investment. We pursue this issue first by comparing the

parents that located in two very different types of host countries, Sweden

on the one hand, a high—wage, high—skill, developed country, and Brazil and

Mexico on the other, two rapidly industrializing developing countries, but
with   far lower wages and skill levels than Sweden. Those countries are
compared here not only because of the contrast   in   environments they provide
but also because reasonably complete lists of U.S. investors are available
that permit us to use our own company data for analysis (Table 7).
       Investors in Sweden were far more R&D—intensive firms than those in
Brazil or Mexico, as measured by the ratios of R&D expenditures to    sales
and employment. They were from R&D—intensive and technology—intensive

      The list of U.S. investors in Sweden was supplied by an agency of the
Swedish government. The list of investors in Mexico and Brazil was from

industries,   by the same measures as well as by measures of employment.

They were in addition, by a large margin, the more R&D—intensive firms

within their industries.

     Since Sweden is a high—wage country, at least for unskilled labor, we

might expect it to attract the most capital—intensive U.S. firms. In fact,

the parents of Mexican and Brazilian affiliates were more capital intensive

and were from more capital—intensive industries than those investing in

Sweden. Within industries, however, we could not observe any consistent

relationship to capital intensity.

     Sweden's comparative advantage is often associated with skill

intensity, but our measure, compensation per employee, suggests that skill

intensity did not distinguish investors in Sweden from those investing in

Mexico or Brazil. The investors in Sweden came from industries of somewhat

higher skill levels but within their industries they were lower wage—firms.

In other words, firms which, within their industries, were the lower-wage

firms, presumably those with a lower—skill labor force, tended to establish

affiliates in one of the highest—wage countries .iith a highly skilled labor

force, as if they were seeking characteristics in their affiliates opposite

to those of the parent operations in the United States.7

    Among the other firm characteristics we have information for,

investors in Sweden were smaller and they were from industries

characterized by relatively small firms, probably a reflection of the

concentration on machinery investment8 and the absence of U.S. auto

companies. They were also relatively small firms in their industries.

There are thus indications that economies of scale in production were a

characteristic that did not favor locating in Sweden.

    The firms investing in Sweden were from industries of faster growing
                                     — 37 —


 and more profitable firms and they were also, within their industries, the

 firms with these characteristics. Both of these may be related to the high

 level of R&D intensity among investors in Sweden.

        The sharpest distinction we found between firms investing in Sweden

 and those investing in Mexico or Brazil was the extent of expenditure on

 R&D. The higher R&D levels of the firms investing in Sweden were clearly

 not related to size since the Swedish firms tended to be smaller, and we

 thus have further evidence of the importance of this technology input

variable in explaining within—industry differences in investment.

        A more systematic view of the selection of parents for investing in

different locations can be gained from the latest survey of U.S. direct

investment (U.S. Department of Commerce, 1981). One indication of the

selection of parents is the distribution, by industry, of parents investing

in various areas of the world. Table 8 gives one measure of that

distribution, the share of each major industry in the total of parent—firm

assets. There is no indication here that physical—capital—intensive U.S.

industries, defined as those with high levels of plant and equipment per

worker, consistently concentrated their investment in high income countries

and labor—intensive U.S. industries in low—income, presumably low—labor—

cost countries. The most capital—intensive industry, chemicals,

represented a higher proportion of investment in developing countries than

in developed countries, while the nonelectrical machinery industry, which

is labor—intensive, was concentrated in developed countries. On the other

hand, electrical machinery and transportation equipment, both labor-
intensive, tended to be more heavily represented in low—income countries.
Similarly, R&D—intensive industries did not consistently choose locations

with highly educated populations. Electrical machinery and chemicals, two

 R&D—intensive industries, were more heavily represented in developing than

 in developed countries.

         Two measures of the capital intensity of parents investing in

 different areas of the world are given in Table 9.      Fixed assets per

 employee    represents physical—capital intensity and total assets per
 employee represents some mixture of physical capital, including
 inventories,   and financial capital. We    show average capital intensities of
 parents    investing in different areas, for all manufacturing and for several

 Industry groups, using weighted and unweighted averages within countries.

        One fairly   consistent feature of the table is that unweighted averages
of net property, plant, and equipment per worker      of Investors in Canada are

lower than weighted averages, overall and In all industries except foods.

Furthermore, the unweighted averages for investors in Canada are

consistently below those for investors in Europe and even those for

investors in developing countries, even though Canadian wages were higher

than European wages and much higher than developing country wages.

Weighted averages for investors in Canada also tend to be relatively low,

but not as consistently or by so much. Since the difference between the

weighted and unweighted averages is in the weight given to the larger

parents,    it tells us something about   the relation of parent size, capital

intensity, and investment location. High physical capital intensity was
associated   with large parent size. Canada apparently attracted a larger
number of    small parents with low physical capital Intensity   that were less
likely   to invest in the developing countries or in Europe. Their presence

reduced the average capital intensities of U.S. investors in Canada,

particularly the unweighted averages, by large amounts. In other words,

 industries,   were more likely to invest In Canada than in developing

 countries despite their labor intensity. The reason was presumably that

 because they were small they did not wish to take the risks or costs of

 investment in developing countries.

     The direction of differences between uriweighted and weighted parent

firm capital intensities is often consistent within industries. In foods

and electrical machinery almost all the unweighted averages are higher for

both total assets and fixed assets per employee. For metals, nonelectrical

machinery, transportation equipment, and "other manufacturing," the

weighted averages are higher. For chemicals, unweighted averages of total

assets per employee are higher while unweighted averages of fixed assets

per employee are lower than weighted. The implication seems to be that

large parent firms were more capital intensive in metals, nonelectrical

machinery, transportation equipment, and the miscellaneous group but were

more labor intensive in foods and electrical machinery and, as measured by

total assets per worker, in chemicals.

     Most of the figures show slightly higher capital intensity among

investors in developing countries than among those in developed countries.

The differences are small and not very consistent from industry to

industry. Although the capital intensities derived from weighted averages

within countries are often quite different from those derived from

unweighted averages, they tell essentially the same story about the capital

intensity of investors in developed and developing countries.

     The relation among parent capital intensity, host—country labor cost,

and parents' selection of countries for investment was examined by

regressions across host countries of parent capital intensity on average

compensation per worker in affiliates.9 The results agree with our
                                   - 42   -



impression from Tables 8 and 9: none of the coefficients is statistically
significant and more are negative than positive. If there is any relation

between the two variables It Is more likely negative than positive, but the

evidence for any relationship is very weak.

     Another set of parent company characteristics we can examine is

related to the technical level of the companies. These characteristics

include the average skill level of employees, as measured by average

compensation per worker, and three variables related to technological

Intensity. These are R&D expenditures as a per cent of sales and two

measures of technology sales: the importance relative to sales of license

fees received from firms not controlled by the parent and of sales under

license by foreign firms not controlled by the parent.

     Investors in developing countries were parents with slightly higher

average compensation than those investing in developed countries among

manufacturing companies in general, but there was no consistent relation

within industries (Table 10). The only fairly consistent difference Is

that investors in Canada seem to have been among the lower-skilled

companies In their Industries relative to other investors, despite the

comparatively high level of education of the Canadian labor force. This

result may reflect the size of investors in Canada mentioned earlier (see

also Kravls and Lipsey, 1982) rather than any selection on the basis of

labor force quality.

    Regressions across countries within industries of parent average wage

coefficients.    The coefficients larger than their standard errors, for

three of the seven industries, are all negative. That is, if there was any

faintly visible relationship, lower—skill firms within their industries in

the United States tended to operate in countries with higher labor quality.

       Our measure of parent R&D intensity, R&D expenditures as a per cent of

sales, reveals a surprising relationship. Investors in developing

countries were more R&D—intensive than investors in developed countries in

manufacturing as a whole and in   every   industry. Some of the differences

were   very small but some were substantial. With respect to this measure as
was true of others, investors in Canada were different:        in this case less
R&D intensive than   those investing in any other area, and by a large margin
in   several cases. However, even investors in Europe were less R&D
intensive than investors in developing    countries in every   industry. In the
two machinery industries, the margin was quite large. There was little

difference in R&D intensity between investors in Europe and investors In

Latin America, but the machinery parent companies investing In the

developing Asian countries were particularly R&D intensive.

       The figures for individual countries (not shown in our tables)    confirm
that   investors in Canada were among the least research intensive, even if

they were not the lowest. Our earlier finding from the individual company

dta for 1972 that investors in Sweden were particularly R&D intensive is

supported here only for the nonelectrical machinery Industry. That was,

however, by far, the main area of U.S. investment in Sweden. In other

industries we do not find investors in Sweden particularly R&D intensive

even relative to those investing in Brazil and Mexico. Investors In
                                     — 45 —




individual    developing Asian countries were not only much more R&D intensive

than others In the machinery industries hut slightly more R&D intensive In

all the other Industries except foods.

     Regressions across countries within industries in which we related

parent R&D intensity to average host—country labor quality again failed to

reveal any selection of parents, or of investment locations by parents, on

this basis. Only one of the coefficients was even as large as its own

standard error.

     The apparent affinity of R&D—intensive parents for low—income

countries may be related to other characteristics of the parents. Larger

parents may tend to have higher R&D Intensities and may also be more able

to bear the costs of investing in developing countries. The latter point

has been documented in this paper and elsewhere (for example, Kravis and

Lipsey, 1982). The developed countries thus attract both larger and

smaller U.S. parents while the developing countries attract mainly the

large ones.

     The particularly high R&D intensity of machinery Industry investors in

developing Asian countries must reflect to some degree the policies of the

semiconductor and computer companies, which are particularly R&D—intensive.

U.S. parents' Investment in developing countries of Asia (except the Middle

East) and the Pacific is heavily concentrated In "Electronic Components and

Accessories" within electrical machinery and "Office and Computing

Machines," within nonelectrical machinery. The ability of the

semiconductor companies to split their stages of production between labor—

intensive operations, carried out in developing countries, and skill— and
                                        — 46 —



technology—intensive operations carried on in developed countries is partly
responsible for this apparently paradoxical choice of host countries by R&D

intensive parents (see Firian, 1975).

      We include two measures of technology sales in Table 10. One is the

ratio to parent sales of fees and royalties received by the parent from

foreign entities other than its own affiliates. The other is product sales

by uncontrolled foreign entities under license from the parent. We

interpret them as representing a mixture of two elements: the

technological level of the parent, which permits it to have some technology

to sell to others, and the tendency to exploit that technology outside the

United States by sales of the technology itself rather than by production

of the goods embodying it. A firm or industry with little technology to

sell would presumably show low ratios to total sales of fees and royalties

and uncontrolled product sales under license. The food industry might be

an example of this situation, since it has low ratios of both R&D and

technology sales to total sales. A firm or industry at a fairly high

technological level might still show low ratios of technology sales to

total sales if it chose to exploit its technological capital by producing

abroad rather than by sales of the technology itself. This might be the

case for the motor vehicle industry which is only slightly below average in

R&D   expenditure but far below average in the importance of uncontrolled
product sales under license.
      Differences in   technology   sales levels   between investors in developed

and developing countries were not very large or consistent among

industries. Within industries two major differences stand out. Electrical
                                    — 47 —


machinery companies investing in developed countries reported larger sales

 by uncontrolled companies under license (but not larger income from such

 sales) than those investing in developing countries while the latter spent

more heavily on R&D. In the other manufacturing group, investors in

developing countries, and especially those investing in Asia, reported both

relatively high sales by uncontrolled companies under license and high

income from fees and royalties from such sales, while they were no more

research—intensive than were investors in Europe. Investors in Canada

were, overall, the lowest in sales under license, income from such sales,

and R&D intensity, but the picture is very different in some industries.

Chemical and metals industry investors in Canada were the least

R&D—intensive group but reported the highest ratios of fees and royalties

received and of sales under license, while "other manufacturing" investors

in Canada were low in all three respects.

     Along the same lines we ran a set of regressions across host

countries, including and excluding Canada, relating two characteristics of

parents investing in them, from the unpublished U.S. Department of Commerce

data for 1977. The dependent variable was the importance to the parents of

technology sales, as measured by the ratio of sales by uncontrolled foreign

entities under license from the parents (TS), and the independent variable

was the ratio of parent R&D expenditures to parent sales (RD). None of the

equations for manufacturing as a whole, foods, chemicals, electrical

machinery, or transportation equipment, explained any of the variation in

technology sales. Equations for the other industries, excluding Canada,

based on 24 observations, are as follows (equations including Canada were
                                      — 48 —


similar):


     TS (Metals)    .162 + 1.367 RD                                 = .13   (1)
                   (.22)   (2.11)

     TS (Nonelectrical machinery)       4.705 —         .587 RD   2 .17     (2)
                                       (5.63)      (2.41)

     TS (Other manufacturing)   —2.123 + 2.903 RD                  = .15    (3)
                                    (.74)      (2.22)


     The relationships seem to vary among the industries. In metals and in

"other manufacturing industries," the more R&D intensive the firms

investing in a country, the greater the importance of sales by uncontrolled

firms under their licenses. In the nonelectrical machinery industry, on

the other hand, higher R&D intensity was negatively related to sales by

others under license. The equation for electrical machinery also had a

negative coefficient hut explained very little of the variation in

technology sales. It may be characteristic of machinery industries that

they exploit their technological capital in foreign markets by production

rather than by licensing. However, this is a question that should be

examined at the individual firm level rather than, as here, by looking at

differences among parents investing in groups of contries.


Conclusions

     The strongest influence on the likelihood that a U.S. manufacturing

firm will be a foreign investor is the size of the firm, as has been noted

by others. Profitability, capital intensity, technological intensity, the

skill level of the labor force, and the rate of growth of the firm, are

also all positively related to the probability of being an investor.

    We separated these relationships between effects common to firms in an

industry and those related to differences between a firm and the industry
                                         — 49 —



average.       About half of the firm   size   effect can be attributed to the

industry of the parent firm and capital intensity is mostly an industry

effect.    Aside from industry differences and that of size of firm within an
industry we found,      in contrast   to some earlier studies, two characteristics
that    influenced the selection of firms within industries. One is the

extent of input into R&D, which is a technological input, and the other is

profitability, which might reflect the output from technological input or

market power derived from other sources.

       The selection of firms and industries as foreign investors tends to

bring   to foreign countries the attributes of the more technically oriented,
faster-growing, and more profitable of U.S. manufacturing firms within
their industries, as well as the larger firms. It also brings to foreign
countries U.S. firms from industries that are capital         intensive and

technologically     oriented.
       While   a number of studies have examined the factors determining the

probability of a firm's being a foreign investor, few have attempted to

explain the propensity to invest abroad——that is, the determinants of the

size of foreign investment or activity relative to domestic. The results

of our test of the effects of size of firm on investment propensities were

somewhat surprising in view of the conclusive evidence that size is the

major determinant of the probability of foreign investment. For

manufacturing as a whole and for major industry groups within manufacturing

we could find little or no evidence from two independent sources of company

data of any relationship between the domestic size of a parent company and

the propensity to invest abroad. Thus the frequently mentioned

concentration of manufacturing abroad in a small number of companies

appears to be nothing but a reflection of the concentration among
                                        — 50 —


manufacturing   firms   in   the United States.

     Our conclusion about the influence of size of firm   is   to support the

belief that it is important, but only as a threshold effect. It affects

the decision to invest abroad or to invest in a particular area but not,

once manufacturing has been established, the fraction of the firm's

resources that are devoted to foreign operations. The influence of size,

we conclude, reflects economies of scale, not in production, but in foreign

investing, and such economies of scale account for the higher frequency of

foreign investment among larger firms. However, these economies of scale

seem to result from indivisibilities that have little or no influence once

a firm has surmounted the initial barrier to becoming a foreign investor.

     We could find only a few, and rather weak relationships between the

characteristics of parent firms and the locations of their foreign

operations, as measured by the likelihood that they would invest in

particular locations. Investors in low—income countries were not

predominantly U.S. companies that paid low wages or were labor intensive

in their U.S. operations. Relatively R&D—intensive or skill—intensive U.S

companies or those from relatively R&D—intensive or skill—intensive

industries were not more likely to invest in developed countries. In fact

the average firm investing in developing countries was slightly more R&D

intensive than the average investor in developed countries. Investors in

developing Asian countries in particular were relatively R&D intensive for

their industries. Thus the characteristics of parent firms that led to

foreign investment also led to investment in the developing countries, with

perhaps a greater emphasis on size and technological intensity.

    Other parent—firm characteristics we investigated were income from

technology sales and the importance of sales by uncontrolled foreign
                                    — 51 —


licenses   relative to the parents' sales. Two types of relationship were

noticed: in the electrical machinery industry, investors in developing

countries spent more on R&D relative to their sales than investors in

developed countries but reported smaller sales by uncontrolled firms under

license, and in the machinery industries R&D—intensive companies tended to

license less. In other words, these companies apparently tended to exploit

their technological capital in foreign markets by production rather than by

licensing. On the other hand, in metals and in "other manufacturing

industries" there was a positive relation between R&D intensity and

licensing.

                                Foot notes

     1
      Since size is such a major difference between the investors and the
noninvestors, one might suppose that it alone might account for some of the
differences in other characteristics between the two groups, if those
characteristics, such as profitability, are related to size. In fact, size
does not seem to be a strong influence on most of the other variables in
equations across all firms. Where it was, we tested the effect of size on
the differences between investors and noninvestors. For example, we substi-
tuted, for the profitability measure (Pr), defined as Net Income/Sales, the
residuals from an equation relating profitability to size, such as

         Pr = a + b (Sales)
         Pr = a + b (log Sales)
         log Pr = a + b (log Sales)

and then compared investors and noninvestors with respect to PR — PR, the
latter being the "expected" profitability from one of the equations. The
conclusions were not altered by that calculation; the other variables'
influence was not simply a reflection of their relation to size. However,
taking account of size did reduce the margin substantially, from the 1.7
percentage points shown in the table to only .6 percentage points, using an
arithmetic equation, or from over 35 per cent to less than 10 per cent using
a log equation.

    2
      "...direct investment entails higher (relatively fixed) costs of
search and investigation than do exporting or licensing, and thus is more
likely the game of the firm big enough to amortize these search costs over a
large direct investment outlay' (Caves, 1974).

    3
      The same R&D variable has a fairly weak effect on the propensity of
Swedish firms to produce abroad (Swedenborg, 1979). That fact suggests that
the role of R&D input may be a characteristic of U.S. multinationals rather
than of multinationals in general. However, the variables that affect the
propensity to invest (the ratio of foreign to home—country investment) are
not necessarily the same as those that affect the probability of investing
(the proportion of firms in a group that do any foreign investing at all) as
we shall see below, and there are also other differences between the Swedish
and U.S. analyses. We therefore cannot make a strong statement on this
question.

    4
      Although we are dealing with characteristics associated with any
investment abroad rather than with the proportion of production carried Out
abroad (propensity to invest) it is of some interest to compare these
                                  — 53 —



characteristics with those that determined the propensity to invest of
Swedish parent firms (Swedenborg, 1979). Aside from size, discussed later,
the labor skill level was positively related and physical—capital intensity
negatively related to the Swedish foreign investment propensities. Those
facts suggest that multinational firms from different countries may not
carry the same set of advantages.

     5
      Table 2 probably exaggerates the difference associated with industry
composition because, in the enterprise data, investors are much more fully
covered than noninvestors and dominate our industry averages. However, an
industry size measure from establishment data (not shown here), not subject
to this problem, gives the same results: investors are from industries in
which the median size of establishment is larger.

     6
      This difference is undoubtedly underestimated here because the nonin—
vestors missing from our data must consist mainly of small firms.

     7
      That strange result is not a peculiarity of this pair of countries.
In another paper (Kravis and Lipsey, 1982) we found, across a broader set of
countries, that high—wage, presumably high—skill companies showed some ten-
dency to locate not in high—wage host countries, for example, but in low—
wage countries, and low—wage parents located in high—wage countries. The
most capital—intensive parents located in low—wage countries and the least
capital intensive in high—wage countries.

     8
      44 per cent of U.S. manufacturing investment in Sweden, measured by the
U.S. direct investment position, was in norielectrical machinery, the highest
share for any host country, although Japan was close (U.S. Department of
Commerce, 1981, Table I.W3). U.S. machinery industry parents were, on the
average, 25 per cent smaller, as measured by total assets, than U.S. manu-
facturing parents in general (ibid, Table C).

     9
      In these regressions, differences among host countries in compensation
per worker are presumed to reflect differences in costs of equivalent labor
to a substantial degree, although we know that differences in labor quality
are also included. That interpretation contrasts with the one we apply to
average wage differences among industries or companies within the United
States, which we consider as measuring differences in labor quality.   The
underlying assumption is that labor is fairly mobile among companies and
industries within the United States but not among countries. To test the
consequences of treating inter—country differences in average wages as
measures of the price of labor we ran the regressions substituting for
average wage in 1977 the same wage corrected for differences in labor
quality measured for an earlier period (see Kravis and Lipsey, 1982, for a
discussion of the correction). The results were essentially the same.
