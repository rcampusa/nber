tell in some countries but nut in others and contrast union responses to the
challenge of the period. I find that:
     — Rates of unionisation diverged greatly among developed countries
     — The composition of union members shifted from private sector blue collar
workers to puhlic sector end white collar workers in all countries, producing in-
creased divisions within union movements by category of worker
       —  Changes in the industrial      composition of employment,   changes in public

do not explain the divergence       in density

          Differing rates of inflation contributed to the divergence, with unions

1.     INTRODUCTION

        In this paper I explore the evolution of unionism in lNlOs and l98Os when

rite   post-oil   shock world economy created a "crisis of unionism          throughout the

western world.         I try to explain why union representation of work forces fell


in some countries but not in others and contrast union responses to the

challenge of the period.            I   find that:

        I) Rates of unionisation diverged greatly among developed countries

(Section 2.1)

        2)   The composition of union members shifted from private sector blue collar

workers to public sector and white collar workers in all countries, producing

increased divisions within union movements by category of worker. (Section 2.2)

        3) Changes in the industrial composition of employment, changes in public

attitudes toward unionism, and the growth of governmental protection of labor

do not explain the divergence in density (Section 3.1)

        4) Differing rarem of inflation contributed to the divergence, with unions

doing better in countries with high inflation.                In addition, unemployment

 raised density in settings where unions disperse unemployment benefits.

 (Section 3.2;      section 3.5)

        5)       The primary reason for the divergence are differences in the

 incentives and opportunities different industrial relations systems give

 employers to oppose unions.               Unions fated best in neo-corporatist settings and

 worst in settings where decentralised bargaining creates a strong profit

 incentive for managers to oppose unions and where msnageeent is relatively free

 to act on that incentive. (Section 3.3; Section 3.5)

                                                                             in some
         6) Union organizations and modes of operating changed significantly

 countries with declining or endangered unionism but not in others.(Section 3.4)
       Most strikingly, my analysis indicates that ii l980s trends continue the

west will he divided between countries with strong trade union movements

operating in a neo-corpotatiat system, as in Scandinavia, and countries with

'ghetto unionism' limited to special segments of the work force, as in the U.S.



2   CHANCES IN UNIONISM ANONO DEVEIDFED COUNTRIES

       In   contrast   to business firms, which behave similarly in all capitalist

countries, maximizing profits or somethtng close akin, trade unions have a

"national" dimension, operating under distinct institutional arrangements

across countries.         In the United States unions negotiate detailed collective

bargaining contracts with fires; in Sweden they are involved in national wage-

setting and nee-corporatist social agreements; in Australia they argue wage

cases before arbitration tribunals; in France they negotiate industry or

regional minima that are extended to entire sectors; in Japan they represent

workers at the company level and organize tha Shunre offensive; etc.               Separated

by national barriers, union movements are like distinct species of animals,

developing differently in some dimensions even in similar economic and

technological      environments.      In the   1970s and 1980s the union representation    of
workers underwent particularly dramatic changes across developed countries,
rising in      some    countries to   reach virtually complete organiaarion of the work

 force, while falling sharply in other countries.           At the same time the

 composition   of      unionised labour underwent similar changes across    countries, as

 the   white collar and public        sector worker share of union members rose while the

 manual     and private sector manufacturing workers share of members       fell.
 2.1   Divergence in Union Density

       The first and seemingly simplest fact to establish is the claimed

 divergence in union density among countries.            Because counts of union

 membership      include large numbers of the unemployed      or of peosioners   in some
countries but not in others; come from diverse sources - -   labor   force surveys,

reports by unions, employer surveys, union financial records (see Eurostat for

a detailed comparison of union data by country); and reflect differences in

what unions do in different settings, however, the seemingly simple is fraught

with problems.    As examples of the difficulties in cross-country comparisons

note the following: in Australia unions represent virtually all workers before

the tribunals that formally set wages but enlist only half of the work force;

in France and Germany unions have a larger role in wage-setting than density

figures indicate because agreements between representative employers and unions

are legally extended to other employers; in Italy the growth of autonomous

union groups in the public sector and of quadri among foremen and lower level

management makes membership data from the major confederations an incomplete

indicator of union organisation (Minestero del L.avoro e della Previdenza

Sociale, 1988).    These and other data/conceptual problems mean that even the

most careful estimates of density provide only crude indicators of cross-

country differences in union strength and must be informed by direct knowledge

of institutions so as not to be misleading.

    This said, exhibit 1 records estimates of the union proportion of non-

agricultural wage and salary workers in OECD countries from 1970 to the mid-

1980s.   While comparisons of changes in density over time are less likely to be

distorted by cross-country differences than are comparisons of levels, even the

trends are not problem free.    The United Kingdom figures understate the l980s

decline in British density as some unions exaggerated membership to maintain

high representation in the Trade Union Congress and Labor Party.       The American

data mix two opposing trends: a disastrous drop in private sector density and a

spurt in public sector unionism.    The Italian data may overstate the 1980s drop

due to absence of membership outside the three confederations.

   Measurement issues notwithstanding, exhibit 1 shows a divergence

 suggests that relatively modest differences

membership and  collective bargaining representation (Freeman and Ichniowski,
1988)   with dramatic effects on the public sector share of unionists due to the
decline in    private sector membership.   In countries like Denmark and Sweden,

where blue collar private sector organisation rates were high at the outset of

the period, growth wam necessarily concentrated aeong public aector and white

collar workers.     In Canada, public sector membership expanded rapidly, partly

as a result of favorable public aector labor laws, while private sector density

drifted downward.     One reason for the incraased attractivenaaa of unions to

public aector and white collar workers wam a perception that they needed unions

to   maintain real wages during the l9lOa rapid inflation.      Once established,

moreover, public sector membership tends to be more stable than private sector

membership due to the stability of public employment.

      The shift to white collar and public sector membership has begun to change

the face of union movements traditionally dominated by industrial workers.          In

the U.S.    the locus of power in the AFL-CIO   ia   shifting to public sector

organizations while the non-affiliated National gducarion Association has

achieved considerable national influence.       In Italy the new autonomous public

aector organizations and quadri pose a challenge to the three traditional

confederations,     In Sweden and Denmark the white collar unions have shown an

increasing willingneaa to develop their own economic agenda rather than to

follow the lead of blue collar manufacturing unions.



 3   REASONS FOR THE DIVERGENCE

        Several hypotheses can be advanced for explaining the divergence in

 density: changes in the composition of employment, in attitudes toward

 unionism, and in governmental protection of labor which reduce worker desires

 to organise; macro-economic developments; management opposition to unionism;

 and differential responses of union movements to the problems of the period.
3.1 Structural Explanations

   One oftan suggested explanation for changing unionismtion ara differonrial

changas in rho composition of employment among jobs or workors, which in tho

1970s and 1980s took tha form of   a   shift toward traditionally loss unionizod

araas.    In countrias where employment shifted rapidly froa manual to white

collar jobs, from goods to service industries, from small to large firms, and

from female to male or from less educated to more educated workers, unions are,

after all, likely to have greater difficulties organizing than in countries

where those shifts occur more slowly.

    The ahift hypothesis does nor, however, stand up to scrutiny.      Shifts in

the composition of employment cannot explain divergent country experiences

because shifts have occurred similarly across countries: the share of

employment in manufacturing fell, for example, by roughly as much in high and
                                                                            or
 increasing density Sweden, Canada, or Denmark as in the de-unionising U.S.

Japan. (2)    Contrary to the shift hypothesis, moreover, large changes in union

 representation are accompanied by changes in density within sectors, as exhibit

 3 demonstrates for countries with declining unionism.
    A    second possible explanation for diverging union density is that public

 opinion of unions has come to differ greatly among countries.      Perhaps density

 is declining in countries where the public has less favorable attitudes and

 increasing/stabilizing in those where the public has more favorable attitudes.

 Lipset (1986), for one, has argued that reduced public approval is a major

 cause of the decline in American union density.

     I reject this hypothesis as inconsistent with within-country and cross-

 country and evidence.    Pirar, there is little relation within countries between

                                                     Polls for the U.K. show that

between 1972 and 1965 when density fell sharply in the

in the public sector, where public opinion ought to be especially important.(3)

                                                           data show no
Moreover, for what it is worth, cross-country opinion poll

substantial differences in approval of unions between countries with decreasing

                                              show about a 33 percent
density and those with stable density: "polls

                                            higher   than in Britain (26 percent> and
(confidence) in the Unitad States       .



                                                                   36 percent)"
Italy (32 percent) and scarcely worse then German and France (both
                                                                of opinion polls
 (Hacksher, 1988, 258).    Perhaps most strikingly, comparisons

between the United States and Canada show that Canadians have, if anything,

 less favorable attitudes toward unions than Americans (Chaison and Rose, 1988>,

which runs counter to the decline in density in the United States and stable

 density in Canada.
    A   third possibility is that the divergence results from differential

 changes in worker need for unionism among countries.         Perhaps goverruuental

                                                                            a
 protection of labor increased more in some countries than others, offering

 substitute for unionism      (Neuman and Rissisan   (1986) argue   that    this explains

 the decline   of unions in   the United States).     Perhaps wages and personnel

                                                                    a substitute
 practices improved more in some countries than in others, offering

 for unionism.

     There is compelling evidence against this hypothesis.           First, unionism has

 remained strong in Scandinavia and other European countries with highly
                                                                           and
 regulated markets while losing strength in the United States under Reagan

 in the United Kingdom under Thatcher --       the   opposite of what one would expect

  if governmental regulations substitute for union protection at work places.

 Within-country evidence is also inconsistent with the government substitution

 hypothesis: in the United States unions have done no worse in states with the

  greatest legal protection
                            of labor than in those with the least (Freeman. 1987;

  Block, Mahoney, and Corbitt, 1987).       At a conceptual level the argument        that

unionism and governaent regulation are substitutes is flawed because it fails

tu recognize that "enacting a law and securing rhe realization of the purpose

the law is aimed to secure are two vastly different matters" (Compers, 1965,               p.


54).    To bonef it from legal regulation workers need   a   union or union-like

sgency to monitor compliance at the shop hoot.       As for the substitution of

good employment prectices for unionise, while high wages and positive

industrial relations can deter uoioniaetion, the large firas that pay above-

market wages and have progressive human resources policies        -   -   of which   IBM is

               -
the exsmplar       -employ similar moderate and declining proportions of work forces
in industrial economies (OECD, 1986).      Changes in union density are, moreover,

oncorrelated with levels or changes in real wages across countries, contrary to

what one would expect if high or improving pay reduced the desire for unions

(4).

       If none of the above explains the divergence in density, what does?



3.2 MACRo-ECONOMIC FACTORS

       One likely factor is the differing macro-economic experiences of countries,

On the basis of studies of the cyclical pattern of union growth, high

unemployment, low inflation, and slow economic growth ought to reduce unionism

while the opposite conditions should increase density. (5)

       To explore this hypothesis I contrast in exhibit 4 the growth of employment

 and GOP per capita, the rate of inflation, and the rate of unemployment between

 countries with increasing, decreasing, and roughly stable union density.               The

 results are, with the exception of inflation, rather mixed.              Rapid inflation is

 associated with union growth, presumably because nonunion workers see a need

 for contractual arrangements to preserve real earnings.        Employment growth is

 higher in declining union density countries while growth of COP per capita and

 most strikingly, unemployment rates do not differ noticeably.             As will be shown

workers who lose jobs to maintain or join unions in periods of increasing

unemployment.



3.3 MANACEMKNT OPPOSITION TO UNIONISM

      The factor that, I believe, explains best the divergence in union

experiences are differential changes in the difficulty of organising new

workers due to changes in the level and effectiveness of management opposition

to unionism.    Here, the rapidly de-uniontaing United States is the prima facie

case of what aggressive management can do to unionism.           In the 1910s and 1980s

U.S. management turned against unions and collective bargaining to a degree not

seen anywhere else in the free world.           Virtually all firms that faced National

Labor Relations Board representation elections (the government-run secret

ballot process by which American workers can choose to unionise) engaged in

expensive aggressive campaigns to persuade/pressure workers to reject unions.

Unfair labor practices of diverse forms (including firing upwards of a thousand

 union activists in a year) skyrocketed to rates five or six times those in

 aarller decades.    Large nonunion firms consciously copied union seniority and

 grievance procedures to deter employee interest in unions.          Forty-five percent

 of the relatively progressive firms in the Conference Board's Personnel Forum

 declared in 1983   that   operating 'union-free' was their main labor goal (Kochan,

 McKersie, and Chalykoff, 1986)     -   -   a far cry from the 1950s and 1960s when most

 large firms accepted unions at the work place.           Even when workers voted to
                                          14


                                                                     of ihe
unioniae, moreover, management avoided a first contract in one-third

cases, effectively negating the election.      On the basis of diverse studies that

show management opposition to have been a major factor in the failure of unions

to organism in the period (Freeman, 1985), moat analysts have come to believe

that it is a, if not the, major cause of the decline in private aeccor density.
                                                                  is that
    Why did American management declare war on unions? One reason
unionism became more costly to firma.     It became more costly because the union

                                               end because growth of trade,
wage premium rose In the 1970a (Freeman, 1986)
                                                                             it
deregulation, and other factors increased product market competition, making

more difficult to pay above-market wages.      A second reason   is   the growth of a

militant market-oriented ideology that juatified virtually any anti-union

action as preserving managerial flexibility.       A third reason is the

development of   a   sophisticated union-prevention technology that exploits the
                                                                                   In
 opportunities U.S. labor laws give management to campaign against unions.

 Canada, where labor law limits management's ability to fight unions, often by
                                                                     all out to
 certifying unions after card checks, many of the same firms that go

 defeat unions in the U.S. accept unionisation of their Canadian plants.

     Is management opposition important in other countries with rapidly

 declining density?

     In the United Kingdom, the principal cause of the l980s drop in density
                                                                    which
 appears to be the Thatcher government's industrial relations laws,

 shifted the balance of power at workplaces to management and weakened the

                                                                      While management

 opposition to unionism ham not taken the form or virulence

 the new features of the law have enhanced resistance to union activities.

      In Japan, government and management opposition have played a major role in

  the drastic loss of membership of Kokuro, the militant union of now privatized
                                       15


Japanese National Railway.   Once the latgest taitway union with over 500,000

meobers, in 1988 it had only 62,000 members due to management's union busting

tactics. (Nagashima, 1988)   Similarly, the Japanese Teachers Union has suffered

major losses of membership due in part to government efforts to discourage

newly-hired teachers from joining the union.   More importantly, data on the

number of workers newly organised shows a pattern remarkably like that in the

United States, with the bulk of the drop in unionism attributable to a

precipitous fall in union organisation of new workers relative to the growing

work force. The drop in new organisation occurred after the oil shock placed

severe economic pressures on Japanese employers, was accompanied by changes in

court interpretation of lehour law favorable to managssent,   and was concentrated

in industries facing the greatest profits squeeze (Freeman and Rebbick, 1989)

Civen the close ties between companies and unions in an enterprise union

 system, and the role of white collar employees in company unions, I find it

hard to believe that changes in company attitudes toward unionism has not

 played a role in the inability of unions to organism new workplaces.

    In Italy and the Netherlands, management opposition of the American or

 milder British type would appear to have little to do with the observed

 changes.   The l980s decline in density in Italy has bean attributed to the

 disorganisation of the union movement that developed after 1983.    The 1980s

 decline in density in the Netherlands may be largely the result of the high

 unemployment that devaloped in the mid-1910s and persisted for over a decade.

     What about management behavior in countries where union density reached

 unprecedented peaks in the period under study?   If differences in management

 opposition contributed to the divergence, one would expect less opposition in

 those countries, either because firms have little profit incentive to avoid

 unionism or little legal or institutional opportunity to express opposition.
                                            16



   The prime factor that appears to reduce the profit incentive to fight

unions is centralized wage negotiations.         In countries where unions and

management engage in national bargaining --       so-called   neo-corporatist systecs - -

managementa form employers'   federations    to establish going national wages and

often presaure nonunion firms to recognize unions, presumably to assure that

they pay the going rate. The notion that business should engage in a jihad for

union-free environment as in the United States is anathema to employers in such

a setting. Unionism has accordingly fared well, with density increasing in the

1970s and l9BOs aven though density was already high at the outset of both

periods (exhibit 5).

    Countries where the state extends collective contracts to nonunion firms

such as Germany and France and where workers are represented by works councils

(much of Western Europe) might also appear to give employers little reason to

oppose unions at the plant level.      Here, however, the likelihood that plant-

level agreements will go beyond representative contracts suggests that

employers will be more opposed to unions than in neo-corporstist settings.           In

fact, unionisation trends in Germany and in France (as best one csn tell from

available data) are intermediate between those of the U.S., U.K. in the

Thatcher era, and Japan end the neo-corpormtist countries.

     Finally, the growth/stability of unionism in Canada and in Ireland shows

that even in industrial relations systems where management has a substantial

profit incentive to oppose unions legsl restrictions on opposition can produce

 developments that differ from those in neighboring countries (U.S.         end U.K.)

where the laws are less favorable to organisation.

3.4 UNION RESPONSE

   Another likely cause for diverging union densities are cross-country

differences in union responses to economic changes.     Sidestepping wege setting

(most uoion movements moderated wage demands relative to inflation for the sake

of job security or to reduce unemployment) and strike hehavior (strike daya

lost fell in the l980a in all countries) there was a wide rango of union

organizational responses to the crisis of the l970s/80s.

    The Australian union movement made pethsps the most dramatic adjustment to

the new economic environment.   After careful study of the German and Swedish

experiences, the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) sought to ttansfotm

Australian industrial relations from a confronrational British-style system to

a neo-corporatiat system, in part to preempt growing anti-union management
sentiment that might fuel ILS. or U.K. type losses of membership.        In the mid

1980s the Secretary-Treasurer of the ACTU was doing him beat to convince

constituent unions to accept a national wages accord that required aome unions

to take lnwër wage settlements than they could otherwise get.

    The American labor movement reacted more sluggishly.     In the 1970s many top
AFL-CIO leaders downplayed felling density on the grounds that absolute

membership was stable end that an economic boom would cute all.      In 1978 the

Federation tried but failed to get   a modest   labor law reform bill.    It was nmt

until 1985 that top leadership aounded alarm bells with      "The Changing

 Situation of Workers and their Unions" report.     Since then national unimns have

been slew to adopt the "evolutionary blueprint" laid out in the report.        While

many now offer union Mastercards with attractively low rates of interest for

 their members (McDonald, 1987) few have actively pursued the key recoronendation

 to create new forms of membership outside the collective bargaining structure.

 A major reason for the slow adaption is the decentralized structure of
                                         19



organized labor, which consists of some 90 or so independent national unions in

the AFL-CIO; others outside the federation; and hundreds of independent locals

within the national unions.   Each national and local has its own concerns,

guaranteeing slow response to prohlems chat affect unionism in general and

making problematic implementation of reforms recoumsended    by the AFL-CIO.

    In the United Kingdom there has been a similar effort to devise new

benefits (of the U.S. mastercard type)   to attract workers.    There hmva also,

however, been more dramatic changes in industrial relations practices in some

sectors: the Miners Union split; the Electricians and Engineering unions have

developed cooperative single plant/singla union bargaining strategies; tha

Boilermakers, among othars, have sought to enlist pert-time workers.      The big

organizational change is, however, be the splitting of the Trade Union Congress

when it revoked membership of the Electricians in Sapteebar 1988,
     In some other countries where unions have been in trouble, there have been

structural changes in union organizations.    In Japan, two federations, Dcmei

 and Churitsu Roren, have dissolved and their private sector unions have formed

 the new federation Rengo to break free from the more politicized public sector

 unions.   Sohyo plans to dissolve itself in 1990.   Tn Italy, the three majpr

 confederations, which united briefly in the early l980a, separated to engage in

 competitive recruiting efforts, each with its own style and selling points.

 3,5 regression analysis

     To estimate the quantitative impact of some of the aformentioned factors on

                                                                      its
 cross-country changes in union density. I pooled data on density and

 determinants across 18 developed OECD countries for the period 1913-1985 and

 estimated a regression model linking changes (d) in density (DENS) to: a dummy

 variable for corporatist industrial relations (CORE);      the rate of inflation

 (INF); changes in the uneoployment rate (ONE); a dummy variable for union

 delivery of unemployment benefits interacted with changes in the unemployment
                                         20


rate (Ul*dUNE); and selected other variables (Z).       Because density is bounded

betweeo 0 and I I use a log odds ratio form as well as a linear form:

     dDENS or dln(DENS/l-DENS) — a + bINF + cdUNE + Ul*dUNE+ eCORP +       fZ + u,

where Z   — setof   variables that includes growth of employment and growth of COP

per capita and a vecror of dummy variables for individual years.       Controlling

for individual years removes common cyclical variation from the data to locus

on the cross-country differences of concern.

     The regression estimates summarized in exhibit 6 show that, consistent with

the simpler tabulations given earlier, density grew more in countries with

corporetist industrial relations; with rising unemployment when unions deliver

unemployment benefits; and with rapid inflation.
4   CONCLUDING COMMENTS

     This study baa shown that, contrary to the view that industrial relations

converges as countries develop (Kerr, Dunlop, I4arbison,      end Meyers). union

density diverged among developed countries in the 1970m and l9BOs.        As all of

 the countries are advanced capitalist economies undergoing similat economic

 changes, the divergence implies that relatively modest differences in the

 institutions thef govern labor relations extort e substantial influence on the

 evolution of unionism.    The decline in union density in the United States and

 Japan, where unions were thought to be parr of the established order, furthur

 implies that private sector unionism is a more fragile institution than is

 widely recognized.    The broad implication   is   that in a world of economic and

 social flux the structuring of labor relations is not a once-and-for-all

 process of setting up procedures and insrirurions. Rather, it is a process

 that must be undertaken time and again as environinentml      changes alter the

 balance of power barween workers and management and their conflicting and

 coincident interests. Therm is no rear in rho practice or study of industrial

 relations.

    --       I calculated the coefficient of variation for 1985/86 using 1919 densities
for Belgium, France,           and New Zealand.     The average deosity for the top six

countries was 65% in 1910 and 79% in 1985/86 while the average density for the

bottom six countries was 31% in 1910 and 30% in 1985/86.               1   calculated the

United Stares and Japanese shares of wage and salary employees using the data

from the Center for Labour Economics, OECD Data set, updated, and with union

figures based as ouch as possible on the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data.

The calculation is crude, using figures for the year closest to 1985 for

countries wirh missing data.

2 -      -   OECD   data show that the shift of employment out of manufacturing, was

actually larger in OECD Eureps than in the de-unionising United States.                 See

OECD Nistorical Statistics (Paris 1986).

3    --      The rise   in favorable   ratings   of unions in the UK is documented in

Financial Tine's, November 18,1987.               Data on approval of unions in the United

States are given by Lipaet (1988).                Because the U.S. figures are from two

separate surveys they are not atrictly comparable.

4    --       This claim is based en correlating changes in real wages and in density

using the LSE-OECD data set.

 S   -- The literature here is enormous.             The most influential modern econometric

 paper is by Aahenfelter and Pencavel (1969).
