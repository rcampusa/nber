                     Macroeconomic Policy Under
                     Currency Inconvertibility

                               ABSTRACT




    This paper analyzes the macroeconomics of currency inconvertibility,

building on the role of relative prices in a portfolio balance model.

The relationship between black markets for foreign exchange and smuggling

is first analyzed from the perspective of an individual importer.

According to the portfolio view, the black market rate behaves like the

financial rate in a dual market. The premium of the black marlet rate

over the official rate is thus related to the probability of success in

smuggling and the tariff.

     Then the black market is analyzed using a simple three-good,

two-asset general equilibrium model. Under the   assumption of    regressive

exchange rate expectations, the portfolio view is contrasted with a

monetary approach to the black market. The short-run and long-run

effects of monetary and exchange rate policies on relative prices are

assessed. Different assumptions about expected returns are contrasted,

but emphasis is placed on the perfect foresight case. Unless expecta-

tions are static, official exchange rate policy has to adjust to the

private valuation of foreign exchange, as stressed in the conclusion.

Introduction



     Restricting the ability to convert the domestic currency into

foreign exchange may involve restrictions on international trade or

capital movements: currency inconvertibility is to be understood relative

to particular items in the balance of recorded international

transactions.1 While inconvertibility promotes smuggling and black

markets for foreign exchange, these may exist even when a currency is

legally "convertible". In effect, the definition in the Articles of

Agreement of the International Monetary Fund only requires the absence of

restrictions on current account transactions.

     Some basic features of the black market for foreign exchange can be

derived in partial equilibrium models. The relationship between recorded

trade, smuggling and the demand for and supply of black market foreign

exchange is evident in the choice between importing at the official

exchange rate plus the tariff or at the black market rate.      Under incon-

vertibility, therefore, domestic and foreign assets are not perfect

 substitutes. Applying the conventional monetary approach - where assets

 (and goods) are assumed to be perfect substitutes -   to   the inconvertible

 exchange rate would be misleading. On the contrary, the portfolio

 approach assumes a stock demand for the foreign, as well as for the

 domestic, currency and does not require perfect goods arbitrage.      It can

 thus explain the observed diversification of currency portfolios and

 provide a useful framework in which to analyze macro—economic policy

 under inconvertibility.

     The paper is divided into two parts. Part I contains a partial

equilibrium model of the black market for foreign exchange which brings

together the smuggling literature and the portfolio view. Different

mechanisms of expectations formation are contrasted, but emphasis is

placed on the perfect foresight case. It is shown under what condition

the premium of the black market rate over the official rate is likely to

be positively related to the probability of success in smuggling, along

the lines of the classic "Beccaria formula".

     In Part II, the black market for foreign exchange is analyzed using

a simple three-good, two-asset general equilibrium model in the spirit of

Kouri (1975). Under the assumption of "stabilizing", or regressive,

expectations about returns to domestic and foreign currencies, the

portfolio view is contrasted in section 2 with the monetary model of

Blejer (1978a). Then, assuming static expectations, the black market

premium (which is also the relative price of traded goods) and the

relative price of non—traded goods are endogenously determined in tempo-

rary equilibrium (section 3), while the asset mix is determined in

steady- state equilibrium (section 4). The effects of monetary and

exchange rate policies on relative prices and asset stocks are analyzed

in this set-up. The implications of perfect foresight are explored in

Section 5. The conclusion summarizes the results.

I.   Partial equilibrium

1.   The Beccaria formula



     The formal analysis on black markets can be traced back to the mid-

eighteenth century, when - as Hume was writing on the specie-flow mecha-

nism -   Beccaria (1764-65) developed a break-even condition for smuggling
                                       -3-




activity, involving the probability of. success and the tariff rate on

imports:



(1)         ztl

where       z is the probability of success in smuggling



and         t is one plus the tariff rate



        A higher degree of enforcement of tariff regulations -   to   the extent

that is implies a lower z -    is   associated with negative profits from

smuggling unless a higher rate raises the domestic price and thus re-

stores profitability. The objective of the analysis was precisely

directing the attention of policy-makers to the trade-off between the

revenue from higher tariffs and the associated higher enforcement costs.3

        After some centuries of neglect, the literature picked up about ten

years ago. Bhagwati and Hansen (1973) - who refer to Beccaria's work -

showed that tariffs do induce smuggling but, together with Sheikh (1974),

they claimed that a black market for foreign exchange would not be

induced by trade restrictions alone. Sheikh (1976) adapted the tradi-

tional analysis of black markets by Michaely (1954) and others to the

foreign exchange market.4

        By introducing real costs to smuggling in the form of a "smuggling

function", Pitt (1981) and (1982) showed that legal and illegal trade in

goods and money coexist even in the absence of exchange restrictions. If

some legal trade is necessary in order to engage in smuggling, the

domestic price may be less than the cost of legal imports, a phenomenon
                                   -4-




which he calls "price disparity". Along the same lines, Martin and

Panagaryia (1983) propose a crime-theoretic approach to smuggling, which

provides microeconomic foundations to Pitt's smuggling function but they

neglect the black market for foreign exchange.

Noting that this revival of interest in the supervision aspect would have

pleased Beccaria, a criminologist by training, we will show how the

Pitt-Martin-Panagaryia (PMP) analysis is consistent with his formula,

modified to allow for a black market for foreign exchange. In fact, the

black market premium is a measure of the cost of smuggling. We begin by

describing how this premium is determined in a portfolio model.



2.   A portfolio model



     Consider a small country whose residents are not authorized to hold

foreign assets, but who nevertheless allocate their financial wealth

between domestic and foreign currency.5 The terms of trade between legal

 ("official") and illegal ("smuggled") imports and exports are given in

the world market. Alternatively, as is done below, the same good is

traded through both channels and there is a non-traded good.

     If foreigners do not hold the inconvertible domestic currency in

 their portfolios, the domestic currency price of foreign currency in the

 black market will be such that the existing stock is willingly held.

 Furthermore, the only way for domestic residents to acquire foreign

 currency is through the underinvoicing of exports and the overinvoicing

 of imports. In the absence of endogenous reported capital flows and

 errors and omissions, as well as interest payments on unrecorded capital

 flows, excess supply of the two traded goods equals the change in the
                                         -5-




stock of foreign currency of the private sector and the central bank

respectively.

      The black market rate is determined so that the private stock of

black market foreign exchange is willingly held, and demand a is propor-

tional to wealth for simplicity. Demand increases with expected depreci-

ation of the black market rate or with a higher probability of success in

smuggling:



(2)          eF = a(&Ii, z)W     c =
                                       a4i/a
                                 y=az/a


where        e is the black market exchange rate

             F is the stock of black market foreign exchange (in foreign

                 currency)

             W is private financial wealth (in domestic currency)

and          4   is   the expected rate of change of the black market rate.



        The measure of relative real return is the expected change in the

black market rate because domestic residents are assumed to be identical

in their consumption preferences.6

        Given an official exchange •rate, ,    the   requirement of portfolio

balance can be written in terms of the black market premium and of

financial wealth valued at the official rate:



(3)          pFa
where        p =   e/     is the black market premium
                                        -6—



and         =   W/      is financial wealth valued at the official exchange

                        rate.




      The change in F is given by smuggling and other unreported current

account transactions. The unreported surplus, B, is zero for a particu-

lar value of the premium, taken to be one, and, if the elasticities

condition holds, improves with an increase in the premium. Denoting

rates of change by dots:



(4)       F = B(p)      B(1) = 0   Bt > 0



      Assuming that the opposite holds for the reported trade surplus, IL

we show temporary equilibrium in Figure 1, a variant of the Kouri (1983)

diagram. The right panel shows the instantaneous determination of the

black market exchange rate, given demand for foreign currency and no

expected change in relative returns, along a rectangular hyperbola PP.

Under perfect foresight, demand for foreign currency will increase when

the black market rate depreciates, constraining its initial value for a

given stock of foreign currency F0 to e, on the saddle path S (below

the corresponding initial value under static expectations, e0). For a

given official exchange rate,         (< e0 so that p0 >   1),   the left panel of

Figure 1 plots the unreported trade surplus in foreign currency, B (which

equals the increase in F) and the exogenous reported trade deficit, -.

Assuming a stronger effect of the black market rate on B, the relative
slopes will be as drawn. For simplicity, assume that the unreported

trade balance equilibrium associated with the given official exchange

rate is at e* <
                  e0.

     If the associated reported deficit    is corrected by devaluation

of the official exchange rate to its long-run equilibrium level, ,    the

two schedules will shift up and intersect on the vertical axis at a point

where, by choice of units, e1 =    so that p1 = 1.   The implications of

the official devaluation differ depending on the expectations formation

mechanism. If expectations are static, the black market exchange rate

will gradually depreciate from e0 to e1 as the stock of foreign assets

decreases from F0 to F1. Under perfect foresight, the black market rate

jumps from    to e and then gradually depreciates to the same long-run

value. If the official devaluation generates an increase in the demand

for foreign assets from PP to P2P2, furthermore, the black market rate

will overshoot to e2 (e under perfect foresight) and gradually

appreciate back to e1 as the stock of foreign assets increases to F.

The same would be true of an exogenous increase in z: in the short-run

the premium would rise, in the long-run F would rise.

     The analysis remains applicable under a crawling peg regime, where

the rate of depreciation equals the reported trade deficit as a propor-

tion of central bank reserves. It does, however, assume that these are

large enough, so as to be able to neglect the "collapse problem" of

Krugman (1979).



3.   Special risks



     Consider the profit p in domestic currency of a price-taking import-

 er. It varies depending on whether smuggling is successful       or not

          Setting the foreign currency price at unity, we get profits as a
                                           -8—



linear function of the amounts imported through legal and illegal

channels:




            z=P(L+S)- tL-eS

(6)
            p1_PL_tL-eS

where       P is the domestic price

            L is the amount legally imported

            S is the amount smuggled



        Under perfect competition, profits will be zero at the optimum,

which is independent of demand conditions. If the probability of success

is exogenous to the firm, expected profits will also be linear in the

decision variables, S and L, since they are a z—weighted average of (5)

and (6):



(7)          p = z pz + (1    —
                                  z) p12


        The basic idea behind the so-called "crimetheoretic" approach is,

however, to make the special risks, measured by the probability of

success, depend on the decision variables of the firm. Assume it is a

decreasing function of the ratio of smuggled to legal imports.




 (8)         z =   z(s)   ;
                              =   -sz'/z

                  S
where s=

Using (3) and (8) in (7), first-order conditions for profit maximization

can be solved for the optimal combination of price and import pattern,

given the tariff and the premium:



(9)         (1 + zCs) =       t + ysp          LL locus



            z(1 - C) = p(1      -              SS   locus
(10)




where         =   P/

        To preserve the zero-profit condition for legal imports in (9), an

increase in the smuggling ratio requires a lower price in terms of the

official exchange rate if both z and p are elastic or inelastic with

respect to s and z respectively. This implies a downward sloping LL

locus. If one of the functions is elastic and the other is inelastic,

though, the LL locus will be upward sloping. The slope of the LL locus

is given by:




                      —   -
('1)
             dsI                 1+Czs


        To preserve the zero-profit condition for smuggling imports in (10),

an increase in the smuggling ratio requires a higher price unless p is

 elastic with respect to the probability of success. The slope of the SS

 locus is given by:
                                              -10-

       Adapting a diagram from Martin and Panagaryia (1983), we present the

inelastic case (y,              <   1) in Figure 2. An increase in the tariff from

to t1 raises           and s. A decrease in z (or F) from z0 (or FO) to z1 (or

F1) raise        but lowers s.

       Now eliminating              between (9) and (10) we obtain a more general

version of the Beccaria formula:



(13)         zt = pA




where        A        1-[Y•zs(1y)1



       Note first that, if demand for black market foreign exchange in-

creases in proportion with the probability of success (y                1) or if z is

exogenously given (C            = 0),   then A = 1 in (13). This is a sufficient

condition for the premium to be less than the tariff (t >             p).   Put

another way, given the probability of success in smuggling, an increase

in the premium lowers profits unless there is an increase in the tariff.

The Beccaria is now between more supervision (lowering z)and a higher

tariff or an official devaluation (lowering p/t).

        On the other hand, a new trade-off arose between profits from the

smuggling activity and profits in the black market for foreign exchange.

Higher supervision of smuggling is now associated with a lower black

market. In Figure 2, or in the elastic case, we have A > 1 so that again

t >    p.8

       While some basic features of the black market for foreign exchange

can be derived in partial equilibrium models, the interaction between the

private and official valuation of foreign exchange, on the one hand, and

the role of the black market premium as a relative price, on the other,

call for a general equilibrium approach. In the model presented next, we

determine not only the black market premium but also the relative price

of non-traded goods, their ratio being the real exchange rate. To

sharpen the analysis, we will ne.glect the role of the black market

premium emphasized in the previous section, namely determining whether a

transaction will go through the official or the black foreign exchange

market.9



II     General equilibrium



1.     The Model

       Exports and imports are either traded through the official market or

smuggled. Their prices in foreign currency are determined in the world

market. It would, of course, be possible to reinterpret the results in

terms of the Beccaria analysis by allowing for a tariff on the official

import.

       Using the wealth definition, the portfolio balance condition is (3)

becomes:




(14)
            pFlaa

            A..
                   A...•

                   rate

           h = eF/FI is the currency ratio

and        1(1+h)

       The assumption of regressive expectations implies, in turn, that:



(15)          =    )      ;
                                =




       Excess-supply functions for the official traded good, the smuggled
good and the non-traded good depend on prices (e,            and     and wealth.

An income effect could easily be added but, as noted by Kouri (1975), it

would be irrelevant. We take the official exchange rate as the

numeraire.

       The market for non-traded goods is always in equilibrium. Neglect-

ing the cross-price effect (and indicating the sign of the partial

derivatives over the respective argument), excess supply for non-traded

goods is given by:


              +     -
(16)         N(q, ) = 0


where        q =              is the relative price of the non-traded good.
                   PNIe


       As mentioned, excess supply for traded goods equals the accumulation

of foreign currency by the central bank and the private sector through

the reported and unreported trade balances respectively. The domestic

money stock is made up of domestic credit (C) and foreign exchange
                                                -13-




reserves, valued at the official exchange rate. The balance of payments

is the only endogenous source of money creation: capital gains on the

foreign currency value of reserves go into central bank net-worth forev-

er. Neglecting reported capital flows, (and denoting proportional rates

of change by hats), we get:


                           +   -
(17)           F = B(p, q,

relative prices as a function of 6:

                  price of non-traded goods.

and         c =          is   the positive elasticity of h with respect to the

                         premium.


       We contrast (19) and (20) with the flow specification of the black

market rate due to Blejer (1978a). His model collapses into the usual

monetarist model of exchange rate determination when the real official

exchange rate is fixed by a purchasing-power-parity reaction function)°

To make the models compatible, this last aspect and many inessential

complications are ignored.

       Arguing that excess demand for non-traded goods is a given fraction,

t, of excess demand in the goods market, and therefore of the ex-ante

excess supply of money, Blejer posits that changes in the relative price

of non-traded goods are proportional to 5:



(21)        q =


By interpreting t as             (21) is of course the same as (19). The

difference comes from the specification of the black market for foreign

exchange in flow terms. Supply per unit of time, sB, is a positive

function of the black market premium:



                    =
(22)        log         c11 + c12 log p



       Demand per unit of time, DB, is a positive function of the expected

rate of change of the black market rate and a negative function of
                                             -15-



expected inflation, as proxies for the real return to holding black

market foreign exchange and holding the non-traded good. Since own and

cross effects are the same, and expectations are assumed to be regres-
                    13
sive, we get:



(23)        log DB =         c21 - c22 log


where           =
                    e/P

Note that (23) is not consistent with domestic residents having the same

consumption preferences, as assumed in (12), where ,          rather   than the

expected change in , measures the real return differential.

       Log differentiating (22) and (23) and equating yields a link between

the two relative prices p and q, represented in Figure 3 by point E:




            A            A
(24)       p=cq

where       c =
                    C22/(C12 + C22)


Substituting (24) into (21) we obtain, instead of (20):



(25)        pctô

       According to (25), the effect on the premium isdampened by Ct < 1.

Clearly, if q is not responsive to ô and t =        0,   the black market premium

is constant. The same happens when the flow supply of foreign exchange
                                     -16—




does not respond to the premium - say because expectations are static -

and c = 0.

        However in (20), if =   0 we get p =   ô =   q/t,   so that the premium

moves by more than the relative price of non-traded goods, as seems

plausible. The equilibrium is now at E' in Figure 3, and the flow model

understates the change in the premium by EtE. Since            >   0,    under

regressive expectations the premium will be lower. It will nevertheless

be larger than at E if the elasticity of expectations and of the currency

ratio are sufficiently larger than the ratio of the flow supply and

demand elasticities, as at E". The condition is:

                     C12/C22



where           =    —
                     1 -a



        We now analyze, in the case = y        0, the temporary equilibrium of

the system, where excess supply for traded goods is non-zero, and
                                                                    12
steady-state equilibrium, where asset stocks are constant.



3.      Temporary equilibrium



        Equations (14) and (16) determine the relative prices of the smug-

gled and non-traded good in terms of the numeraire, given asset stocks.

An increase in the return to foreign assets (or in the probability of

success in smuggling) would increase h, that is the black market rate.

For a given h, (14) states that there is a single value of p consistent

with portfolio balance. Similarly, from (16), an increase in q must be

matched by an increase in wealth, that is in p, in order to eliminate the

associated excess-supply of non-traded goods.




(26)       pa-F


(27)



       According to (26) and 27), an increase in foreign money decrease p

and leaves q unchanged, while domestic monetary expansion increases p

one-to-one and q by t.   If the relative price effect dominates the wealth

effect (t < 1), then, domestic monetary expansion will imply a real

depreciation of the black market rate expressed in terms of non-traded

goods. The same will be true for a once-and-for-all devaluation of the

official exchange rate, which leaves the demand for foreign currency

unchanged, so p falls, and generates an excess demand for non-traded

goods, so q falls:




(28)



       It can similarly be shown that an increase in h will increase p more

than q (i.e. lead to a real depreciation) unless t > 1 + 1/h.



4.     Steady-state equilibrium



       Steady-state asset stock are such that, aside from portfolio balance

and equilibrium in the non-traded goods market, there is zero
                                              -18-



excess-supply of the smuggled good, so that B = 0 and, therefore, zero

excess-supply of the official traded good as well,                 =   0.   We thus need 6

= 0 in steady-state.

       Substituting for p and q from the temporary equilibrium equations,

the asset accumulation equations in (17) and (18) can be used to show

that the reported (unreported) trade balances deteriorate sufficiently

with increases in domestic (foreign) currency for the system to be

stable.

       Consider now the steady-state effects of monetary and exchange rate

policies when the currency ratio is fixed. The total differential of the

system can be expressed as a function of disturbances which affect the

currency ratio and official exchange rate policies:




            1          0     -1         1     p            h

                                  respect to the premium

                       11(p) is the positive semi-elasticity of (B) with respect

                                  to the relative price of non-traded goods;

and                    (w) is the positive semi-elasticity of (B) with

                                  respect to real wealth
                                           -19—



        A once-and-for-all devaluation leaves the stock of foreign assets

unchanged and raises e, N and N in proportion, so that p, q and                are

also unchanged. An increase in domestic credit creation -            or   a decline

in the rate of crawl -           increases p, q and i, whereas the effect on F is

ambiguous:




(30)         p= idó

(31)                        dô


(32)                    1dô



(33) F= ido

where        =pt+w;
                  = pt + w

and



        When own-price effects are stronger than wealth and cross-price

effects, it > .         Then, when ô rises, p rises by less than i, so that F

rises. Defining ratjos of semi-elasticities, as in (21) above, we can

rewrite the condition in (33) as:



(33')        1- 4t> t'



where             =   p/n
and          t'    = w/it.
                                        -20-



       The condition for a real depreciation when the rate of crawl in-

creases (or, equivalently, for a fall in       after a rise in 6) is stronger

than (33 ).    It   is given by:
                                   13




(34)        (1 —    4)t   > t'




       An increase in h has no steady-state effects on relative prices. It

increases F by 1 + a and decreases by a.        We now allow for endogenous

changes in h. Rather than making the currency ratio a function of the

premium, though, we focus on the case of perfect foresight.



4.     The implication of perfect foresight



       The well-known portfolio model of flexible exchange rates with

non-traded goods of Calvo and Rodriguez (1977) asssumes that expectations

about relative returns are continuously realized, so that i = e.      Using

this in (14) and inverting, we obtain a differential equation for the

black market rate. Since the rate of change of         is pegged to the rate

of crawl by the assumption that the market for non-traded goods clears,

we solve out for q. We also assume that the official rate is constant.

Then we express the system in terms of p, f and F by taking a linear

approximation around steady-state equilibrium, where p = 1 by choice of

units.
                                               -21-

            F




       To solve the characteristic equation of the system in (35) we assume
                               14
that Q =        and obtain:



(36)        X2[1 -         + c2)] +      x(   ÷ 11) ÷ Qil =   0



where       fl=it-t-it




       The, trace and determinant are given by:



(37)        X1X2X3 =      r1Q/


(38)              +             =        -
                      x2+ X3


        Noting   that          -O satisfies (36), we get two roots of opposite

signs:




(39)         X=-±
               2c
                  -.                4c
                                            -22-



       The solution is therefore saddle-point-stable with one direction of

instability associated with the jump variable p and two directions of

stability associated with the assets stocks.

       Suppose now that a crawling peg policy is implemented from a

steady-state situation where the rate of crawl is zero. In steady-state

the premium is constant, so that the rate of depreciation of the black

market rate has to increase. This makes foreign currency more attractive

and raises the currency ratio.

       Suppose now that the expected rate of change of the black market is


given by the rate of crawl, 4          = , the     case of hyperopic expectation)5

The currency ratio also increases.

       We now return to the diagram in the right panel of Figure 1 above,

in order to represent a simplified version of the general equilibrium


system, given by a monetary policy such that = 0 at all times, so that

we can solve out for       and obtain a two-by-two dynamic system. Using the

ratios of elasticities already introduced, we get:




                                       t
                                            )               p-i
(40)

                         rc(]. +                    0
                                   t   4t


where          =   w/n
and

       The trace of the matrix in (40) is positive and the determinant is

negative, so that once again the roots are of opposite sign and the
                                       -23—



system is saddle-point stable. Since the wealth effects cancel, the

locus'where F = 0 is horizontal in p, F space, and defines the long-run

value   of the premium.16. The linear approximation to the portfolio

balance locus,     = 0, has negative slope less than one in absolute value,

given by (t    + t)/(1   +   ' + t). Now      reinterpret Figure 1 as if the

premium were measured on the vertical axis, and the F = 0 locus were a

straight line. Then, as stated in Part I, under perfect foresight,

demand for foreign currency increases when the black market rate depreci-

ates, constraining its initial value for a given stock of foreign curren-

cy to a value below the corresponding initial value under static

expectations. The effect of an increase in the demand for foreign assets

is also smaller than under static expectations. It is followed by a

continuous decline of the black market premium along a higher perfect

foresight path. Conversely, the effect of an exogenous increase in the

foreign demand for the smuggled good is a downward shift in the F = 0

locus, which leads to a jump fall in p and a continuous decline along a

lower perfect foresight path to F2. Under static expectations, there

would be no jump    fall, in   p, but only a decline along the portfolio

balance locus.



Conclusion



        The paper has analyzed regimes of currency inconvertibility using

the portfolio approach to exchange rate determination developed by Kouri

(1983) and others. Reference was also made to a "crime-theoretict'

approach pioneered by Beccaria (1764) and to the monetary approach of

Blejer (1978a). In a simple three—good, two-asset general equilibrium
                                   -24-



model, the condition for a crawling peg to induce real depreciation of

the black market rate in terms of non-traded goods was shown to be the

dominance of the price effect over the wealth effect. Increases in the

demand for foreign assets increase relative prices in the short-run and

the currency ratio in the long-run.

       Allowing the currency ratio to be changed by monetary and exchange

rate policy, it was shown that, under perfect foresight, it would be

raised by an increase in the rate of crawl. The assumption of perfect

foresight may seem particularly strained in a black market, but the

result also holds when expectations are hyperopic, so, in the long run

that the private valuation of foreign currency adjusts to the official

one.

       The contrast of the various expectations formation mechanisms brings

out an important dilemma of currency inconvertibility. If the monetary

authorities believe that, in the long-run, the private valuation of

foreign currency adjusts to the official one, they also have to accept

that the wrong exchange rate policy will set the black market for foreign

exchange off the stable path where expectations are continuously real-

ized, making domestic money worthless. To rule out destabilizing expec-

tations, the official valuation has to adjust to the private valuation,

as in a dual market for foreign exchange.

       Such a regime has the advantage of giving a warning signal which may

prevent the collapse of a fixed exchange rate regime. The literature on

this latter issue, beyond the scope of the present paper, has been

surveyed by Garber (1983), who mentions in passing the potential role of

a dual exchange rate in preventing the speculative attack. This, in
                                       -25-



turn, provides a justification for the weak standard of convertibility

found in the 11fF   Articles   of Agreement.

                                 NOTES



1.   Thus, restricting convertibility for current account transactions

     would tend to promote factor mobility and trade in assets.

     Conversely restricting convertibility for capital account transac-

     tions would tend to promote trade in goods.

2.   In response to the greater mobility of capital, some governments

     have attempted to recapture foreign exchange by offering special

     advantages to the types of transactions, where evasion of exchange

     controls would be easier, like tourist services and migrant's

     remittances. According to the IMP's latest Annual Report on

     Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions, only 33 out of 148

     member countries have fully convertible currencies,      while 67

     (Western Europe, Middle-East and Latin America) have accepted

     convertibility for current account transactions only.

3.   As Cooper (1974) showed for the case of Indonesia, tariff collec-

     tions as a percent of imports were less than schedule rates at

     higher duties because of the increased incentive to smuggling

     activity. While higher collections are presumably achievable with

     greater law enforcement, net revenues might still be less than

     proportional to rates.

4.   A brief survey of this literature is in Macedo (1979).

     approach.

6.   Strictly speaking, this also requires constant expenditure shares.

     See Kouri (1975, P. 77, note 1).

7.   The "collapse" literature is surveyed by Garber (1983).

8.   In the case where LL is upward sloping, the existence of a solution

     (A >   0) requires that, when   > 1 and 1 >   y zs/(1 + zs), we also
     have [y - zs (1 -   y)}   > 1, so that A < 1 and if A <   z,   then t <   p.
9.   In Macedo (1982b, Essay II), S, L and their ratios depend on p. An

     alternative, suggested by Al Fishlow, would be to make the ratio a

     function of 4s.

10. Other references in the monetarist spirit are Culbertson (1975) who

     used annual data on black market rates in India, the Philippines and

     Turkey for purchasing power parity calculations; Giddy (1978) who

     attempted to show the "efficiency" of black markets for foreign

     exchange in Columbia, Brazil and Israel by testing the randomness of

     the black market premium and changes therein using weekly data;

     Blejer (1978b) who used annual data on a black-market-based real

     exchange rate for Brazil, Chile and Colombia to estimate money

     demand functions in these countries; and Canto (1983), who performed

     time-series analysis on data from the Dominican Republic.

11. Under rational expectations the "real rate"       would be a double

     exponential function of time.

12. See the analysis in Macedo (1983) for the cases where            0, so that

     the currency ratio changes, where there are terms-of-trade changes

     and where alternative assumptions about capital gain on reserves are

     explored.

13. This real appreciation is used to characterize the "Egyptian dis-

     ease" in Macedo (1982a).

14. This allows it      because the elasticity relative to the nuineraire

     can also differ.

15. See Allen and Kenen (1980, p. 242).

16. If, instead, we assumed that =          at   all times, the F = 0 locus

    would be upward sloping because of the wealth effect. None of the

     conclusions would be changed.
