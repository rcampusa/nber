Bridging the Gap: Do Fast Reacting Fossil Technologies Facilitate Renewable Energy Diffusion?

                                           ABSTRACT

The diffusion of renewable energy in the power system implies high supply variability. Lacking
economically viable storage options, renewable energy integration has so far been possible thanks
to the presence of fast-reacting mid-merit fossil-based technologies, which act as back-up
capacity. This paper discusses the role of fossil-based power generation technologies in
supporting renewable energy investments. We study the deployment of these two technologies
conditional on all other drivers in 26 OECD countries between 1990 and 2013. We show that a
1% percent increase in the share of fast-reacting fossil generation capacity is associated with a
0.88% percent increase in renewable in the long run. These results are robust to various
modifications in our empirical strategy, and most notably to the use of system-GMM techniques
to account for the interdependence of renewable and fast-reacting fossil investment decisions.
Our analysis points to the substantial indirect costs of renewable energy integration and highlights
the complementarity of investments in different generation technologies for a successful
decarbonization process.

    1. Introduction
The ability to match future economic growth with reduced pressure on the environment (through so-called
“green growth”) is inextricably linked with the deployment and diffusion of low carbon technologies. A
crucial sector in this respect is that of energy, which in 2012 accounted for two thirds of global CO2
emissions. Indeed, this sector alone can contribute to more than 40% of the emission reductions needed for
a “Two Degree Scenario”. To achieve this goal, it will be necessary among other things to deploy
renewable energy sources and reduce the carbon intensity of fossil-based generation technologies (IEA
2015).
    The widespread diffusion of cleaner technologies in the energy sector is currently hindered for three
main reasons. First, renewable technologies recently witnessed dramatic decreases in costs, but they are
not yet fully cost-competitive with fossil-based power generation, except in favorable geographical
locations. Second, the energy sector is sticky and a change in the paradigm of electricity production faces
multiple challenges: the need to upgrade infrastructure (i.e. the electricity grid) and the considerable sunk
costs in existing, less efficient power plants. Third, renewable energy sources such as wind and solar,
which today are the most cost-competitive options, are intermittent and non-dispatchable. Increasing the
penetration of these energy sources in the system is particularly challenging given the current lack of
cheap large-scale storage technologies. Indeed, this last issue may prove the most crucial, as it would
challenge the deployment of renewables even if these were cost competitive and old fossil-based capital
vintages were close to the end of lifetime.
    We shed some light on how renewable energy integration has been historically handled. The topic we
address is not new to energy system operators and experts: unlike energy produced using fossil fuel
sources, generation from the most promising renewables is non-dispatchable and often reaches peak
supply in times not coinciding with peak demand. 1 This increases the risk of shortage, and lowers
reliability and security of supply. To compensate, much back-up generation capacity needs to be kept in
place. For instance, Eon Netz (2004), one of the four grid managers in Germany, indicates that 8 MW of
back-up capacity are required for any 10 MW of wind capacity added to the system. Martin Hermann,
CEO of 8minutenergy Renewables, argues that only the ability to store solar electricity for three to five
hours will eventually “allow a precise overlap between the PV production curve and the demand peak,”
while 20 hours of storage are necessary for PV to work as a base load resource (REW 2011). Such large
scale storage technologies or the dispatch of electricity over long distances are still not possible at

  For instance, wind turbines produce most electricity in the early hours of the day and at night and cannot cover daytime peak
demand; wind speeds vary significantly from day to day but also between seasons. Solar power plants output is strongly affected
by cloud coverage and varies between seasons. Hence, it can cover daytime peak load, but not the residential sector nighttime
peak load demand. Both these renewable energy options require a significant amount of backup capacity.

                                                                 2
competitive costs at present. 2 Indeed, the issue of how to successfully manage renewable energy
integration has attracted increasing attention, especially as their share in the system increases to levels
never witnessed before (Carrrara and Marangoni 2015).
      To date, back-up capacity has been mostly provided through fossil-based technologies. Importantly,
there are different categories of fossil-based technologies. Base-load fossil generation (BLF henceforth),
which comprises coal based and low efficiency generation technologies, cannot easily compensate for
renewable variability due to slow reacting times and high capital costs. Fast-reacting fossil technologies
(FRF henceforth), which includes most gas-generation technologies, Combined Heat and Power and
Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle to name a few, are characterized by mid-merit order, quick ramp-
up times, lower capital costs and modularity (meaning that efficiency does not fall significantly with size).
They are thus particularly suitable to meet peak demand and mitigate the variability of renewables.
    A careful consideration of the relationship between renewable capacity and other generation
technologies, and especially fast-reacting fossil-based electricity generation, unveils two significant
shortcomings of existing empirical and theoretical analyses. First, it highlights that the trade-off between
renewable deployment and security of supply is exacerbated as renewable penetration increases. Second, it
suggests that unless cheap storage options become widely available in the immediate future, the
penetration of renewable energy will increase system costs, as a significant amount of capital-intensive
and under-utilized back-up capacity will have to be maintained. Overlooking these two issues leads to an
underestimation of the costs of the energy transition. This is particularly troublesome considering that
higher renewable penetration rates will further increase system variability and hence require a parallel
expansion of back-up resources (NYISO, 2010 and REW 2011).
    We contribute to the debate by providing a careful macro-analysis of the historic interplay between the
deployment of renewable and fossil electricity generation capacity in a sample of 26 Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries between 1990 and 2013. As in the related
paper by Popp et al. (2011), we focus on installed capacity as our proxy for technology investment and
penetration. We complement previous contributions by focusing on the role of fossil-based technologies,
and further splitting them into base-load and fast-reacting fossil generation.
    Controlling for country fixed effects and the rich dynamics of RE capacity, we show that, all other
things equal, a 1% percent increase in the share of fast reacting fossil technologies is associated with a
0.88% percent increase in renewable generation capacity in the long term. This is a sizeable effect, which
is attributable to the high persistence of RE capacity in our dynamic specification. To be sure, the short-
term effect of a 1% increase in FRF capacity is a modest 0.03% increase in RE. This result is robust to

various changes in the specification and in the estimation technique, including the use of system-GMM to
account for the fact that investment decisions in renewable and fast-reacting fossil are correlated.
      The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 details some of the challenges of the
integration of renewable energy generation in the power system, reviews the available literature on the
topic, and highlights our contribution to the debate. Section 3 presents our dependent variable and main
variables of interest and provides descriptive statistics. Section 4 details the empirical strategy. Section 5
presents our results, and quantifies them in a detailed way. Section 6 concludes, highlighting the policy
implications of our analysis.



     2. Managing renewable energy integration in the energy system
Decoupling economic activities from fossil-fuel use (and hence, from anthropogenic carbon emissions) is
the only way to avoid severe and pervasive impacts from climate change while sustaining economic
growth (IPCC, 2014). As testified by the outcomes of the COP21, all governments are committed to
addressing this challenge by implementing policies to promote cleaner technologies and to limit the use of
polluting inputs. The integration of renewable sources in the energy system is one of the key components
of such decarbonization strategy. However, as argued in the Introduction, this integration raises many
challenges in terms of planning, operation, and reliability practice.3 In particular, renewable technologies
are not comparable with fossil-based generation in terms of dispatchability. This translates into high
system costs 4 of renewable generation, as it requires holding significant back-up capacity to ensure a
balanced energy supply throughout the day. In fact, these challenges will only further increase as the share
of renewable energy generation increases to levels never witnessed before. To date these aspects have
been only marginally considered in economic analyses of renewable energy deployment.
     The issue of how to match demand and supply instantaneously, and in particular to meet peak demand,
has always characterized energy systems, since electricity cannot be stored in an economically viable way
for extended periods of time or dispatched for long distances without significant loss. This means that
even power systems fully based on dispatchable technologies (such as fossil fuels) incur into system costs
due to the necessity to hold spinning capacity, namely reserve generation capacity always on hold to offset


3
  For instance, renewables imply a more flexible and decentralized approach to energy generation. In addition, they shift the merit
order of power generation options and lower the price of electricity. The merit order is a ranking criterion whereby in a centralized
system generation capacity should be brought online in increasing order of marginal costs (considerations are also given to the
amount of energy that can be generated). Implementing the merit order ensures that electricity dispatch is done minimizing the
cost of production. Sometimes generating units must be started out of merit order, for instance in cases of transmission congestion
or system reliability. The high demand for electricity during peak hours pushes up the bidding price for electricity, and the
relatively inexpensive base-load power supply mix is supplemented by ‘peaking power plants,' which charge a premium for their
electricity since their marginal costs are higher. Renewable sources, with high merit, hence reduce the overall costs of electricity,
and particularly so in times of peak demand (Sensfuss and Ragwitz 2008).

  System costs are the total costs above plant-level to supply electricity at a given load and given level of security of supply.

                                                                    4
variations in demand and supply. Generally speaking, peak demand has been met thanks to gas-fired and
diesel turbines, which have fast rump-up times and are modular. 5 Conversely, other technologies with
higher capital costs, lower operating costs and slower reaction times (such as coal-based or nuclear power
plants) have been used to handle base-load production.
     The problem of matching demand and supply is magnified in the case of renewables due to their
variability vis-à-vis fossil-based generation and to the fact that times of peak production do not necessarily
take place at times of high demand. Variability in generation has been identified as a significant barrier to
the integration of both wind and solar resources (e.g., GE Energy 2008, Lorenz et al. 2011, Marquez and
Coimbra 2011, Mathiesen and Kleissl 2011, Gowrisankaran et al 2016, Sinn 2016). To date, given their
relatively low penetration, the integration of renewable sources has not required drastic changes in system
operations. Peak-load generation technologies such as gas turbines have been used to compensate for
variability, alongside other load-following “mid-merit” generation technologies (such as combined cycle,
and specifically combined cycle gas turbines), which have been used to this end as the penetration of
renewables increased in the last decades. 6
     As a result, the estimated indirect costs of renewables are at least an order of magnitude greater than
those associated with dispatchable fossil-fuel technologies. For the latter, system costs are relatively
modest, generally estimated below USD 3 per MWh in OECD countries. For the formers, such costs are as
high as USD 40 per MWh for onshore wind, USD 45 per MWh for offshore wind and USD 80 per MWh
for solar (IEA 2012). These high estimates are the direct results of the need for additional system reserves
and back-up generation to ensure system reliability. 7 Renewable energy system costs will also increase
over-proportionally with the amount of variable electricity in the system, with far-fetching implications for
the energy markets and security of supply (OECD 2012, NYISO 2010, IEA 2012, Baker et al. 2013, Sinn
2016). 8Ignoring them can thus lead to a severe underestimation of the social and private costs of any
energy transition.

  Unlike steam turbines, which require a period of 1-1.5 hours for heating after start up, cold gas turbines heat within 6 to15
minutes following the start-up (http://www.eolss.net/sample-chapters/c18/e6-43-33-06.pdf). The most attractive option is to use
the most efficient types of gas-fired plants as back-up capacity. These consist of co-generation gas-fired plants, which use gas to
produce both electricity and heat for additional applications. Co-generation is an attractive option since back-up capacity is used
below peak and often at low levels of capacity. Unfortunately, our data do not allow discerning if gas turbines are used in co-
generation mode. Hydro generation has also been traditionally used to meet peak demand, as electricity production can rump up
fast. However, hydro is very dependent on endowment and it is unlikely that it can be expanded further (especially in big plants)
since most of the resource is already exploited in most of the countries included in our sample. Biomass is also an excellent
candidate, but concerns over tradeoffs relating to land use for biomass and biofuel production versus food are high.
6
  Such technologies can respond to changes in load much faster than conventional steam power plants, but slower than gas
turbines (see http://www.wartsila.com/energy/learning-center/technical-comparisons/combustion-engine-vs-gas-turbine-part-load-
efficiency-and-flexibility and http://iea-etsap.org/web/Highlights%20PDF/E02-gas_fired_power-GS-AD-gct%201.pdf )
7
  Indeed, Baker et al. (2013) argue that new solar PV capacity displaces only a small percentage of already existing dispatchable
capacity.
8
  To attenuate such costs, it will be necessary for system operators to alter system infrastructure, introduce demand-side
management programs, and change the operating capabilities of conventional generation.

                                                                   5
    Notwithstanding the importance of this topic, the economic literature focusing on energy innovation
and deployment has largely overlooked this issue to date. A first set of contributions focuses on the role of
energy and environmental policies in promoting renewable investment and deployment, proxied by
installed capacity. Shrimali and Jenner et al. (2013) explore the contribution of different policy
instruments to solar PV development in the US commercial and residential sectors over the years 1998-
2009, but their analysis does not touch upon the possible role of other generation technologies. Jenner et
al. (2013) extend the analysis to the EU and show that solar PV deployment has been driven by feed-in
tariffs (FITs). They partially recognize the role of other generation technologies in affecting RE
investments (i.e. yearly capacity additions) by conditioning their empirical analysis on the share of power
generation from traditional energy sources (nuclear, coal and gas), but they do not distinguish between the
roles of different fossil-based technologies (FRF vs. BLF) and they do not discuss the implication of their
findings in this respect. Popp et al. (2011) show that technological improvements have a small positive
impact on investments in RE generation in OECD countries, but find that policies are not significant. Also
in this case, the analysis does not control for the possible interaction between investments in renewable
energy and (fast-reacting) fossil generation technologies. Generally speaking, the role of fossil-based
generation is overlooked in these studies under the implicit assumption of high substitutability between
clean and dirty technologies. This assumption is shared by the theoretical contributions on directed
technical change, which assume a relatively high degree of substitutability between the two (Acemoglu et
al., 2012). We contribute to this strand of literature by providing the first macro-level empirical analysis of
the diffusion of RE generation while accounting for the interaction with investments in other generation
capacity, and specifically fossil-based capacity. In addition, our empirical specification takes into account
a rich dynamic structure of investments in power generation, improving on the linear technological model
of diffusion which is assumed in Popp et al. (2011).
    A second strand of empirical literature studies the determinants of renewable energy deployment by
focusing on power production (rather than capacity), with no specific attention to the role of energy and
environmental policies. Aguirre and Ibikunle (2014) investigate the drivers of country-level RE growth in
a broad sample size of countries (including Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa). They show that
coal, oil and gas contribution to electricity generation is negatively associated with renewable growth (see
also Pfeiffer and Mulder, 2013). Narbel (2013) provides evidence that RE generation is inversely related
to energy dependency from abroad, proxied by coal imports. Overall, these contributions suggest that
renewable and fossil energy are substitutes, as the share of renewable generation is inversely related to the
share of fossil generation. However, by focusing on the actual amount of electricity produced, these
studies cannot provide any insights on the sunk costs associated with back-up capacity. As argued in
Jenner et al. (2013) “generation determines the actual return on investment while capacity reﬂects the


                                                        6
expected return on investment.” Our analysis contributes to this strand of literature by exploring the
relationship between renewable and other generation technologies using capacity rather than production
data. In this way, we are able to capture the investment decision as purely as possible, since capacity
informs on investments without being confounded by other forces that investors cannot fully foresee or
control, such as weather conditions, equipment performance, and other such factors.
    A third strand of literature comprises the contributions which use integrated assessment models
(IAMs) to provide insights on the evolution of demand and the generation mix over time. In these models
is it of paramount importance to properly account for the constraints imposed by variable renewable
energy sources. Carrara and Marangoni (2015) show that several strategies are adopted to this end in
IAMs, depending on the granularity of the model and the complexity with which it portrays the energy
sector. For instance, some models impose hard upper bounds on variable renewable sources penetration,
while others rely on implicit or explicit cost mark-up for renewables, or constraints on the flexibility or
installed capacity of the power generation fleet. Our contribution provides insights on the historical
interaction between renewable and fossil generation technologies, and can inform the IAMs community
regarding the calibration of such constraints. This is particularly true for those models which describe the
energy system at the aggregate level and considering that we provide both short-run and long-run
estimates.
    Our focus is thus on the historic relationship between renewable energy integration and the presence
of fossil-based generation technologies which are used as back-up capacity. The core of the paper is
devoted to the empirical investigation of whether, absent cost-competitive storage technologies, the
successful integration of renewable was possible (and higher) partly due to the availability of fast-reacting
fossil-based units. In the next Section, we describe in detail our data sources, while Section 4 presents our
empirical approach.



    3. Data and Descriptive Statistics
Our sample includes 26 OECD countries betweeen 1990 and 2013. 9 Our dependent variable is the
                                                                       𝑅𝐸
percentage of net installed electrical capacity in RE technologies (𝐶𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡 ) over total electricity capacity
(𝑇𝑜𝑡𝐶𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡 ) in country i, time t, which reflects the investment decision as purely as possible (see
discussion in Section 2):

  The sample is slightly unbalanced due to missing data and includes: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic,
Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland,
Portugal, the Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States. The missing
values are concentrated at the end of the sample period for France and Germany, while at the beginning of the sample period for
the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic. These countries account for the majority of worldwide RE investment over the
period considered.

                                                                 7

                                                     𝑅𝐸           𝐶𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡

                                                                 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝐶𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡
    Renewable energy technologies include solar, wind, geothermal, ocean/tide/wave and biomass from
the IEA Renewable Energy Information Database (2016a). We exclude hydro from the calculation of RE
capacity because, as pointed out by Popp et al. (2011), it is a mature technology for which most of the
natural endowment is already exploited. Furthermore, hydro is a fast-reacting dispatchable technology and
is often used to meet peak demand. As such, it does not share the same characteristics and limitations of
the other RE technologies. Furthermore, since our main argument is that FRF technologies compensate for
the variability of RE, we test the robustness of our results by also excluding biomass (which is storable)
from the definition of RE capacity.
      Fossil technologies are split into base-load fossil generation and fast-reacting fossil technologies,
with the latter being the best candidates to compensate for renewable variability, as argued above. The
IEA Electricity Information Database (2016b) distinguishes between the following generation
technologies: Gas Turbines; Combined Cycle; Internal combustion/diesel; Steam; and Other type of
generation. We define FRF as the sum of Gas Turbines and Combined Cycle, as these are mid-merit
technologies often used to address peak load. Conversely, we define BLF as Internal combustion/diesel;
Steam; and Other type of generation. These are technologies which are generally characterized by lower
efficiency levels and slower ramp up times. 10
         Figure 1 shows the development of the shares of installed capacity in RE, FRF and BLF for
selected countries and on average in the sample. The share of BLF technologies declined over time except
in Japan, with some countries such as Denmark and Italy experiencing a rather sharp decrease.
Conversely, both RE and FRF technologies increased significantly, especially in the second part of the
sample, albeit with different rates across countries. A sharp and more uniform increase in renewable
characterizes EU countries starting around the signing of the Kyoto Protocol. Denmark stands out, with
very high investments in RE already in the 1990s, almost entirely due to wind power. We see a similar
change in FRF around the year 1996, with some countries, such as Italy and the US, increasing capacity
significantly.

   IEA (2016b) allows a breakdown based on the energy carrier (gas, oil, coal or other combustible fuels) Unfortunately, it is not
possible to distinguish installed capacity along both dimensions (i.e. energy carrier and conversion technology (IEA 2013).

Figure 1: Share of installed capacity in RE, FRF, BLF, average and selected countries.


    To explore the relationship between RE and FRF capacity, we estimate a regression model where the
                                           𝐹𝑅𝐹
capacity share in FRF technology (𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒 𝐶𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡  ) is the main explanatory variable of interest, and is
included in a regression alongside other determinants previously explored in the literature. This allows us
                                              𝑅𝐸              𝐹𝑅𝐹
to quantify the relationship between 𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒 𝐶𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡 and 𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒 𝐶𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡  ceteris paribus, namely
conditioning our estimates on several other confounding factors affecting the level of RE generation
capacity in country i at time t.
    Among the most important drivers of renewable deployment previously identified in the literature are
public policies, which pertain to two realms: environmental policy and market regulation. On the one
hand, environmental policies such as feed-in tariffs, tax credits, emission targets and investment incentives
are specifically designed to accelerate the diffusion of RE technologies by reducing the cost wedge with
fossil generation. Their role in supporting the development and diffusion of renewable technologies has
been widely explored in the theoretical and empirical literature (see Popp et al 2010 for a review). As
such, our analysis necessarily includes them among the key determinants of renewable investments.



                                                                                                                       9
     On the other hand, the liberalization of the electricity market had the effect, among the other things, of
shifting the balance of power from centralized, large and regulated providers to smaller actors specialized
in cleaner technologies (Nicolli and Vona, 2016). While it is theoretically well established that the degree
of competition in the energy market affects the incentives to innovate in renewable energy technologies
(Nesta et al. 2014; Nicolli and Vona, 2016), this is to the best of our knowledge the first paper to consider
the effect of market competition on the deployment of both renewable and fossil energy technologies.
Conditioning our analysis on the level of market liberalization is particularly important given the
significant changes that characterized OECD countries in the last decades.
     Regarding environmental policies, we use data from the OECD Environmental Policy Stringency
(EPS) database (Botta and Koźluk 2014). This data includes information 15 environmental policy
instruments for OECD countries over the years 1990-2012, and rates their stringency on a scale from 1
and 6. 11 Among the policy instruments included in the EPS database, we select the ones that are more
relevant for the power sector. In line with the findings of Johnstone et al. (2010), we include in our
preferred specification feed-in tariffs (FITs) and renewable energy certificates as the most important
policies supporting RE deployment. FITs promote the integration of renewable in the power system by
guaranteeing a fixed remuneration to RE generation. Our underlying assumption is that feed-in-tariffs are
particularly effective in supporting new and small producers in the power market. Conversely, renewable
energy certificate promote RE deployment by requiring that utilities produce or purchase a certain share of
renewable power as part of their portfolio. In this respect, certificates are expected to be particularly
effective. We define the variable “FIT” as the average of a country’s score for the solar and wind FITs
from the EPS database. The variable “Certificates” is defined as the average of the score for White, Green
and CO2 certificates.
     We also test also the effects of other two policy instruments in additional empirical specifications:
“Taxes” (defined as the average of CO2, SOx, NOx and Diesel taxes scores) and “Limits” to pollutants
(defined as the average of SOx, NOx, and Particulate Matters limits scores). Unlike FITs and Certificates,
these do not provide a direct incentive to invest in RE and thus are expected to have smaller effect on the
deployment of RE.
     Regarding the level of market regulation, we include the OECD index capturing the level of entry
barriers in the electricity market, which accounts for both freedom of access to the grid by producers and
freedom of choice by consumers. The index varies on a 1-6 scale, with the highest values indicating a
higher level of entry barrier (Conway et al., 2005). The scale of production for RE installation is usually

11
  The OECD EPS database contains information on 15 different environmental policy instruments implemented in OECD
countries, which include Non-Market Based (NMB) and Market Based (MB) instruments. NMB policies are limits to pollutants
(SOx, NOx, Particulate Matters and Sulphur Content of Diesel) and Government energy-related R&D expenditures as a
percentage of GDP. MB policies are feed in tariffs (FITs - Solar and Wind), taxes (on CO2, SOx, NOx and Diesel), certificates
(White, Green and CO2) and the presence of deposit and refund schemes (DRS).

                                                               10
much smaller than the one of traditional fossil plants (e.g. rooftop PV) and more suitable for a
decentralized market composed of several producers. Therefore, we expect that the diffusion of both RE
and small scale FRF technologies will be favored by the reduction of entry barriers.
    Hence, the basic vector of policy controls 𝐏𝐎𝐋 in our analysis is defined as follows:


                             𝐏𝐎𝐋𝑖𝑡−1 = [FITit−1 ; Certi�icatesit−1 ; PMR it−1 ]

    To capture the optimal lag between all variables in the 𝐏𝐎𝐋 vector and our dependent variable, we use
a moving average of the policy variables between 𝑡 − 1 and 𝑡 − 3. We limit ourselves to this time
window, rather than considering all lags of the policy proxies between 𝑡 − 1 and 𝑡 − 𝑘 , to be
parsimonious, given that, as we will explain more in detail below, our empirical strategy already takes into
account a rich dynamic structure of the dependent variable.
    Figure 2 shows the evolution of the policy variables on average in our sample and for selected
countries. FITs increased steadily over time, indicating that more and more countries relied on this policy
instrument to promote renewable energy capacity and generation. However, countries like Italy or
Denmark experience high fluctuations. The use of Certificates started around the year 2000, and increased
very fast after 2005, but with some heterogeneity across countries. Japan and the US score rather low on
this specific policy instrument. The deregulation of the power sector (PMR) led to a rather sharp increase
in entry (i.e. a decrease of entry barriers) in all countries since the mid-1990s. The use of Taxes in the
sample has increased, but at a much lower speed than other policy instruments, including Limits to
pollutants.
    To isolate the true relation between installed capacity in the different power generation technologies,
our model controls for additional confounding factors likely to affect RE investments. Details on the data
source for each variable are presented in Table 1.
    First, GDP per capita and electricity consumption are included to capture overall economic well-
being, expectations about future demand and as well as all other demand-side factors not captured by the
policy indicators and related to country or economy size. All these forces are expected to increase the need
for new generation capacity irrespective of the technology considered.

    Second, we include a set of controls specific to the country’s energy system. For instance, France
relies heavily on nuclear power, which is a carbon free source of electricity, and this should decrease its
need to invest in either renewable or fossil-based technologies. We hence include the share of capacity in
nuclear as a control variable. Conversely, as shown in Narbel (2013), investments in alternative energy


                                                                                      12
sources are lower in countries which are less dependent on energy imports. The same can be argued with
respect to investments in higher efficiency fossil-based power production. We control for energy
dependence by including a variable defined as net energy imports over total energy use. A variable
controlling for rents associated with the extraction of coal, oil and gas is also included as a way to capture
in-house resource advantages in fossil fuel endowments and profitability, which likely affect the
incentives to invest in any type of additional generation capacity. We also add the average age of each
installed megawatt of electricity capacity to proxy for the fact that countries with older capital stock are
more likely invest in new capacity.
      Third, although large scale storage technologies for power production are not available in the market
at cost-competitive prices during our sample period, expectations about the fast deployment of such
technologies may influence investment decisions. Therefore, we control for the technological evolution of
storage technologies by including in our specification a variable measuring the knowledge stock in storage
and smart grids technologies. This is built using the perpetual inventory method, as in Verdolini and
Galeotti (2011).

    Tables 1 and 2 provide descriptive statistics for our variables of interest on average across the sample
and by country. Overall, the share of RE capacity is rather low (5 percent and 3.5 percent when including
or excluding biomass from the calculation, respectively). However, this share spans from 0 up to 47
percent. The share of FRF technologies is about two and a half times higher on average, but the maximum
penetration rate is very similar to that of renewables (49 percent). Overall, the distribution of RE
investments in much more skewed to the left than that of FRF technologies. BLF technologies, on the
other hand, provided the bulk of generation capacity over the sample period, while the share of nuclear
generation is comparable to that of FRF. Germany, Spain and the Nordic countries (excluding Norway)
are leaders in non-hydro RE deployment and generally have high FITs, high Certificates and low entry
barriers in the electricity markets. Interesting for the purpose of this paper, eight countries are above the
median in both RE and in FRF; in particular, Ireland, Netherland, Italy and Finland are leaders in both.



    4. Empirical Strategy
In this Section we illustrate our empirical strategy, which is designed to address, to our best, the
econometric issues which characterize the identification of the effect of FRF capacity on RE capacity. As
                                                                        𝑅𝐸
explained above, we assume that the percentage of RE capacity (𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒 𝐶𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡 ) is a function of the
                                     𝐹𝑅𝐹
percentage of FRF capacity (𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒 𝐶𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡  ), of the policy variables and of all other controls. Because
capacity is a stock and thus is highly persistent, we consider a dynamic econometric model. Specifically,
we estimate variants of the following equation:



             RE                      RE                FRF
     𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒𝐶𝑎𝑝i,t = ∑ks=1 ρs 𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒 𝐶𝑎𝑝i,t−s + β𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒 𝐶𝑎𝑝i,t−1 + θ𝑷𝑶𝑳𝑖,𝑡−1 + α𝐗 i,t−1 + µi + µt + εi,t,
                                                         (1)


               RE             FRF
where 𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒 𝐶𝑎𝑝i,t , 𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒 𝐶𝑎𝑝i,t−1 and 𝐏𝐎𝐋i,t−1 are as explained in the previous Section; µi and µt are
country and time effects, respectively, with the former capturing time-invariant country characteristics and
the latter absorbing the influence of global shocks; εit is an error term and X it−1 is the vector of other
controls. This empirical specification improves on that of the closely related paper of Popp et al. (2011),
                            𝑅𝐸      𝑅𝐸
which uses the change in 𝐶𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡 (∆𝐶𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡 ) as dependent variable, because it accounts in a flexible way
for the rich dynamics of capacity. Our approach is more general as it nests the one where the dependent




                                                       15
variable is in first difference (i.e. s = 1 and ρ1 = 1) 12 and provides two advantages. On the one hand, the
inclusion of more than one lag portrays rich and technology-specific dynamics, allowing to retrieve both
the short- and long-term effects of our variables of interest. Specifically, the latter is equal to the short-
term effect multiplied by 1/(1 − ∑ks=1 ρ�s ). On the other hand, we can take advantage of GMM estimation
methods to lower endogeneity concerns regarding the main explanatory variable of interest (CapFRF
                                                                                              it−1 ). We

briefly discuss these two advantages in turn here, and present detailed results in the next Section.
     First, investments in RE are likely planned to structurally reduce energy dependence and carbon
emissions in the long run, and therefore they are expected to be highly persistent. The potentially rich
dynamics of RE capacity requires the ex-ante choice of the appropriate lag length for the lagged terms of
the dependent variable in equation (1). Following Acemoglu et al. (2014) and Popp (2016), we use a
practical approach to determine the optimal number of lags required to correctly specify such dynamics.
We estimate a basic model which includes only the lagged dependent variable alongside time and country
fixed effects and we add lagged terms up to the point where the additional lag is not statistically
significant. These estimates are presented in Table A1 in the Appendix and discussed in next Section. To
show the robustness of our results, we also presents estimates for the specification in first difference used
in Popp et al. (2011). 13
     Second, and most importantly, we need to choose the appropriate estimator to obtain an unbiased
coefficient for our variables of interest. It is well known in the literature that a simple within-
transformation fails to provide accurate estimates in dynamic panels (Nickell, 1981). This bias is due to
the mechanical correlation between the within-transformed error term and the right-hand side variables,
and it decreases with 1/𝑇, where 𝑇 is the number of periods considered. In our case 𝑇 = 24 , hence the
bias should be small and a fixed effect estimator is a good starting point. While the debate regarding the
best estimator for dynamic panels is still open, the system-GMM estimator has gained some consensus
especially in the case of highly persistent series (Arellano and Bover, 1995; Blundell and Bond, 1998).
The basic rationale underpinning this estimator is to instrument the lagged terms of the dependent variable
with lags and lagged differences. Compared to the difference-GMM estimator proposed by Arellano and
Bond (1991), the system GMM approach mitigates the weak instrument problem using moment conditions
both for the equation in levels and in first-differences (Bond, 2002). This problem exists because, by
definition, lagged levels are weak instrument of the subsequent first-differences when a variable is highly
persistent.

   This is evident from the fact that a model as: ∆𝑦𝑖𝑡 = 𝛽𝑋𝑖𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡 is equivalent to 𝑦𝑖𝑡 = ρ𝑦𝑖𝑡−1 + 𝛽𝑋𝑖𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡 under the constraint
that 𝜌� = 1. If the series 𝑦𝑖𝑡 is highly persistent, ∆𝑦𝑖𝑡 is near a pure random disturbance and the estimates of our effects of interest
𝛽̂ are more likely to be estimated imprecisely.
13
   The specification used by Popp et al. (2011) is: ∆𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒 𝐶𝑎𝑝itRE = β𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒 𝐶𝑎𝑝it−1  FRF
                                                                                         + θ𝐏𝐎𝐋i,t−1 + α 𝑋𝑖,𝑡−1 + μi + μt + εit .

                                                                    16
    The flexibility of the system-GMM approach is especially useful to mitigate bias in the estimation of
the effect of the share of capacity in FRF on RE investments. In our context, the coefficient associated
                           FRF
with the variable 𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒 𝐶𝑎𝑝it−1 and estimated using an OLS approach cannot be interpreted as causal
because unobservable shocks are likely correlated with investments decisions. Of particular concern is the
fact that actual investments in both FRF and RE result from long-term planning of utilities under
                                                                        FRF
environmental and “dispatchability” constraints. Instrumenting 𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒 𝐶𝑎𝑝it−1 with the history of both
                                                                               �𝐶𝑎𝑝it−1
capacities in RE and FRF reduces endogeneity concerns because the predicted 𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒  FRF
                                                                                        reflects a
given country’s past long-term investment strategies in both RE and FRF investments. This arguably
smoothens the influence of time varying shocks, such as unobserved changes in energy policy or the entry
of a new large player, affecting both RE and FRF investments. We are aware that our estimation strategy
does not fully succeed in dealing with the endogeneity of FRF capacity. Indeed, a full test of the role
played by FRF technologies as backup capacity for intermittent RE would require convincing external
instruments or an exogenous variation in FRF capacity. Such a thorough test is left for future research, but
the robustness of our results to different specifications reassures with respect to the validity of our results,
given the data constraints we face.



    5. Estimation Results
Table 3 presents the main results of our analysis using variations of Equation (1) presented above. An
important initial insights provided by our estimates is that there is a sizeable amount of persistence in the
RE dynamics, thus supporting our choice of a rich dynamic model. More specifically, if we consider only
one or two lags, RE capacity behaves similarly to a random walk with a drift (see Table A1). Adding the
third lag (which is significant in the base specification presented in Table A1), the dynamics of RE
capacity becomes less persistent. The cumulative effect of past RE capacity on current RE capacity is
estimated at 0.972 in our favorite specification (Model 3 in Table 3). This implies that the short-term
effect of FRF capacity on RE capacity is small compared to the long-term effect. For this reason, it is
important to distinguish between the two effects using a general dynamic framework, as is the case in this
analysis.

    Moving to more detailed comments, Model 1 presents a basic specification where we consider only
FITs, Certificates and PMR as determinants of RE deployment. Two main considerations emerge from
this model, which shed light on previous results in the literature. First, in line with recent studies on the
effect of competition on RE innovation (Nesta et al., 2014; Nicolli and Vona, 2016), lowering entry
barriers promotes the deployment of RE. Second, environmental policies have a positive impact on the
diffusion of RE capacity. This last result goes in the direction of confirming that environmental policies
are indeed key drivers of renewable energy generation. Previous empirical evidence in this respect was
rather mixed. For instance, Popp et al (2011) finds only a modest and often statistically insignificant
effect, while other contributions point to the effectiveness of FITs but not of other policies (Jenner et al.,
2013). The difference between the results put forward in these contributions and our analysis can be
ascribed to several factors which we are not in a position to test directly, including the choice of
econometric approach, the choice of policy proxies and the time frame and geographical focus of the
analysis.
    Furthermore, the effects of both environmental policy and market regulation are economically
relevant. On the one hand, the short-term effects appear small. An inter-quartile change in the policy
                                                    RE
variables is associated with an increase in 𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒𝐶𝑎𝑝i,t of 0.2% for FITs and Certificates and 0.5% for
PMR. On the other hand, the long-term effects are 77 times larger in the base specification (Model 1) and
35 times larger in our favorite specification (Model 3, see discussion below). Notice that for PMR an
interquartile change is equivalent to going from “no freedom of access and choice for producers and
consumers” to “full opening up of the market”, while the interquartile changes in Certificates and FIT
entail less extreme variations. The large long-term effect of PMR (i.e. 17.5% in our favorite specification)
reflects the key role of independent power producers and decentralized generation in the deployment of
key RE technologies, such as Wind and Solar.
    Model 2 adds both the vector of relevant controls 𝑋𝑖,𝑡−1 and the other policy variables (Limits and
Taxes). These additional regressors fail to reach acceptable levels of significance and their inclusion does
not affect in a major way the coefficients associated with the main policy variables. Given the lack of
significance of the coefficients for the Taxes and Limits variables, we exclude them from our specification
and focus on the FIT, Certificates and PMR variables.
                                                                                                  FRF
    Model 3 presents our preferred specification, which includes our variable of interest 𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒𝐶𝑎𝑝i,t−1
alongside all controls 𝑋𝑖,𝑡−1 and the proxy indicating the stock of knowledge related to storage
technologies. Our results indicate that the presence of FRF technologies favors investment in RE,
conditional on all other covariates. Once again, the estimated short-term effects of the policy variables are
small, but their high persistence gives rise to significantly larger long-term effects. In the short-term, a one
percent increase in FRF capacity brings to a 0.028% increase in the share of RE. In the long term, the

                                                        19
effect becomes nearly a one-to-one increase (i.e. 1.02%). Indeed, the large long-run point estimates we
present are consistent with the insights from technical assessments made by practitioners and international
institutions, as explained in Section 2. For instance, Baker et al. (2013) argue that new solar PV capacity
displaces only a small percentage of dispatchable capacity. Our results also confirm the insights from Eon
Netz (2004) and REW (2011) indicating that wind and solar are in need of close to a one-to-one back-up
capacity. We discuss the implications of these results in the concluding Section.
       As mentioned in the previous Section, our econometric model nests the model used in Popp et al.
(2011). Table A2 in the Appendix presents the estimation of our favorite specification using the first-
difference transformation of the dependent variable as in Popp et al. (2011) to show the robustness of our
results. 14 While the short-term effect of FRF on RE capacity is very similar to the one we obtain, our
approach has the advantage of allowing the assessment of long-term effects.
       A possible concern regarding the estimated effect of FRF capacity on RE diffusion is represented by
the fact that RE include biomass, which differs from other renewable energy sources in two respects. First,
it is dispatchable, namely it can be stored and burned when needed. Second, biomass can be fed into many
burners which also burn fossil fuels, and can be co-fired by mixing it with coal and gas. Therefore,
including biomass in the definition of RE could lead to biased estimates. To gauge the strength of our
results, we re-estimate our favorite specification subtracting biomass capacity from our definition of
dependent variable (Model 4). Our general conclusion is that the enabling role of FRF technologies with
respect to RE investment is not driven by any mechanical correlation between FRF investments and
biomass. Specifically, we observe a small decline in the effect of FRF on RE, which is however still close
to unity in the long-run: a 1% increase in FRF capacity is associated with a 0.88% increase in RE capacity.
It is interesting to stress that in the specification without biomass the policy effects become weaker and
more similar to that estimated in Popp et al. (2011), while PMR remains the most important policy driver.
Finally, the effect of storage technologies becomes statistically significant at conventional level, pointing
to the importance of complementary technologies which improve the dispatchability of intermittent RE
technologies such as wind and solar. It is indeed well known that the speed of technical change in storage
technologies will be as important as the direct speed of technical change in RE technologies to make RE
autonomous and thus fully substitutable to fossil fuel technologies.
       As an additional step to improve the identification of the effect of FRF capacity, Model 5 replaces
        FRF
𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒𝐶𝑎𝑝i,t−1 with leads of the same variable, from 𝑡 + 1 to 𝑡 + 3. This allows us to test the robustness of
our results to the assumptions regarding the way in which agents form expectations. Indeed, by using lags
of the variable of interest, our estimation strategy so far implicitly assumed that agents follow an adaptive
rule to form expectations. On the contrary, positive significant coefficients associated with the leads of

     That is: ∆𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒 𝐶𝑎𝑝itRE = β𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒 𝐶𝑎𝑝it−1
                                         FRF
                                              + θ𝐏𝐎𝐋i,t−1 + α 𝑋𝑖,𝑡−1 + μi + μt + εit .

                                                                  20
FRF capacity would indicate that agents are forward-looking. This would undermine our estimation
strategy and point to reverse causality issues which would be difficult to address in an appropriate way
with the data at hand. It is thus reassuring to observe that the coefficients associated with the leads of
𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒𝐶𝑎𝑝iFRF are never significant, suggesting that our model is well specified.
    Nonetheless, the results presented so far do not fully resolve all the endogeneity concerns regarding
the estimated effect of FRF capacity. Because FRF and RE investments are the outcomes of a joint
decision of power producers, unobservable time varying shocks can affect both types of investments. As
illustrated in the previous Section, system GMM represents the best option to identify the effect at stake,
absent a clear exogenous policy change affecting either FRF or RE capacity. Note that system GMM can
be criticized because, as Roodman (2009) points out, when N is small the method has ‘too many
instruments’ compared with the number of observations. This leads to an overfitting of the endogenous
regressions, which in the second stage will give results nearly identical to those obtained without
instrumenting. To solve this problem, Roodman (2009) proposes to collapse the instrument matrix to
retain only the relevant information and to reduce the number of lags used to build the instruments. This
correction should in theory allow to obtain reliable standard specification tests such as the Hansen’s test of
overidentifying restrictions. In our case, however, given that N is particularly small (26 countries), the p-
value associated with the Hansen’s test is implausibly good. We thus present the Hansen’s test and the
estimated coefficients obtained using a simplified equation, where we replace year effects with a linear
and a quadratic time trend.
    Results of the system-GMM estimates are shown in Table 4, which show the estimates of our
preferred specification with and without biomass (Model 1 and Model 3) and the estimates obtained
replacing year fixed effects with a time trend to obtain plausible values of the Hansen’s test (Model 2 and
Model 4). Three conclusions emerge from this table. First, standard tests validate our specification: the
Hansen’s test does not reject the null hypothesis of instruments’ exogeneity, while the Arellano-Bond tests
always fails to reject the alternative hypothesis of second-order autocorrelation. This latter test is
particularly important for a consistent estimation of the coefficients of interest. Second, the system GMM
results indicate that the combined effect of the lagged terms is close to one and thus is larger than that
presented in Table 3. The combined effect of the lagged terms remains high, but smaller than one when we
add a fourth lag in the dependent variable, as shown in Table A3 of the Appendix. Third, the coefficients
                                                  FRF
associated with our variable of interest 𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒 𝐶𝑎𝑝it−1 are roughly half the size of those presented in Table
3. While this indicates that not addressing the issues of endogeneity leads to an overestimation of the role
of FRF in supporting RE generation, the higher persistency in the series of RE makes it difficult to
compute a reasonable long-term effect in this case.

    To give a clearer interpretation to our results of the feedback of FRF capacity on RE diffusion, we also
study the determinants of FRF diffusion (Table 5). This exercise allows showing to what extent the
decisions regarding FRF investments are affected by RE capacity as well as by other common drivers. Our
main argument is based on the assumption of no effect of RE investments on FRF investments, and on the
further assumption that the drivers of FRF investments are different from the ones of RE investments.
Indeed, Table 5 shows that RE capacity has no effect on FRF capacity, both when using lags and leads of
the dependent variable in our estimation. Similarly, environmental policies have no effect on the change in
FRF capacity, except for the negative effect of emission limits. This highlights the fact that to date
investors in FRF plants seem to have paid little attention both to the installed capacity in RE and to
environmental policies. It also provides some evidence that there is a sort of “asymmetric”
complementarity between RE and FRF investment, where the latter are key support technologies for the
former, but not viceversa.
    Results of the drivers of FRF capacity are also interesting per se, given the importance of these
technologies for decarbonization. Table 5 highlights the fact that the main drivers of FRF are related to the
size of the economy (GDP per capita) and to the growth rate of energy consumption as well as to the rents
associated with fossil fuels. Notice that in this case, we include only one lag to account for the dynamics
of the dependent variable (see Table A1 in the Appendix). Overall, our results indicate that FRF
investments are more volatile than RE investments, and that they respond more to demand shocks than to
policy shocks.
    As a final robustness exercise, we perturb our main specification adding the shares of capacity in
technologies other than FRF on the right hand side of equation (1). While ideally we would like to control
for all other technologies at the same time, this is impossible due to the high collinearity which
characterizes these variables: by definition all shares sum to 1. For this reason, we add the share of another
technologies one at a time to our base specification. Results are presented in Table 6. Models 1 and 2
include the share of capacity in Hydro in the estimation of the share of RE with and without biomass,
respectively. Along the same lines, Models 3 and 4 the share of capacity in coal-burning technologies and
Models 5 and 6 the share of capacity in Base Load Fossil technologies. The perturbations we implement
are motivated by the role that these technologies have in the energy system: Hydro is often used to
compensate fluctuations in demand and supply, while the inclusion of Coal and BLF capacity is meant to
test our assumption that only FRF technologies (which are gas-burning rather than coal-burning)
contribute to increasing the share of RE capacity. Overall, this table confirms previous results: the
inclusion of additional variables does not change the estimates associated with the FRF capacity and
confirms that there is no feed-back effect between variable renewables and capacity in other generation
technologies.

    6. Conclusions
This paper presents an econometric analysis of the determinants of the diffusion of renewables in a sample
of 26 OECD countries over the years 1990-2013, with a specific focus on the role of fast-reacting fossil
technologies. We contribute to the literature with one key result. We show that absent economically viable
storage options, countries where FRF capacity was available were more likely, ceteris paribus, to invest in
renewable energy generation. While short-run effects are low, in the long run the relation between FRF
and RE capacity has been almost a one-to-one increase (i.e. 0.88%). This result holds in a series of
demanding robustness checks, including system-GMM estimators, different definitions of RE capacity and
the inclusion of other technologies besides FRF technology.
    The evidence presented here supports the conclusion that to date FRF technologies have enabled RE
diffusion by providing reliable and dispatchable back-up capacity to hedge against variability of supply.
Our paper calls attention to the fact that renewables and fast-reacting fossil technologies appear as highly
complementary and that they should be jointly installed to meet the goals of cutting emissions and
ensuring a stable supply. In this respect, our analysis complements recent attempts to systematically assess
the grid-level system costs for different technologies. Our long-run estimations of the relation between
FRF and RE point indeed to the high indirect costs of the latter.
    These considerations must be appropriately recognized and internalized in the policy debate to avoid
serious challenges to the security of electricity supply in the coming years. As the share of RE increases,
so will the requirements for increased back-up capacity and serious stresses will be put on the energy
system unless the relationship and the complementarity between FRF and RE technologies are
appropriately acknowledged. Our analysis thus draws attention to the fact that the technical and pecuniary
system costs are of such magnitude that they will have to be acknowledged, and can’t be borne in a diffuse
manner. A particularly thorny issue is linked with the need to take a long-term perspective and to consider
the future need of replacing existing mid-merit/load following capacity as they reach the end of their
lifetime. Indeed, while not paying the external cost of pollution, FRF technologies provide the
unremunerated positive externality of long-term flexible capacity for back-up (OECD 2012). Pricing both
back-up services and greenhouse gas emissions appears as a key priority of a sound energy policy.
    We thus argue that a policy and academic debate centered on the juxtaposition of renewable (clean)
and fossil (dirty) technologies misses this important point, leads to an underestimation of the costs of
renewable energy integration, and does not contribute to stressing the importance of funding and
developing solid alternative options such as cheap storage technologies. Overstating the ability to
substitute fossil generation with renewable energy generation may lead to a poor support of alternative
enabling technologies. Conversely, our analysis suggests the need for a systemic perspective and the


                                                       26
coordination of different types of investments (in storage technologies, RE and FRF) to successfully
pursue sustainable development through the integration of large shares of RE energy in the power system.
    While our results are robust to a series of modifications in the empirical strategy, a fruitful avenue for
future research will be a thorough test of our conclusions based on a convincing external instruments or
exogenous variation in FRF capacity. This will further lower any concerns linked with the possible
endogeneity of the share of FRF capacity.
