                                             ABSTRACT

We estimate the sensitivity of scrap decisions to changes in used car values – the "scrap elasticity"
– and show how it influences used car fleets under policies aimed at reducing gasoline use. Large
scrap elasticities will tend to produce emissions leakage under efficiency standards as the longevity
of used vehicles is increased, a process known as the Gruenspecht effect. To explore the magnitude
of this leakage we assemble a novel dataset of U.S. used vehicle registrations and prices, which we
relate through time via differential effects in gasoline cost: A gasoline price increase or decrease of
$1 alters the number of fuel-efficient vs. fuel-inefficient vehicles scrapped by 18%. These relationships
allow us to provide what we believe are the first estimates of the scrap elasticity itself, which we find
to be about -0.7. When applied in a model of fuel economy standards, the elasticities we estimate
suggest that 13-23% of the expected fuel savings will leak away through the used vehicle market.
This considerably reduces the cost-effectiveness of the standard, rivaling or exceeding the importance
of the often-cited mileage "rebound" effect.

1. Introduction

       Passenger vehicles currently enjoy long lifetimes and are traded on an extensive

used market. We examine the timing of decisions to scrap used cars and the relation

between changes in scrap rates, the gasoline price, and used car resale value. The extent

to which the fuel economy of used cars is elastic – via differential rates of scrap as used

car prices change across the fleet – has important consequences for policies meant to

reduce gasoline use. Despite this, there has been surprisingly little empirical guidance on

the relevant elasticity of used vehicle scrap rates.

       We address three questions: First, what is the effect of gasoline price changes on

scrap rates? Second, what is the elasticity of the scrap rate with respect to used vehicle

prices? And third, how does this scrap elasticity interact with fuel economy policies

aimed to reduce emissions from new vehicles?

       We begin by developing a novel dataset that includes a detailed history of used

vehicle prices and registrations at the make, model, and trim level. We use it to estimate

the responsiveness of used vehicle prices and scrap rates to changes in the gasoline price,

addressing the first question above. Higher retail gasoline prices mean fuel-efficient cars

are scrapped less while the largest, thirstiest cars are scrapped more. Also, the resale

value of fuel-efficient cars rises relative to fuel-inefficient cars. We use this relationship

as the first stage of an instrumental variables estimation of the scrap elasticity with

respect to used vehicle prices. We provide estimates of the magnitude of this elasticity

using a combination of cross-sectional and time series variation. This variation is caused

by differential impacts of gasoline price changes on models of different fuel-economies

as well as the impact of gasoline price changes on the fuel cost of the same vintage of a

                                               2
particular make-model over time. These changes in the used fleet are part of the

mechanism through which changes in gasoline demand are realized when a tax is applied.

       We next model the more complex interaction of the scrap elasticity with fuel

economy policy. Early work by Gruenspecht (1982) highlights the relevance of the

vehicle-scrap margin in this context: When new vehicle prices rise due to tightened fuel

economy regulation, the prices of used vehicles also increase in equilibrium. This gives

used vehicle owners an incentive to postpone the decision to scrap their vehicles, leading

to a larger and potentially less fuel-efficient used vehicle fleet. Goulder et al (2012)

briefly explore the magnitude of this “used car leakage” effect and find that, depending

on the scrap elasticity, it can substantially reduce the effectiveness of fuel economy

standards.

       The magnitude of the effect is tied directly to the scrap elasticity, which we

estimate to be around -0.7. The detail in our data allows us to further decompose this

elasticity according to attributes like age and class of vehicle. Our estimates suggest

important differences between classes, with 10-19 year-old pickup trucks and sedans

having lower scrap elasticities while SUVs and vans tend to be more elastic.

       Our work follows a series of recent papers examining the effects of gasoline

prices on the used car market, a relation we will take advantage of in the first stage of our

instrumental variables approach: Busse, Knittel, and Zettelmeyer (2013), Sallee, West,

and Fan (2010), and Allcott and Wozny (2012) all consider the nexus between gasoline

price changes and changes in used vehicle prices. Precise accounting of the fuel

economies and lifespans of used cars allows these authors to recover novel estimates of

consumer response to gasoline costs. Li, Timmins, and von Haefen (2009) and Knittel



                                              3
and Sandler (2013) examine the response of new and used car fuel economies to changes

in the gasoline price, including estimates of the relation between scrap rates and gasoline

price.

         In contrast, we work to isolate the influence of the used vehicle price itself on

scrap, allowing us to investigate the Gruenspecht effect in the context of fuel economy

standards. Using a simulation model of the U.S. vehicle fleet, the elasticities we estimate

suggest that 13-23% of the expected fuel savings will leak away through the used vehicle

market. This effect is often ignored by policy makers, yet it rivals or exceeds the

importance of the often-cited mileage “rebound” effect.

         The elasticities we present here could further be applied to consider the influence

of a number of other programs, for example vehicle subsidies that target particular

classes, or incentives like scrap bonuses that alter prices and scrap rates in the used

market directly.

         To our knowledge the only prior empirical work looking at the relation between

used vehicle values and the scrap rate consists of two case studies based on policy shocks

(Alberini et al (1998) and Hahn (1995)). The data from these studies is insufficient to

construct price-scrap response curves over a meaningful range and they are confined to

small geographic regions. In contrast, our data span the U.S. and cover the 17 years

between 1993 and 2009. The detailed cross-sectional variation we have available also

allows us to examine differences in scrap responsiveness across vehicle age, class,

manufacturer, and fuel economy rating.




                                               4
         Programs like “cash-for-clunkers”, where new car purchasers receive a subsidy to

have their previous vehicle destroyed, are also related to our question.1 Such policies by

definition influence people considering a new car purchase, who may be very different

from the typical final owners of vehicles. These last owners of cars often repair or

maintain the vehicle personally, and may operate them on a salvage title long after the

typical car consumer would no longer be interested. We are able to capture the decisions

of both groups, examining the entire used fleet using data on vehicle registrations.

         The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the dataset we

assemble. Section 3 explores the relation between gasoline prices, used vehicle prices,

and scrap rates, with Section 4 offering an alternative specification. Section 5 uses these

relationships to provide instrumented estimates of the vehicle scrap elasticity itself.

Finally Section 6 provides an application of our elasticity estimates, simulating the

influence of the scrap elasticity on fuel savings achieved via U.S. fuel economy

standards.




2. Data

         We have assembled a panel of data on used vehicles from two industry sources:

The R.L. Polk company maintains a database of vehicle registrations in the U.S. by

individual vehicle identification number (VIN). The National Automobile Dealer's


1
  Other papers have investigated the effectiveness of the Car Allowance Rebate System (“cash for
clunkers”) program along several dimensions. Busse et al (2012) find that the program increased consumer
welfare and that the scrappage of the old vehicles did not affect prices in the used vehicle market. Mian
and Sufi (2012) provide evidence that cash for clunkers affected the timing of new vehicle purchases, but
did not lead to additional purchases. They find no evidence that the program was effective as a fiscal
stimulus policy: cash for clunkers had no impact on employment, house prices or default rates in cities with
higher exposure.

                                                     5
Association (NADA) combines auction and sale records to produce monthly used vehicle

valuations at the sub-model level.

         Due to the potential for lag in the registration data (available as often as quarterly)

we work only with annual variation. The coarseness of the time series is counterbalanced

by very fine cross-sectional variation, where we can measure prices and registrations for

each 10-digit VIN prefix separately. This allows us to distinguish not only vehicle

models, but also engine, body style (e.g. 4-door or 2-door), and certain optional features

(e.g., horsepower, weight, MSRP) in each observation. Data is aggregate at the level of

the U.S. (we assume the used car market is liquid across states).

         We merge fuel economies, options, and characteristics for each vehicle by VIN

prefix. The NADA data provides a crosswalk from the VIN prefix to model, body-style,

and “trim” (e.g. “LX”, “DX”, etc.) as well as data on some car characteristics. From

there we match the car description to EPA fuel economy ratings back to 1978.

         The most complete and consistently coded data span the period 1999 - 2009 and

we currently focus our analysis on this period.2 In each year we consider vehicles

between 1 and 19 years old, measuring the fraction scrapped as the change in

registrations from the previous year. Our measure of scrap rate is therefore most

precisely described as a change in size of the legally operated U.S. fleet; we do not

distinguish exported or unregistered vehicles from those that are scrapped.3 Equation

(3.3) below makes precise our translation from registration counts to scrap rates.



2
  Note that this period applies to the registration data. Vehicle vintage goes back much further. For
example, we have observations up to 19-year-old vehicles in 1999. The limiting factor is used vehicle
prices, which are available back to model-year 1980.
3
  To the extent that accounting for used vehicle exports is significant (see Davis and Kahn, 2010) we can
integrate explicit data on exports from Ward’s Automotive Fact Books.

                                                     6
        Table 1 displays a summary of vehicle scrap rates and prices through age 19.

Vehicles that are 20 and older represent only 1.6% of the registered fleet and we drop

them due to difficulty obtaining data for the oldest vintages. Overall, we see that vehicle

scrap rates increase gradually with age from 1.6% (for 2-year-old vehicles) to 14.4% (for

19-year-old vehicles). Pickup trucks and SUVs have higher scrap rates when relatively

new (corresponding to higher accident frequency) and lower scrap rates at older ages.

        There is also considerable heterogeneity among manufacturers: Figure 1 displays

scrap profiles by age for a selection of vehicle brands. Scrap rates are relatively similar

over the first few years with considerable heterogeneity emerging at older ages. Luxury

brands tend to have the lowest scrap rates as they age.

        Figure 2 displays scrap rates after dividing all vehicles into quartiles by fuel

economy. The heterogeneity in this dimension is particularly interesting for policy: As

vehicles age the more fuel-efficient vehicles are scrapped faster. Like differences across

brands, heterogeneity in scrap rates appears most strongly in the second decade of the

vehicle’s life. For the oldest vehicles, scrap rates are nearly twice as high in the most

fuel-efficient cars.



3. Equilibrium Effects of Gasoline Price Changes

        We begin with a description of the relation between gasoline prices and valuation

of used vehicles, key to the first stage of our scrap elasticity estimates appearing below.

Following Busse, Knittel, and Zettelmeyer (2013) we first divide vehicles according to

fuel economy quartiles and examine the response to gasoline price changes.



                                              7
         We focus on the relative effect between different quartiles in order to allow

flexible controls for time and vehicle age. Macroeconomic indicators that co-vary with

gasoline prices, for example, could increase or decrease the attractiveness of used cars in

general. This is something we are able to take out by focusing exclusively on

composition: Higher gas prices increase the value of gas sippers and decrease the value of

gas guzzlers. Conversely, this implies that higher gas prices lead to increased scrappage

of gas guzzlers and reduced scrappage of gas sippers. The fuel economy of the used fleet

is therefore not fixed, but has an elasticity with respect to gasoline price. It is the

differential impact of gasoline price changes in our detailed cross-section of vehicles that

provide the key source of variation.

         In addition to examining used vehicle prices in this section we can also describe

the impact of gasoline prices directly on scrap probabilities, suggesting the mechanism

described above. We show how in many cases relatively small changes in gasoline price

correspond to large deviations from normal scrap rates.



3.1 Effect of Gasoline Price on Used Car Prices

         We first report the equilibrium impact of gasoline price on used vehicle prices

following the specification in Busse, Knittel, and Zettelmeyer (2013). Our results match

theirs closely. We must aggregate vehicle vintages due to our coarser time series and

lack of regional variation, but our data has the advantage of measuring the effect on

vehicle prices over a much wider range of ages.4 We employ the following specification

for equilibrium price changes:


4
 Busse et al (2013) observe the set of used cars sold at new car dealerships: This is the “high-end” of the
used market, where vehicles have an average price of $15,000.

                                                      8
         pamt = α am + α at + β1 (gaspricet ⋅ MPGquartilem ) + β 2 zamt + ε amt                     (3.1)


where subscript a is vehicle age in years, m is make and model (e.g. Toyota Camry), and

t is the year of observation. α am are fixed effects for each model-age combination (e.g. a

5-year-old Toyota Camry) and α at are fixed effects for year-age combinations (e.g. all 5-

year-old cars in 2009). The coefficient of interest is β1 , the influence of gasoline price

on vehicle price depending on relative fuel efficiency. Because we cannot control for

vehicle vintage within a given make-model (Busse et al (2013) are able to do this using

regional and monthly variation) we instead introduce additional controls in zamt to

account for model-specific differences in attributes across vintages. zamt includes

horsepower, weight, and the original retail price suggested by the manufacturer (MSRP).5

The estimated coefficients are positive and significant as expected: The prices of used

vehicles in more fuel-efficient MPG quartiles rise relative to prices of the least fuel-

efficient used vehicles. We estimate by least squares and cluster all standard errors at the

make-model-age level.

        The estimation exploits a combination of time series and cross-sectional variation,

using the differential effect of a change in gasoline price across vehicles depending on

their fuel economies. The fixed effects for age by year allow the average price of

vehicles of each age to vary freely over time, and the age-model effects similarly allow

the price of each model to vary flexibly as it ages. The variation that remains is the price




5
 For example, if 2003 Toyota Camrys had increased horsepower or additional features (captured in the
original retail price) we would model an increase in the value of this particular vintage as it aged.

                                                    9
differential between vehicles of varying fuel economies: We estimate the change in price

differential between the least efficient quartile and each of the higher three.

       Table 2 displays the estimates of β1 in specification (3.1). Full regression output

is available from the authors. Average fuel-efficiency in the least efficient quartile is

15.4 MPG as compared with 26.7 MPG in the most efficient quartile. A $1 increase in

the gasoline price would imply a $1,762 increase in used car prices in the most efficient

quartile relative to the least efficient quartile. This compares with $1,945 between the

four quartiles in Busse et al (2013). The somewhat larger result in their data is most

likely the result of a younger age profile (Busse et al include used cars sold by new car

dealers, which tend to be newer than average).

       Our sample allows us to differentiate the price changes across quartiles by age,

looking closely at the interaction between gasoline prices and remaining vehicle

lifetimes. We find that the difference in price effects drops off sharply from about $2,900

among the newest used cars to less than $1,000 among vehicles ten years and older (for a

constant $1 change in gasoline price). Busse et al (2013) argue that the price effects

across quartiles indicate near-full adjustment on the part of consumers, modeling gasoline

cost over the remaining expected life of the vehicles. This corresponds well with our

finding of smaller price effects among older, and therefore closer to retirement, used

vehicles.



3.2 Effect of Gasoline Price on Scrap Rates: Composition

       We now depart from the analysis in Busse et al (2013) and begin our examination

of scrap rates. As shown in Figures 1 and 2, the scrap rate for relatively new vehicles is


                                             10
low and rises slowly through the first five years of age. This is not surprising considering

that these vehicles still retain much of their original value; scrappage for such vehicles is

mostly the result of severe accidents yielding damage to the structure of the vehicle. We

will show that gasoline prices do not affect the scrap rate of this newer set of used cars

very much (in absolute terms) as they imply relatively small percentage changes in

vehicle value. Instead, absolute changes in scrap rates concentrate in much older vehicles

where maintenance and minor accidents yield a more flexible margin for the scrap

decision.

          We repeat the specification in (3.1), now considering scrap rates in place of

prices:

          yamt = α am + α at + β1 (gaspricet ⋅ MPGquartilem ) + β 2 zamt + ε amt          (3.2)


where yamt is the fraction of vehicles of age a and model m that are scrapped between

year t-1 and t. We construct scrap rates by tracking individual vehicle models of each

vintage and mapping the scrap rates as they pass different ages. Age is measured as the

difference between observation year t and vintage year v. Specifically, we define the

scrap rate as:


                   nym(t−1) − nymt
          yamt =                     (t − y) = a                                          (3.3)
                      nym(t−1)


          The numerator is the count of vehicles scrapped (we observe each registration)

and the denominator is the count in the previous year. The overall measure is then the

fraction scrapped from one year to the next.




                                                   11
       The results from specification (3.2) are presented in Table 3. Overall, we find

that when gasoline price increases by $1, vehicles with the best fuel economy experience

a change in their scrap rate that is about 1 percentage point less than vehicles with the

worst fuel economy. In terms of scrap counts, this corresponds to an 11% reduction in

the number of efficient vehicles that are scrapped relative to the least efficient quartile.

       The effects of gasoline price changes on scrap rates are largest for the older subset

of vehicles in the sample: Among cars more than 9 years old scrap rates in the highest

MPG quartile fall by more than 2 percentage points for a $1 increase in the price of

gasoline (relative to cars in the lowest MPG quartile). On a base scrap rate of 12.8%, this

effect amounts to an 18% decline in the count of fuel-efficient vehicles scrapped.




4. Alternative Specifications

       In this section we consider alternative versions of specifications (3.1) and (3.2),

now estimating the impact of gasoline price changes on used vehicles and scrap rates as a

continuous function of each vehicle’s fuel economy. We adopt a specification similar to

Li et al (2009) that allows a precise measure of the “turning points” for our effects. Our

data on prices allows us to adopt their approach not only for scrap rates, but also for used

vehicle prices. Section 5 will relax this structure and return to a more general approach.

       We estimate the following models:


       𝑝!"# = 𝛼!" + 𝛼! ⋅ 𝑡 + 𝛽! 𝐷𝑃𝑀!" + 𝛽! 𝑔𝑎𝑠𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒! + 𝛽! 𝑧!"# + 𝜀!"#                     (4.1)


       𝑦!"# = 𝛼!" + 𝛼! ⋅ 𝑡 + 𝛽! 𝐷𝑃𝑀!" + 𝛽! 𝑔𝑎𝑠𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒! + 𝛽! 𝑧!"# + 𝜀!"#                     (4.2)



                                              12
where dollars per mile, DPMmt, is calculated as gaspricet/MPGm and 𝛼! ⋅ 𝑡 is a linear

time trend that varies by age. Equations (4.1) and (4.2) impose the restriction that

vehicles at the extremes (highest and lowest DPM) will see the largest changes in price

and scrap. Specifically, if β1 > 0 and β2 < 0, there exists a critical MPG-value above

which used vehicle prices increase (or above which scrap rates decrease) when the

gasoline price goes up.

       Table 4 reports the results of specifications (4.1) and (4.2), including estimates for

all vehicles (columns 1 and 3) and a restricted sample of vehicles ten years and older

(columns 2 and 4). The signs of the coefficients on gaspricet and DPMt are opposite in

all four cases, allowing calculation of the desired “turning point” in MPG where the sign

of the response changes. When gasoline price increases vehicles with fuel economies

above the turning point see their prices increase and scrap rates decrease.

       For older vehicles turning points in the price and scrap regressions are similar,

between 22 and 23 MPG. To interpret the estimates in the table consider for example a

vehicle with average MPG (20.0 in our sample): A $1 increase in the gasoline price will

decrease its price by $227 and increase its scrap rate 0.34 percentage points. Vehicles

with a fuel economy of 15 MPG are predicted to respond much more dramatically: A $1

gasoline price increase decreases their value by $786 on average, and increases scrap

rates by 1.56 percentage points. Conversely, high-MPG cars benefit from higher gas

prices: The value of a 40 MPG vehicle increases by $611 following a $1 gasoline price

increase, while the scrap rate decreases by 1.49 percentage points.

       These results are consistent with Tables 2 and 3. The average fuel economy in

quartile 1 is 15.2 MPG, while the average MPG in quartile 4 is 27.2. The estimates in


                                            13
Table 4 predict a price differential of $974 and a scrap rate differential of 2.12 percentage

points. This corresponds closely to the price differential of $952 in Table 2 and the scrap

rate differential of 2.27 percentage points.

         The turning point specification has the nice feature of using continuous variation

in fuel economy, but suffers from the requirement that linear trends be imposed on prices

and scrap rates over time.6 We find that this restriction leads to much less plausible

results for newer vehicles in our sample: Sharp effects of the recession, for example,

cannot be modeled and could explain the asymmetric turning points in price and scrap.

         We therefore move to a more flexible specification for our main elasticity

estimates in Section 5, building a model that combines the best features of the models in

Sections 3 and 4: We will use a continuous measure of fuel economy (as in Section 4)

while maintaining the flexibility of the quartile model in Section 3 that exploits changes

in relative, rather than absolute, prices and fuel economies.




5. Estimating the Scrap Elasticity


          In this section, we estimate the used vehicle price elasticity of the scrap rate7

using an instrumental variables (IV) approach. While the estimates above demonstrate

the reduced form influence of rising gasoline prices on scrap rates (and therefore could

suggest the effect of an increase in the gasoline tax), our goal here is to instead model the

effect of vehicle price changes in the used market. For example, a policy to subsidize

new vehicles of a particular type will reduce demand for used versions of those vehicles,
6
  Flexible controls for year are incompatible with the turning point structure since they permit arbitrary
increases or decreases in all prices and scrap rates together, leaving the turning point undefined.
7
  We will define this elasticity as the percent change in the scrap rate associated with a 1% increase in the
value of a vehicle on the used market.

                                                      14
reducing their value. This in turn creates a change in the scrap rate that we will be able to

measure.

        More generally, fuel economy rules will generate a whole pattern of price shifts

through the used fleet. Our elasticity estimates in this section can be used to model the

effect of these (or other) vehicle price changes. We will show in the next section that

these effects have important implications for the performance of fuel economy standards.



5.1     Econometric Framework

        We estimate the following model using a panel IV estimator, relating the natural

logs of the scrap rate y and the vehicle price p such that γ can be interpreted as the

elasticity:


        ln(yamt ) = γ ln( p̂amt ) + α am + α at + ε amt                                  (5.1)


        where 𝑝!"# denotes the predicted values from a first stage. Notice that the scrap

rate in (5.1) is a transformation of a supply curve (based on existing stocks of each

vehicle), so to identify the elasticity in question we will employ instruments that shift

demand.

        In our main specification we use the differential effect of gasoline price changes

on vehicles with different fuel economies, as well as the effect of gasoline price changes

on the fuel cost of the same vintage of a particular make-model over time, as instruments.

A particularly appealing aspect of using differential changes is that is allows aggregate

changes in scrap rates for individual ages of vehicle to be removed through the temporal




                                                      15
fixed effects in αat. Most complications from the dramatic swings in macroeconomic

variables during our sample period can therefore be absorbed.

       As before, the model in (5.1) also includes a full set of fixed effects for each

model-age of vehicle (e.g. a 5-year-old Toyota Camry receives its own fixed effect for

the scrap rate). The flexible age-year effects will capture patterns like improved

reliability in newer vintages (to the extent they are correlated across different models),

with idiosyncratic differences across models within a vintage appearing in the error.



5.2    Identification Assumptions

       Estimating the scrap elasticity by directly regressing the scrap rate on the used

vehicle price suffers from the usual endogeneity of prices in equilibrium: We are trying to

uncover parameters that control the scrap (i.e. supply) side of the used car market,

meaning we require an instrument that shifts demand. The differential impact of gasoline

prices across used vehicle models is one such instrument; we show that the estimates are

quite similar for an alternative instrument (the current popularity of the same model as a

new car) in Section 5.4 below.

       Sections 3 and 4 show how gasoline prices can predict used vehicle prices, and in

particular how the price effects operate through differential changes in demand for

vehicles with better or worse fuel economies. Our instrument therefore predicts prices

quite strongly, reflected in the high first-stage F-statistics shown alongside the

instrumented elasticity estimates in Table 5.

       The validity of our instrument also depends on an exclusion restriction applying

to the supply (scrappage) side of the model: We require that unobserved factors


                                             16
determining the scrap rate (for example, mechanics' wages, or prices of used vehicle

parts) be uncorrelated with the differential fuel cost changes across vehicle models as

gasoline prices move. Unobserved factors that affect scrap rates of all cars of the same

age similarly are not a problem in our specification: These will appear in the age by year

effects.

           Another way of stating the exclusion restriction is that we need to assume that

gasoline prices affect differential scrappage of efficient and inefficient vehicles only

through their effect on vehicle prices. The recurring decision problem faced by a used

vehicle owner provides a foundation for this argument: In any given year, he faces a

random repair cost shock and must decide whether to repair and keep the vehicle, repair

and sell it at the current market price, or scrap the vehicle. He will choose to scrap it if

and only if the price in the used market falls below the realized repair cost plus any

residual value. If not, he will be better off selling the car to someone else. Thus, the

decision to scrap a car depends on the used vehicle price, repair cost realization, and

scrap value, but generally not on demand-side parameters such as utility from owning and

operating the vehicle and – importantly – not on relative fuel cost versus other models.

           This conclusion does not change if there is heterogeneity in consumer preferences

across vehicles, or if consumers are heterogeneous in their valuation of fuel economy. A

potentially complicating factor is transaction cost, which can make keeping a vehicle

more attractive relative to either scrapping or selling. Under some conditions, the scrap

decision could then depend on prices of other vehicles, which in turn depend on gasoline

cost. We argue that the relevant transaction cost in our setting is likely to be limited: The

final person to face the scrap-or-repair decision for a given vehicle is likely to be a



                                               17
mechanic or someone operating the vehicle on a salvage title. This group generally faces

lower search and information costs than a typical owner, making the scrap-or-repair

margin we have in mind the relevant choice.8

         The error term in (5.1) includes some of the unobservables already mentioned

above: Mechanics’ wages, prices of used vehicles parts, and transaction costs. In

addition it will contain any vintage-specific effects. For example, there may be annual

quality differences in the fleet of new Honda Civics sold. Higher quality vintages are

likely to have lower scrap rates in each year as they age; we find some evidence in

support of this in Section 5.4.9 The estimates of the scrap elasticity are unaffected,

however, suggesting that vintage-based effects are not correlated with variation in

gasoline prices later in the vehicle's life.



5.3      Results

         The first panel of Table 5 presents the elasticity estimates, γ, estimated from

Equation (5.1) by OLS. The elasticity over all vehicles averages -0.58. We expect this

result to be biased toward zero, as it reflects equilibrium outcomes coming from

uncorrelated shocks to both vehicle supply (i.e. determinants of scrap) and demand. The

remaining three panels detail our instrumental variables approach that instead takes

advantage of demand shifts based on relative gasoline cost. These panels correspond to

three different specifications for the first stage of our IV estimator.

  This simple model can be formalized and the derivation is available upon request.
9
  This would create positive autocorrelation in the error. “Harvesting effects,” where removal of many cars
in the previous period suggests the remaining ones are higher quality, act similarly and would lead instead
to negative autocorrelation.

                                                    18
       Since the basic intuition for our instrumenting strategy comes out of the quartile

model in Equation (3.1) we first present results that import these estimates (appearing in

Table 2) directly as the first stage. The elasticity results from this basic specification

appear in the second panel of Table 5, with an overall elasticity estimate of -0.83.

       We next move to a pair of specifications that take advantage of considerably more

variation across vehicles. Rather than lumping all vehicles of the same quartile together

to predict prices, we can add detail at the make-model level. The first stage becomes:


        ln( pamt ) = α am + α at + β m ⋅ DPM mt + ε amt                                      (5.2)


where DPMmt measures the time-varying cost of a mile driven at the vehicle model level.

We prefer this approach to using (3.1) as the first stage since it leverages much more of

the variation in our data, creating more precise first stage estimates and also removing

bias that could result from uneven distribution of cars of different age categories across

quartiles. These results appear in the third panel where the average elasticity is -0.70.

       Finally, we move to our most flexible (and preferred) specification. Now we

instrument not only with relative fuel cost changes at the make-model level, but also

differentiate by vehicle age. Specifically, our preferred first stage is:


        ln( pamt ) = α am + α at + β am ⋅ DPM amt + ε amt                                    (5.3)


       We continue to include all fixed effects as before and now predict price changes

for each make-model and age separately; DPMamt includes all variation at the age-model-

time level. The fourth panel reveals quite similar elasticities to the somewhat more

aggregate instruments used in the third panel.


                                                    19
       Table 5 also explores differences in the elasticity across age categories. Generally

we find fairly similar elasticities across ages, declining somewhat for the very oldest cars.

We estimate the price elasticity of used vehicle scrappage to be about -0.7 for all vehicles

ages grouped together. Our preferred specifications indicate that scrappage of 2-9 year-

old vehicles is slightly more price elastic (-0.9) than scrappage of 10-19 year-old vehicles

(-0.6). This likely reflects high existing scrap rates among the oldest vehicles.



5.4    Heterogeneity and Robustness Checks

        Table 6 decomposes our elasticity estimates by vehicle class again using the

preferred instruments at the make-model-age level. Heterogeneity across classes is fairly

limited with the exception of pickups trucks: Our point estimate is a scrap elasticity of

-0.4 as compared with -0.7 in the full sample. We find somewhat more heterogeneity in

the scrap elasticity for older used vehicles, which are also the most relevant group from a

policy perspective given their high absolute scrap rates. Older pickups exhibit much

more inelastic scrap behavior, while scrappage of small and large sedans is also

somewhat less elastic (-0.5). In contrast, the scrap elasticity for older SUVs and vans is

larger than average (-0.9). Since SUVs and vans are the majority of the light truck fleet

this suggests that the scrappage of old, large vehicles on average tends to respond the

most strongly to changes in used vehicle prices.

       Table 7 explores a variety of subsets of the data and alternative model

assumptions. We find that the elasticity estimates are generally robust, including to

alternative sources of variation in price:




                                             20
Excluding luxury models: Excluding luxury models (about 25% of the make-model

combinations we see, classified on brand and price) has only a small effect on the

estimates. Average prices are of course much lower in this subset, suggesting similar

elasticities across prices within an age category.

Using only increases/decreases in gasoline price: Our point estimate is somewhat

smaller when using only years where gas prices have fallen, though it remains similar and

the difference is not statistically significant.

Log-log instead of semi-log first stage: The results from prediction using the log of

dollars-per-mile in the first stage produce very similar elasticity estimates. The semi-log

form in the main model visually fits the shape of the price data better.

Fraction of each vintage remaining: Here we include the remaining fraction of the

original production for each vintage as a regressor on the right hand side of (5.1). The

coefficient on this new variable is negative, suggesting that quality differences in

vintages are persistent over time. Including this term does not influence our elasticity

estimates, however, suggesting that this sort of variation is orthogonal to the cross-

sectional changes in vehicle prices.

New vehicle popularity as an alternative instrument: Here we use the popularity of the

new version of existing (older) models as an instrument. In years when new Corollas sell

well, for example, demand for used Corollas is also high. This variation is also tied to the

gasoline-price shocks in the main model, but has the advantage of being filtered through

actual demand changes in a different (newer) part of the fleet. It also includes additional

demand shocks not included above, for example negative shocks resulting from recalls.

The point estimates remain similar in magnitude to our central case but, since this



                                                   21
instrument is farther removed from the demand for the used vehicle in question, become

noisier.



6. Application to Fuel Economy Standards: The Gruenspecht Effect

           We now consider the price elasticity of the scrap rate in a simulation model of the

U.S. vehicle fleet. The idea is to estimate the magnitude of the Gruenspecht effect; the

simulations reveal to what extent tighter CAFE standards lead to increased gasoline

consumption from used vehicles. The simulation model is similar in nature to the model

used in Goulder et al (2012). We refer to that paper for details, but outline the model

structure below.


6.1        Model Structure

           We model the following economic agents: New vehicle producers, used vehicle

suppliers, and households. Vehicles differ by manufacturer, age (new to 18 years old),

size (large or small) and type (car or truck).

           Vehicle demand is derived from the utility function of a representative consumer,

who derives utility from the various vehicles and a composite consumption good. The

representative consumer has a nested CES utility function, with nesting the following

nesting order: Vehicles vs. other goods, type, size, age, and manufacturer. At the highest

nest, the consumer chooses the mix between vehicles (v) and other goods (x) while

satisfying its budget constraint:
                                                     1

            v, x
                             (
           max U (v, x ) = α v v ρu + α x x ρu   )
                                                 ρu
                                                                                          (6.1)
subject to
           pv v + px x ≤ M
                                                                                          (6.2)

                                                         22
and non-negativity constraints. M is total income, pv is the implicit rental price of the

composite vehicle (which includes expected depreciation and fuel cost), px is the price of

other goods, ρu is the elasticity of substitution between vehicles and other goods, and αv

and αx are distribution parameters.

         We also model the supply of both new and used vehicles. New vehicle

manufacturers k (7 in total: Ford, GM, Chrysler, Toyota, Honda, Other Asian, European)

engage in Bertrand competition and maximize profits by choosing the prices and fuel-

economies of four vehicle classes (combinations of type t and size s) subject to CAFE

fuel economy standards. The profit maximization problem for manufacturer k is given by:

         max
     { pt ,s , et ,s }
                          ∑ [( p
                         t , s =1,2
                                          t ,s   − ct ,s (et ,s ) ) ⋅ qt ,s ( p, e)]                  (6.3)


subject to the CAFE standards for cars and trucks:


                ∑ q1, s
              s =1,2
                                      ≥ eC                                                            (6.4)
                 ⎛ q1, s      ⎞
             ∑ ⎜⎜             ⎟⎟
           s =1,2 e1, s
                 ⎝             ⎠
               ∑ q2, s
             s =1,2
                                   ≥ eT                                                               (6.5)
                ⎛ q2, s       ⎞
            ∑ ⎜⎜              ⎟⎟
          s =1,2 e2, s
                ⎝              ⎠


where the decision variables pt,s and et,s denote the vehicle prices and fuel economies,

respectively. ct,s refers to the marginal production cost; eC and eT refer to the CAFE

requirements for cars and trucks.

         Used vehicle supply is determined by last period’s supply net of scrapping:


          qt,s,a+1,k (τ +1) = (1− yt,s,a+1,k (τ +1)) qt,s,a,k (τ )                     a = 0,1,…,18   (6.6)


                                                                               23
where τ indexes time, a indicates age (a = 0 refers to new cars) and yt,s,a,k is the end-of-

period scrappage probability. All 18-year-old cars are scrapped at the end of the period.

The scrap probability for each vehicle type and vintage is endogenous and depends on the

vehicle’s resale value. A car will be scrapped when its resale value falls below the repair

costs to keep the vehicle running. Since vehicles of model t,s,a,k actually represent an

aggregate category of similar cars with different quality, condition, and value, we assume

that a fraction of these vehicles will face repair costs that are high enough to scrap the car

(rather than repairing the vehicle). This fraction is inversely related to the vehicle type’s

resale value in working condition and modeled as:


          yt,s,a,k,r = bt,s,a,k,r ( pt,s,a,k,r )γ                                          (6.7)


where bt,s,a,k,r is a scale parameter (determined in a calibration procedure) to actual scrap

rates and γ is the price elasticity of the scrap rate, estimated above in Section 5.

          The used car purchase price pt,s,a,k,r is the sum of scrap-adjusted, discounted future

rental prices rt,s,a,k,r. Used car owners are assumed to exhibit myopia in that they expect

the rental price of their used car next year to be the same as that of a one-year-older used

car this year. Under this assumption, we can recursively solve for used vehicle purchase

prices:

          pt,s,18,k,r = rt,s,18,k,r                                                        (6.8)

                                      (1− yt,s,a,k,r )pt,s,a+1,k,r
          pt,s,a,k,r = rt,s,a,k,r +
                                               1+ δ

where δ is the annual discount rate.




                                                                     24
          The model solves for prices and fuel economies of new vehicles and used car

purchase prices that clear both new and used vehicle markets and are consistent with

firms’ profit-maximizing behavior. These equilibria are calculated for every year in a

sequence of equilibria over the simulation period (2009-2020).

6.2       Data and Parameters

          We calibrate the model to prices and composition (obtained from Automotive

News), and fuel economies (obtained from the EPA) of the 2009 U.S. vehicle fleet, as

well as the 2009 GDP and gasoline price. We assume an income growth rate of two

percent per year, and an autonomous rate of improvement in fuel economy technology of

1.8 percent per year (Knittel, 2011). For all other parameters, we follow Goulder et al

(2012).



6.3       Used Vehicle Leakage Results

          We now estimate the magnitude of emissions leakage to used vehicles as a result

of tightened fuel economy regulation for new vehicles. We consider scrap elasticity

estimates of -0.5 and -0.8, defining a range that includes our preferred estimates both for

older vehicles (an elasticity of -0.6) and the full sample (an elasticity of -0.7).

          Leakage will be expressed as the fraction of expected gasoline savings that are

never realized due to changes in used vehicle scrap rates. We calibrate the model to

consider the recent tightening of federal CAFE standards to a target of 41.7 MPG in 2020

(the policy reaches 54.5 MPG in 2025).10 The reference case to which this is compared

corresponds to a previously announced goal of 35 MPG in 2020. We model the separate

requirements CAFE imposes on passenger cars and light-duty trucks.
10
     EPA (2012).

                                              25
         Figure 3 (a) considers the scrap elasticity of -0.5 and shows the difference in total

gasoline consumption over the period 2009-2020 between the reference and policy cases.

The blue line ignores the impacts of the tightened CAFE standards in the used vehicle

market. The red line accounts for these effects, and reveals smaller reductions in gasoline

consumption. Both lines are downward sloping, indicating that gasoline reductions

accumulate as additional generations of fuel-efficient new vehicles enter the fleet. The

difference between the two lines is the leakage to used vehicle markets, and by 2020

amounts to about 13%: That is, 13% of the gross emissions reductions in the new vehicle

market are offset by increased emissions from used vehicles.

         Figure 3 (b) displays a parallel set of results in a setting where the scrap elasticity

is increased to -0.8, close to the most elastic of our estimates (for all vehicle ages

combined) in Table 5. This larger elasticity increases leakage to used vehicle markets to

23%.11

         While we believe ours is the first empirical estimate of the Gruenspecht effect, it

may be instructive to draw a comparison with the “rebound effect” estimated in a number

of earlier papers. The rebound effect refers to the increased driving as a result of lower

per-mile driving costs under a fuel economy rule. Small and Van Dender (2007) placed

this effect between 4.5% and 22.2% for the period 1966-2001, but only between 2.2%

and 10.7% for 1997-2001.12 Gillingham (2011) leverages a recent and very rich data set

to arrive at a value of about 15%. The 13-23% range we estimate here for the




11
   We find that leakage to used vehicles becomes even greater when the stringency of policy is further
increased. We are currently incorporating these results, as well as simulations exploiting more detail in the
range of elasticity estimates by vehicle class and age.
12
   Using a similar approach, Greene (2010) arrives at a point estimate of about 10% for the rebound effect.

                                                     26
Gruenspecht effect adds to the rebound effect as a source of leakage, rivaling or

exceeding it in magnitude.




7. Conclusions

        We estimate the sensitivity of the decision to scrap used vehicles to changes in the

value of those vehicles on the used market, the scrap elasticity. Our estimates imply that

changes in used vehicle prices lead to significant changes in composition and scrappage

in the used fleet. This has important implications for fuel economy policy: Tightened

standards for new vehicles lead to reduced scrappage for used vehicles. We estimate that

this effect offsets 13-23% of expected gasoline savings. This effect is typically ignored

by policy makers, even though its magnitude rivals or exceeds the often-cited mileage

“rebound” effect.

        Our empirical strategy combines variation in gasoline prices through time with

finely detailed information on used vehicle values and scrap rates. We include fixed

effects on the price and scrap rate for each vehicle model at each age of its life, using

variation from the differential effect of gasoline price on used vehicle values depending

on their fuel economies.

        We find that a $1 increase in gasoline price corresponds to a $1,762 increase in

the price differential between the most and least efficient fuel economy quartiles for all

used vehicles. This is comparable to the findings in Busse et al (2013). We can also

investigate the composition of vehicles scrapped: A $1 increase in gasoline price

corresponds to an 18% decline in the number of old, but efficient, vehicles scrapped

relative to scrap of the least efficient vehicles.


                                               27
       We incorporate these effects on vehicle prices as the first stage of an instrumental

variables approach to estimate the elasticity of scrap rates with respect to the used

vehicle’s value. Our central case estimate is -0.7 with significant heterogeneity across

vehicle ages and classes. Finally, we incorporate a simulation model of the U.S. vehicle

fleet to estimate the effect of a range of scrap elasticities between -0.5 and -0.8.

Throughout this range used car price changes represent an important source of leakage.

       Our findings also suggest an interesting overlap with the literature on local air

pollution: Many of the gross polluters in terms of smog and ozone precursors tend to be

the very oldest vehicles on the road. Our model and estimates of the scrap elasticity

could therefore be extended to draw direct comparisons on local air pollution between

CAFE standards and gasoline taxes

       Our ongoing work looks particularly at the heterogeneity in elasticities across

class and age categories. Greater elasticity in the extremes of the fuel economy

distribution, for example, tends to magnify the leakage effect even further. We also plan

to incorporate vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in our analysis. High gas prices are likely to

lead to a higher utilization of relatively fuel-efficient used vehicles. Other things equal,

this increases their scrap rates. We find that higher gasoline prices lead to a decrease in

the scrap rate of fuel-efficient used cars, but this decrease would have been even stronger

had increased vehicle utilization not offset some of the downward pressure on scrap rates.

Our estimates of the scrap elasticity could therefore be considered conservative. In

ongoing work, we explore ways to introduce estimates of the VMT elasticity (the

“rebound” effect) in our estimation and simulation results.
