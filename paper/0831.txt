           THE ROLES OF MONEY AND CREDIT IN MACROECONOMIC ANALYSIS


                                  Abstract



       This paper considers the implications, for macroeconomic modelling

and for monetary policy, of the interrelationships among money, credit and

nonfinancial economic activity. Data for the United States since World War II

show that the volume of outstanding credit is as closely related to economic

activity as is the stock of money, and moreover that neither money nor credit

is sufficient to account fully for the effect of financial markets in deterinin—

ing real economic activity. Instead' what appears to matter is an interaction

between money and credit. This result is consistent with a macroeconomic

modelling strategy that deals explicitly with both the money market and the

credit market, and with a monetary policy framework based on the joint use

of a money growth target and a credit growth target.

           THE ROLES OF MONEY AND CREDIT IN MACROECONOMIC ANALYSIS


                            Benjamin M. Friedman*

       In thinking about the relationships between nonfinancial economic

activity and quantity measures of what is happening in the financial markets,

most economists and most economic policy makers today focus primarily —    if
not exclusively — on money. At the theoretical level, the implicit assump-

tion underlying most current macroeconomic analysis is that the money stock

is both necessary and sufficient to represent the relevant information con-

tained in financial quantities. Almost every macroeconomic model, no matter

how simplified, includes the money stock among the variables it represents

explicitly, and few such models include any financial quantities other than

money. At the applied policy level, the formulation of monetary policy

in most of the industrialized Western countries takes place in terms of

target rates of monetary growth. The most prominent exception to the perva-

sive emphasis on money in macroeconomic analysis is that the large macro—

econometric models often do include non—money financial quantities, but

even here such variables are usually only peripheral)

       This single-minded devotion to the money stock raises issues that go

beyond mere questions of definition. Any specific monetary aggregate is,

after all, a collection of certain of the public's financial assets.

Although it would strain the meaning of the word "money" to include in it

such items as equity claims and long—term debt instruments, as long as the

focus of analysis is exclusively on the public's assets the question of which

ones to include is, in the end, a matter of definition.2 The more fundamental

issue stems from the underlying reality that any balance sheet has two sides.
                                      —2—




 Except in the trivial sense that the entirety of the public's assets equals the

 entirety of its liabilities plus net worth, the distinction between assets and

 liabilities — between money and credit —   is   not definitional. Merely redefining

ways of adding up the various items on the asset side of the public's balance

 sheet is not sufficient if there is also valuable information contained in the

 liability side.

       What accounts for the current preoccupation with money to the exclu—

siori of other financial quantities? Is there something about money that is

"special" in an a priori sense, or is the reason instead an empirical

presumption that, for reasons unexplained, variations in money somehow

correspond more closely to the variations in the nonfinancial aggregates

which are the primary object of macroeconomic inquiry?

       Apart from government—issued base money, which is usually not the

definition that people have in mind either in economic analysis or in dis-

cussions of monetary policy,3 there is nothing "special" about money in an

a priori sense. In the simplest abstraction of an economy with no privately

issued financial instruments, base money is the only financial asset, and

there are no liabilities. In modern economies, however, most money is not

base money but bank money, and privately issued financial instruments consti-

tute the great majority of all such instruments issued, held and traded.

For given growth in base money (if that is what the relevant authority does

in fact control), the behavior of the banking system and that of the nonbank

public together determine the growth of both bank money and bank credit,

and do so jointly with the determination of nonbank financial assets and

liabilities as well as nonfinancial economic activity. Economic theory

provides no a priori reason at all to expect a role for the nonbank public's

money holdings but not its credit liabilities.

       The reason for emphasizing money in macroeconomic analysis must
                                     —3—




instead be a set of presumptions about the empirical relationships connecting

money and the behavior of key measures of nonfinancial economic activity,

including especially income and prices. Indeed, during the last two decades

a vast literature has developed documenting money—income arid money-price

relationships, in a variety of forms corresponding to variations in the

underlying theoretical framework, and for a large number of different coun-

tries and different time periods.

       Now more recent work has shown that, at least for the United States

during the period since the 1951 Treasury—Federal Reserve Accord, the rela-

tionship between economic activity and the public's outstanding credit

liabilities exhibits the same degree of regularity and stability as does

the relationship between economic activity and the public's holdings of

money balances. Moreover, still incomplete analysis suggests that the

approximately equal regularity of the credit—income and money—income rela-

tionships holds for other countries as well, including Canada, Germany,

Japan and the United Kingdom.4

       The object of this paper is to present the empirical case for a

redirection of emphasis in macroeconomic research, as well as in the formu-

lation of monetary policy, away from the sole focus on money among financial

quantities. The goal is not to show that the money stock contains no infor-

mation that is useful in these two contexts, nor even to suggest that some

non—money quantity dominates the money stock in these contexts and therefore

should replace it as the fulcrum of analysis. The point is simply that

the available empirical evidence does not warrant an exclusive focus on

any one financial quantity. Moreover, if for some reason there is a need

to focus on just one financial quantity, the evidence provides no reason

to conclude that that one should be a monetary aggregate rather than a
                                         —4—




 credit   aggregate.
          Section I reviews the evidence documenting the approximately equal
 regularity and stability of the relationships between money and income and
 between credit and income in the United States. Merely finding empirical

 regularities settles few interesting questions, however. Indeed, it is

 difficult to think of a familiar economic hypothesis that is contradicted

merely by the finding of a close relationship between credit and income.

It could always be the case, of course, that the operative chain of causa-

tion ran from money to income and thence from income to credit, so that

the public's decisions with respect to credit liabilities remained a periph-

eral aspect of economic behavior, one which macroeconomic analysis could

safely ignore in the interest of simplification.

          Section II examines evidence bearing on the interaction among money,

credit and economic activity, drawn from statistical investigations that are

prior to structural economic model building.5 Here too the results provide

no justification for a special emphasis on money to the exclusion of credit

in macroeconomic analysis. At the same time, the results do go beyond

merely indicating parallel roles for money and credit. Especially in the

context of the determination of real income, what apparently matters is

neither money nor credit alone but rather the interrelationship between them.

          Section III goes on to consider what kind of structural economic

model would be consistent with this set of empirical observations. This

line of investigation inevitably leads to the issue of the role of financial

prices (in other words, interest rates), in addition to financial quantities,

in determining nonfinancial economic behavior. Here the evidence indicates

a significant, but still less than complete, connection between the relation-

ship of income to credit documented in Sections I-li and the familiar
                                          —5-.




relationship of income to interest rates documented in a precise way in

other recent work. Because the interest rate is the price of credit in

terms of money, this analysis leads naturally to the idea of a three—market

model — including the markets for goods and services, for money and for

credit — as an appropriate framework for structural analysis.

          Section   IV brings together the major conclusions reached in the
paper and then explores their implications for monetary policy. In the
absence    of evidence supporting a special role for money in macroeconomic

behavior, there is little support for the intermediate target procedure as

currently    implemented with monetary aggregates as the sole intermediate
targets. One alternative, of course, would be to abandon intermediate targets
altogether and focus directly on the ultimate nonfinancial     objectives of

monetary   policy. Alternatively, a two-target framework combining one monetary
aggregate   and one   credit aggregate offers some advantages over   the   current
emphasis   on monetary aggregates alone, in that it would at least facilitate

the formal incorporation into the monetary policy structure of information

from both sides of the public's balance sheet.

I. The Relative Stability of the Money-Income and    Credit-Income   Relationships

         Results based on a variety of methodological approaches consistently

indicate    that the aggregate outstanding indebtedness of all nonfinancial
borrowers   in the United States bears as close and as stable a relationship

to U.S. nonfinancial economic activity as do the more familiar asset ag-

gregates like the money stock (however defined) or the monetary base.6

Moreover, in contrast to the familiar asset aggregates, among which there

appears to be little basis for choice from this perspective, total nonfinan-

cial debt appears to be unique in this regard among major liability aggre-

gates.

         Figure 1 plots data for 1946—80 showing the yearend credit market

indebtedness, as a percentage of fourth—quarter gross national product, for

the aggregate of all U.S. nonfinancial borrowers and for five different

categories of borrowers that together comprise the total.7 These

data are "net" in the sense that they net out financial intermediation.

For example, the data include such items as a household's mortgage

issued to a bank, or a corporation's bonds sold to an insurance company,

but they exclude any liability issued in turn by the bank or the insurance

company in order to finance that lending activity. The data also exclude

debt issued by separate financial subsidiaries of nonfinancial corporations,

as well as by federally sponsored credit agencies and mortgage pools. The

data are "gross," however, in the sense that they include all of an individual

househo]d or firm's outstanding credit market liabilities, not just any

excess of liabilities over either financial or total assets, and also in

the sense that they include one household's borrowing from another or one

firm's borrowing from another.

 the top line in the figure, stands out in stark contrast to the variation

of the individual sector components. The nonfinancial economy's reliance

on debt, scaled in relation to economic activity, has shown almost no trend

and but little variation since World War II.   After falling from 155.6%

of gross national product in 1946 to 126.6% in 1951 and then rising to

143.9% in 1960, the total has remained within a few percentage points of

that level ever since (the 1980 level was 142.9%).8 Otherwise it has exhibited

a slight   cyclicality, typically rising a percentage point or two in reces-

sion years (when gross national product, in the denominator, is weak).

       The individual components of this total, however, have varied in

sharply different directions both secularly and cyclically. In brief, the

secular postwar rise in private debt has largely mirrored a substantial

decline (relative to economic activity) in federal government debt, while

bulges in federal debt issuance during recessions have mostly had their

counterpart in the abatement of private borrowing. Households have almost

continually increased their reliance on debt in relation to their nonfinan-

cial activity throughout this period. Both corporations and unincorporated

businesses have also issued steadily more debt, on a relative basis, except

for temporary retrenchments during recession years. State and local govern-

ments steadily increased their relative debt issuing activity during the l950s

and l960s, but just as steadily reduced it during the 1970s. Except only

for 1975—76 and 1980, the federal government has reduced its debt ratio

in every year since 1953, although this relative shrinkage of the federal

debt has been slower in years when recession has temporarily inflated the bud-

get deficit (and, again, depressed gross national product in the denominator).

groupings, including the "total nonfinancial debt" measure plotted in Figure 1,
and   five   asset groupings   by showing the coefficient of variation (standard
deviation    normalized by mean) for each ratio computed from both annual nd

quarterly U.S. data over the 1953-78 sample period (except for the M3 money

stock, for which data begin only in 1959). In each case the table shows

the coefficient of variation computed from raw data, and also computed from

detrended data.

        As columns (1) and (3) of Table 1 show, the comparison for data

including time trends indicates that total net assets and total nonfinancia1

debt are (in that order) the most stable, while the Ml money stock and the

monetary base (in that order) are the least stable, among the ten aggiegates,

Whether or not a particular relationship exhibits a time trend, however,

has little to do with its "stability" in the usual economic sense. The

corresponding comparison for detrended data, shown in columns (2) and (4,

again indicates that total net assets is the most stable aggregate in rela-

tion to gross national product, with toal debt and total nonfinancial

debt, respectively, a close second and third. The monetary base exhibits

the least stability on a detrended basis, with private nonfinancial liabilities

and the Ml money stock close behind. Orderings based on annual data are

essentially the same as those based on quarterly data.

        Simple ratios of precisely contemporaneous observations may well

fail to capture the relevant concept of "stability" in the relationship

among variables that move over time with some general lead or lag pattern

between them. The remaining columns of Table 1 present the respective

coefficients of determination and standard errors of ten estimated regre—

product to a moving average of the growth of one of the ten financial

          Columns (5) and (6) of Table 1 show the results of estimating equations

of the form (1) using quarterly data for the same 1953-78 sample period

used in comparing the simple ratios. Total net assets performs best in this

test, with a standard error of 0.85% per quarter in "explaining" the historical

growth of gross national product, while bank credit (standard error 0.97%)

performs worst. Total nonfinancial debt is about in the middle. Because

there is evidence of a significant break in most of these regressions at

around 1970, however —probably associated with the Federal Reserve System's

change to a monetary target strategy and/or the elimination of the Regulation Q

interest ceiling from large certificates of deposit, both of which occurred

in 1970      columns (7) and (8) also show the respective results for analogous

regression equations based on data for 1970-78 only.9 For this shorter

period the relative performance of total nonfinancial debt is somewhat

better, equalling that of the Ml money stock.

         In part because of the extent to which regressions of the form (1)

have been discredited by a variety of criticisms, researchers examining

the money—income (or, here, credit—income) relationship have increasingly
                                                     —10-j




 turned to methods that allow for a richer dynamic interaction between money

and income by relating the variation of income not to the entirety of the

variation of money but only to that part of it which cannot already be de-

duced either from the past history of money itself or from the joint past

history of both money and income)° In this context a key indication of

the stability of the relationship to income of any financial aggregate is

the behavior of that relationship following just such an "innovation," or

unanticipated movement, in the aggregate (or in income). A more general

representation of (1) that is consistent with this interpretation (but

that omits the fiscal variable, so as to keep the order of the system small)

is the vector autoregression

       The upper half of Table 2 summarizes simulations of (4), estimated

in the form (1) using quarterly data for nominal gross national product and

three each of the liability and asset aggregates from Table 1, with eight

quarters of lags on each variable in each equation. For convenience the

table reports the response of F/Y rather than the individual responses of

F and Y separately. Each column in the table presents values, for the initial

quarter and then for the final quarter in each of the first five years,

indicating the time path followed by F/y (for the definition of F indicated)

in response to a 1% innovation in F.

       What stands out in these results is the contrast between the time

paths for the three asset aggregate ratios, each of which declines rapidly

albeit irregularly after such an innovation, and those for the three liability

aggregate ratios. The total nonfinancial debt ratio declines rapidly too,

indicating about the same stability in this respect as does any of the asset

aggregates; but both the (narrower) private nonfinancial debt ratio and the

(broader) total debt ratio show pronounced instability, with overshooting

lasting up to three years beyond the initial innovation in F.12

       A further aspect of the tendency in recent research to avoid simple

nominal income regressions of the form (1) has been a reluctance to ignore

the distinction between the real and price components of nominal income

variation. The lower half of Table 2 summarizes simulations that are analo-

gous to those shown in the upper half of the table but based on the moving-

where X is real gross national product and P is the price deflator (both in

natural logarithms). Once again the results show a fairly rapid return

of the F/(X•P) ratio after an innovation in any of the three asset aggre-

gates and also in total nonfinancial debt, but a slower and less stable

return after an innovation in either private nonfinancial debt or total

debt.

          among the various liability measures considered, therefore, these

results suggest that there is indeed something unique about total nonfinan-

cial debt. It is as if the Ml money stock ratio were sharply unstable, but

adding commercial bank time and saving deposits to form the M2 money stock

ratio: yielded stability, and further adding thrift institution deposits

to'form the M3 money stock ratio destroyed that stability — none of which

appears to happen. Hence not only does the total nonfinancial debt ratio

exhibit just as much stability as any of the five asset ratios in these

dynamic tests, it does so uniquely among the various liability aggregates

tested.

          In sum, the evidence provided by a variety of methodologies shows

that at least one aggregate measure of outstanding credit liabilities in the

United States —     total   nonfinancial debt —   consistently   exhibits just as

much stability in relation to U.S. economic activity as do the more familiar

asset aggregates. Indeed, the debt—to—income relationship measured in this

way can appear to be more stable than any particular money-to—income relation-

ship, depending on the specific measure of money and the specific test used.

Regardless of whether the credit—income relationship is "as stable as"

or "more stable than" that for money, however, like the money—income

relationship it is potentially important for understanding economic behavior.

Nevertheless, although the money-income relationship has long been the

focus of attention, the credit-iicome relationship has to date stimulated

little investigation.

II. Money, Credit, Income and Prices

        The mere finding of a regular empirical relationship between the

outstanding debt of nonfinancial borrowers and the economy's nonfinancial

activity is suggestive, but it is not necessarily of direct importance for

either economic model building or economic policy making. For example,

what if the explanation for this observed phenomenon were simply that people

always adjusted their borrowing to stay in line with their incomes, while

their real spending and saving decisions remained predetermined with respect

to their activity in the credit market? The total nonfinancial debt variable

in that case would be interesting from the standpoint of an investigation

of the credit market per se, but there would be little sacrifice to economic

analysis in omitting it from a model primarily intended to deliver insights

into the determination of nonfinancial behavior itself.

        Alternatively, what if the observed stability of the credit-to-income

relationship reflected the outcome of a process in which people took decisions

with   respect to their spending and borrowing behavior jointly? Such a process
could emerge if   spending   and saving decisions were sensitive to the expected
yield   levels that cleared the credit market, for example, or if the credit

market did not clear and people's ability to spend were constrained by their

ability to borrow. In that case a model that failed to account for whatever

joint decision process connected spending behavior and borrowing behavior

would be inadequate, even if understanding the determination of nonfinancial

activity constituted the sole objective of the analysis.

         The same arguments apply, of course, to the role in economic analysis

of money (or other asset aggregates). Nevertheless, although few models of macro—

economic behavior include an explicit representation of the credit market, al-

most all include at least a money demand function and an equilibrium condition
                                       —15—




for the money market, and many go on to treat the supply of money in some

detail as well. Were it not for evidence like that summarized in Section I,

it would perhaps be possible to rationalize this disparity on empirical

grounds — although, even so, the distinction between making money

an integral or a peripheral part of the analysis would again depend

on whether or not the money market played a role in determining nonfinancial

economic activity.

          In light of the evidence summarized above shOwing that there is

little to distinguish the respective stability of the money-incqme and

credit—income relationships on empirical grounds, however, the ration-

alization for including the money market but excluding the credit market in

macroeconomic analysis must hinge on a presumption that money is central to

nonfinancial decisions while credit is not — in other words, that people

jointly determine how much to spend and save and how much money to hold,

but only secondarily determine how much to borrow.

          Is there evidence to support this distinction? Just what constitutes

evidence in this context depends in large part on what it means for two

actions to be jointly determined or, alternatively, for one to be predte,-

mined with respect to another. "Causality" is a concept with a precise

meaning   in logic (indeed, several precise meanings), but there is little
prospect of using time—series evidence to settle directly questions of
economic causality)3 "Exogeneity" is a concept with a precise meaning in
econometrics, and time—series evidence is better suited to bear on questions

of econometric exogeneity. In recent years the literature of this subject

has therefore moved away from asserting that one variable "causes" another

to the alternative formulation that the one "is exogenous with respect to"

the other. Even so, as the development of this literature during the past
                                        —16—




decade has amply shown,   whether   one variable is or is not predetermined with

respect to another, even in the narrower sense of econometric exogeneity,

depends on (among other considerations) what if any third or further variables

the analysis incorporates)4

         Perhaps the best way of formulating the question at hand so as to

convey the actual meaning of the tests developed for such purposes by

Granger [9] and Sims [18] is to ask whether one variable "incrementally

predicts"   or "incrementally explains" another. Because the basis of such
tests consists of regression equations relating one variable to lagged
values   of another, the issue is really whether the lagged variation of the

right-hand-side   variable predicts (in beyond-sample analysis) or explains
(in within—sample analysis) the variation of the left—hand—side variable.
The relevant prediction or explanation is not absolute but incremental,
however,   in that the lagged values of the specific right-hand—side variable

which is the focus of the inquiry are not the equation's only regressors.

Hence the question these tests address is, more accurately, whether the

lagged values of that specific right—hand-side variable make an incremental

contribution to the equation's predictive or explanatory capacity over and

above that already provided at least by lagged values of the left-hand-side

variable itself and perhaps by lagged values of still other variables as

well.

         Put in these terms, one rationale for focusing on the money market but

not the credit market in macroconomic analysis would be a presumption that

money incrementally explains real economic behavior in a way that credit

does not Table 3 summarizes evidence testing this proposition, drawn from

of the trivariate system consisting of real gross national product, the

price deflator and the Ml money stock (hereafter called simply "money").

The lower half of the table presents analogous statistics for the estimation

of the trivariate system consisting of real gross national product, the price

deflator and total nonfinancial debt (hereafter called simply "credit").

Once again all variables are in natural logarithms, and each of the lag

operator polynomials includes eight quarterly values. For each estimated

equation the table shows the coefficient of multiple determination and the

standard error, and, for each lag operator polynomial, the F-statistic for

the test of the null hypothesis that the polynomial's coefficients are all

equal to zero.

       The results presented in Table 3 provide no basis whatever for dis-

tinguishing money from credit along lines that would warrant including the

money market but excluding the credit market in macroeconomic models. The

evidence indicates that neither money nor credit incrementally explains real

income, given the explanatory power already contained in lagged values of

real income and prices. By contrast, both money and credit do incrementally

explain prices, this time given the explanatory power already contained in

lagged values of prices (and of real income, which does not significantly

contribute). Finally, both money and credit are incrementally explained

by real income and by prices, even given the explanatory power of one another

as well as of lagged values of money or credit, respectively.

       Hence the evidence does not support the proposition that money hold-

ings and nonfinancial behavior are jointly determined in some sense in

which credit borrowings and nonfinancial behavior are not, nor does it

support the proposition that money is prior to nonfinancial behavior while

credit is not. Indeed, the results reject at the 1% level the proposition
                                     —18—




 that money is predetermined with respect to either income or prices. By

contrast, a test of the proposition that money is predetermined with respect

to nominal income (that is, that nominal income does not incrementally explain

money), as in Sims [18], would impose on the analysis the constraint that

the respective coefficients of lagged real income and lagged prices must

be identical in the equation explaining money — a constraint that the dat4

decisively reject.15

       Although the finding that real income and prices incrementally explain

both money and credit is not surprising (at least not to this writer),

the apparent absence of any effect of either money or credit on real income

is somewhat surprising. Because prices apparently do incrementally explain

real income (albeit weakly in the second system), while both money and credit

incrementally explain prices, this result is not evidence for any straight-

forward classical neutrality proposition. Even so, it would be surprising

if prices were a sufficient statistic for whatever information financial

quantities conveyed about decisions with respect to real spending, output

and income.

       Table 4 helps to resolve this puzzle by presenting statistics, an4o-

gous to those in Table 3, for the estimation of the four-variable vector

autoregression system including both money and credit in addition to real

gross national product and the price deflator. Apart from the expansion to

include all four variables, the system summarized in Table 4 is identical

to those represented by (5) above.

       The contrast between the results for the four—variable system and he

corresponding results for the two trivariate systems once again illustrates

that whether or not one variable incrementally explains another depends

crucially on the base from which the increment is measured — and not always

 in the direction that a larger information base makes the relevant increment

 harder to detect. Although neither money nor credit incrementally explains

 real income in the absence of the other, both do so in the presence of one

 another. In intuitive terms, what appears to matter for the explanation

 of real income is neither money nor credit but, instead, the interrelation

between the two. Moreover, even in the presence of both money and credit,

prices still also incrementally explain real income. Hence the effect on

income represented by the price variable is at least in part independent of

the effect of financial quantities; prices are not a sufficient statistic for

the relevant information contained in financial quantities, nor do money

and credit even jointly constitute a sufficient statistic for the relevant

information contained in prices.

       The other results presented in Table 4 are less striking but

interesting nonetheless. Although money and credit each incrementally

explain prices in the absence of the other, neither does so in the presence

of the other (and of lagged prices and real income). Hence money and credit

both apparently convey largely the same information about the determination

of prices, and neither contributes significantly beyond what is contained

in the other. Credit does not incrementally explain money, nor does its

presence overturn the result that both real income and prices do. By contrast

money does incrementally explain credit (although only weakly), and in the

presence of money neither real income nor prices any longer do so.

       The results of vector autoregression analysis of real income, prices,

money and credit therefore do not provide any basis for focusing on money

to the exclusion of credit in macroeconomic analysis. From the perspective

of explaining the variation of real income, what appears to be important is

neither money nor credit separately but the relationship between the two. From   te
                                     —20—




perspective of explaining the variation of prices, either one will do, and

the   choice between them is largely arbitrary.16 Finally, the interrelation-

ship between money and credit themselves is apparently not so simple as to

warrant including one and not the other in the analysis. Macroeconomic

analysis should be sufficiently broad to include both the money market

and   the credit market.

 III. The Market for Money and the Market for Credit

          The conclusion that both the money market and the credit market

should play an integral role in macroeconomic analysis immediately recalls

Patinkin's [15] classic statement of the static neoclassical monetary equili—

brium framework. In its full form this model includes four markets —

those for goods and services, labor, money and credit'7 — but by invoking

Walras' Law Patinkin was able to eliminate any one. He chose to eliminate

the labor market and work with the markets for goods and services, money
              17
and credit.

         Figure 2 illustrates the sense in which the markets for money and

credit are both fundamental in Patinkin's model. The object of the analysis

here    is to determine the price level P and interest rate r — in other words,
the two rates of exchange spanning the three markets. An equilibrium in
(r,P)   space is determined by the   joint intersection, as   at point E1, of the

three curves representing the market—clearing (r,P) combinations for the

three markets: Xx for the goods and services market, MM for the money

market and CC for the credit market. A change in the underlying conditions

that shifts any of the three curves must also shift at least one of the others.

For example, if the introduction of checkable money market mutual funds

were to reduce people's demand for "money," and therefore shift the market—

clearing curve for the money market from MM to M'M', the logic of the budget

constraints underlying the model's construction dictates that people would

also either increase their demand for goods and services or decrease their

demand for borrowing, or both. If only the demand for goods and services

changed, the XX curve would shift so as to intersect both M'M' and CC at

point E'. If only the demand for borrowing changed, CC would shift so as to in-

tersect both M'M' and XX at E''. The figure as drawn shows a shift in both

curves to a new equilibrium at E2.

       Two lines are sufficient to determine a point, of course, so that

even in this framework it still is formally possible to eliminate one of

the three markets. What remains impossible, however, is to determine the

effects of a change affecting any one market without, at the very least,

making a potentially refutable assumption about a corresponding change in

at least one other. In the example of the money market mutual fund, shift-

ing MM to M'M' and leaving XX in place, as is analogous to the practice in

the more conventional Hicks-Keynes IS—LM analysis, is equivalent to assuming

a specific shift in CC. Similarly, analyzing an increase in government

spending that shifts XX to XIX' by leaving MM in place is again equivalent

to assuming a specific shift in CC. In either case, behavior in the credit

market may or may not warrant such an assumption. The results presented

in Tables 3 and 4 suggest that, at least from the perspective of the deter-

mination of real income (though not of prices, as in Patinkin's full employ-

ment model), it is not safe to assume that the credit market passively

absorbs the necessary shifts in this way. Changes in the quantity of money

may or may not have implications for real income, depending on what is

happening to the quantity of credit.

       In the context of this three—market representation of economic activity,

the four-variable system summarized in Table 4 uses the quantity of credit

to represent the relevant aspects of behavior in the credit market,

while the remaining three variables represent the quantities in the other

two markets (goods and services and money) and the rate of exchange between

them. To the extent that the objective is simply to include some represen—

tatibn of the credit market, however, the quantity of credit is not the only

logical choice for this purpose. The alternative is either the rate of
                                      —23—




exchange between credit and money in a market with nominal bonds, or the

rate of exchange between credit and   goods in a market with indexed bonds.
       Following Mehra's [13] demonstration that including the interest

rate in the analysis is sufficient to reverse Sims' [18] earlier findings that

money incrementally explains income but not vice versa, Sims [19] has estimated

the analog to the system in Table 4 using the rate of exchange between credit

and money —   that   is, the nominal interest rate — to represent the role

of the credit market. Table 5 summarizes the results of estimating a four—

variable system like Sims', but using the same data and details of estimation

as in the work presented above.19 The results are close to Sims', and they

offer some interesting contrasts to those in Table 4. The interest rate

incrementally explains real income, while prices no longer do, nor does

money.2° In the absence of the credit quantity, however, money once again

incrementally explains prices. Real income again incrementally explains

money, but in the presence of the interest rate prices no longer do. Money

does not incrementally explain the interest rate here, although it does

incrementally explain the credit quantity in Table 4.

       Beyond the simple distinction between using the quantity variable

and using the relative price variable to represent the third market, is

there any relationship between the two systems summarized in Tables 4 and 5?

Figure 3 shows two alternative representations of the credit market in a linear

stochastic model. In each the intersection of the deterministic parts of

the demand and supply curves —       for   borrowers and S0 for lenders, respec-

tively — indicates the expected equilibrium in (r,C) space. In panel (a)

only the demand curve is stochastic, and the resulting deviations of the

interest rate and credit quantity around expected equilibrium (r0,C0) are

perfectly positively correlated. In panel (b) only the supply curve is

stochastic, arid the resulting deviations around (r0,C0) are perfectly negatively

correlated.

         Both credit demand and credit supply are presumably stochastic in

reality, so that the actual correlation will be imperfect. The value of the

correlation coefficient constitutes potentially useful information, however.

First, the correlation's sign will indicate whether the dominant source of

stochastic variation in the credit market comes from the behavior of borrowers

or lenders. Second, and more importantly, the correlation's absolute value

will indicate to what extent a univariate representation of the credit market

— either the interest rate or the credit quantity — is adequate. In the
extreme case in which either credit demand or credit supply is nonstochastic,

so that the correlation is perfect, either variable contains all of the rele-

vant information about stochastic shifts in the credit market. At th other

extreme, if credit demand and credit supply are both about equally stochastic

(in independent ways), the two variables contain two separate sets of infor-

mation, both of which are necessary.

         Table 6 shows the pairwise correlations between the independent innova-

tions associated with the credit quantity in the orthogonalized moving—average

representation solved out from the four—variable vector autoregression

system   summarized in Table 4 and the independent innovations associated with
the interest rate in the analogous representation of the system summarized
in   Table 5. Table 6 shows correlations between the innovations per Se, as

well as between their respective first differences. In addition, because

the ordering assumed in the orthogonalization in general affects the computa-

tion of the innovations corresponding to particular variables, the table

shows correlations for the innovations computed for credit and the interest

rate ordered last in their respective systems (as in Table 2 above) and

 also for these variables ordered first. In each case the interest rate

innovations are lagged one period so that the 4—6 month span of the interest

rate   approximately centers on the corresponding credit quantity observation
 (measured as of the end of the quarter).
         The correlation between the two innovations is positive regardless

of the details of the computation, indicating that credit demand —that

is, the behavior of borrowers — is the dominant source of stochastic varia-

tion in the credit market. None of the correlations approaches unity,

however, confirming that credit supply is also importantly subject to

stochastic variation. Hence it is highly unlikely that either the credit

quantity or the interest rate constitutes, by itself, a sufficient represen-

tation   of the credit market.
         Some representation of the   credit market in   macroeconomic analysis
is   clearly better than none, and the chief contribution of the four—variable
systems presented in Tables 4 and 5 is that each includes one variable
for this purpose: a quantity in the former and a relative price in the
latter. Nevertheless, the evidence presented here suggests not only that
macroeconomic analysis should explicitly incorporate the credit market but

also that it should do so with both a quantity and a relative price variable.

The resulting framework would then be a fully specified three-market model,

including real income, money and credit (the quantities in all three markets)

as well as the price level and the interest rate (the two rates of exchange
                 20
spanning them)

IV. Implications   for Monetary Policy

       The evidence presented in this paper supports three conclusions about

the respective roles of money and credit in macroeconomic analysis:

       First, the relationship between credit and nonfinancial economic

activity is just as regular and stable as is that between money and economic

activity. The evidence does not warrant including the money market but

excluding the credit market on grounds of the closeness, or lack thereof,

of the observed empirical relationships.

       Second, real income and prices are not predetermined with respect to

credit, any more so than they are with respect to money. The evidence does

not warrant excluding either the credit market or the money market on grounds

of being only peripheral to the determination of nonfinancial economic activity.

       Third, the interest rate and the quantity of credit both represent

aspects of behavior in the credit market that matter for nonfinancial

economic activity. The evidence suggests, however, that neither variable

alone is adequate to convey all of the information about the credit market

that is relevant to macroeconomic analysis.

       These conclusions also bear parallel implications for the choice of

framework for conducting monetary policy. The same evidence that rejects

the propositions which, if true, would rationalize a special role for money

over credit in analysis also rejects the corollary propositions which, if true,

would rationalize a special role for money over credit in the design and

execution of monetary policy. Hence this evidence suggests that there is

little basis for the conventional monetary policy procedures currently in

practice in the United States, as well as in most other industrialized Western

economies, which revolve around specific target rates of growth for some

measure(s) of the money stock with minimal attention paid to credit measures.
                                        —27—




         One way to read the evidence developed in this paper is simply as

further support for the case against having any kind of intermediate target

for monetary policy at all. Under the intermediate target procedure, the central

bank first determines for some financial quantity a time path believed to be

consistent with achieving its ultimate objectives for the nonfinancial economy,

and   then   acts as if its objective were to control that quantity so that its

subsequent growth follows the chosen path to within a predetermined range of

tolerance. Hence the intermediate target, which is observable on a timely

basis in the financial markets, stands as a proxy for the ultimate nonfinancial

objectives of monetary policy in a world characterized by uncertainty and

lags of several kinds. In practice, central banks using the intermediate

target procedure have typically chosen a measure of the money stock as the

intermediate target, and the main impetus for the adoption of this procedure

has usually rested at least in part on notions of the special relationship

between money and nonfinancial economic activity.

        In fact, the intermediate target procedure would constitute an optimal

way to conduct monetary policy only under extremely stringent conditions

describing the relationship between the intermediate target and the nonfinancial

objectives of monetary policy.22 Even in the context of a simple macroeconomic

model, for example, the intermediate target procedure based on the money stock

as the intermediate target is optimal only if the demand for money is both

perfectly stable and perfectly insensitive to interest rates.

        In the wake of the widely publicized collapse of previously well

accepted U.S. money demand functions during the l970s, further evidence that

the demand for money does not meet these conditions is hardly necessary.

Even so, the evidence presented in this paper further strengthens the case
                                    —28—




against the intermediate target procedure by indicating the complexity of

the relationship among money, credit and economic activity. Indeed, the

evidence shows that there is no more empirical justification for using money

as the intermediate target than there is for using credit as the intermediate

target. To the extent that arguments for this way of conducting monetary

policy have traditionally rested on the presumption that money plays a special

role, and hence that money should serve as the intermediate target, this

evidence casts further doubt on the appropriateness of the entire intermediate

target procedure.

       Even within the more limited context of the intermediate target

procedure itself, the evidence presented in this paper suggests that at the

very least a two-target framework based on one monetary aggregate target and

one credit aggregate target would be superior to a framework based on monetary

targets only, in the usual sense of delivering a greater likelihood of

achieving outcomes for key nonfinancial variables falling within any given

tolerance around corresponding set objectives.   (The evidence even provides

some ground for believing that a three-target policy, including an interest

rate in addition to money and credit, would be superior still.)

       How would monetary policy function in an explicit two-target money—

and—credit framework? Only with infinitesimal probability, of course, would

the stated target for money and the stated target for credit ever turn out

to be precisely compatible. The diversion between the two aggregates in an

environment of uncertainty would indeed present a problem if the central

bank were to interpret the intermediate target procedure in a strict sense.

If, however, it instead regarded each intermediate target as an "information

variable" which identified a limited set of incoming information to which

there would be a presumption that the central bank would respond as a matter
                                       —29—




 of course, there would be neither analytical nor practical difficulty in having

 two such targets instead of one.2 Indeed, according to the published policy

 records of the Federal Open Market Committee, as well as reports to the Congress

by the Chairman of the Federal Reserve System, monetary policy in the United

 States currently uses just such a two—target framework, but with the Mi—B and

M2 money stocks serving as the two targets.

        The key advantage of an explicit two—target framework based on money

and credit in comparison to a two—target framework based on two separate

definitions of the money stock, however, would be the incorporation of a more

diverse information base in the set of signals that presumptively matter

for monetary policy. Money is, after all, an asset held by the public, and

each monetary aggregate is just a different way of adding up the public's

assets. The conthination of an Mi—B and an M2 target therefore relies solely

on the asset side of the public's balance sheet, although it aggregates those

assets in two separate ways. A framework based on a money target and a credit

target would instead establish a presumption that the central bank would

respond to signals from both sides of the public's balance sheet, and the

evidence presented here indicates that both sides of the balance sheet do

contain information that is relevant to the determination of nonfinancial

economic activity.

       In sum, the evidence presentd in this paper provides no support for

the intermediate target procedure for monetary policy, as currently implemented

with some measure(s) of the money stock used as the only intermediate target(s).

The evidence is instead consistent with either abandoning the intermediate

target procedure altogether and addressing monetary policy directly to its

nonfinancial objectives, or else adopting a two—target monetary policy frame-

work based on both money and credit.

    1. An exception in this regard is the role of the quantity of home mort-
        gage lending in determining residential construction (and hence the
        level of income generally) in the MIT—Penn-SSRC model; see de Leeuw
        and Gramlich [ 41.

 2.      Indeed, one strand of literature seeks to define "money" simply as
         that asset aggregate which bears the closest empirical relationship
         to economic activity.

    3. An exception is the work of Brunner and Meltzer, who have always
        emphasized the role of the monetary base; see, for example, [3 1.

 4.      I refer here to my own current research, which will be the basis of a
         forthcoming paper encompassing all four of these countries, as well
         as to work by Islam [11] on Germany and Japan.

 5. The concept of these analyses' being prior to structural model building
     is in the sense of Zellner and Palm [22] and Sargent [16].      It
                                                                    is not
     to be confused with the proposition that such analyses are a substitute
     for structural model building.

 6. This section draws heavily on my earlier papers [6 ,     7 1; see especially
     [6 ] for the full set of results.

 7. In part because of the capital export controls that were in effect
     during 1964—74, foreign obligors have accounted for only a small fraction
     of borrowing in U.S. markets throughout this period. Including foreign
     borrowers would make    little
                                 difference to the analysis that follows.

 8. With the exception of the depression years and (less so) World War II,
     the stability in fact goes back at least to 1921 when the ratio stood
     at 141.9%; see again [6].

 9. Apart from the equation for M3, which is based on a shorter sample
     period because of limited data availability, the F-statistic for a
     break at 1970 is significant at the 10% level for all of these equations
     and at the 5% level for all but two (total debt and    total
                                                               net assets).

10. Among the most important criticisms of the St. Louis approach have
     been those of Goldfeld and Blinder [8 1, Sargent [171, and Modigliafli
     and Ando [14]. The methodology underlying the tests described below
     is due largely to Granger and Sims; see especially Sims [18].
11. The orthogonalization procedure is

               l1 12    —
                        —   ®11   °l2
               2l 22        °2l   022
                                             A 1

                             1
                  Eit   —               it
                  E2t       —A    1 2t
     for A = cov(j ,p2)/var(p1). This orthogonalization is equivalent to
     placing F las in the pairwise causal ordering of Y and F. The alter-
     native ordering placing F first, which follows from transposing the
     A (or —A) and the zero elements, gives results that are close to those
     reported below; see [6 1.

12. 7nalogous simulations for the M3 money stock, net financial assets
     and non-federal debt all support this contrast. Bank credit also
     appears to be stable, however.

13. See, for example, Tobin [20] and Zeliner [21].

14. The contrast between the results of Sims [18] and the results of Mehra [131
     and Sims [19], discussed below, is a striking example of this phenomenon.

15. The F—statistic for this additional constraint is 2.22, which is
     significant at the 5% level. Moreover, results for the bivariate
     system which does impose this constraint also reject at the 1% level
     (F-statistic 2.89) the proposition that nominal income does not incremen-
     tally explain money.

16. Only at the 1% significance level is it true that money incrementally
     explains prices while credit does not.

17. Patinkin referred to all debt instruments as "bonds" and, for simplicity,
     assumed that they were perpetuities. In reality the instruments included
     in the total nonfinancial debt aggregate span the entire maturity
     spectrum but, at least for the United states, do not include perpetuities.
     What actually matters for the pricing of debt instruments is not stated
     maturity anyway but the duration (see, for example, Hopewell and
     Kaufman [10]) which is always shorter for coupon-bearing instruments,
     especially after allowance for the probability of call (see Bodie and
     Friedman [2]).

18. The choice of the labor market was perhaps appropriate for Patinkin's
     equilibrium analysis, but, as subsequent work (Barro and Grossman [1 :i,
     for example) has shown, the labor market is apparently central to
     disequilibrium analysis.

19. Sims used monthly data, industrial production instead of real gross
     national product, and the wholesale price index instead of the gross
     national product deflator.
20. The finding that the nominal interest rate renders the price variable
     insignificant everywhere except in the price equation is not surprising
      since, with an eight—quarter lag, the F—test for prices is hard to dis—
      tinguish from an F-test for the inflation rate.
21. A forthcoming paper will report my analysis of such a five-variable
      system.
22. See Friedman [5).

      "information variable" concept in the context of intermediate targets
      for monetary policy.
