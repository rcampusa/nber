Forward and Backward Intergenerational Goods: A Theory of Intergenerational Exchange

NBER Working Paper No. 7518

                                               ABSTRACT

        This paper develops a theory of intergenerational exchange for generations that are either selfish
or have non-dynastic altruism. The main building blocks of the theory are forward and backward
intergenerational goods (FIGs and BIGs) and the relationship between them. A FIG is a transfer from
present to future generations, like parental investments in education and the preservation of the environment.
A BIG is a transfer from future to present generations, like pay-as -you-go social security or taking care
of elderly parents. We show that there is a fundamental difference between BIGs and FIGs. BIGs
generating a positive surplus are self-sustainable, but FIGs never are. However, even with selfish
generations, optimalinvestment in future generations can take place if the equilibrium social norm links BIGs
and FIGs. The tools developed here can be used to understand a wide class of intergenerational problems,
from the political economy of environmental treaties to the economics of seniority institutions. Two
applications are developed in the paper: (1) the political economy of intergenerational public expenditures,
and (2) investment in children within the family.
