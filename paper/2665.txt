                     OLIGOPOLY IN SEGMENTED MARKETS


                                 ABSTRACT




     We propose a new solution concept for a game among oligopolists that
                                                      The notivation for
simultaneously compete in several segmented markets.

this solution comes from international      trade, but it also has applications

in other areas.     It is based on a three-stage extension of the two-stage

Kreps-Scheinkman game.     We show that two-way trade is not an equilibrium

outcome and that there exist bounds on possible cross-market priced dif-

ferentials    that are defined by transport   costa.   Prices are the same when

transport    costs are zero.   In fact, in the limiting case of zero transport

costs the equilibrium coincides    with a Cournot equilibrium in a single

integrated market.     In the presence of transport coats there nay exiat

multiple equilibria.

3.      The Model

        Consider two markets, indexed by             i'-l,2.       There is a aingle firm located

in each one of them; firm j            is located in market                        The firma                       in
                                                                          j   .
                                                                                                    compete

three stages.        In the first stage they choose capacities                       x;      in the         second

stage they thoose prices
                                   pJ_(p,p),        where      p    is the price charged by firm

j    in market      i;    and in the third stage they choose sales                        x(xtx),           where

x3   is sales of firm            in market    i.    There exists a                                               cost
                             j                                                    capacity       buildup

                                 stage.                                                                            j,

which does not include capacity              buildup    costs,       is           a3—(p-t3-c3,p3-t3-c3),
where    c   is unit manufacturing coats and
                                                        t      is the unit sales cost in market

i.   The latter may result from transport               costs,       tariffs,                         subsidies,
                                                                                          export

sales taxea, and the like.           The typical case is            t>t,           k#j.     Namely,         it    is

cheaper to sell in ones own market than in the rival's                                    market.      This        is

necessarily the case if there are no taxes and transport coats are                                    higher       to

the rival's market.         In the context of international trade this inequality                                  is

reinforced by the existence of tariffs.                On the other hand,                 export subsidies
can reverse it.          For these reasons we do not impose a priori                        restrictions           on
sales costs.

        The demand function in market           i   is denoted by                 0(p),     where       p         is
the consumer price.       The demand funccions are continuous and                       decreasing.          In

what follows we use the efficient rationing rule (see (P.1) below).                                However,

before we state it formally, we provide it with a rational that is based on an

                                         Assume that in each market there                        exists        a
interesting economic structure.
                                                                         from      the                      and
large number of competitive retailers who buy goods                                       producers

sell them to final users, and who operate with zero coats.                         We assume at             this

                                             can                   resell       commodities         in      the
stage that neither retailers nor final users

other market.     We will show, however, that this assumption is not needed in

most interesting cases.         Since the retailers            operate     with      zero     costs,         the

market clearing price             is    determined        by                             Whenever        the

one of them.     If a producer does not satisfy the placed orders, the orders are

rechanneled to the other producer.             It is easy        to    see      that     this    procedure

produces the efficient rationing rule:                 If a firm, say firm 1, charges a lower

                                           it can supply as much as it                   chooses       up     to

choose to aupply up to          D(p2)-x.    provided this expression is                   non-negative.

When both firms charge the same price, firm                 j    is free to choose sales up                   to

 the limit     max[D(pJ)/2,D(pJ)xk].

It is clear from the          figure that given                             positive      unit profit              levels    its

clear that the quantity response of the firm is one for one to                                  the     expansion

of the rival.           These explanations clarify to some extent                      the     nature     of     the


sales game.            We now proceed to describe its solution.

       Let       X(p,x)          be the set of    (x1,x2)        that constitute       a pure strategy Nash


equilibrium of the sales game.                   This set may contain more               than    one     element.

For this reason it is useful to focus on a particular solution, a focal point,

if   there exists one with particularly appealing properties.                                In our context       it
is   natural to assume that the solution is Pareto optimal                              from    the     point     of

view   of the firma whenever there exists                             a   single       Pareto    optimal        Nash

equilibrium.            We   will    show   that this is        indeed the case.        For this purpose          we

define:



Definition: (x1,x2) is an agreeable    allocation                                 if    (x',x2)€X(p,x) and
gJ.J1J•Jf for j—l,2 and all (x'' ,x2')EX(p,x).

Definition: 1I(p,i)—(r'.x',ir2'x2) is an agreeable payoff of the aalea                                      game

if (x12                                          .                            —

      ,x     )    ia   an agreeabie sales allocation for                  (p,x).




Remark:          It is clear        from    these definitions that        if there exista more           than one

agreeable sales allocation all of them have the same agreeable payoff. Hence,
whenever there exists an agreeable sales allocation,   fl(p,x) is a vector
 function.

        In the second stage the firms take as given capacity                        levels      (that        were

chosen     in the    first   stage)      and choose prices.                   Prices     are     chosen in

anticipation of the       third   stage.        We    are     interested           in   subgame        perfect

equilibria.      Since in the third stsge         there       is    a    unique agreeable               payoff
H(p,x)=[111(p,x),112(p,x)], firm          j    solves in the second stage:

                                   max U(p,x)           j—l,2,
                                    p
and the Nash equilibrium of this price game is                 the       solution to the                second

stage.

        It is known from the work of Kreps            and    Scheinkaan            (1983)      that     in    the

single market case there may not exist an equilibrium in                           pure strategies            to

the price game.      This happens when capacities are in                  some        sense    too      large.

However, since capacities are           chosen in       the    first          stage     they    cannot        be

arbitrary and their level is determined amongst other things by the                               costa       of

their buildup (see Tirole (1987, chap. 5).              In our multiple market setup                       this

issue     is   somewhat   more complicated.           We proceed          by       assuming that             the

parameters of the problem ensure existence of a subgame perfect pure                                  strategy

equilibrium for the three stage game.            Hence, the relevant set                  of    capacities

for the price game is the set of capacities                 which       are    a    component         of     the

overall    equilibrium.      This assumption          avoids        explicit          treatment       of     the

existence issue and enables us           to    concentrate         on   the        characterization           of

equilibria, which is our main concern.

     In the general case there does not exist a                    single   Nash equilibrium              or

focal point to the price game (see the example in Section 5).                           For this reason

For this reason most of the discussion is conducted for given capacity levels,

                                                                  The    first    result,       which is

 this case the retailers are making zero profits.                    In addition, it implies that

 when both firms sell in a market they charge the same price.

         Next we establish that whenever average unit sales costa                        are    higher in

      This proposition has important implicationa.                              Note        that           under     normal

circumstances     a firm's unit sales Costa are higher in a rival's aarket than in

the local market, because tranaport costs are
                                              higher to a rival's market.                                                  The

proposition      implies   that in            these    circumstances              we        will            not     observe

cross-hauling of identical producta.                  This conclusion is, of course, different

from the implication of the accepted formulation                            in which                                          of
                                                                                                  cross-hauling
identical products is an equilibrium phenomenon.                            Another implication is                        that

when both firms are selling positive quantities and both marketa                                             are    served,

each firm is selling a positive quantity in its own market.

      As far as international trade is concerned, it impliea that oligopoliatic

competition in segmented markets per-se cannot explain intra-induatry                                                trade.

In addition, the existence of tariffs,                 which increase unit sales coats                                   of    a

rival, reinforces the inability of the model to predict                                                              trade.

The proof of conditions            (i)    and   (ii) proceeds          in the same way as the proof                     of

        The     proposition       identifies          bounds     on     possible              equilibrium            price

non-negative       (ia.        subsidies to sales in             the    rival's          market        are    not     too

Hence,         cross-market transport costs of                  retailers and other agents are not
lower than       the firms' ,     then   there do not exist arbitrage opportunities across
markets.
        Some observations on this proposition are in order; we

proof in order to save space.                  First, when the inequality in (a)                       is     reversed

(i.e. , average unit           sales costs across markets ace                    lower    than average               unit

sales costs in local markets)              ,   then   there exists a similar inequality                        to     (d)

with an appropriate switch of market indexes.                               Hence,       the    conclusion           that

there do not exist profitable arbitrage
                                        opportunities remains valid.                                          Next, if
market    1   is not active the right hand side
                                                inequality in                             (d)      still      applies,
and if market       2   is not active the left hand aide                        still                        In     these

                                                         and                                 the

                                                                           choice
        This specification focuses on the last two stages of the game: the

 of prices and sales allocation.                  Observe that Proposition 3 implies that there

                                                                                        ia no trade
 are only two possible types of equilibria:                      Type N, in which there




                                                          19
 and every firm sells only in its own                          market;       and Type I        in which there            is

 trade and one firm sells also in the rival's market.                                      First we establish          that
 in both types of equilibria there is no underutilized
                                                       rapacity.



Claim 1.:       Both firms sell all their rapacity.



Proof:        Suppose      to the contrary that, say, firm 1                         sells    less       than    all    its

capacity.       We show that in this case it can increase                               its    equilibrium          profit
level.        First, observe that Propoaition 3 implies that firm 1 sells in                                        market
1.     Consider the following two possibilities:                             (a)    Only firm 1 serves market 1;
(b)    Both firms serve market                   1.       In the former       case     it will be           better     off

reducing price in markot 1 and selling more, because with sales                                           smaller      than

1/2 marginal revenue is positive in market 1.                                 In the latter case both charge

the same price in market                    1,    which is          equal      to     the    consumer      price       (see

Proposition 2)         .   An infinitesimal price reduction by                         firm    1    in    this      market
enables it to increase sales by a finite
                                         amount, thereby raising profits.                                              The
same arguments apply to firm 2 and market 2.                             •


         2:    There exists a Type N equilibrium.



Proof:    We prove existence by construction.                            Let

(i)                —        —   x       for all             and x3   —   0
               x                                      j                       for     ij
(ii)           p   — p — 1          -   x   for all i,j.

We argue that          (ii)     represents                                            and            is    the
                                                      equilibrium        prices               (i)                 unique

agreeable allocation corresponding to these prices.                                   The second         part of the
argument is covered by case 9-H in the appendix.                                    In order to prove the           first

part, observe that there are eight possibilities for a firm, say I, to deviate




                                                               20

from the prices given in (ii), which are

                                                       D                             E

                                               not increase sales in market 2.
Deviation A reduces sales in market 1 and does

                                          is                         (due       to   (3)),     it    reduces      profita.
Since   marginal revenue                          positive

                                                          and                                          do    not     change
Deviations B and C do not change the agreeable allocation
                                                                                         allocation         and     reduces
profits.   Deviation C does not change the                                 agreeable

profits.   Deviations E and H lead to lower unit profits and reduce                                                 profits.


It remains, therefore, to deal with D and                                 F.    We only give the argument for F,

It is straightforward to inspect that (i)-(iii) is an agreeable allocation for

the prices given in (iv)-(v) (see case 9-D in                                  the    appendix).             In order           to

prove that this is an equilibrium it is                                necessary      to       inspect       all      possible

price deviations by firms                     1   and 2 and verify that they do not increase profits

of the deviating firm.                We consider only two interesting deviations,                                    one      for

each firm, in order to save space.                              First, consider the possibility that                         firm

1 reduces price in market 1 and increase                                it   in      market      2,    with the              prica

reduction being equal to the price increase.                                 The change in profits                   per     unit

price change as a result of a small change is given by                                         tO     in     (6).     clearly,

(i)    implies       All-cO     so that this deviation is not profitable.                                  Next,      consider

the possibility that firm 2 increases price in markets 1 and 2.                                              Its change in

revenue takes place along the demand curve                                l-x'-x2,         which       has       a    marginal

revenue (evaluated at the initial point) of                                  l-x'-2.       This       marginal         revenue

is non-negative under (i), and therefore rhis price change does not                                                   increase

profits.     Other price deviations can be similarly analyzed. •

        claims 2-4 show that the capacity interval [0,1/2] can                                        be      divided         into

two subsets,          N—[O,tJ         and         T—(t,l/2],        such that on           N    there exists a               unique

equilibrium in which there is no trade and on                                  T     there exists a continuum                   of

equilibria with the trade volume being anywhere between                                         zero       and       the     right

hand aide of         (i)      in the proof of claim 4 (trade is, however,                                  unidirectional).

In order to compare these equilibria to the equilibria that obtain                                                   under     the

accepted formulation, observe that with                                fixed       identical         capacities            in the

interval     ]0,1/2]            the       accepted           formulation       yields          the    following            unique




                                                                  23

Hence, on    N     both solution concepts               yield the             ssme      equilibrium.             On      T,


however,    the accepted formulation yields                    two-wey         trade       while      our       solution

yields en equilibrium without trade as well as a continuum of equilibria                                               with

one-way trade.       Naturally, due to the symmetry, either firm 1 or firm 2 can be

selling in the rival's market.               In our case            the    volume          of     trade       does not

exceed     (x-t)/4,    while in the accepted formulation it ia                                  (x-t).        Hence,      in

our case the volume of trade is at most a quarter of the volume                                       of        trade     in

the accepted formulation.

     Next, observe that the measure of the set of equilibria at a point on                                                 T

can be represented by the upper bound on                       x1    (or       x2)        As transport costs              t

decline towards zero this measure also                       declines         towards        zero.        Hence,        the

extent of multiplicity of equilibria                    is bounded        by       transport       costs        whenever

they are sufficiently small.                In the limit, when tO,                        Type    N      is     the     only

existing     equilibrium.         For       t—O        Proposition            5    ensures         that       even      when

capacities are not the sane equilibrium prices are the saae in                                        both      markets.

Moreover, Proposition        6    ensures that if we were to endogenire capacity choice,

then for     t—0    the resulting unique equilibrium would have been                                      the     Cournot

outcome in a single integrated market.

     There are two interesting                   points      concerning            Type     T    equilibria            (with

positive transport costs).              First, the firm that sells in both markets charges

a lower price in the rival's market.                      Since it also incurs transport costs                            to

the rival's market, its unit profit differential is even larger than the price

differential.       In the context of international                        trade          this     price        structure

represents       dumping    under       some         definitions.          Observe,          however,           that     the

diversified firm cannot gain from a shift of sales from the rival's market                                                to




                                                          24
its own,     despite   the   unit profit differential.             The    reason is            that       a

comparison of marginal revenues across markets makes this                 shift     unprofitable

on T.      Setond, note that the diversified firm makes higher profits                      than      the

firm that sells only in its own market. This is         seen as           follows.            Let     the

diversified firm reduce price in its own market to the level that                       enables          it

to sell the entire capacity in this market and let it raise price in the other

market.    Then the resulting agreeable allocation enables it to                   sell       all     its

output in its own market at a price that exceeds             the   price      charged         by      the

rival in the rival's market.      Its profits under this allocation, which are the

profits obtained in the corresponding Type N equilibrium, are higher than                             the

rival's but smaller than in the original Type T equilibrium.                  Therefore             in   a

trading equilibrium the exporting firm has higher profits than in                       a     no-trade

equilibrium and the non-exporting     firm has lower profits than in                 a      non-trade

equilibrium.



6.   Conclusions

     The solution to the problem of      oligopolists         that       interact        in    several

segmented markets that has been proposed         in    this    paper         has    a       number       of

appealing features.      First, the structure    of    the    game seems            to      resembles

actual trading practices.       Second, in the resulting equilibrium there                     do     not

exist arbitrage opportunities across markets.          Third,        there     is    no wasteful

two-way trade in identical products.      Fourth, market segmentation is                      possible

only when cross market unit sales        costs   are   positive.             When these             costs

approach zero, the equilibium approaches         the   Cournot        outcome       in a        single

integrated market.

     In deriving these results we have used the efficient rationing rule.                                In

addition, we have provided a new justification for its                use     in terms          of       an




                                           25
institutional structure which sssings a role               to    competitive              retailers.      We

belive that our asin results remain valid for other                    institutional             structures

that produce different rationing rules.             For our purpose these rules need only

ensure the existence of an agreeable allocation and that consumer prices equal

in equilibrium to the prices charged by active firms (Propoairions 1 and 2).

     The proposed framework      can    be    applied       to     a    number        of     conventional

probles.   For example, it is possible to interpret the markers as markets                               for

differentiated products.      In this case unit sales costs can be interpreted                            as

the additional costs that a firm has to bear in order to sdjust m unit of                                the

basic product to the specified variety.             The model can            also    be      extended     to

spatial problems.   Under this interpretation a choice of location in                             physical

or characteristics space involves choosing a               trsdeoff         among         different     unit

sales costs.   It can slso be applied to the analysis of                      trade        structure     and

trade policy when each market is interpreted to be a                   different           country.       In

this case (as well ss in      others)    it    is       possible       to     deal     with      short-run

effects, for which the capacity levels are fixed, and                       long-run       effects      that

take account of capacity adjustments.

     A final application which we plan to explore concerns                          the     formation    of

multinational corporations.     The accepted formulation of the game in segmented

markets assumes that firms can precommit            quantities         to      particular         markets.

This, we have argued, is unreasonable when discussing arms length trade                                 with

production concentrated in a single location.                Under          these    circumstances         a

firm can   precomxsit total    output        (via   a    capacity       buildup)           but    not    its

distribution across markets.      It is, however, possible to think about                          foreign

direct investment as s precommitment to             quantities         st    particular          locations

(although in the third stage, after the choice of prices, it is                            necessary      to

decide how to allocate outputs across markets).                 It might,            for     example,    be




                                              26
more expensive to build two plants, each one in a          different     market,   than     a

single plant with their joint capacity.          Nevertheless, the strategic value        of

these   separate   plants--that     draws   from    the   fact    that   they change      the

conditions of the subsequent stages of the game- -may            make it worthwhile       to

incur the additional costs.       These considerations     can be developed        into     a

strategic theory of multinational corporations.

                                                  APPENDIX




        In what follows we provide a joint proof of Propositions 1 and 2 for                                       the

case     (ic',r2)>O.   The arguments do not             change        much when some                 unit     profit

levels are non positive.             Our proof outlines a way                   for    the        construction     of

equilibria.      In order to prove the second                 proposition             it     is     sufficient      to


prove



Prooosition 2':        Let    (x',x2)        be an agreeable sales               allocation          for      (p,x),

such that     x>O and                   for some       j.     Then there exists a firm k                      which
                              p3<p1

can raise its agreeable payoff by deviating from p".



For the purpose of this proposition it is                      sufficient             to   consider        caaes    in

which a firm's price is below the consumer price, because if it                                      ia    above    it

retailers do not buy from this firm and its sales are zero, thereby                                        violating

the supposition of Proposition 2 that requires positive sales.

        We have already shown that             (P.1)   is a linear             programming          problem    whose

crnstraints are described in Figure 1.                      Recall that when the firm has a higher

unit profit in market 1 it chooses point                      C,    because it desires                to    sell as

much as possible in          the      market    with higher            unit       profits.           The    residual

capacity is sold in the other market (if possible)                         .     If unit profits            are    the

same in both markets it              cares     only about          total        sales,       and is         therefore

indifferent between all points on the line                         segment        .           In     many of       the

situations to be discussed it proves useful to consider a particular market in

isolation.      The next lemma provides conditions under which this                                  is    possible,

and establishes the uniqueness of equilibrium sales in                                 the    isolated        market.

The proof      of the        lemma     is by      construction,            which       helps        to understand

 1Ipi:    If for every         j    (i)    ir<ir;
                                                      or    (ii)   an equilibrium value of x3                   is

known, then

(a)    there exist unique values of sales in market                       i       that   are      part of       the

       equilibrium sales vector; and

(b)    if the solution implies that               x>0      and     p<p,           then as       long    aa     the

       above specified conditions remain valid                     (x1,x2)         are     also equilibrium

       sales when p3         is     replaced      with      p3'—p3+e,         for        6>0      sufficiently

       small.




£ia:      The known limit of firm j's sales                     in market i          is denoted by         y3 and

it is defined by


 i_J
       1x3    -xk            for      x3     known,

                             otherwise.


Hence, if sales in market             k    are known the limit on sales in                     market      i     is

given by residual capacity, and if sales in market                            k      are    not    known       (but

under the conditions of the lemma profit margins are higher in market                                   i)      the

limit on sales in market             i     is given by capacity.          In both cases             each firm

would like to sell as much as possible, up to its sales limit, in                                  market        i.

If one of the firma, say firm 1, has a strictly                       lower        price       in market         i,

then     in     the      third            stage     equilibrium               x1—min[y',D(p')]                 and

                                      (because firm        1,    which has        the    lower     price,      is
x_.min[ymax[oD1(p)-x]]
free to sell in market I                 as much as It wishes under the demand                     constraint).

This proves part       (a)     for the case of unequal prices.

       To prove part     (b)       consider first firm 1.           If its price is lower than                  the

consumer price        x'—y'.       Neither this solution nor the sales of firm 2                         change




                                                      29
when firm 1 slightly raises its price.                       Next, consider firm 2.              If     its       price

is below the consumer price               x"-y'       and    x2-'y2.   This solution does not                change

either when firm 2 slightly raises its price.

       Next, consider the case in which both                       fins    charge       the      same       price       in

market      i,     say    p.     If for one of them, say               fin   1,   y<D.(p)/2                 then in

equilibrium         xLy'       and x2—min[y2,D(p)-y1J.                 If, on     the    other     hand,          the

known limits on sales in market                   i   are larger than half the demand                       for   both

firms, each one supplies half the demand.                          This proves part (a)            for the equal

price case.         To prove part        (b)      note      that       p1-'p2<p     implies           x1=y1       end

x2-'y2.     Clearly, this solution does not change when one of the firms                                    slightly

raises its price.          It is also clear from this proof that the                             equilibrium            in

market       i    corresponds to the efficient rationing rule in a single market (see

Tirole (1987, chap. 5)).             U

          Now, in order to prove the propositions we have to deal with nine                                       cases

that are described in Table Al.                   The columns describe firm                l's     possibilities

of unit          profit   differentials        across        markets,      while        rows     describe         these

possibilities for firm 2.                It is clear from the table that a proof of                           case       9


also covers case 1; a proof of case 2 also covers 4, 6, and 8; and s proof                                              of

3 also covers 7.           In fact, it will become clear from the proof of                              9    that       it

applies to all even cases.               Hence, we proceed to prove cases 3, 5, and 9.

cd 2:      In   this csse both firms              have higher unit                         profits       in marker          l

Hence, we can apply part (a) of the                     lemma          to          establish      unique equilibtiuan

sales levels in market 1.            Using these quantities we can again use part (a) of

the lemma to establish unique sales levels in market 2.                                          These        sales     levels

constitute the unique agreeable sales allocation.                                       This completes the ptoof of

Proposition 1.      In this case part             (b)   of the lemma                    is applicable, which proves


Proposition 2'



Case 2:    Table A2 presents a subdivision of this case on the basis of                                               whoever

charges a lower price in the marker; columns                                  represent          price    advantages        in

marker 1 while rows represent price advantages in                                       market     2.     In all         these

cases firm      j   has a higher unit profit level                              in      marker      j         (the    critical

distinction is that each firm has a higher unit profit level                                             in    a     different

marker).     Ihe resulting nine possibilities are grouped into                                          four categories.

In category A at least one firm has a price advantage                                        (lower      price)        in   the

market in which it prefers to sell (i.e.                         ,   in       which it has a higher unit profit

level).    In 8 every firm has a price advantage in the less                                        preferred          marker.

In C one firm has a price advantage in the less preferred market while                                                   there

is no price difference in the other marker.                                   Finally, in 0 there are no                 price

advantages in either market.                 We now proceed to                       prove    the       propositions        for

(A)   Without loss of generality, consider the case in which fira 1 has a price

advantage in aarket I (the first column).                     Since it also prefers            to        sell       in

market 1, it will use the price advantage to sell there as much                               as        possible.

Hence,   x1—min[x',D(p1)j.           Now consider market 2.                  Firm 2 prefers             to    sell

there, and firm l's sales in market 1 are known.                         Hence, we may apply part (a)

of the lemma to obtain the unique                   equilibrium         sales     in market        2.        Having

obtained these sales we may now coapute the sales of firm 2 in market     1 as

              ,max[O,D (p )-x]J . This proves the first proposition. In order
—minx
to prove the second proposition, consider first market 1, in which firm 1                                          has

a price advantage.         Since in this case             x'—min[x',D(p1)],           then if its            price

is lower than the consumer price                   x'—x'<D(p1) .        In   this case it can           slightly

raise its price and still be able to sell its entire capacity in                               this          market

without affecting other components of the                         agreeable      sales   allocation.               The

result is higher profits.            Next, consider market 2.                   We have used part            (a)    of

the lemma to prove uniqueness of the equilibrium allocation.                              Part (b) can now

be used to prove the second proposition.

(B)     In this case evety fitm has a price advantage in the                                   aarket         with lower

unit ptofits.            Hence, as is clear from (P.1), its sales in the market with the

higher unit profit- -         in   which       it    wants          to   sell    as     much       as      possible- -are

constrained by either its capacity or by residual demand.                                         Therefore          in     the

solution to (P.1) for firm I

Naturally,      the firm wants to sell the residual capacity in market 2,                                            but     it

may face there insufficient demand.                      Hence, in the solution to (P.1)




(A.2)          x     —   mm   [l - x1     ,   0(p1)],


where     x1   is taken from (Al).                  It   is now clear         from (Al) and             (A.2)       that the

firm's best response in each market depends on                              x2    but not on            x2.         We    will

characterire equilibria by considering the best response functions                                              x=R(x2)

and x2—R2(x1)        (the derivation of the best response                        function          for        the    second

firm follows the same steps as the derivation of the                                  best        response          function

for firm 1) . There exist               only    two       types          of response           functions        that       are

implicit in (Al) and (A.2); they are described by reaction curves in the                                                    two

panels of Figure 1A. Type I reaction curve arises when D(p')x1                                                and Type II

arises when          D(p')3'.          The two types coincide when demand equals capacity.

        It is evident from the shapes of                       these      curvea        that      when both              firma'

reaction curves are combined in the same                             figure      they     intersect           only once,

unless one curve is of Type I and the other of Type II.                                      In      the      latter       case

there also exists a single intersection,                             unless      x'+x2—D(p'H-D(p)               .        When

this    condition        is met the reaction             curves          coincide       on     the      upward sloping




                                                               33

of Nash equilibria to the sales game.                    However,       the    closer       an     equilibrium

point is to the origin, the higher the profit level of evety firm (because                                           by

                                                                                                        to
moving towards the origin firms swap sales from lower unit ptofits                                            higher

unit              markets),        Hence,         there      exists     a    unique agreeable                   sales

allocation (point A in the figure)            .    This      completes the          proof    of         the    first


proposition.

        In order to prove the second proposition we first consider                                the        case    in

which                               We    have shown that in this case                   there      exists           a

unique equilibrium of the sales game.                   It is straightforward to                  inspect           that

(i) if both firms sell in s market and one has a lower price                                the     equilibrium

does not change when the lower price firm slightly raises its price; and                                            (ii)


if a firm sells in a market and its price                    is lower       than the consumer                price        a

slight increase in      its       price     does not          change        equilibrium       sales.            Next,

therefore              so   that      the    suppositions             of the        proposition          are        not

the agreeable sales allocation;              this        point    does       not    change        when firm 2

slightly raises its price and therefore profits.



(C)     First consider the market           in which no            firm has          a   price          sdvantsge.

Clearly, if the firm that has a higher unit                       profit       in    this     market           hss        a

capacity level that falls short of half the                       demand,      it    will     sell sll               its




                                                        34
 capacity in     this    markec.     it   is   then    scrsightforward          to     calculate          the

resulting unique equilibrium allocation.              In addition, in these             circumstances

there is no market in which both sell snd one has s
                                                                      price     advantage.
This covers both propositions for this case.

         Next, consider the case in which the firm that has a higher                     unit       profit
in the market with equal prices, say firm             1,   has a capacity level that exceeds

half the demand.        Clearly, it will supply at least half the                demand.        Define,

therefore, its pseudo capacity to be ;1—'-D(p')/2                     and the pseudo demand                in
market 1 to be half the original demand.              Using     these      pseudo      quantities          in

conjunction with the remaining original              data we        can    redefine      the    problem

giving firm 2 as if a price advantage in market                1.   This      brings     us    to        case

(B), and its arguments can now be applied to prove both propositions.



(D)      If there exists a firm with a capacity that is lower than half the demand

in the market in which it has a higher unit profit, apply the                        first     half of
the argument in (C).       If not, apply the argument in the second half of                              (C),

defininp pseudo capacities         for both firms.




Q.aag.   :   In this case a firm cares only about its total sales; their                       division
across markets does not affect profits.               However,      constraints        on     sales       in

particular markets depend on prices.            For     this     reason      it is possE-'          --    to
categorize the relevant sub          cases     on the      basis     of price         advantaa            in

different markets, as       we have done        in     Case    9.     This     classification             is

presented in Table A3.       Instead of discussing each category we demonstrate the

arguments for (F) and (H) only.

(F)    Here one firm baa a price advantage in both markets, say firm                                      1.        Hence,

if aggregate demand D(p1)+D(p')                         falls short of its capacity,                 it        supplies

both markets and firm 2 sells nothing.                            This is the unique equilibrium, and it

does not satisfy the conditions of Proposition 2'                              .   If,   on the other hand, the

above aggregate demand exceeds its capacity, it sells its entire capacity                                                 and

                                                                 Since firm 1      is    indifferent           in    which

proposition.

       To prove the second proposition, observe that aa long as                                     firm       1    has     a

price advantage in both markets and aggregate demand (evaluated at its prices)

exceeds its capacity, it is able to sell the entire capacity.                                       Hence, a alight

                                              is lower than the consumer price
price increase in a market in which its price

does not eliminate its price advantage and raises its                                    profits.      If,          on    the

other hand, aggregate demand is lower or equal to its capacity, it                                          aella         the

demanded quantities and the consumer price in each market                                     is     equal          to    its

neither are they satisfied for firm 2 whose price is higher than the                                               consumer




                                                                 36
price and it baa no sales.




(H)   In this case both firma are   indifferent       towarda      aales       in alternative
markets (they care only about total sales)      and    none       of    them      has     a    price

advantage in either market.   Therefore, if there exists a firm whose                     capacity
is smaller or equal to   [D(p)÷D(p)]/2,        it sells its entire                              and
                                                                                 capacity
the other firm picks up the residual demand up        to    its    own capacity               level.

Since they are indifferent as to which market
                                              they are serving,                   there       exists

typically a continuum of agreeable sales allocations, all               yielding        the     same

agreeable payoff.   If the capacity of every firm is larger than half aggregate

demand each firm supplies half of every     market.        This    is      the    unique        Nash

equilibrium and the agreeable allocation.      As far as the second proposition is

concerned observe that if the firms'   price     in a      market       is     below      the

consumer price, both sell their entire capacity.        Let a      firm slightly               raise

its prices in both markets.   This shifts us to case (F), but it is quite clear

that for sufficiently small price increases it is          able    to    sell      the        entire

capacity after the price increase and thereby increase profits.                   This        proves

the second proposition. •
