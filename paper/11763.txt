                                           ABSTRACT

A test of adverse events and strategic timing theories can be conducted by determining whether some
relevant financial decision variables, such as financial benefit from filing for bankruptcy, or debt
discharged in bankruptcy are endogenous with the bankruptcy decision or not. For the strategic
timing theory such decisions are endogenous, while for the adverse events theory they are not.
Hausman tests for endogeneity show that financial benefit, unsecured debt, and non-exempt assets
are exogenous with the bankruptcy decision, consistent with the adverse events theory.

1. Introduction

Among the several theories put forth to understand the determinants of a household's
decision to file for bankruptcy, two have received particular attention: the adverse events
theory and the strategic timing theory.

The adverse events theory postulates that consumers file for bankruptcy mainly because
they experience adverse events, and financial stresses associated with such events.
Adverse events occur, for example, in the form of a job loss, medical problems, and
particular family issues such as divorce. Financial stresses associated with such events
arise, for example, in the form of income interruption, income reduction, or debt increase.

The strategic timing theory postulates that a rational consumer incorporates in her
decision-making, the bankruptcy option available under law, and its associated costs and
benefits, and making the best use of her economic environment, chooses an optimal time
to file for bankruptcy. In particular, if the best choice includes a strategic, and lawful, use
of debt and the bankruptcy system, then that is reflected in consumer choice.

Both theories are emblems of long-standing debates to derive an optimal bankruptcy law;
one that balances rights of a creditor against misfortune of a debtor, one that protects a
creditor from a dishonest debtor, and one that trades-off losses in bankruptcy against
increases in expected economic growth from greater risk-taking arising from wealth
insurance. In the United States, examples of such debates are found in early conventions
regarding the U.S. Constitution, as can be seen in Warren (1935).

It is important to understand which theory is correct, because each theory is based on
different assumptions on consumer behaviors, and therefore, each theory implies
potentially different policy responses to reduce bankruptcy filings. For example, if
adverse events theory is correct, and if it is determined that bankruptcy filings are too
high, then policies to reduce bankruptcy filings could include, among others, those that
minimize the impact of adverse events, or increase financial literacy for planning for such
events. On the other hand, if strategic timing theory is correct, then policies to reduce
filings could include, among others, those that tighten access to bankruptcy courts, or
make bankruptcy more expensive, perhaps by lowering exemptions, diverting more
debtors to longer repayment plans, lengthening minimum time between repeat filings, or
requiring debt management programs outside of bankruptcy.

In deriving a test of these theories, a simple model for the strategic timing theory is easy
to formulate using a standard economic model of consumer decision-making. A
comparable model for the adverse events theory is not available, and a simple model is
formulated here using a standard economic model and incorporating some basic
ingredients of consumer behavior consistent with the adverse events theory.

Using these models, this paper formulates a simple test of these two competing theories.
Essentially, this test determines whether a consumer’s decision to file for bankruptcy and
her decision regarding some variables relevant for filing (for example, unsecured debt, or



                                               3
financial benefit, or non-exempt assets) are both endogenously determined, or not. For
the strategic timing theory, it is easy to see that these decisions are endogenously and
simultaneously determined. For the adverse events theory, the model here implies that
decisions regarding unsecured debt or financial benefit are exogenous to the filing
decision.

The dataset used here is a combined cross section and time series sample of PSID
households over the period 1984-95; the same dataset is used in Fay, Hurst, and White
(2002). 1 The model specifications are similar to their work as well. In each of two models
of interest, two estimations are conducted – one using least squares specification, and the
other using log-normal specification.2 In all four cases, the results are consistent with
adverse events theory.

The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 discusses the relevant literature. Section 3
formulates simple models of these two theories, and a prediction based on these models.
Section 4 presents test results.


2. Related Literature

There is a long literature that tries to understand household bankruptcy decisions. Early
work is presented in Stanley and Girth (1971), based on a study of bankruptcy cases
closed in 1964.

Results of studies of bankrupt debtors in 1981, in 1991, and their comparison are
provided in Sullivan, Warren, and Westbrook (1989, 2000, 1994), respectively. These
authors relate bankrupt debtors to the population, and conclude that bankruptcy is mainly
due to adverse events. Moreover, Domowitz and Sartain (1999), combining data from
filings in the early 1980s and the Survey of Consumer Finances, present evidence of the
role of credit card debt and adverse events (especially medical debt) in bankruptcy
decisions.

Using comprehensive data aggregated by bankruptcy district, White (1987) provides
evidence of economic incentives in bankruptcy by showing that bankruptcy filings are
positively related to exemption levels. Moreover, using data from the Panel Study of
Income Dynamics, Fay, Hurst, and White (2002) (henceforth denoted FHW) show strong
evidence that financial benefit from bankruptcy affects a household’s decision to file for
bankruptcy. As mentioned in their work, a distinction between adverse events and
strategic timing theories is not clear, but for the most part, direct inclusion of variables
for adverse events (such as health problems, divorce, and length of unemployment) does
not significantly affect the bankruptcy decision. Additional aspects of these incentives are
explored in White (1998), and in Fan and White (2003). Further, using the same dataset

 As mentioned below, additional estimators such as the least absolute deviations (LAD) estimator and the
robust estimator could not be applied successfully to this dataset.


                                                    4
as FHW, Han and Li (2004) study how the bankruptcy decision is jointly determined with
labor supply decision.

Gross and Souleles (2002), using credit card data, provide evidence of growing
bankruptcies over 1995-97, after controlling for changes in risk composition of
borrowers; a finding consistent with their hypothesis of declining social costs or declining
bankruptcy stigma. A related dynamic is reported in FHW, and it is further consistent
with an impact of local legal culture on bankruptcy decisions. Additional empirical
studies are discussed in Sullivan, Warren, and Westbrook (2000). 3

Ausubel (1991) investigates the nature of competition in the credit card industry, sticky
credit card interest rates, and relatively high returns on credit card operations, and
presents some theoretical explanations for such observations. Ausubel (1997) provides
additional information on the counter-cyclical nature of credit card delinquencies and
defaults, and combining this with credit card profitability, considers the dynamic from
high rates to high defaults.

Some theoretical models for default and bankruptcy with competitive and incomplete
markets are considered in Dubey, Geanakoplos, and Shubik (2003), Zame (1993),
Geanakoplos and Zame (1997), Modica, Rustichini, and Tallon (1999), Araujo and
Pascoa (2002), Sabarwal (2003), and Dubey, Geanakoplos, and Shubik (2005), among
others.

3. Two Models and a Prediction

This section develops different models of personal bankruptcy that reflect household
decisions regarding filing for bankruptcy based on (1) the occurrence of adverse events,
or on (2) an endogenous choice of variables relevant for bankruptcy filing (such as debt,
or financial benefit). These models yield a prediction that is testable with observed data.

Adverse Events Theory

In recent years, frequent support for the adverse events theory has been advanced by
Sullivan, Warren, and Westbrook (1989, 1994, 2000), among others. Using data from
bankruptcy filings in 1981 (for Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Texas), and in 1991 (for
Illinois, Pennsylvania, Texas, California, and Tennessee), these authors paint a rich
portrait of consumers in bankruptcy, they present statistics that indicate similarities
between bankrupt debtors and the general population, especially middle-class families,
and they present a variety of cases and statistics to conclude that while some cases of
abuse of bankruptcy law may exist, bankruptcy is predominantly due to adverse events.
As they put it succinctly, 4 “No one plans to go bankrupt.”

these reports is provided in General Accounting Office (1998, 1999).

A scenario of the path to bankruptcy may be as follows: a person (or a couple), with
demographic characteristics usually associated with somewhat stable middle class
families, experiences some adverse events that compel this person to file for bankruptcy.
Such events could include, for example, a job loss, a reduction in number of hours
worked, a change from a higher-paying job to a lower-paying job, a medical condition,
divorce, and so on. In addition to their direct effects on household earnings, such events
have indirect effects on household financial well-being as well. For example, job-related
adverse events can lead to lower levels of health insurance or lower pension plan
contributions; medical conditions and other adverse events can lead to higher levels of
expensive credit card debt; and any adverse event can lead to greater probability of
default on a home mortgage, or on other debt. Against a backdrop of increasing health-
care costs, increasing rates of health uninsurance, a noticeable incidence of job skids 5
and associated losses in fringe benefits, and deepening debt markets via subprime lending
(whether in the form of high loan-to-value mortgages, or credit card debt for borrowers
with greater probability of default, or increasing maturity of automobile loans), the
impact of adverse events on household finances may be large enough for a consumer to
file for bankruptcy.

In terms of formulating a model for this theory, it is useful to keep in mind that a pattern
that emerges consistently in this theory is that there are some events for which consumers
do not plan (even if they may, in principle, be aware of the existence of such events), and
if such an event occurs, then they may be compelled to file for bankruptcy. If such an
event does not occur, consumers do not consider filing for bankruptcy. For a statement
like this to be true in a model of this theory, it is important to answer at least two
questions. First, why don't consumers plan for some events? Second, even if they don't
plan for some events, why do they not include a bankruptcy option in the events for
which they do plan?

Consumers might not plan for some events if they assign an event a subjective probability
of zero. For example, we observe that in surveys of individual mortality, some consumers
list as zero their probability of next-period mortality (Gan, Hurd, and McFadden, 2005).
Such an assignment can arise if the cost of making very fine probability distinctions is
relatively high, or it can arise as a mistake that has a miniscule impact. For example, in
the PSID data, the probability of bankruptcy is 0.003017, as reported in FHW. Moreover,
such an assignment could arise from effectively incomplete markets. For example, there
are limits to coverage for virtually all types of standardized insurance contracts, whether
auto, health, or unemployment, and of course, with some positive probability, an event
could occur where coverage is inadequate. Thus, subjective probability may be zero, but
objective probability may be positive.

It is somewhat harder to justify theoretically why, in events for which consumers
otherwise plan, they do not include a bankruptcy option that is legally, and in principle,

5
  Sullivan, Warren, and Westbrook (2000) present some evidence from the 1992 Worker Displacement
Survey, and the Census Bureau that of the workers who were laid-off during 1990-92, and who had worked
full-time for at least three years before their lay-off, about one-quarter had regained full-time work at the
time of the survey, but were working at a lower wage than earlier.


                                                     6
widely available. One explanation for this is that ex ante, the benefit from a bankruptcy
filing is low relative to costs; for example, as reported in FHW, for families that can gain
from a bankruptcy filing, the mean benefit from filing is $7,813, and the probability of
filing is 0.003017, for an ex-ante filing benefit of about $25. This is less than the cost of a
planning session with a bankruptcy lawyer, or the resources expended to purchase and
plan with a book on how-to-file. Another explanation can be provided in terms of utility
penalties arising from future reputation losses from filing; for example, see Dubey,
Geanakoplos, and Shubik (2005). Such losses can arise from a combination of restricted
future access to debt markets, credit score impact (for severity of credit score impact, see
Musto 2004,) and loss of option to re-file for some period (six years for a Chapter 7
filing). If such losses are very high when consumers file in the absence of adverse events,
and such losses outweigh benefits of filing, then in non-adverse events, consumers may
optimally decide to not consider a bankruptcy option. For example, a bankruptcy flag on
a consumer credit report is one of the worst derogatories on a credit report, and it stays
there for ten years, but the legal system allows a Chapter 7 re-filing after six years.
Consequently, the longer memory of a bankruptcy filing by financial institutions
increases the cost of filing by increasing future costs of accessing debt markets.

Therefore, as a first approximation, we may view adverse events consumers as taking
decisions sequentially; in period 1, they plan for some events, and in such events, they do
not plan to file for bankruptcy, but they do not plan for other events (termed adverse
events). In period 2, if a planned-for event occurs, they consume as planned, and if an
adverse event occurs, they include a bankruptcy option in their decision-making and re-
optimize accordingly. In other words, in period 1, “no one plans to go bankrupt.”

Notably, the explanations given above are based on the currently realized situation, and
may be taken as an approximation that may hold for small changes in the current
situation. Such an approximation may not necessarily hold, if the economic and legal
environment is very different; whether in the same economy under consideration, or in a
different economy. As shown by FHW, the bankruptcy decision is significantly affected
by financial benefit from filing. Therefore, if large changes are considered to a legal or
economic system, or a very different system is considered, additional justification would
be useful before applying this version of adverse events theory.

This simple version of adverse events decision-making is sufficient to derive a test for the
theories under consideration. Consider a standard, two-period decision-making
framework. In the first period, there is one decision node. In the second period, one of
three states of the world prevail; a good state, indexed g, a bad state, indexed b, and a
terrible state, indexed t. Each state corresponds to a decision node, and the probability of
each state is πg, πb, and πt, respectively, with πg + πb + πt = 1.

As usual, a consumer has to decide how much to consume at each node; his consumption
is indexed c0, cg, cb, and ct. Moreover, lending markets are available to him at a one-
period, risk-adjusted, market interest rate r. As usual, a single consumer takes interest
rates as given. His endowment in consumption units at each node is denoted w0, wg, wb,
and wt. (For convenience, suppose w0 = 0, and 0 < wt < wb < wg.) Moreover, he has to



                                              7
decide how much debt to take, subject to some exogenously specified debt limit;
indexed d > 0 . His twice continuously differentiable von Neumann-Morgenstern utility is
denoted u (c ) with u ′ > 0, u ′′ < 0, lim c→0 u ′(c) = ∞, lim c→∞ u (c) = ∞. His expected utility is
U = u (c0 ) + δ [π g u (c g ) + π b u (cb ) + π t u (ct )].

An adverse events consumer takes decisions sequentially. In period 1, he plans for states
g, b, and he plans to remain solvent in these states, but he does not plan for state t. In
period 2, if g or b occurs, he consumes as planned, but if t occurs, he considers the option
to file for bankruptcy. There are some costs of filing for bankruptcy; usually some loss of
assets, court fees, lawyer fees, limited future participation in debt markets, and so on.
Benefits of filing include, among others, discharge of debt, fresh start, and accompanying
wealth insurance. Adapting a simple form of a Chapter 7 filing, 6 it is assumed that a filer
gives up all his assets except any exemptions from forfeiture provided by law, and his
debt is discharged. 7 Exemptions specified under law are summarized by e. For the
clearest distinctions between the two theories, suppose 0 < wt < wb ≤ e < wg . (That is,
exemptions are sufficiently high to have non-negative financial benefit from filing in bad
and terrible states, but not necessarily in a good state.) Consequently, an adverse events
consumer solves the following problem.

                     Stage I : max u ( c 0 ) + δ [π g u ( c g ) + π b u ( c b )]
                                 d ,c0 ,c g ,cb

                     subject      to              c0   =   d
                                                  cg   =   w g − (1 + r ) d
                                                  cb   =   w b − (1 + r ) d
                                                  d    ≤   d
                     Stage II : If            t , then set :
                                                 c t = max( w t − (1 + r ) d , min( w t , e ))

In Stage I, a consumer decides optimal debt and consumption (d, c0, cg, cb), and by
assumption, he does not file in g, b. Given d > 0, and wt < e, in Stage II, if t occurs,
optimal choice is to file and consume ct = wt. The appendix shows existence of a solution
for this problem, and some comparisons with a strategic timing consumer.

Strategic Timing Theory

A strategic timing consumer is a standard rational consumer who includes the bankruptcy
option in her maximization problem. Assumptions regarding decision nodes,

6
  Chapter 7 bankruptcies account for about 70 percent of all bankruptcies.
7
  The other main personal bankruptcy category, Chapter 13 bankruptcy, accounting for about 29 percent of
all cases, can be viewed in this formulation as follows. In this type of filing, a repayment plan proposed by
the debtor is confirmed by the Court, and a discharge of remaining debt is provided on successful
completion of the plan. In this case, net assets saved and debts discharged depend on the repayment plan,
and can be mapped to this model after an appropriate discounting for period of plan. Exemptions provided
under law are the same in both cases.


                                                                8
endowments, utility functions, and expected utility are the same as in the previous case.
Moreover, it is assumed that the bankruptcy process is the same as in the previous case.
Of course, the difference is in the optimization problem. In each state in the second
period, a strategic timing consumer has an option to file for bankruptcy, and solves the
following problem.

                         max                    u ( c0 ) + δ [π g u ( c g ) + π b u ( cb ) + π t u ( ct )]
               d , c 0 , cg , cb , File , Not

               subject                to             c0     =     d
                                                     cg      =    max( w g − (1 + r ) d , min( w g , e ))
                                                     cb     =     max( wb − (1 + r ) d , min( wb , e ))
                                                     ct     =     max( wt − (1 + r ) d , min( wt , e ))
                                                     d       ≤    d

The maximum operator for decision nodes in the second period corresponds to the
bankruptcy decision. For example, if a consumer decides not to file in g, her constraint is
wg - (1+r)d, and if she decides to file, her constraint is min(wg,e), where, as before, e
captures exemptions permitted in bankruptcy. Recall that 0 < wt < wb ≤ e < wg , as before.

In this case, it is easy to see that a strategic timing consumer files in b and t, and
therefore, more frequently than an adverse event consumer. Moreover, depending on the
economic environment, a strategic timing consumer might or might not file in g, but an
adverse events consumer does not file in g. The appendix characterizes the solution for
this problem, and provides comparisons with an adverse events consumer.

A Prediction

One clear distinction between the strategic timing and adverse events theory is that for
strategic timing consumers, the bankruptcy decision and the debt decision (and
consequently, financial benefit) are jointly determined, whereas for adverse events
consumers, the debt decision (and consequently, financial benefit) is exogenous to the
filing decision.

Notice that the test here is, in principle, independent from conclusions in FHW. The
insignificance of coefficients on variables for adverse events can be viewed as negating a
strong version of the adverse events theory; that is, there is little evidence that ceteris
paribus, (in particular after controlling for financial benefit,) consumers file for
bankruptcy on the occurrence of an adverse event, such as a medical problem, or
unemployment, or divorce. Of course, as described in Sullivan, Warren, and Westbrook
(2000), another channel for the operation of adverse events is through their impact on
consumer debt and consumer wealth, (and consequently, on financial benefit from
bankruptcy,) and on earned income, (and consequently, on repayment ability.) In
particular, an increase in financial benefit could arise from an occurrence of adverse
events or from strategic timing. For example, financial benefit increases when unsecured
debt increases, whether due to an adverse event, such as unemployment, or due to a


                                                                         9
strategic increase in credit card debt before filing for bankruptcy. Therefore, it is possible
that increased financial benefit could increase the probability of filing based on
occurrence of adverse events. Nevertheless, a distinction between these two theories can
be derived by investigating whether financial benefit is endogenous to the bankruptcy
decision or not.


4. Data and Results

The dataset used here is a combined cross section and time series sample of PSID
households over the period 1984-95; the same dataset is used in FHW. We consider three
specifications, close to FHW as well, as follows:
                    Pr(file) = Φ ( Xβ + γ 1 fb )                          (1)
                    Pr (file) = Φ( Xβ + γ 2 d + γ 3ne)                    (2)
                    Pr (file ) = Φ ( Xβ + γ 4 d + ηAE )                   (3)

In all three specifications, the independent variable, file or not, indicates whether a
household files for bankruptcy or not. The variable fb is financial benefit from filing, and
is defined as fb = max(d − ne,0), where d is debt discharged in bankruptcy, and ne is
non-exempt assets given up in bankruptcy, defined as ne = max( w − e,0), where w is
wealth, and e measures exemptions. The vector AE represents adverse events, and
includes a dummy for divorce, length of unemployment in weeks, and a dummy for
health problems. The explicit assumption here is that adverse events are exogenous to the
bankruptcy decisions. In other words, people do not intentionally experience these
adverse events for the purpose of filing for bankruptcy. The variable X is a vector of
control variables, including demographic variables, a proxy for local trends, a proxy for
legal fees for filing, and state-level variables. 8

The key coefficients are γ1, γ2, γ3, γ4, and η. An interpretation in FHW is that a positive γ1
and γ4, a positive γ2, and a negative γ3 are consistent with strategic behavior, and positive
coefficients η are consistent with adverse events behavior. As mentioned above, the test
here is different, because it allows for an impact of adverse events on debt, on wealth,
and on financial benefit, and consequently, on probability of filing via the γ coefficients.
Therefore, the interpretation here is that although directional results for the γ coefficients
may possibly be consistent with either theory, a distinction still emerges from the
endogeneity or exogeneity of variables such as financial benefit, non-exempt assets, and
debt.


8
  Demographic variables include age and squared age of head of household, years of education of head,
family size, a dummy for household owning home, and a dummy for household owning a business. The
proxy for local legal trends is the one-year-lagged aggregate bankruptcy rate in the household's bankruptcy
district. The (inverse) proxy of legal fees is the per capita number of lawyers. A higher number of per
capita lawyers indicate more competitions and hence lower legal fees. State-level variables include growth
of average income in household’s state, county level unemployment rate, and standard deviation of income
per capita in the state. These variables are used in FHW as well.


                                                    10
Let the null hypothesis be the adverse events theory. In particular, for the specification in
(1), the null hypothesis is H0: fb is exogenous. For the specification in (2), the null
hypothesis is H0: d and ne are exogenous. The specification in (3) is no longer
appropriate for our test since the vector AE now serves as exogenous variables for the
Hausman endogeneity test, and can no longer enter directly as factors to explain
bankruptcy decisions.

The Hausman test is a two-stage process. At the first stage, we estimate fb, or d and ne
using the set of exogenous variables AE and additional controls Z. The predicted values
of fb, or d and ne are then used in the second stage to predict a household’s decision to
file for bankruptcy. Since fb is a function of d and ne, while ne is a function of w and
exogenous exemption value e, 9 we need only to estimate d and w in the first stage. The
predicted values of fb and ne can be calculated using the predicted d and w from the first
stage.

As a benchmark, consider first a least square estimator of wealth and debt, as follows:

                            w = Xδ w + μw AE + ε w
                                                       ,                          (4)
                           d = Xδ d + μd AE + ε d

where X is the vector of control variables. First stage regression results for both w and d
are reported in the “Least Square” panel in Table 1.

Consider next an estimator that assumes both w and d are log-normally distributed.
Wealth and income are often considered to be log-normally distributed (see, for example,
Crow and Shimizu, 1988). A nonparametric density of d reveals that d also has a
distribution that is close to log-normal. However, a log-normal density requires all
observations are positive. Since 7.56 percent of observations of w are negative, and an
additional 7.01 percent of observations of w are zero, it is necessary to make a
transformation of w. We assign a wealth of $1 to those households with negative or zero
wealth. The negative value of w is included as part of debt. We then assign a debt of $1 to
those households with zero debt. The new debt, denoted as d1, now includes the negative
part of wealth with minimum level of debt of $1. Similarly, the new wealth, denoted as
w1, is now all positive, with minimum level of wealth of $1. Therefore, equation (4)
becomes:

                  log( w1 ) = Xδ w + θ11w < 0 + θ 21w =1 + μ w AE + ε w
                                                                          ,                (5)
                  log(d1 ) = Xδ d + λ11w < 0 + λ21d 1 =1 + μd AE + ε d

  Historically, exemption levels were affected by political constituencies; in states with large farmlands and
farming communities, higher exemption levels can be observed. This is reflected in a special procedure,
Chapter 12, for family farmer bankruptcies as well. However, data available from 1986 to present show that
annually, Chapter 12 bankruptcies are a miniscule proportion (less than 0.01 percent) of total bankruptcies.
As mentioned above, this paper focuses more on consumer bankruptcies, in which case, exemptions are
reasonably assumed to be exogenous.


                                                     11
where εw and εd have normal distributions. It is expected that w and d may be correlated.
The raw correlation coefficients between the w and d, between w1 and d1, and between
log(w1) and log(d1) are .0842, .0644, and -.0577, respectively. Therefore, the error terms
εw and εd are allowed to be correlated.

In principle, negative wealth can affect a household decision differently from unsecured
debt. Negative wealth comes from negative net worth of real estate, farms/businesses,
and vehicles. Loans on these are usually secured by the assets themselves. In the case of
default, (or bankruptcy,) these assets are repossessed by creditors, (or sold by the trustee
of the estate,) likely making it costlier for the debtor to provide a good substitute for such
an asset. But unsecured debt does not carry this additional loss of an asset. Unsecured
household debt includes credit card charges, student loans, medical, or legal bills, or
loans from relatives. To distinguish between these two types of debts, dummies are
included in the wealth equation to indicate if a household’s wealth was originally
negative, or zero. Similarly, dummies are included in the debt equation to indicate if a
household’s debt includes negative wealth, and if a household’s debt is zero. Finally, the
log of household income for last period is used, instead of the level itself, to minimize the
effect of income outliers. Households with zero income are assigned an income of $1. A
dummy for zero income is included in the model. Maximum likelihood is used to jointly
estimate equations (5). The second panel in Table 1, denoted as “log-normal”, illustrates
estimation results.

In stage 1, adverse events are represented by four variables – a dummy for divorce,
period of unemployment in weeks, squared period of unemployment, and a dummy for
health problems. These four variables enter the first stage regression only. As shown in
Table 1, for the least square estimator, the coefficients for adverse events are not
significantly estimated. For the lognormal estimator, in the debt equation, the coefficients
for adverse events are not statistically significant, but in the wealth equation, both divorce
and health problem would significantly reduce a household’s wealth. Divorce would
reduce a household’s wealth by 14.4%, while the health problem would reduce a
household’s wealth by 23.3%.

For both estimators, the coefficients for many control variables are significantly
estimated. In some cases, both estimators yield similar results. For example, a household
with a higher labor income has more wealth and more debt, while a household with a
larger income reduction at the last period has lower wealth and lower debt. More years of
education of head of the household increases both wealth and debt, while a larger
household has less wealth but more debt. A household who owns business has higher
wealth and higher debt. In other cases, the two estimators may yield different results. For
example, owning a house appears to have no impact on a household’s unsecured debt, if
the least square estimator is used, but a household’s debt increases by 8.1%, if the
lognormal estimator is used. The difference between the two estimators may come from
the different specifications in independent variables, and the different assumptions in
error distributions.




                                             12
For the log-normal estimation, the dummy for negative wealth is statistically significantly
estimated, indicating that the unsecured portion of secured debt (negative wealth) is
indeed different from unsecured debt. The dummies for zero wealth or debts are also
significantly estimated, indicating that zeros may be systematically different from non-
zeros. The dummy for zero labor income is statistically significant, indicating that non-
labor income may differ systematically from those households with labor income and
those households without labor income. Finally, the correlation coefficient between the
log of wealth and the log of debt is statistically insignificant from zero.

Let the predicted wealth and debt from the first stage be ŵ and d̂ . The predicted non-
exempt assets ne and financial benefits fb are calculated by:
                   ∧
                  ne = (wˆ − e ) × 1( wˆ > e )

                   fbˆ = ⎛⎜ dˆ − ne ⎞⎟ × 1⎛ ∧ ⎞
                                  ∧


                          ⎝          ⎠ ⎜⎜⎝ dˆ > ne ⎟⎟⎠

                               ∧
The predicted fbˆ and ne now enter into the second stage to form the Hausman test.
Table 2 reports the result for specification (1), and table 3 reports the result for
specification (2).

In table 2, first, a probit is conducted for whether a household files for bankruptcy, using
observed financial benefit fb. Then predicted financial benefit fbˆ is used to conduct the
same probit. As wealth and debt are slightly different in the two estimations, (because of
transformation,) the fb variable is slightly different in these estimations as well. Therefore,
two probits are reported for each estimation, one using the observed data (denoted as
“observed” in table 2), and the other using the predicted fbˆ , denoted as either “least
square” or as “log-normal” depending on the estimation method at the first statge.

In table 2, when observed data are used, financial benefit positively affects probability of
filing bankruptcy. 10 However, if predicted fbˆ from least square estimator is used, fbˆ
now has a negative effect on the probability of filing bankruptcy. If the predicted fbˆ
from the lognormal estimator is used, the coefficient for fbˆ is no longer significant.

Similarly, in table 3, first, a probit is conducted for whether a household files for
bankruptcy, using observed d and ne, and then their predicted values are used to conduct
the same probit. In table 3, the level of d positively, and the level of ne negatively affect
                                                                       ∧
the bankruptcy decision. 11 However, the effect of d̂ and ne on the bankruptcy decision
is no longer as clear. The d̂ from the least square estimator has a significant but negative

   For reference, coefficients in the first column of Table 2 can be compared to those reported in the
comparable specification in FHW.

effect on the bankruptcy decision, but d̂ from the lognormal estimation has no
statistically significant effect.

Another interesting observation from tables 2 and 3 is about the coefficients of control
variables X. No matter using the observed fb, d, and ne, or using the predicted fbˆ , d̂ and
 ∧
ne from different estimation methods, their corresponding coefficients and their standard
errors are all very close.

The Hausman test statistic has a χ2 distribution with 58 degrees of freedom. The 5%
critical value is 76.8, and the 10% critical value is 72.1. In all cases, the Hausman test
statistics are relatively much smaller than the 10% critical value. For specification (1) in
table 2, the Hausman test statistic is 9.62 for the least square estimator and 11.7 for the
lognormal estimation. For specification (2) in table 3, the Hausman test statistics are
negative: -7.00 for the least square estimator and -.94 for the lognormal estimator. In
these two cases, we calculate generalized Hausman test statistic. 12 For the least square
estimator, the generalized Hausman test statistic is 58.3. For the lognormal estimator, the
generalized Hausman test statistic is 59.5. 13 In both cases, we fail to reject the H0
hypothesis. The tests here favor the adverse event theory.

Notice that there are several limitations of this work.

As is well-known, wealth data in the PSID are not available with the ideal frequency and
detail for several aspects of bankruptcy research. (Additional data limitations and their
effects are described in FHW.)

Moreover, it would be good to have results from additional empirical specifications of the
models. For reference, two additional tests for stage 1 results were tried on these data –
one using least absolute deviation, (and censored least absolute deviation for financial
benefit,) and another using robust regression. The LAD estimator failed to converge, and
the robust regression estimator predicted wealth poorly enough to yield too many zeroes
for predicted non-exempt assets, and led predicted non-exempt assets to be dropped in the
second stage, and consequently, a drop of the variable squared non-exempt assets, and the
interaction term.

Furthermore, the model of adverse events formulated here is one model of adverse events
theory. We are not aware of another model of adverse events that can be compared
directly with a standard economic model. The model formulated is designed to capture an
important aspect of adverse events theory (“no consumer plans to go bankrupt”), and
designed to capture this effect in the simplest possible manner. No doubt, other models

Appendix

Solution to optimization problem for an adverse events consumer

Notice that the first-order condition for the consumer's stage I problem is:
MU AE (d ) = u ' (d ) − δ (1 + r )π g u ' (wg − (1 + r )d ) − δ (1 + r )π b u ' (wb − (1 + r )d ) = 0.
Moreover, as lim d ↓0 u ' (d ) = ∞, for d small enough, MUAE(d)>0, and for d sufficiently
large, wg - (1+r)d, and wb - (1+r)d are sufficiently small, and hence, MUAE(d)<0.
Therefore, there is unique d* ≡ d*AE > 0 such that MUAE(d*AE)=0. Furthermore, it is easy
to check that ∂MU AE (d ) / ∂d < 0 , and consequently, if d ≤ d * AE , then
                        (           )
MU AE (d ) ≥ MU AE d * AE , and if d>d*AE, then MUAE(d)<MUAE(d*AE) . Comparisons with
strategic timing consumers are provided below.

Solution to optimization problem for a strategic timing consumer

For the state g, the optimal decision of a strategic timing consumer can be characterized
as follows. Notice that utility of filing in g, when debt is d, is
                         [                                                 ]
U (file, d ) = u (d ) + δ π g u (e) + π b u ( wb ) + π t u ( wt ) , and utility of not filing is
U (not, d ) = u (d ) + δ [π     g   u (c g ) + π b u ( wb ) + π t u ( wt ) .   ]
Consider the action of not filing. Then marginal utility is:
MU ST (not , d ) = u ' (d ) − δ (1 + r )π g u ' (c g ) . Notice that marginal utility is decreasing in
debt, because ∂MU ST (not , d ) / ∂d = u ' ' (d ) + δ (1 + r ) π g u ' ' (c g ) < 0 . Moreover,
                                                                                   2


lim d ↓0 u′(d ) = ∞ , implies that for d small enough, MUST(not,d)>0, and for d sufficiently
large, wg-(1+r)d is sufficiently small, and hence, MU ST (not, d ) < 0 . Therefore, there is a
                                                (             )
unique d * > 0 such that MU ST not, d * = 0 . Furthermore, ∂MU ST (not, d ) / ∂d < 0
implies that if d < d , then MU
                            *                       ST
                                                         (not , d ) ≥ MU ST (not, d * ) , and if d>d*, then
 MU ST (not, d ) < MU ST (not, d * ) . Consequently, if a consumer considers not filing, then
maximum utility possible when debt limit is d is as follows: if d ≤ d * , then maximum
                                            [                                                   ]
utility is U (not , d ) = u (d ) + δ π g u (wg − (1 + r )d ) + π b u ( wb ) + π t u ( wt ) , and if d > d * ,
then maximum utility is:
                                [ (                               )
U (not, d * ) = u (d * ) + δ π g u wg − (1 + r )d * + π b u ( wb ) + π t u ( wt ) .      ]
Consider the action of filing. Then marginal utility is MUST(file,d)=u’(d)>0, and
consequently, the optimal debt choice is to set d = d . Therefore, if a consumer considers
filing, the maximum utility when debt limit is d is:
                            [
U (file, d ) = u (d ) + δ π g u (e) + π b u ( wb ) + π t u ( wt ) .        ]



                                                                      16
In order to characterize the optimal decision, it is useful to define the level of debt at
which the consumer is financially indifferent between filling or not. That is, let d̂ solve
w − (1 + r )dˆ = e . In other words, let dˆ = ( w − e) /(1 + r ) .
  g                                                                g



Suppose d ≤ dˆ . That is, debt limit is small relative to d̂ . (In other words,
e = wg − (1 + r )dˆ ≤ wg − (1 + r )d . That is, exemptions are small relative to net wealth
after maximum possible debt payoff.) Then the consumer’s optimal decision is not to file
in g. This can be seen by separately considering two cases: d ≤ d * , and d > d * .

If d ≤ d * , then maximum utility from not filing is:
                            [ (                        )
U (not, d ) = u (d ) + δ π g u wg − (1 + r )d + π b u ( wb ) + π t u ( wt ) ,                      ]
                                                                                       [
and maximum utility from filing is U (file, d ) = u (d ) + δ π g u (e ) + π b u ( wb ) + π t u ( wt ) .                ]
Moreover, d ≤ dˆ implies that e = w − (1 + r )dˆ ≤ w − (1 + r )d , and consequently,
                                                   g                           g

  (        )        (
U not, d ≥ U file, d .      )
If d > d * , then maximum utility from not filing is:
                                [ (                            )
U (not, d * ) = u (d * ) + δ π g u wg − (1 + r )d * + π b u ( wb ) + π t u ( wt ) ,                    ]
                                                                                       [
and maximum utility from filing is U (file, d ) = u (d ) + δ π g u (e ) + π b u ( wb ) + π t u ( wt ) .                ]
Moreover, d ≤ dˆ , and the optimality of d * imply that
  ( )           (                       ) ()              (                        ) ( )
u d * + δπ g u wg − (1 + r )d * > u d + δπ g u wg − (1 + r )d ≥ u d + δπ g u (e ) , and
consequently, U not, d  (       *
                                    ) ≥ U (not, d ) ≥ U (file, d ) .
Consider now the case d > dˆ . That is, debt limit is large relative to dˆ . (In other words,
e = wg − (1 + r )dˆ > wg − (1 + r )d . That is, exemptions are large relative to net wealth
after maximum possible debt payoff.) Then the filing decision is a little more nuanced,
and it depends on the tradeoff between exemptions and net wealth after paying off
endogenously determined debt use. This can be seen by separately considering the
following cases: when dˆ ≤ d * (that is, exemptions are large relative to net wealth after
paying off optimal debt in the case of not filing) and when dˆ > d * (that is, exemptions
are small relative to net wealth after paying off optimal debt in the case of not filing).
         Suppose dˆ ≤ d * . (In other words, exemptions are large relative to wealth after
paying off d * .) Then the optimal decision is to file, and it can be seen by considering the
following two cases. If d ≤ d * , then maximum utility from not filing is:
                            [ (                        )                                           ]
U (not, d ) = u (d ) + δ π g u wg − (1 + r )d + π b u ( wb ) + π t u ( wt ) , and maximum utility from
                                          [                b           b   t       t       ]
filing is U (file, d ) = u (d ) + δ π u (e) + π u ( w ) + π u ( w ) . Moreover, d > dˆ implies
                                              g

that e = wg − (1 + r )dˆ > wg − (1 + r )d , and consequently, U file, d > U not, d . If        (           )   (   )

d > d * , then maximum utility from not filing is
                               [ (                   )                           ]
U (not, d * ) = u (d * ) + δ π g u wg − (1 + r )d * + π b u ( wb ) + π t u ( wt ) ,
                                                                       [                            ]
and maximum utility from filing is U (file, d ) = u (d ) + δ π g u (e) + π b u ( wb ) + π t u ( wt ) .
Moreover, dˆ ≤ d * implies that e = w − (1 + r )dˆ > w − (1 + r )d , and consequently,
                                               g                   g

U (file, d ) > U (not, d ) .

Suppose dˆ > d * . (Exemptions are small relative to d*.) Then there is a unique d * ,
 dˆ < d * , such that if dˆ < d < d * , then optimal decision is to not file, and if d * < d , then
optimal decision is to file. This case highlights an interesting dynamic. In this case,
relatively high debt limits additionally affect a consumer’s decision to file. That is, even
when exemptions are relatively small as compared to a consumer’s desired debt (when
not filing), she may decide to file, if her debt limit is sufficiently high to make the
intertemporal consumption tradeoff valuable. This sufficiently high threshold is
characterized by d * . Recall from a previous case that if dˆ = d and dˆ > d * , then
U (not, d * ) > U (file, d ) . In other words, if exemptions are the same as net wealth after
maximum debt payoff, but consumer’s optimal use of debt is smaller than maximum debt
allowed, then it is beneficial for the consumer to not file, essentially because the
additional consumption in period 1 from additional debt does not compensate for the
decrease in consumption in state g that results from filing. Therefore, for d slightly
larger than d̂ , U (not, d * ) > U (file, d ) . However, in the region d * , ∞ ,[     )
∂U (not, d ) / ∂d * = 0 , and, ∂U (file, d ) / ∂d = u ' (d ) > 0 . In other words, maximum utility
from filing is strictly increasing in d , while maximum utility from not filing is constant.
Moreover, u is unbounded above. Consequently, there is a unique d * , dˆ < d * , such that
for each d , if dˆ < d < d * , then optimal choice is to not file, and if d * < d , then optimal
choice is to file.

Some Comparisons

The models above shed more light on the behavior of these different consumers. These
differences can yield testable predictions, and can help understand some otherwise
puzzling results.

One clear distinction between the strategic timing and adverse events theory is that for
strategic timing consumers, the bankruptcy decision and the debt and consumption
decisions are jointly determined, whereas for adverse events consumers, the debt decision
is exogenous to the filing decision.

A second distinction is that adverse events consumers may file less frequently than
strategic timing consumers. This can complement other arguments for why households
filing for bankruptcy form only a small fraction of households that would gain from
bankruptcy, (see, for example, FHW, or White (1998).)



                                                         18
Another intuitive comparative statics result that can be seen formally here is that debt use
by adverse events consumers is sometimes less, and never more than that for strategic
timing consumers. Of course, when debt limits are sufficiently low, both types might
decide to use maximum possible debt, and in this case, debt levels are the same. But
notice that the optimal debt level for adverse events consumers can be lower than that for
strategic timing consumers, because
   MU AE (d ) = u ' (d ) − δ (1 + r )π g u ' (wg − (1 + r )d ) − δ (1 + r )π bu ' (wb − (1 + r )d )
             < u ' (d ) − δ (1 + r )π g u ' (wg − (1 + r )d )       [= MU   ST
                                                                               (not, d )]
             < u ' (d )                                             [= MU   ST
                                                                               (file, d )]

                          (     )            (           )
In particular, MU AE d * AE < MU ST not, d *ST = 0 implies d*AE<d*ST.
