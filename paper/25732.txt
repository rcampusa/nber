"And Yet It Moves": Intergenerational Mobility in Italy

                                          ABSTRACT

We link tax returns across two generations to provide the first estimate of intergenerational
mobility in Italy based on administrative income data. Italy emerges as less immobile than
previously depicted by studies using proxies for economic status or survey data with imputation
procedures. This conclusion is robust with respect to a number of concerns, both standard when
using administrative data and specific to our sample. A 10 percentile increase in parental income
is associated with a percentile increase in child income between 2.5 and 3. The expected rank of
children born from parents with income below the median is around 0.43. Upward mobility is
higher for sons, first-born children, children of self-employed parents, and for those who migrate
once adults. We uncover substantial geographical variation in the degree of upward mobility.
Provinces in Northern Italy, the richest area of the country, display levels three times as large as
those in the South. This regional variation is strongly correlated with local labor market
conditions, indicators of family instability, and school quality.

1     Introduction
Income mobility across generations is a key socio-economic indicator. It sheds light on the
extent to which individuals with unequal initial conditions are offered equal opportunities to
succeed and, as such, it is considered a proxy for a fair and fluid society.
    In spite of its centrality to the academic and policy debate, the body of empirical evidence
on intergenerational mobility that economists have collected over the years is rather thin. The
reason is that the data requirements are formidable. Very few publicly available datasets around
the world have information that allows to link parents and children and, at the same time, to
construct reliable measures of permanent income for both cohorts.
    Italy is no exception in this regard. There exists, so far, no study on intergenerational mo-
bility on a national scale that uses high-quality data on incomes. Sociologists have filled this
gap by studying intergenerational persistence of occupational classes (Pisati and Schizzerotto,
2004). Economists have opted for a variety of other approaches. Checchi et al. (1999) have
documented the degree of persistence in educational attainment. A number of papers have
used statistical procedures to impute incomes to parents of children who report their income in
the Survey of Household Income and Wealth (SHIW) or in the Italian sample of the European
Survey on Income and Living Conditions.1 Finally, other authors have made creative use of
surnames. Barone and Mocetti (2016) have focused on one particular city, Florence, and linked
surnames of tax records in 1411 and 2011; Güell et al. (2015) have documented large variation
in intergenerational mobility across geographical areas within Italy by exploiting the informa-
tional content of surnames.
    Over the last decade or so, the empirical literature on intergenerational mobility has wit-
nessed a strong revival thanks to the fact that economists have been able to access large ad-
ministrative data in a handful of countries (e.g., United States, Canada, Australia, Denmark,
Sweden, Norway). These very large datasets have led to precise estimates of mobility indexes
and have opened the possibility to analyze upward mobility patterns, within countries, at a
very disaggregated geographical level. This variation has been exploited to learn about what
socio-economic factors are strongly correlated with upward mobility across regions, while con-
trolling for the institutional framework.
    1 Some of these studies are Mocetti (2007), Piraino (2007), Barbieri et al. (2018) and Cannari and D’Alessio (2018).




                                                           1
    In this paper we add to this recent wave of studies and introduce a new dataset that allows
us to develop the first systematic investigation of intergenerational income mobility for the
Italian economy. Our starting point is the administrative electronic database on individual tax
returns from the Ministry of Economy and Finance.2 From this data source, we extracted a
sample of two cohorts of Italians born, respectively, between 1942-1963 and 1972-1983 and we
matched parents and children through their social security numbers. Our final dataset contains
nearly 650,000 parents-child pairs with detailed income information for three years in each
cohort - 1998-99-00 for parents, 2011-12-14 for children.
    We begin from the analysis of intergenerational mobility at the national level. We estimate
that, in Italy, a child born from parents with income below the median of the parental income
distribution (thus, on average the 25th percentile) is expected to reach the 44th percentile of
her own income distribution as an adult. In other words, she is expected to move upward, but
to remain below the median. When we examine the full intergenerational income transition
matrix across deciles, for a child from parents in the top decile, the probability of keeping her
parents’ rank as an adult is 26%. For a child in the bottom decile, the probability of rising to the
top decile is less than 4%. We also find that upward mobility is larger for sons, for first-born
among siblings, for children of self-employed parents and for children who, once adult, migrate
to other regions within Italy. By exploiting variation within siblings, we conclude that around
20% of variation in child outcomes is attributable to parental background.
    We also estimate the relationship between the average rank of the child and average rank of
the parents in their respective national distributions to learn about relative mobility patterns.
We confirm the finding of Chetty et al. (2014) that this relation is markedly linear, except at
the very top where it bends upward. Its slope —the rank-rank slope (RRS)— is a measure of
relative mobility for children with different initial conditions in terms of parental income. In
Italy, the RRS is 0.25. To understand the meaning of this value, consider two children, one from
parents in the top decile and one from parents in the bottom decile of the national distribution
—a gap corresponding to a differential in their fathers’ earnings of around 43,500 Euros. An
RRS of 0.25 means that, when adults, these children will be on average still two deciles apart,
   2 The  cross-sectional dimension of this database, i.e. without any intergenerational matches, is the source of the
statistics on top incomes in Italy documented by Alvaredo and Pisano (2010) and contained in the World Inequality
Database (www.wid.world).



                                                          2
a gap that translates into nearly 6,500 Euros of annual earnings. The median rank-rank slope
is much higher, 0.36. The discrepancy between mean and median is due to the fact that the
conditional distributions of child ranks are skewed - to the right at the bottom of the income
distribution of parents, and to the left at the top.
   Even though the expected rank of a child, conditional on parental rank, has a tightly es-
timated slope, the R-squared of the rank-rank regression is low. Conditional on a particular
percentile of the parental income distribution, even controlling for all observable variables in
our dataset, economic outcomes of children remain vastly different. For example, if we condi-
tion on children with parents in the 90th percentile, the bottom quarter of these children will be
below the 35th percentile of their own national distribution. Among children from families at
the 10th percentile, a quarter of them will be above the 60th percentile.
   For completeness, we also compute a more traditional measure of intergenerational mobil-
ity, the intergenerational elasticity of income (IGE). We estimate an IGE of 0.25. However, we
uncover that this elasticity varies dramatically across the distribution: at the bottom it is nearly
zero, while above the 10th percentile its value exceeds 0.30. This sharp nonlinearity makes it
problematic to use the IGE as a single statistic to summarize mobility across the whole dis-
tribution. When we replicate imputation procedures used by previous studies to estimate the
IGE in Italy, we obtain much higher point estimates, in line with those findings. We argue this
approach leads to an upward bias in the IGE because the instruments used to impute father’s
income are correlated with child income.
   The three main shortcomings of our data are: (i) an attenuation bias due to the short within-
individual panel dimension; (ii) a selection bias due to the fact that we can only link parents to
children when the latter are claimed as dependent by the former; (iii) possible distortions aris-
ing from tax evasion for the self-employed. Correcting for these three sources of bias increases
somewhat our estimates of intergenerational rank persistence, e.g. the RRS rises above 0.30.
However, measures of upward mobility remain largely unchanged.
   When placing our estimates in a comparative context, upward mobility in Italy is higher
than in the United States, but lower than in Nordic European countries. However, when using
alternative measures of mobility (namely, the probability that the son earns at least 50% more
than the father) that account for the different level of income inequality between Italy and the
United States, and hence distance between percentiles , we conclude that upward mobility in

                                                  3
Italy is higher than in the United States only in the bottom tercile of the income distribution.
   Next, we explore the geographical differences in upward mobility across the 110 Italian
provinces. We document a staggering amount of variation, with a steep South-North gradi-
ent. Relative to the South of Italy, provinces in the North (especially in the North East), are
both more egalitarian —i.e., they display higher relative mobility— and more upward mobile
—i.e., they display higher absolute mobility (as measured, for example, by the expected rank
of a child born by parents below the median). In the North, children from parents with un-
equal background are more similar in their economic outcomes when adults, and children from
poor parents fare better when adults. The level of upward mobility in Northern Italy exceeds
that of Scandinavia. Provinces with higher upward mobility systematically display also lower
downward mobility.
   To give a sense of the magnitudes, we compare the province of Milano (ranked 10th in terms
of upward mobility) to that of Palermo (ranked 107th), both very large provinces with 3.2M and
1.2M residents, respectively. In Milan, children from parents with income below the median
in the national parental income distribution are expected to reach the 54th percentile of their
own national income distribution, once adults. Children from parents with the same economic
background who grow up in Palermo reach, on average, the 38th percentile. The probability of
moving from the bottom quintile to the top quintile of the national income distribution is 0.22
for children who grow up in Milano and less than 0.06 for those raised in Palermo.
   We uncover a Great Gatsby curve with a negative slope linking upward mobility and several
measures of inequality across Italian provinces. However, surprisingly, the top income share
correlates positively. One interpretation is that the top income share is high in areas where
self-employment is prevalent and upward mobility is especially strong for this group.
   Our dataset also allows us to assess, for the first time, the relationship between Informa-
tional Content of Surnames (ICS) indicators (such as those estimated by Güell et al. (2015) for
the Italian provinces) and true measures of mobility. As one would expect, we find a significant,
negative correlation between the two. However, we also show that this relationship weakens
considerably –becoming almost flat– for provinces which display ICS indexes below the mean.
Thus, when the ICS is low, it contains little information about the true extent of mobility, sug-
gesting that researchers should be cautious when using such proxy.
   We then investigate what socio-economic indicators correlate, at the provincial level, with

                                                4
upward mobility. We use nearly 50 markers for productivity, labor market conditions, demo-
graphic structure, educational attainment, family instability, crime, and economic openness
from ISTAT, the National Statistical Institute. In addition, we have several measures of social
capital and a unique and very detailed set of indicators of school quality.
   Most of these variables correlate with upward mobility with the expected sign. A limi-
tation of this unconditional analysis is that all these socio-economic variables are also highly
correlated among each other. We therefore proceed with a multivariate conditional correlation
analysis, where we extract a small number of principal components for each broad category to
collapse the number of covariates. Overall, the included categories explain a large portion of the
geographic variation in rates of upward mobility (nearly 90%). The key explanatory variables
are the local labor market conditions, indicators of family instability and two specific indexes
of school quality: students’ grades and test scores, and the quality of pre-school.
   These correlations do not imply causality. We make an attempt to identify a causal link by
exploiting households who are likely to have moved exogenously because of an earthquake
that struck three provinces in the South of Italy in 1980. By comparing movers and stayers,
we find statistically significant differences in upward mobility that are almost as large as the
differences between mobility indexes of provinces of destination and provinces of origin. This
exercise supports the idea that fixed characteristics of the province, over and above selection in
the pool of residents, has an independent impact on the degree of intergenerational mobility.
   The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 defines the measures of intergen-
erational mobility used in the analysis. Section 3 describes the dataset, outlines the sample
selection procedure, and provides some descriptive statistics. Section 4 discusses our findings
on the degree of intergenerational mobility at the national level. Section 5 tackles potential
sources of bias in our baseline estimates. Section 6 compares mobility outcomes in Italy to
those in other countries. Section 7 documents the patterns of geographical variation in upward
mobility across provinces in Italy. Section 8 explores the correlation between upward mobility
and local characteristics of provinces that could account for geographical variation. Section 9
concludes.

2     Measures of intergenerational mobility
In this section, we briefly discuss the measures of intergenerational mobility we use throughout
the paper. No single measure is perfect. Each one has advantages and shortcomings over the
others, and each one answers a specific question.


2.1   Relative mobility

Relative mobility is the subject of most prior investigations of intergenerational mobility (see
Solon, 1999; Black and Devereux, 2011; Jäntti and Jenkins, 2015, for surveys of the literature).
These studies focus on relative outcomes of children with different family backgrounds, and
ask: what is the expected income of children of low-income families relative to those of high-
income families?
    Our main measure of relative mobility is the correlation between child and parent income
ranks (Dahl and DeLeire, 2008; Chetty et al., 2014), i.e. an index of positional mobility. Let
Ri denote child i’s percentile rank in the income distribution of children (from 0 to 99) and
RiP denote the percentile rank of i’s parents in the income distribution of parents. A linear
regression of child rank on parental rank yields


                                        Ri = α + βRiP + ε i                                     (1)


where the constant α measures the expected rank of a child born from parents at the bottom of
the income distribution RiP = 0 , and the rank-rank slope (RRS, or rank-rank persistence co-
                               

efficient) β measures the strength of the correlation between a child’s position and her parents’
position.
    By construction, this regression on national data has only one free parameter since it must
be true, by taking averages of both sides of (1) , that 50 · (1 − β) = α. Values of β close to zero
denote a very mobile society where the expected rank of children is always around the median
independently of parental rank. Values close to one depict a society with high persistence in
relative positions across generations. In other words high relative mobility corresponds to a
low value for β.
    For example, by computing ∆ · β we can answer the question: what is the difference in

                                                6
expected rank between two children with parents who are ∆ percentiles apart in the national
income distribution? And, by simple iteration we can ask how many generations it would take,
on average, for descendants of families originally ∆ percentiles apart to belong to the same
percentile of the income distribution, i.e. the value N that solves β N ∆ = 1.3
    We are also interested in assessing whether mobility at the top differs from mobility in the
rest of the distribution. For example, we may think that belonging to the upper class of society
yields disproportionately better opportunities to perpetuate social status across generations. For
this purpose, we construct an index of relative mobility at the top, or top mobility ratio (TMR),
as follows. First we compute the RRS by running the rank-rank regression (1) on the top decile
of the parental distribution ( β91−100 ). Next, we run it on the bottom 90 pct and obtain β1−90 .
We then define
                                                           β91−100
                                                TMR =              .                                              (2)
                                                            β1−90
The higher this ratio, the stronger persistence in ranks across generations at the top of the in-
come distribution relative to the rest of the distribution.
    The most commonly used index of relative mobility in the literature is the intergenerational
income elasticity (IGE) which captures the elasticity of child income with respect to parental
income and is estimated as the OLS coefficient of a linear regression of log child income yi on
log parental income yiP , i.e.
                                                              SD (log yi )
                                          IGE = ICC ×                    ,                                       (3)
                                                              SD log yiP
where ICC is the intergenerational correlation coefficient between log income of parent and
child and SD is the standard deviation. An IGE of 0.5, for example, means that a 20 pct differ-
ential in parental income translates into a 10 pct differential in child income. Mazumder (2016)
discusses the relation between RRS and IGE.4
    There are four advantages of the RRS compared to the IGE. First, the IGE is based on log
   3 This back-of-the envelope calculation requires the assumption that permanent income across generations fol-

lows an AR(1) process. Existing empirical work on multiple generations finds a correlation between outcomes of
children and grandparents that is higher than what one would expect under the AR(1) assumption (Braun and
Stuhler, 2017; Lindahl et al., 2015). Thus, this calculation might be a lower bound.
   4 RRS and ICC are closely-related, scale-invariant measures of the extent to which child income depends on

parental income. Theoretically, the IGE differs from the  RRS only if income inequality changes significantly across
generations: if, for example, SD (log yi ) > SD log yiP , then the effect of parental income on child income is larger
and this is reflected in a higher IGE.



                                                          7
income. As a result, one has to either drop the zeros in income or use an imputation procedure.
Conclusions can be sensitive to selection and imputation assumptions. Second, the conditional
expectation of log child income as a function of parental income, in practice, is often very non-
linear. As a result, a single elasticity is not a good summary of intergenerational mobility at all
points in the distribution. Conversely, the empirical literature that uses measures of positional
mobility showed that the rank-rank relation is remarkably close to linear. Third, the RRS can be
used to measure mobility differentials among subgroups of the population (e.g., geographical
areas) because the RRS for different groups can be estimated based on ranks of the same na-
tional distribution.5 Fourth, the RRS is less sensitive than the IGE to lifecycle and attenuation
biases (Nybom and Stuhler, 2017).


2.2    Absolute mobility

Absolute mobility indexes measure the outcomes of children from families at a given income
or rank in the parental income distribution. They are typically used to study the economic
performance of children from poor families.
   We follow Chetty et al. (2014) and report measures of absolute upward mobility (AUM),
defined as the mean rank (in the national child income distribution) of children whose parents
are below the median of their own national income distribution, or:

                                                  h             i
                                          R̄50 = E Ri | RiP ≤ 50 .                                           (4)


   When the rank-rank relationship is linear, the average rank of children with below-median
parental income equals the average rank of children with parents at the 25th percentile of the
national income distribution, i.e., E Ri | RiP = 25 , which can be easily computed from (1) as
                                                  

α + 25 · β = 50 − 25 · β.
   Another measure of absolute mobility we analyze is the probability of rising from the lowest
to the highest quintile of the income distribution (Corak and Heisz, 1999) —we call it Q1Q5.
This probability can be interpreted as the fraction of those who make it to the top starting from
   5 Instead,
            the IGE estimated within groups is only informative about persistence or mobility with respect to the
group specific mean, not the aggregate mean.

the bottom:
                                             n                      o
                                Q1Q5 = Pr Ri ≥        80| RiP   < 20 .                          (5)

   Finally, we provide non-parametric transition matrices by percentile, and marginal distribu-
tions, that allow readers to construct alternative measures of mobility beyond those we docu-
ment here.


2.3   Indicators for within-country comparisons across regions

We are interested in analyzing the geographical heterogeneity in intergenerational mobility
within Italy. Let Rig denote the rank in the national income distribution of children for a child i
who grew up in geographical area (or region) g. Let RiP denote its parents’ rank in the national
distribution of parental income. By running regressions of the type


                                     Rig = α g + β g RiP + ε ig ,                               (6)


where we continue to rank both children and parents based on their positions in the national
income distribution (rather than the distribution within their region), we obtain estimates of
                                                                
the region-specific indicators of relative β g and absolute R̄50
                                              

   It is important to note that, while in the linear national rank-rank relation (1) there is only
one free parameter, and a one-to-one mapping between AUM and RRS, this is not the case for
the regional regressions, since the average national rank of residents of a specific region needs
not be the median. However, as long as linearity holds, the AUM for region g can be accurately
approximated as:
                                          50
                                       R¯g = α g + 25 · β g .                                   (7)

This is the measure of absolute upward mobility that we use throughout our regional analysis.
Using directly the 25th percentile of the national income distribution avoids the problem that in
poor provinces the income distribution can be much more concentrated on lower values than
in rich ones, thus affecting local estimates of the AUM.

2.4     Indicators for cross-country comparisons

We are also interested in comparing the level of intergenerational mobility in Italy with that of
other countries. The key challenge in this comparison is that the national income distribution
differs markedly across countries and such differences can obscure the interpretation of the
results.6
    To overcome this problem, when we do cross-country comparisons, we report another mea-
sure beyond positional indexes. The measure has been used previously by Chetty et al. (2017) to
compare mobility between cohorts in the United States. We compute, at each parental income
rank r, the probability that the income of the child (y) is higher than the income of the parents
(y P ) by a factor Φ > 1, once the two distributions have been rescaled by their mean to capture
aggregate growth over the period. Specifically, at each r, we calculate
                                                                                 
                                                                ȳ
                                     Pr yi ≥    ΦyiP   ·                  | RiP   =r .                       (8)
                                                               ȳ P

By measuring upward mobility this way, we quell the valid concern that different degrees of
income dispersion across countries may bias our findings.



3     Data
In this section, we describe our dataset, outline our sample selection procedure and present
some descriptive statistics. We argue that the earnings distribution in our sample is comparable
to the distribution obtained from more standard survey data, hence it is representative.


3.1     Description of the dataset

Our data source is the electronic database of Personal Income Tax returns assembled by the
Department of Finance of the Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance.7 The accuracy of the
    6 Consider,  for example, country A and country B, where country A is a lot less unequal than B. When using
indexes of positional mobility, such as the RRS, there is a mechanical force towards measuring more mobility in A
than in B. The reason is that it takes a lower absolute change in income in country A to move up (or down) any
given percentile, compared to B, since in A the income distribution is more compressed.
   7 In Italy, the tax unit is the individual.

information in this database is preliminarily statistically checked and validated by the Depart-
ment of Finance.8 The database is used for the official tax return statistics published annually
and for economic analysis supporting policy decisions. It is also the source of cross-sectional
statistics on income inequality for Italy in the World Income Database (Alvaredo and Pisano,
2010). However, it is the first time that the dataset is used to link children to their parents in
order to construct measures of intergenerational mobility. As of today, no other existing sources
of income data allowed such link in Italy.
    The database combines information from all three income tax forms available to Italian tax-
payers: (i) form Modello Unico (MU), which is the most common, (ii) form 730, the simpli-
fied income tax form available to employees and pensioners whose tax returns consist of only
few items, and (iii) form 770 which is compiled by the withholding agent of employees or by
self-employed workers, and is accepted by the Italian tax authorities when the taxpayer is not
required to submit a tax return directly. This is mostly the case of individuals with only one
source of income, no other dwellings than their primary home, and no itemized deductions
(e.g., medical expenses, charitable donations, mortgage interests).9
    Our extract comprises numerous variables on demographic characteristics and income. De-
mographics include the province of birth and residence, birth year, marital status, and an occu-
pation/sector identifier (ATECO code).10 The income variables include total gross (before-tax)
income and all its components, i.e. income from dependent labor, self-employment (divided
into professional and entrepreneurial income), pensions, unemployment benefits, financial as-
sets, housing, land and farms.11,12
   8 This  process is mainly performed by SOGEI SpA, an in-house company of the Ministry of Economy and
Finance, through a series of algorithms that checks the coherence between data reported in different sections of tax
returns, corrects abnormally high values, etc. In 2012, 100% of tax returns were transmitted electronically to the
tax authorities.
    9 Standard deductions such as allowances for children and dependent spouses are applied by the withholding

agent.
   10 The ATECO code is available only for self-employed individuals in our dataset. These individuals are required

to report it in the tax return, as the code describes the specific economic activity that generates the income.
   11 Some income sources we do not observe are fellowships/scholarships, child/family benefits, social assistance

transfers.
   12 The difference between professional and entrepreneurial income is subtle. The key distinction is the extent to

which the business uses extensively physical capital beyond human capital. For example, a lawyer or a free-lance
journalist is considered, for tax purposes, a professional. An owner of a firm which produces clothes is considered
an entrepreneur. Entrepreneurial income includes income from owned firms, i.e., firms where individuals own a
share of total equity (partnerships, closely-held companies).

3.2     Sample construction

Our aim is to link parents and children in the database. This operation is possible because, in or-
der to claim deductions for dependent children, parents must report the child’s Social Security
Number (SSN) on their own tax return. Figure A1 in the Appendix shows the corresponding
section of the tax form. Data for parents are extracted from tax returns of year 1998 by selecting
all taxpayers who claimed allowances for children born between 1972 and 1983 (age 15-26 in
1998).13 Then through children’s SSNs, we match the tax return of the parents to that of the
children in tax year 2012. Our cohort of children in 2012 is therefore of age 29-40.
    Our initial dataset with information on both child and parents comprises of 2,846,994 matched
records. Each record contains information on a child, her father, and her mother.14 Based only
on the tax return, we cannot be sure that the individuals claiming the child deduction are the
parents (e.g., they could be older brothers, or grandparents).15 Therefore, we drop records
where the age difference between child and father is less than 15 or larger than 45 which re-
duces sample size to 2,835,920 records. This criterion minimizes instances where the individual
claiming the dependent on the tax return is not the parent.
    In what follows, we discuss three potential problems with our sample: (i) selection bias, (ii)
attenuation bias, and (iii) life-cycle bias. We explain why these issues are not sever and later, in
Section 5, we propose explicit corrections for each of them.


3.2.1   Sample selection bias

The matching procedure outlined above inevitably misses some parent-child pairs for three rea-
sons. First, in 1998 the child’s SSN was mandatory only for forms MU and 730. For those who
filed form 770 (around 25 percent of taxpayers, typically low-income ones) a match is not possi-
ble. Second, certain individuals are not required to submit any tax form. These are individuals
(i) with no income whatsoever, (ii) with only tax-exempted income such as social assistance
payments, social transfers in kind, or fellowships, (iii) with only income from housing and land
  13 Year 1998 is the first one in which parents were required to report the SSN of the dependent children on the
tax form.
  14 From the tax returns information, we can always match spouses unless they are divorced and live apart. We

can retrace divorced couples when they both claim a positive percentage of deduction for the same individuals
born in 1972-83.
  15 While tax filers have to specify if the dependent is a child by checking a box, there could be errors in reporting.

assets below 500 euros, (iv) with income exclusively from interests, dividends, and capital gains
deriving from financial assets. Because of (i-iii), the very poor and the extreme tax evaders are
not covered in our sample.16 In Section 5, we bring in additional data to deal with these two
possible sources of bias.
    The third reason why our sample may not be representative is that a share of individu-
als aged 15-26 in 1998 were no longer dependent and thus they cannot be matched to parents
through tax returns. Our data gives us access to all children aged 29-40 in 2012, but only to
parents who claim some of those children as dependent in 1998. From the Ministry of Economy
and Finance, we obtained additional tabulations of the income distribution of all taxpayers in
the same age group of the linked parents in 1998, i.e. all potential parents of those children.
Figure 1 compares the conditional (on having a dependent child) distributions of father income
in 1998 and the conditional (on being claimed as dependent) distribution of child income in
2012 to their unconditional counterparts. In both cases, the conditional and unconditional dis-
tributions are remarkably similar.
    Figure 2 goes one step further and compares the distributions for all children (left panel)
and for dependent ones (right panel) across some key characteristics.
  16 Individuals in group (iv) are very few because it is unlikely that someone in that group would not have other

types of taxable income.

    In general, the distributions are quite close to each other. The only exception is, not sur-
prisingly, age: children claimed as dependent in 1998 are younger on average. However, as
we explain in Section 3.2.3 below, in the relevant age range our measures of intergenerational
mobility are very stable.17
    This preliminary analysis suggests that our sample of dependent children is representative
of the population. In Section 5 we reinforce this conclusion with an additional exercise.


3.2.2   Attenuation bias

After matching children in 2012 to their parents in 1998, we are able to add two years of data of
tax returns for both generations, 2011-2014 and 1999-2000 respectively. For these two years we
only have total income, not each of its components, and hence throughout most of the analysis
our definition of income is total gross income.
    As extensively discussed in the literature (e.g., Mazumder, 2016), a short income span means
our analysis is susceptible to attenuation bias. As a result, intergenerational mobility can be
overestimated: a fraction of the mobility measured could be spuriously due to the fact that
transitory shocks attenuate the income correlation between parents and children.
    To deal with the attenuation bias, throughout our analysis we use measures of income aver-
aged over the three years for parents and children.18 Ideally, one would like to ascertain that the
correlation between the 3-year average and lifetime income for our sample is high. Even if we
do not have access to a longer income span in our own dataset of tax returns, we performed this
calculation on the Italian Social Security (INPS) dataset made available to us by Hoffmann and
Malacrino (2019). In this long longitudinal sample (1985-2016), the rank correlation between a
3-year average of earnings for individuals of the age of our sons (37) and our fathers (51) and
the lifetime income of these same individuals computed between ages 27-55 is 0.93, giving us
confidence that we have a strong proxy for permanent income.19 We return on this point in
Section 5, where we also assess the size of the attenuation bias by simulation.
  17 Figures A3-A5 in the Appendix confirm these findings hold also for regions.
  18 Figure III.B in Chetty et al. (2014) shows that for the US data the attenuation bias is small: their estimates of
the RRS using 2 and 15 years of income are very close.
  19 INPS collects data on employer-employee relationships in order to compute social contributions and pension

benefits. The dataset is based on workers born on 24 randomly selected dates from the universe of all Italian
dependent employees in the non-farm private sector. The data represent a 6.6% sample of the population. The
notion of income is gross labor earnings. See Hoffmann and Malacrino (2019) for details.


                                                         15
3.2.3   Lifecycle bias

Another problem in using only a short snapshot of lifetime income is that, if we catch children
earlier in their working life relative to parents, we may understate income more for those with
steep age-income profiles (e.g., the more educated), which also leads to an understated estimate
of intergenerational persistence when the age-income slopes are positively correlated across
generations.
    Figure 3 illustrates this problem in our data. The figure plots the value of the RRS computed
on samples with different age cut-off criteria for children and fathers. Panel (a) shows that
including children below age 35 would dramatically reduce our estimates of rank persistence,
but after age 35 the estimate levels off.20 Clearly, by selecting older children in 2012, the age of
fathers in 1998 mechanically increases. Panel (a) shows that the effect of mean parental age on
the RRS is very modest until age 55, when it starts becoming considerable.
    In light of these findings, to deal with lifecycle bias, we impose two selection criteria. First,
we drop children younger than 35 in 2012. This selection reduces the sample size from 2,835,920
to 1,067,195 pairs. The oldest child in our dataset is 40 years old, and hence our final sample
covers a 6-year age range for children. Second, we only retain children whose fathers and
mothers in 1998 were between the ages of 35 and 55. After imposing this second restriction, the
sample size shrinks to 647,662 records. This is our final baseline sample.


3.3     Descriptive statistics

Table 1 contains selected descriptive statistics about parents and children in the baseline sample.
    On average, fathers (mothers) are 51 (48) years old in 1998. Over 90% of the fathers are
married. The data show that in 1998 the father is the top-earner in nearly 90% of the families in
the sample, and around 2/3 of families have two sources of income. The median gross income
of fathers is nearly 21,000 Euros in 1998 and that of mothers is approximately half of it.21 The
correlation between the two (which excludes zeros) is positive and significant, around 0.2.
  20 Figure   III.A in Chetty et al. (2014) is the counterpart of our Panel (a) for the US and Figure 1c in Nybom and
Stuhler (2017) is the counterpart for Sweden. In both countries, the RRS levels off at around age 30, i.e. five years
earlier than in Italy. This is not surprising, since entry in the labor market in Italy is much delayed relative to both
US and Sweden.
   21 Italy adopted the Euro in 2002, thus incomes for 1998-99-00 are expressed in Italian Liras in the database. We

transformed them in Euros, the currency in which they are reported in 2011-12-14.

    Children are on average 37 years old in 2012 and less than half are married. Median nominal
income of sons is only 4% higher than that of their fathers 14 years earlier. This small differ-
ence reflects the age gap between the two groups, but also the dismal aggregate growth of the
Italian economy over this period.22 Instead, women’s income is substantially higher in 2012
reflecting the steady rise in female employment rate among the newer cohorts. The compo-
sition of income reveals that for nearly 72% of children compensation for dependent labor is
the major component of income, followed by self-employment for 21% of the children popula-
tion. Fewer than 6% of children are rentiers—their main source of income being financial and
housing capital.
    Additional statistics about income distributions and individual characteristics are presented
in Table A1 in the Appendix. The table shows that, as expected, the income distribution is
markedly right-skewed: the top 1% of the distribution accounts for 6.6% of total income in
2012.   23

  22 Average   annual GDP growth per capita from 1998-2012 is less than 0.5%. Moreover, as in many developed
countries, much of the growth accrued to the top earners so it is less visible for median income.
  23 In the total Italian population, without the age restrictions we impose, this share is close to 10%. For compari-

son, in the U.S. this share is around 20%

3.4   Comparison with survey data

To gain more confidence in the reliability of our data, we verify that the distribution of labor
earnings we obtain in the final dataset is consistent with that from survey data. The best source
for comparison is the Survey on Household Income and Wealth (SHIW), administered by the
Bank of Italy. In both datasets we select all individuals (not just dependent) aged 35-40 in 2012.
Two additional adjustments are performed to make the two samples more comparable. First,
following Cannari et al. (1997), we drop individuals who i) report zero or missing income in the
survey, ii) report housing asset income below 185 Euros, and iii) report only interest income.
These criteria exclude from SHIW individuals who do not file tax returns. Second, because our
dataset comprises only gross income, while SHIW reports after-tax income data, we apply an
algorithm supplied by the Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance to reconstruct net wage
income (by far, the largest component of income for the vast majority of the population, as
mentioned above) in our data.
    Table 2 compares statistics on the after tax earnings distribution of in the two datasets. Over-
all, the two distributions line up well.



4     Intergenerational mobility in Italy
We begin our empirical analysis by documenting the relationship between child and parental
income at the national level.
    Our definition of income is total gross income. Parental income is the sum of total pre-
tax income of both parents. Child income is always defined at the individual level. Unless
otherwise specified, all incomes are nominal.
    We measure the rank of parents RiP as their percentile in the distribution of parental incomes
and the rank of children Ri as their percentile in the distribution of child incomes. Figure 4
presents a binned scatter plot of the mean percentile rank of children as a function of their
parent rank, E Ri | RiP = r .
                          

    Our first main finding is that the conditional expectation of a child’s rank given her par-
ents’ rank is almost perfectly linear, except at the top of the income distribution where it bends

upward.24
    Running the OLS regression in (1), we estimate that a one percentage point (ppt) increase
in parental rank is associated with a 0.25 ppt increase in the child’s mean rank, as reported
in column (1) of Table 3. This estimate of the RRS implies that, if we take two families, one
in the top decile of the income distribution and one in the bottom decile, a generation later
the child of the rich family is expected to be still two deciles above the child from the poor
family. On average, it would take three generations for these differences in initial conditions to
be fully offset so that the descendants of the two families (i.e., their great-grandchildren) would
be expected to belong to the same percentile.
    The first column of Table 3 reports also other measures of mobility. The top mobility ratio
(TMR) is 3.7, a reflection of the fact that in Figure 4, the rank-rank curve steepens towards the
upper end. Thus, ranks persist a lot more at the top of the income distribution.25 This value of
the TMR implies that in the top decile the slope is close to 1: the children of two families, both
  24 This linearity in the rank-rank relationship emerges also from other studies based on administrative records
for Australia, Canada, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and the United States (Boserup et al., 2017; Bratberg et al., 2017;
Chetty et al., 2014; Corak, 2017; Deutscher and Mazumder, 2019). In these studies, the data also show significant
deviations from linearity (less mobility) only at the extremes of the distribution.
  25 Mechanically, this happens because the distribution is right-skewed and percentiles are further apart at the top

relative to the middle. They are also somewhat closer to each other at the bottom, which explains the flattening of
the rank-rank relation for the first few percentiles.



                                                                            19
in the top decile but at the two extremes of the decile, will still be nearly 10 percentiles apart a
generation later.
   The AUM index equals 0.44 which means that a child of parents with income below the
median is expected to end up in the 44th percentile of her income distribution. The Q1Q5 index
implies that, at the national level, the probability of belonging to the top quintile of the income
distribution, for children born in the bottom quintile, is 10 percent.
   Tables 7 and 8 contain the full national intergenerational transition matrix across quintiles
and deciles. The probability that a child of a family from the top income decile remains in the
top decile is over 25 percent, almost 7 times higher than the probability that a child from a
family in the bottom decile ascends to the top one as an adult.


4.1   Robustness to deflating

A concern underlying our national statistical analysis is that all incomes are nominal, while pur-
chasing power varies substantially across geographical areas in Italy. A given income value in
the South, appropriately deflated, becomes higher than its counterpart in the North. A location-
specific deflating procedure might therefore affect the ranks of parents and children in the na-
tional distribution.
   To examine this issue, we used regional consumer price indexes constructed by the Bank of
Italy for the year 2006 (Cannari and Iuzzolino, 2009). We explore four different indexes: the first
one is a price index that allows for regional dispersion in prices of food, clothing, and furniture
only. The other three indexes include alternative ways of accounting for the location-specific
cost of housing services and other services. We also used an alternative deflating procedure
based on the province-level price indexes for year 2005 constructed by Boeri et al. (2018) fol-
lowing the methodology proposed by Moretti (2013). The cross-regional correlation between
all these cost-of-living indexes is very high, ranging from 0.53 to 0.99.26
   Overall, these price indexes reveal cost-of-living differentials of up to 30 percent between the
least expensive regions (e.g., Calabria) and the most expensive ones (e.g., Lombardia). Table 9
shows that our national results are quite robust to alternative deflating procedures. If anything,
our estimates of relative mobility rise somewhat when we use these regional deflators, but

indexes of absolute mobility are nearly identical.27


4.2                       Conditional distributions of child ranks

We now return to our baseline sample. Figure 5(a) reports the median child rank and the 25-
75 percentile range of child ranks conditional on the parental income rank in addition to the
mean rank already reported in Figure 4. The relationship between the median child rank and
parental rank remains linear, except at the very top, but it is a lot steeper: the rank-rank slope
is 0.36 for the median. The discrepancy between mean and median is due to the fact that the
conditional distributions of child ranks are very skewed, as illustrated in Figure 5(b). At the
bottom quantiles most of the mass is in the bottom ranks, whereas at the top quantiles it is in
the top ranks. Therefore, the median is lower than the mean for low parental ranks and higher
than the mean for high parental ranks, which induces a steeper positive relationship between
parents’ rank and conditional child median rank.
                     Figure 5(a) also reports the 25-75 percentile range of child outcomes at each parental rank.
The plot reveals a wide dispersion of outcomes around the mean. The interquartile range of the
conditional distribution of child ranks, averaged across parents’ ranks, is 0.47.28 For example,
      27 A
        dampening of relative rank persistence is what one would expect if high income areas are the high cost-of-
living ones. However, when there is a great deal of within-province income variation, the attenuation is small.
   28 Interestingly, Boserup et al. (2017) also report for Denmark an interquartile range of the conditional distribu-




                                                                21
at the 10th percentile of parental income, one quarter of children have incomes above the 60th
percentile, and at the 90th percentile of the parents’ distribution, one quarter of children have
incomes below the 35th percentile.29 Put differently, even though the slope of the rank-rank
relation is strongly statistically significant, the regression has a very low R2 , around 0.06.
   This finding is not uncommon in the literature and recently has led to interest in methods
that combine multiple parental predictors (e.g. Blundell and Risa, 2019). Here, we build on this
approach and ask: what explains, in our data, the vast within quantile variability? To answer
this question, we regress child rank in each percentile of parental rank (i.e., we run 100 separate
regressions) on a large number of individual covariates that include, for parents: marital sta-
tus, age, province of residence, a self-employment dummy, and a geographical mover dummy;
for children: marital status, age, gender, a self-employment dummy, and a geographical mover
dummy. Figure 6 shows that, jointly, these variables explain around 15% of the within-parental-
rank variation.30 The hump-shaped pattern suggests that they account for more variation in
outcomes of children from middle-class parents, and less for children from poor and rich par-
ents. Province of residence of the parents in 1998 (the location where the children grew up)
accounts for much of the explained within-rank variation: around 1/3 up to the median, and
less and less as parental rank rises. In Section 7, we will document in detail the existence of
sharp differences across Italian provinces in the degree of intergenerational mobility.
   The main conclusion is that most of the conditional variability remains unexplained, sug-
gesting that there is an enormous amount of unobserved heterogeneity left, even within parental
rank and within province.


4.3    A more traditional indicator: the IGE

Historically, the most common indicator used in the literature to measure intergenerational
mobility is the intergenerational elasticity of income (IGE) that we defined in Section 2. For
completeness, we report this measure as well. Figure 7 plots the relation between log income
of the child and log income of the parents, and the share of observations dropped among the
tion of child income ranks around 0.4.
   29 The dispersion in the distribution of ranks is not substantially affected by gender. When considering the

income distribution of sons only, the interquartile range is 0.455.
   30 This is a relatively low R2 compared to typical Mincer regressions. The main reason is that our data do not

contain information on educational levels.

children’s records. There is only 1.5% of observations dropped across the entire distribution, so
this does not seem a serious problem for our dataset.31
    The figure reveals that the relationship is very far from linear, especially if one includes the
bottom decile of the distribution. The overall IGE is 0.25, but for the bottom decile it is 0.04 and
for the top nine deciles it is 0.32.32 In other words, the IGE in our sample has the serious limi-
tation that it is not a sufficient statistics to characterize mobility across the entire distribution.33
In this regard, the linearity of the rank-rank relation offers a significant advantage even though,
as we showed, deviations from linearity emerge at the top for this measure.


4.3.1   Comparison with existing estimates

Other authors before us estimated the IGE on Italian cross-sectional survey data using impu-
tation procedures based on Two-Samples 2SLS (TS2SLS). The key limitation of these surveys
is that one cannot link fathers and sons: the surveys contain only income data for adult sons
along with some demographic characteristics of their fathers, but not their income. Researchers
proceeded in two stages. First, from previous surveys sampling individuals observed during
  31 Approximately     0.3% of observations are dropped because parents’ income is negative or zero, while the rest is
dropped because children’s income is negative or zero.
  32 Berman (2017) proves that under log-normality of the income distribution the ratio of the RRS to the IGE

converges to π3 , i.e. a number very close to 1. If we take the unconditional estimate of the IGE, our data offer sharp
support to this approximation. However, if we exclude the bottom decile, the approximation is poor, possibly
because of a Pareto tail in the empirical income distribution (estimated to be 2.5 in our dataset).
  33 Chetty et al. (2014) show this is the case for the US as well. In their sample, the relation between log income of

parents and children flattens out also at the top, differently from what emerges from Italian data.

the childhood years of the adult sons, an instrumental variable (usually education) is used to
predict income. Next, this instrument, present in the children’s dataset as well, is used to im-
pute a pseudo father income value to each child record. These studies all obtain estimates of the
IGE ranging between 0.35 and 0.55, and hence higher than ours. Point estimates, though, are
rather imprecise because of the small sample sizes (2,000-3,000 observations) (Barbieri et al.,
2018; Cannari and D’Alessio, 2018).34
    We have made an attempt to replicate this methodology as closely as possible on our data
running an exercise ‘as if’ we did not have fathers matched with children, but only two separate
cross-sections. In the absence of education among our observables, we use father’s province of
birth as an instrument. An F-statistic over 200 for this first stage rules out a weak instrument
problem. The IGE estimated from observed child income and imputed father’s income is 0.40.
This value is much larger than our actual estimate of IGE and in the range of existing estimates
reported above.35
    These findings establish the presence of an upward bias in this procedure. The most likely
reason is that the instrument commonly used in this literature, father’s education, has an in-
  34 This   gap between methodologies exists also for the U.S. For example, when Björklund and Jäntti (1997) use
this same imputation procedure on U.S. data they arrive at an IGE between 0.4 and 0.5, compared to an estimate
around 0.35 obtained by the authors themselves on PSID and by Chetty et al. (2014) on matched father-son tax-
return data.
  35 It is also much more precisely estimated (S.E. = 0.02), given that our sample size is over 200 times larger than

that of existing studies



                                                                                  24
dependent effect on child’s income beyond parental income. In our replication, we chose as
instrument a variable that is strongly correlated with father’s income and yet the least likely ex-
ante, among those available, to separately impact child income.36 Yet, when we regress child
income on actual father’s income and father’s province of birth in our dataset with matched fa-
thers and sons where we observe income for both, we find that the instrument remains strongly
significant confirming the source of upward bias. In other words, it appears that the key chal-
lenge in this approach is finding a valid instrument.


4.4   Analysis for different population subgroups

Tables 3 to 5 report results for various subgroups of the population of children. In all these
cases, the position of parents and children remains the same: it is the national distribution of
the core sample of column (1) in Table 3.
   Comparing males and females and focusing on the RRS, it appears that relative mobility is
higher for women. However, the AUM index and the Q1Q5 transition rate reveal that women
have significantly lower absolute upward mobility. If we take a boy and a girl both from fam-
ilies in the bottom quintile, the probability for the boy of reaching the top quintile is almost
twice as large. One of the determinants behind this result is that in Italy female labor force
participation is still quite low (it was below 40 pct in 2013). However, these differences in up-
ward mobility across genders disappear once we estimate AUM and Q1Q5 separately using
gender-specific income distributions for children.
   When we condition on the major source of parental income (labor, self-employment, and
capital) in Table 4, we find significantly higher upward mobility only for the children of self-
employed professionals (e.g., artisans, architects, lawyers, doctors, pharmacists): the Q1Q5 is
three times larger than for sons of wage earners. Relative rank persistence at the top is extremely
high for this group as well: the TMR is above 6.
   Table 5 shows that children who, in 2012, reside in a different region from the one where
their parents lived in 1998 (movers) display much higher economic mobility. For example,
their Q1Q5 transition rate is 0.17 compared to a baseline value of 0.10, and their AUM index
is the 54th percentile, relative to a baseline value equal to the 44th percentile. Therefore, a
 36 Other available variables are:   province of residence, marital status, major source of income, occupational code.

geographical move is strongly associated with an upward move in economic conditions. This
is also true, but to a lesser extent, for children of fathers who are themselves movers, i.e., for
those who in 1998 lived in a different region from the one where they were born, including
foreign born (last column).


4.4.1     Alternative definition of parental income

Tables A3 to A5 in the Appendix repeat our analysis of national mobility and all these exercises
on subgroups of the population for two alternative definitions of parental income: income of
the father and income of the top earner of the household (which is the father in 87% of the
cases). In both instances, results are very similar to those based on our baseline definition.
Tables A6 to A9 in the Appendix report mobility measures and transition matrices considering
only income of male children and income of fathers —thus the most comparable definitions
across generations. Mobility estimates are very close to their baseline counterparts. The RRS
and the Q1Q5 are 0.257 and 0.105, respectively, compared to 0.246 and 0.099 in the baseline.


4.5       Siblings

Our dataset does not contain explicit identifiers for siblings. Given the information available,
we can however recover siblings by matching children that have the same parental record, i.e.,
a record for parents that coincides with respect to all the variables in our dataset. Through this
procedure, we are able to identify around 70,000 parents with at least two children.37 In order
to control for the impact of age on income of siblings, we restrict the sample to cases where,
in our dataset, we see the siblings at approximately the same age. Specifically, we restrict to
children who are 36 or 37 years old in 2012 –around the mean age of children in our dataset–,
leaving us with around 18,500 records of parents with at least two children.
    We exploit this sample of siblings to explore the role of common parental background vs.
exposure to lifetime shocks for upward mobility. We find that the mean absolute rank differ-
entials between siblings is 0.26. Since the mean absolute difference of a uniform distribution is
0.33, we conclude that according to this metric parental background accounts for roughly 20%
  37 By requiring a perfect match for all the variables in the dataset, we impose a very restrictive criterion, but we
prefer to end up with a smaller sample without false positives to avoid any sort of measurement error.

of the total variation of individual outcomes.38 This share is in the range of the estimates of
siblings correlation reported by Jäntti and Jenkins (2015, Table 9) for a number of countries.
     One can refine the analysis by asking whether there is any systematic difference between
first-born and later-born children in terms of upward mobility.39 Table 6 shows the results
of our analysis. We find that the expected rank of first-born children is between 0.2 and 1.6
percentiles higher. Interestingly, this gap increases with parental income, and it doubles as
one moves from the bottom to the top of the parental income distribution. It is statistically
significant, however, only for families at the top of the income distribution.



5      Corrections for potential sources of bias
In this Section, we verify the robustness of our analysis with respect to three potential sources
of bias: (i) attenuation bias due to the combination of a short sample and volatile income; (ii)
dependence bias stemming from the inability to link children who in 1998 are already indepen-
dent taxpayers to their parents; (iii) the omission of certain types of taxpayers from our sample
and the under-reporting of income for those in the sample because of tax evasion.


5.1      Attenuation bias

In Section 3 we already argued that a 3-year average of income measured around ages 37 for
children and 50 for parents is very strongly correlated with lifetime income. Here, in order to
quantify more precisely the attenuation bias in our estimates, we perform the following simu-
lation. We start by estimating a common life-cycle earnings profile from our data. To do this,
we pool fathers and sons in order to have data for the longest possible age range and estimate
a quartic polynomial in age.40 Next, we residualize earnings with respect to this age profile.
    38 The
         more traditional estimate of the relative importance of parental background, siblings correlation, is 0.19 in
our data and hence almost identical.
   39 Note that, as said before, we are restricting to siblings with approximately the same age. Some of the children

we label as ‘first born’ may have older siblings who we do not observe because of our age restrictions on the
sample. However, these cases would only arise in families with at least 3 children, which are only 6% of the total
number of Italian families. If birth order matters, and this is what we find, this source of bias attenuates the true
effect because of a few spurious cases among those who we identify as ‘first-born’.
   40 We normalize average earnings of the sons to the value of that of the fathers for the range over which they

overlap, 30-40.



                                                         27
We assume a time-stationary persistent-transitory process for log residual earnings, a common
representation in the literature on income dynamics:

                                          j         j        j

                                        κi,t = ρ j κi,t−1 + ηi,t ,   t>0

                                                                                    j

with variance ση and the ei,t is an uncorrelated shock with variance σe . The two shocks are
                                                                                                      j

Appendix. Table 10 reports these parameter estimates. It is remarkable how much more ad-
ditional volatility sons’ earnings display relative to fathers’ earnings. We conjecture this is the
outcome of the Italian labor market reforms implemented over the last two decades.41 These
reforms introduced flexibility both at entry (with an expansion of temporary contracts) and at
exit, but they affected only new hires as the vast majority of older cohorts was hired under the
old permanent contracts that were not affected by these changes in legislation.
       The experiment then proceeds as follows. We run 100 simulations of a panel of 323,856
father-son pairs (the number of pairs in our dataset) for 25 years, and compute for each father
and son their average lifetime income (the ideal measure of permanent income) and the average
income over three consecutive years (the noisy measure of permanent income that we have
available): at ages 50-52 for fathers and 38-40 for sons. In these simulations we use both the
estimated deterministic age profile and the stochastic component of income. We set ρ0 = 0.78 in
order to reproduce our estimated value of the rank-rank slope in the national distribution using
the three-year proxy for income. Then we compute the rank-rank slope and other mobility
statistics using average lifetime income.
    41 This
        finding remains true even when controlling for age, i.e. when focusing on fathers who, in 1998, have the
same age as children in 2012. The two major reforms in our sample period were the Treu Package (1997) and the
Biagi Law (2003).


                                                        28
   Table 11 reports average mobility statistics across simulations. The bottom line is that the
short sample induces a downward bias in relative mobility of around 20%, i.e. the true RRS
would be 0.30 instead of 0.25. Our estimates of the AUM and Q1Q5 are even more robust.


5.2   Dependency bias

Our preliminary analysis of Section 3.2 already suggests that the sample of dependent children
is quite representative of the universe of children in most dimensions. Nevertheless, here we
make a formal attempt to assess the size of the dependency bias.
   Recall that in our dataset we have information on all children aged 29-40 in 2012, but only
on the parents who claim some of those children as dependent in 1998. In addition, we have
access to detailed tabulations of the income distribution of all taxpayers in the same age group
as the linked parents in 1998, i.e. all potential parents of those children.
   Our first step is to reweigh the sample of matched fathers in our dataset in order to re-
align their income distribution to the unconditional one. Second, we merge the sample of
non-dependent children with the sample of dependents. We then estimate a Probit model of
dependency status for children in 1998 as a function of their observable characteristics (gen-
der, age, province of birth, income percentile, major income component, and interactions). The
R-squared of this regression is 0.21. Finally, we use these probabilities to reweigh the sample
of linked parent-child pairs. If we let Xi be the set of observables for child i and di its depen-
dency status, that observation is reweighed by dividing it by Pr(di = 1| Xi ) as predicted by the
regression. In essence, this correction is a propensity-score reweighing based on selection on
observables.
   With this correction, our estimates of RRS, AUM and Q1Q5 are 0.262, 0.435 and 0.098, re-
spectively (Table 12). Therefore, the sample selection induced by the dependence status leads
us to moderately understate the degree of rank persistence (0.246 instead of 0.262), but upward
mobility measures are essentially unaffected.




                                                 29
5.3     Omission of certain taxpayers and tax evasion

5.3.1   Omission of taxpayers who filed form 770

In Section 3 we explained that our sample of 730 and MU tax returns does not include individu-
als who file tax form 770. These missing observations may distort our results because this group
of individuals is not representative of the population in terms of income levels and sources of
income. Therefore, our rank ordering may be incorrect.
    Here we propose a simple correction for this selection bias. First, we collect aggregated data
on the number of forms 770 submitted by region and by 20 income classes which are published
yearly by the Ministry of Economy and Finance. Next, we identify the taxpayers in our dataset
of parents who are comparable with those who filed form 770.42 We then split these taxpayers
into the same 20 income groups, region by region. Finally, we reweigh each observation in an
income/region cell by a factor equal to the ratio of total taxpayers (730+MU+770) to 730+MU
taxpayers in that cell. Table 12 reports the results of this reweighing procedure and shows that
our estimates of intergenerational mobility are robust to this correction.


5.3.2   Tax evasion

Italy is notoriously a country with high tax evasion. The size of the non-observed economy was
estimated by the Italian National Statistical Institute to be as large as 12.1 percent of GDP in
2014 - the last year considered in our study. A common rate of tax evasion across the popula-
tion would not affect relative ranks and estimates of mobility, but this benchmark is far from
reality. Tax evasion rates differ significantly across earner categories. For dependent workers
and retirees, taxes are withheld at the source. Thus, evasion is nearly impossible for these cate-
gories of earners, if we exclude illegal workers who are not in the sample.43 Self-employment
and rental income, instead, is much easier to hide.
    The best available estimates of tax evasion are based on a comparison between survey data
(SHIW) and administrative tax return data. The key assumption is that self-reported income in
  42 Specifically,this means looking for taxpayers who have only labor income and rental income below 568 Euros
in 1998. The key reason why these taxpayers opted for the forms 730 or MU instead of the form 770 is because they
claim itemized deductions (e.g., for medical expenses, mortgage interests, charitable donations, etc.).
   43 Tax evasion by illegal dependent workers accounted for 4.5% of total tax evasion in Italy between 2013 and

2015, according to official sources.



                                                       30
surveys is much closer to the truth since survey respondents are protected by anonymity due to
privacy laws. These studies compute average after-tax income from survey and tax returns for
groups of earners with the same type of income, income decile, and region. They confirm rates
of tax evasion near zero for dependent workers.44 Tax evasion rates are, instead, estimated
to be higher for other sources of income. Marino and Zizza (2012) estimate average rates of
tax evasion around 40% for self-employment income and up to 80% for rental income. Fiorio
and D’Amuri (2005) show that tax evasion rates decline steeply with the level of income. For
example, for the self-employed, tax evasion rises from 8% of reported gross income in the top
decile to 70% in the lowest decile.
   We use these sources to inflate these types of income in all our records for both children
and parents. The corrected estimates of intergenerational mobility in Table 12 imply a sensible
increase of the RRS and a smaller reduction in the upward indexes. Intuitively, if self-employed
parents under-report income and their children do not, for example because they are dependent
workers (or the other way around), mobility would be overestimated.
   In the Appendix, we describe two other corrections that leave our estimates barely un-
changed: the omission of poor children, and missing capital income.


5.4   Taking stock: combining the sources of bias

As seen in this section and Section 4, some of the sources of bias shift our point estimates up-
ward and others downward. Here, we consider all the major ones to assess the overall potential
bias in our baseline calculations for relative and upward mobility.
   Table 12 shows that combining the dependency bias, the bias coming from the omission of
certain taxpayers, and the bias originating from tax evasion pushes up the RRS to 0.30. This
compounded correction has a smaller impact on the index of AUM and the Q1Q5.
   One could then further correct these estimates by the attenuation bias computed in our
simulations of Section 5.1. Applying the same proportional factors we obtained for the baseline
estimates, one would arrive at a RRS of 0.36, an index of AUM of 0.41 and a Q1Q5 of 0.074.
These values should be considered a lower bound for our estimates of the level of mobility in
Italy for a number of reasons. For example, as seen previously, by deflating income with local
 44 Recall   that our comparison of Section 3.4 is in fact based on wage income.

price indexes, our estimates of mobility would indicate higher levels of mobility.



6      Cross-country comparison
In our core sample, the rank-rank slope (RRS) is 0.25 and the index of absolute upward mobility
is 0.44. How does this estimated level of intergenerational mobility in Italy compare to that
estimated in other countries? We limit our comparison to studies that used large administrative
datasets like ours.
     The estimate of the RRS for Denmark is 0.18 – corresponding to an AUM index of 0.46
– (Boserup et al., 2017). Schnelle (2015) reports a RRS of 0.19 for Norway. Deutscher and
Mazumder (2019) measures a RRS of 0.21 and an AUM index of 0.45 for Australia. Heidrich
(2017) estimates a RRS of 0.24 for Sweden. Corak (2017) reports a RRS of 0.24 and AUM index
of 0.44 for Canada. The United States have a higher RRS, around 0.34, with an AUM index of
0.41 (Chetty et al., 2014). Thus, Italy’s level of intergenerational mobility lies between that of
Scandinavian countries and that of the United States.45
     As we argued in Section 2, these cross-country comparisons of positional mobility can be
    45 An
        important caveat, when comparing these measures is that, for many of these countries, child income cor-
responds to family income, whereas for Italy it is individual income. Chetty et al. (2014) compute the RRS for both
definitions of child income. Their estimates show that the RRS computed based on family income of the child is 20
pct higher than the RRS estimated on individual child income. Applying this correction coefficient to our estimate,
the RRS for Italy would be closer to that of the United States.


                                                                       32
misleading if countries differ in their level of income inequality. The OECD Income Distribu-
tion Database reports Gini indexes of gross income around 0.30 for Denmark, Norway, and
Sweden, around 0.36 for Canada and Italy and 0.44 for the United States. Higher inequality
in the United States compared to Italy translates mechanically in higher rank persistence, but
this does not mean that mobility in the United States is necessarily lower: children from low
income US families can increase their income, relative to their parents, even more than their
Italian counterparts, and yet climb fewer percentiles in the distribution compared to Italian
children.
     To circumvent this problem, we explore the behavior of the measure in equation (8), the
probability that the income of the child is 50 percent higher than parental income, after normal-
izing the parent and child distributions so that they have the same mean.46
     Figure 8 depicts this probability of upward transition for both the United States and Italy
at each percentile of the distribution of parental income. The plot shows that this index of
upward mobility is significantly higher for Italy among poor households. However, after the
third decile or so, thus for the middle class as well, upward mobility becomes stronger for the
United States.



7       Geographical variation
To investigate the geographical variation in intergenerational mobility within the country, we
focus on provinces. A province is an administrative division of intermediate level between a
municipality and a region. Over the period 1998-2012 the number of provinces increased from
103 to 110. We use the geographic partition in 110 provinces established in 2009. Figure A2 in
the Appendix contains a map of the Italian provinces and Tables A10-A12 list all the provinces,
their population, region and macro area (North-East, North-West, Center, South and Islands).
The average population of a province was 551,000 as of 2010, but there is large heterogeneity.
The largest province, Rome, has over 4 million residents and contains 121 different municipali-
ties. The smallest province, Ogliastra (Sardinia), has less than 60,000 residents and includes 23
municipalities.
    46 This
        normalization corrects both for aggregate growth between 19980 and 2012 and for the fact that parental
income includes income from both spouses while child income is for the individual only.

   In order to analyze the province-level variation in mobility measures, we assign each child
to the province that her father indicated as the province of residence in his own 1998 tax return.
Such province is interpreted as the area where the children grew up, not necessarily as the area
where they live as adults.
   We document mobility at the provincial level using the same definitions of parental and
child income and the same (core) sample we used for the national analysis of Section 4 and Table
3, column (1). Income ranks for children and parents are defined with respect to their national
distributions. We also report mobility statistics on incomes adjusted for different purchasing
power at the regional level as described in Section 4.1.47
   The extent of the difference in relative and upward mobility across provinces is summa-
rized by Tables 13 and 14. These tables report mobility measure for the top-ten and bottom-ten
provinces among the largest fifty provinces in Italy based on resident population in 2010. The
full ranking of the 110 provinces is in the Appendix.

in that section, the different local price indexes we could use are all highly correlated. Figure A6 in the Ap-
pendix shows geographic variation in AUM and Q1Q5 after adjusting income for different purchasing power at
the province level using the index constructed by Boeri et al. (2018).

emerge from this figure. First, there is substantial heterogeneity in upward mobility across
provinces. The interquartile range of AUM across provinces is 0.12, almost twice as large as
the one estimated by Chetty et al. (2014) across the 700 US commuting zones. Second, upward
mobility has a clear North-South gradient, and is highest in the North-East of the country, espe-
cially in the regions of Veneto, Lombardia, and Emilia-Romagna. A within-between-macro area
variance decomposition for AUM implies the between component, i.e. variation in AUM across
the four macro areas (North-East, North-West, Center, South and Islands), accounts for 80% of
the total variation of AUM across the 110 provinces. For example, the highest-ranked province
for AUM not in the North-East or North-West is Prato (Tuscany) at position 37/110. The lowest-
ranked province for AUM not in the South and Islands macro-region is Latina (Lazio) at posi-
tion 75/110.48
    Quantitatively these differences are meaningful. The province with the highest AUM is
Bolzano (Trentino-Alto Adige), with a value of 0.63 and the one with the lowest AUM index
is Ragusa (Sicily), with a value of 0.36. This expected rank differential corresponds to nearly
9,000 Euros of annual income in 2012, and hence, it translates into substantial gaps in children’s
lifetime incomes.
    Panel (b) of Figure 9 reveals that, once adjusting for different cost-of-living levels across
  48 Interestingly, Prato is the province with the largest Chinese community in Italy (15% of population) because
of its vibrant textile sector. Latina, on the contrary, is a rural area with a predominantly agricultural economy.

regions, the predominance of the North-East macro area in terms of upward mobility is accen-
tuated. However, now a few pockets of upward mobility emerge also in Southern Italy.
   These differences in upward mobility are equally pronounced for the Q1-Q5, i.e. the proba-
bility that a child from a family in the bottom quintile of the national income distribution makes
it to the top quintile, as shown in Figure 10. The least mobile provinces have transition rates
around 4-5% and the most mobile around 24-25%, i.e. larger by a factor of five. As evident from
the heat maps, the correlation between AUM and Q1Q5 indicators is very strong (0.94).
   Geographical dispersion is also high for relative mobility. For children growing up in Tre-
viso (Veneto), being born from a family at the bottom of the national income distribution trans-
lates into only 12 percentiles of rank differential compared to someone born from parents at the
top of the distribution. For children growing up in Bari (Puglia) —the one with the highest RRS
among the largest provinces), it translates into a gap twice as big, i.e., 24 percentiles.
   Figure 11 plots the full rank-rank relation in two of Italy’s largest metropolitan areas, Milan
and Bari. Milan (shown in blue) displays a rank-rank relationship that is both flatter and ev-
erywhere higher compared to Bari (shown in red). Through the lenses of a utilitarian planner,
Milan dominates Bari: children who grow up in Milan fare uniformly better across the whole
income distribution and ex-post their income distribution is less unequal. Notice also that the
rank-rank relationships are quite linear even at the provincial level. We verified that this is true
for all the largest provinces —especially so for those in the North. Many of the provinces in the
South, with the lowest level of mobility, show the same sharp increase in slope at the top of the
distribution that emerges at the national level. Figures A7 and A8 in the Appendix display the
rank-rank relationship for the top and bottom eight provinces.
   We conclude that areas in Northern Italy (especially the regions in the North East), rela-
tive to the South, are both more egalitarian (higher relative mobility) and more upward mobile
(higher absolute mobility). In the North, children from parents with unequal background are
more similar in their economic outcomes when adults, and children from poor parents fare bet-
ter when adults. Recall that, as explained in Section 2, while at the national level RRS and AUM
are tightly linked, at the level of a province it needs not be the case. Equation (7) makes it clear
that the AUM can be higher either because the constant of the regression is high, or because
the slope is high. In our data, it turns out that constant and slope are strongly negatively cor-
related (the correlation coefficient is −0.78), but most of the variation in AUM across provinces

                                                 36
is accounted for by the constant terms, suggesting that the province effect materializes mostly
through moving every child raised in that province up or down in the national income distri-
bution, independently of their parental rank. An important implication of this finding is that
provinces with high (low) upward mobility also feature low (high) downward mobility.49
    A possible source of concern with our analysis may be that the stark geographical variation
in mobility that we have documented is driven by the large gaps in the level and growth of
income between the North and the South of Italy. For example, if the distribution of income in
the South is shifted to the left, when computing AUM using the national distribution, upward
mobility in the South would be mechanically lower.50 Moreover, in the absence of geographical
migration among children, if the South grows less than the North, again, mechanically, upward
mobility would be lower in the South.
    In order to address this concern, we perform two exercises. In the first one, when we com-
pute indexes of mobility of a province, we reweigh observations in each bin (e.g., decile) by
the ratio between the share of fathers in that bin of the national distribution (e.g., 0.1) and the
share of fathers in the same bin residing in that province. We find that the mobility estimates
by province are barely affected. In our second exercise, instead of ranking parents and children
with respect to their national income distributions, we rank them relative to the distribution of
income in the region of residence of the father. Then, for each province, we estimate RRS, AUM
and Q1Q5 with ranks computed from these regional distributions. Note that this approach
implicitly assumes that each region is a separate entity from the others. Estimates of mobil-
ity computed this way are more affected, but the overall patterns are robust: the correlations
between RRS, AUM and Q1Q5 across provinces when measuring mobility with respect to the
national vs. regional income distributions are respectively 0.94, 0.43 and 0.52, and all highly
significant.
  49 For  example, the cross-province correlation between Q1Q5 and Q5Q1 –the probability of moving from the top
quintile to the bottom quintile of the income distribution– is -0.81.
   50 As argued in Section 2, using the 25th percentile of the national parental distribution —which is what we do—

already largely solves this problem.

7.1    Is there a Great Gatsby curve within Italy?

The term Great Gatsby curve refers to a negative relation between income inequality and inter-
generational mobility. This relationship has been extensively documented using cross-country
variation and often interpreted as the outcome of different institutions. The stark geographical
heterogeneity across Italian provinces provides us with a source of variation while controlling
for national-level institutions.
   We report our results in Tables 15 and 16 for absolute and relative mobility, respectively. It
is not surprising the relation exists: when inequality is higher, the rungs of the income ladder
are further apart and it becomes more difficult to move. It is interesting to observe that, while
the 90-10 income ratio is highly significant, the Gini coefficient is less so. The tables reveal
that it is the Gini coefficient computed on the bottom 99% of the distribution that is strongly
negatively related with mobility. Somewhat surprisingly, the income share of the top 1% is
positively correlated with mobility. This result contrasts with the finding for the United States
where the top income share is negatively correlated too (Table V in Chetty et al. (2014)).51 In
Italy, the top income share is highly positively correlated with the fraction of entrepreneurs
and professionals in the province, and we observed earlier that upward mobility is higher for
children of families with a large component of self-employment income.
  51 The   top income share instead is not significantly correlated with relative mobility in Chetty et al. (2014).




                                                                                    38
7.2    Comparison with Informational Content of Surname indexes

Reliable estimates of intergenerational mobility require large datasets that link successive gen-
erations, like ours. Such datasets only exist for a handful of countries and, until few years ago,
were not available at all. Therefore, it is always useful to propose alternative approaches to the
measurement of intergenerational mobility that have less strict data requirements.
    Güell et al. (2015) introduced a new indicator that overcomes some of these difficulties, the
Informational Content of Surnames (ICS). The minimal data required for this methodology is
a cross-section of individual records with information on income and on the surname of the
individual. The data are then used to construct an indicator of the capacity of family names
to capture the variance of the outcomes. The basic idea is simple. Surnames are intrinsically
irrelevant for the determination of economic outcomes, but they get passed from one generation
to the next, alongside other determinants of outcomes, such as ability and wealth, for example.
The more these inherited characteristics matter for economic outcomes, the more information
surnames contain on the values of outcomes (the higher is the ICS index), and the lower the
degree of social mobility.
    In a recent paper, Güell et al. (2018) have constructed ICS indicators of social mobility at the
level of Italian provinces and correlated them with many socio-economic indicators.52 Here we
have the opportunity, for the first time, to assess how well the ICS index correlates with more
direct measures of intergenerational mobility based on rich administrative data. This validation
exercise has never been performed before.
    In Table 17 we report the cross-province correlation between the various ICS indexes calcu-
lated by Güell et al. (2018) and two of our measures of upward mobility, the AUM index and the
Q1Q5 transition rates, also computed at the level of provinces. The Spearman rank correlation
index (which takes values between -1 and 1) is negative, as expected, and highly statistically
significant. However, Figure 12, which contains a scatterplot of standardized measures of ICS
and AUM by province, shows that this statistical relationship is strong only for provinces with
high values of the ICS index. The correlation between these two measures for areas with ICS
  52 Güell et al. (2018) use data from a single cross-section of official tax returns in Italy for the year 2005 which
contain surnames. The origin of these data is peculiar. They appeared online on the website of the Italian Ministry
of Finance on April 30th 2008. This act was supposed to be part of a general strategy to fight tax evasion through
social stigma. The Italian Data Protection Authority quickly ordered the Ministry to take down the website, but at
that point the data had already been downloaded and became publicly available.

below the mean is essentially zero.53 In other words, the informational content of ICS about
true mobility is very limited when the ICS is low: according to Figure 12, the ICS is a poor
proxy of true upward mobility in at least half of Italian provinces. In light of this last finding,
we conclude that researchers should be cautious in using this index.



8      What correlates with upward mobility?
The goal of this section is to make a first step towards understanding what local characteristics
can account for the divergence in upward mobility across Italian provinces that we documented
in Section 7. We do not claim that the correlations we uncover should be interpreted as causal
relations, but they surely serve to guide future research on the deeper determinants of intergen-
erational mobility. A similar analysis has been recently performed by Chetty et al. (2014) for the
United States and by Güell et al. (2018) for Italy, using the ICS indicator.54
     We start from a large set of correlates based on the literature. The list includes numerous
local socio-economic indicators (Sistema di Indicatori Territoriali, or Local Indicator System)
    53 The
         outlier in the top-right corner of the graph (with high ICS and AUM) is Bolzano, a largely German-
speaking province.
   54 Compared to Güell et al. (2018), we also include indicators of school quality that turn out to be very important.

Moreover, they only report unconditional correlations, while we go beyond that. Finally, as just explained, the ICS
is very weakly correlated with true mobility for many provinces.



                                                                           40
compiled by the National Statistical Institute (ISTAT) for seven broad categories: (i) productiv-
ity (e.g., value added per resident); (ii) criminal activity of various types (e.g., scams, protested
checks, drug offenses, thefts, murders); (iii) family instability (e.g., separations, divorces, chil-
dren in custody); (iv) labor market conditions (e.g., unemployment rate, labor force participa-
tion rate); (v) life expectancy; (vi) openness to trade and migration; (vii) social capital (e.g., the
indicators proposed by Guiso et al. (2004) and Guiso et al. (2016)).
   To these, we add indicators of educational attainment and a vast array of markers of school
quality obtained from a national report on the performance of the local school system (Tut-
toscuola, 2007). This set of indicators is organized by school level and by broad category. School
levels are four: pre-school, primary school, middle school, and high school. Categories are:
school resources and structures (e.g., local government spending in education as a share of to-
tal spending), school organization and services (e.g. transportation, extended teaching time,
administrative efficiency, students per class), teachers’ composition (e.g., teaching hours, teach-
ers’ age and gender, teachers on temporary contracts), students’ test and examination scores.55
A detailed description of our set of raw indicators is provided in Tables A16 and A17 in the
Appendix.
   We begin by documenting unconditional cross-province correlations between two measures
of intergenerational mobility, AUM and Q1Q5, and these socio-economic markers. Tables 18,
19 and 20 summarize the results for a subset of these indicators. In general, most variables
correlate with mobility indexes with the expected sign and those that do not are insignificant or
mildly significant. The correlation with measures of economic and labor market conditions (in
particular female participation, youth unemployment and long-term unemployment) are very
strong. The educational attainment of residents in a province is also positively associated with
upward mobility. Among the social capital indicators, the self-efficacy index is strongly corre-
lated with upward mobility. This is an index measuring beliefs in one’s own ability to complete
tasks and reach goals among children that Guiso et al. (2016) take as a proxy of a local culture
of individual empowerment. Crime statistics do not show a strong association (and when they
do, the sign is generally unexpected), while the age structure and indexes of family instability
  55 The Tuttoscuola report is based on the geographical partition of Italy into 103 provinces which had been
adopted until 2001. Moreover, quality of schools indicators from this report exclude the provinces of Aosta,
Bolzano and Trento due to limited data availability. As a result, whenever we use these school quality indica-
tors our analysis is limited to 100 provinces.


                                                     41
do. The fraction of foreign-born and population inflows show a tight correlation with upward
mobility. Finally, many of the measures of school quality —such as their structures, students
per class, share of young teachers and test scores— are closely associated with upward mobil-
ity.56 Adding macro-areas fixed effects reduces substantially the values of the correlations and
many of them —in particular, a number of school quality indicators— lose their significance.
    A limitation of these unconditional associations is that all socio-economic variables are
strongly correlated among each other. We therefore move to a multivariate conditional correla-
tion analysis. Given the sheer number of possible covariates, we begin by reducing the number
of variables into a small number of principal components for each category which captures
a significant portion of the variation of the original variables in the category. Each principal
component that we retain is then weighted in the index in proportion to the overall variance it
explains. We retain 4 principal components for school quality, 2 principal components for crime,
and 1 principal component for all other indicators considered (family instability, labor market
conditions, life expectancy, economic openness, social capital, educational attainment).57 We
also include a measure of productivity. Finally, we include in the regression a measure of in-
come inequality (the 90-10 ratio) that we found strongly significant in our analysis of Section
7.1.58
    Table 21 presents the results of the multivariate regression of Absolute Upward Mobility
(AUM) on the factors we construct for each dimension of interest.59 Overall, the included cate-
gories explain a very large portion of the variation of AUM (nearly 90%). The state of the local
labor market is the factor with the strongest correlation with AUM. This factor loads positively
on various measures of occupation and labor force participation, and negatively on measures
of unemployment. The second variable in terms of strength of correlation with AUM is school
  56 It may appear surprising that the share of teachers with temporary contracts shows such robust positive cor-
relation. The reason is that it is very collinear with the share of young teachers: the correlation between the two
variables is 0.74 for pre-school teachers and it decreases monotonically to 0.33 for high-school teachers but remains
statistically significant at 1% level. Indeed, our indicator of teachers’ stability shows a strong positive correlation
as well.
   57 When constructing the disaggregated indexes for school quality, we retain 1 principal component for school

resources and structures, school organization and services, teachers’ composition, students’ grades and test scores,
while we retain 3 to 4 principal components when constructing the indexes of school quality by school level (pre-
school, primary school, middle school, and high school).
   58 Tables A18-A22 in the Appendix describe the underlying markers used to construct each index in this condi-

tional correlation analysis, and the source of each marker.
   59 Variables are normalized to have mean 0 and standard deviation of 1, so regression coefficients can be inter-

preted as correlation coefficients.

                                                          42
quality. When disaggregating this factor into sub-categories, we find that the factor summa-
rizing teachers’ composition is the one which more strongly correlates with AUM. This factor
loads positively on the average number of teaching hours available to each class, the share of
male and young teachers, and teachers’ tenure and stability in their position, and negatively on
measures of teachers employed under temporary contracts. Also students’ test scores is highly
significant. When disaggregating the school quality index into school levels, the strongest effect
is found for pre-school quality.
   With respect to other correlates, family instability has a sizable correlation with AUM. We
observe that the social capital index (which loads positively on measures of blood donation,
number of non-profit organizations, voter turnout in the election of the Italian House of Repre-
sentatives, and self-efficacy) has no longer any statistically significant relationship with AUM.
This appears to be due to the strong correlation between the social capital and state of the labor
market indexes. Excluding the measure of labor market conditions, social capital has a posi-
tive and statistically significant relationship with AUM. Finally, we find a positive correlation
between value added per resident and upward mobility. The crime factor has no systematic
relationship with upward mobility conditional on other observables.60


8.1   An attempt at establishing causality

Our geographical analysis has documented a large geographical variation in the level of eco-
nomic mobility. We have also uncovered that certain fixed characteristics of provinces (such
as school quality, labor market conditions, etc.) can, statistically, explain much of this cross-
province variation. However, so far we did not establish direct causality. For example, it is
conceivable that certain provinces display higher social mobility not just because of their better
intrinsic qualities, but also because they attract families that are more concerned with the eco-
nomic outcomes of their children and invest more time and resources in their upbringing. How
do we distinguish the role of the province from the unobserved attitudes of parents who reside
in those provinces?
   In the spirit of Nakamura et al. (2016), we make an attempt to establish causality in the role
of provinces as determinants of social mobility by exploiting an exogenous shock that forced
 60 Somewhat   puzzling, life expectancy remains significant but not with the expected sign.


                                                       43
thousands of Italian families to migrate. The event is a violent earthquake (6.9 on the Richter
scale) which took place in November 1980 and hit two regions of the South of Italy, Basilicata
and Campania, causing nearly three thousand fatalities and enormous damages to hundreds of
local villages. Over one hundred thousand families were forced to relocate because their houses
were destroyed or severely damaged by the seism.
    In our data, we can identify children who were born (all before 1980) in the three provinces
that were hit hardest by the earthquake (Salerno, Potenza, and Avellino). Some of them have
parents who still resided in those provinces in 1998 (stayers), while others have parents who,
over that period, migrated to a different province (movers).61
    We will work off two assumptions. First, these parents who migrated did so only because
of the earthquake. Unfortunately, we cannot observe the precise year parents moved, so some
of them may have migrated earlier or later, for different reasons. Support in favor of the hy-
pothesis that many moves from those provinces over that period must have been induced by
this unique event comes from comparing the migration rate of parents with children born in
these three seism-hit provinces to the migration rate of parents with children born in all other
provinces of the same two regions (Campania and Basilicata). We find that in the first group the
migration rate is 0.074 and in the second group it is 0.028, and the difference is statistically sig-
nificant at any level. The second assumption is that the selection between movers and stayers,
within parental income rank, was random.
    We compute that the expected rank of movers is 0.45. As a benchmark of comparison, we
compute the expected rank of stayers conditional on the joint distribution of province of origin
and rank of movers. This number captures the counterfactual expected child rank that would
have realized if the parents of movers did not migrate. This counterfactual expected rank is
0.39. The difference between these two numbers should be interpreted as the differential effect
of the provinces of destination, controlling for selection in the population of residents.62
    Since the expected rank in a province/percentile pair is the sum of the province effect and
the selection effect coming from the composition of the resident population, intuitively, we
should find that the expected rank of residents of the destination provinces, conditional on the

South: Napoli, Benevento, Matera, Caserta and Cosenza.
  62 The 99% confidence interval for the difference, obtained through bootstrapping with 100 repetitions, is [0.04,

0.08].

distribution of parental rank of movers, is certainly larger than 0.39 and larger than 0.45 only if
this selection effect is strong. We estimate it to be 0.54.63 Taken at face value, this result would
suggest that around half of the province effect is due to selection of the resident population and
the other half is the result of local socio-economic conditions.



9      Conclusions
Our paper is the first to estimate intergenerational income mobility in Italy. None of the publicly
available surveys for Italy spans two generations. For this reason, thus far, the literature on
intergenerational mobility in Italy has used other socio-economic outcomes such as education
and occupation, other proxies such as the Informational Content of Surnames, or imputation
procedures to obtain crude estimates of incomes for successive cohorts.
     The micro data underlying our empirical analysis are obtained from an administrative database
of tax returns, where we link two generations through SSNs of parents and children. As rich as
they are, the data are not perfect and thus our analysis is not without caveats. Attenuation bias
due to the short panel dimension, misreporting of income due to tax evasion, and sample selec-
tion because of our ability to link generations only when children are claimed as dependent are
the main threats to the credibility of our estimates. In the paper, we dealt as best as we could
with these shortcomings, quantified their importance and concluded that our main results are
quite robust.
     Our findings contain some good news and some bad news. On the one hand, they paint
a somewhat less pessimistic picture of intergenerational mobility at the national level com-
pared to many previous studies that tend to represent Italy as a paralyzed society. Specifically,
through a simulation exercise, we show that former analyses based on imputation procedures
are likely to lead to understated estimates of national mobility. On the other hand, they reveal
acute inequality in the degree of upward mobility within the country: the North-East appears
to be a land of equal and abundant opportunities, and the South to be a land where ranks in
society endure across generations. Compared to the United States, once we adjust for the dif-
ferent levels of income inequality, Italy displays more upward mobility in the bottom tercile,
    63 The
        99% confidence interval for the difference between the 0.54 and 0.45 point estimates, obtained through
bootstrapping with 100 repetitions, is [0.08, 0.12].

but less everywhere else.
   When we exploited this geographical variation to correlate a battery of socio-economic in-
dicators with our measures of upward mobility, we uncovered that the quality of pre-school,
children’s test scores, indicators of family instability, and local labor market conditions have the
strongest association to intergenerational mobility. An empirical exercise that exploits plausi-
bly exogenous movers offers suggestive evidence that there is a causal effect of the province on
upward mobility over and above the unobserved attributes of its resident population.
   Another important results is that, even conditional on a particular percentile of the parental
national income distribution, and within a province, economic outcomes of children are vastly
different. Looking ahead, explaining this unobserved heterogeneity is one of the main chal-
lenges of this literature, and progress in this direction requires richer data on characteristics
and choices of parents and children.
   The availability of reliable estimates for Italy allows to add one important data point to
cross-country comparisons as already done recently, for example, by Alesina et al. (2018) in their
comparative study on intergenerational mobility and preferences for redistributive policies.

Table 9: National indicators of intergenerational mobility for the core sample based on PPP-
adjusted income. Standard errors in parentheses. "Real 1" to "Real 9" are estimates on the core
sample after incomes of parents and children have been adjusted for regional differences in the
price level. The numbers 1, 2, 6 and 9 denote the type of price index used, taken from Cannari
and Iuzzolino (2009). Specifically, Index 1 is constructed under the assumption that food, ap-
parel and furniture are the only consumption categories who vary in terms of price level across
regions. Index 2 also includes house price variation across regions based on data from “Osser-
vatorio sul Mercato Immobiliare" (Housing Market Monitor) within the Italian Revenue Ser-
vice. Index 6 uses rents from Bank of Italy’s Survey on Household Income and Wealth (SHIW),
instead of house prices from the Housing Market Monitor, in order to account for variation
in the cost of housing services. Moreover, for expenditure categories other than food, apparel
and furniture, regional price differences are imputed based on regression estimates using US
data. Index 9 makes different assumptions. First, rents from SHIW used in this index are ad-
justed for house quality. Second, instead of imputing values based on US estimates, regional
price differences in expenditure categories that fall into health care, maintenance, and other
services (which account for 16% of consumption expenditure) are taken from data published
by the Italian Ministry of Economic Development. These price differences are also adjusted for
service quality. The remaining 22% of consumption expenditure for which there is no direct
information is assumed to have no regional variation in price. This is the preferred index by
the authors. The last column deflates incomes based on the local indexes constructed by Boeri
et al. (2018) following the methodology proposed by Moretti (2013).

Identification and Estimation of the Income Process
   Recall the income process specified in Section 5.1 and consider first fathers. For each father in the
sample, we have at most three consecutive observations at dates t, t − 1, t − 2. The cross-sectional mo-
ments we use for estimation are:
                                           var (yt ) = var (κt ) + σε

and

                                        cov (yt , yt−1 ) = ρvar (κt−1 )

                                     cov(yt−1 , yt−2 ) = ρvar (κt−2 )

                                        cov (yt , yt−2 ) = ρ2 var (κt−2 ) ,

where
                                                                              t
                           var (κt ) = ρ2 var (κt−1 ) + σn = ρ2t σκ0 + σn ∑ ρ2( j−1) ,
                                                                          j =1

Identification can be achieved in different ways. For example:

                                       cov (yt , yt−2 )
                                ρ =
                                      cov(yt−1 , yt−2 )
                               σε   = var (yt−1 ) − ρ−1 cov(yt , yt−1 )

                               ση   = var (yt−1 ) − cov (yt , yt−2 ) − σε
                                      "                                 #
                                                               t
                              σκ0   =     var (yt ) − σε − σn ∑ ρ2( j−1) · ρ−2t .
                                                              j =1

For sons, the logic of the identification is the same with the caveat that observations are at dates t, t −
2, t − 3. To avoid contamination by outliers, we trim the top and bottom 5% of the distribution of log-
changes. The estimation methodology follows a standard minimum distance approach (Chamberlain,
1984).

Correction for the omission of poor children
   We discussed in Section 3 how individuals with very low or no income are not required to file. Our
dataset contains records of parents with missing information on children. Under the assumption that
these children did not file taxes in 2012 because their income fell below this threshold level, we can
gauge the effect of omitting poor children from our sample.
   We have 884,808 parents with missing information on children. Applying the same age selection
criteria as in the core sample, we are left with 603,426 records for parents. In the core sample, we retain
only records where children are at least 35 years old in 1998 (29% of the total). However, we do not
have information on children age for non-filers, thus we keep a random sample of 29% of our 603,426
records. For each of these records, we construct an artificial observation of a child with zero income, add
them to the core sample and re-estimate the national mobility measures. The impact of this correction is
very small: the RRS increases from 0.246 to 0.250, AUM decreases from 0.438 to to 0.437 and the Q1Q5
decreases from 0.099 to to 0.092.


Correction for missing capital income
   We have also implemented a correction for missing capital income and concluded that this potential
source of bias is insignificant. In order to impute missing capital income from tax returns we proceed
as follows. We start with Bank of Italy’s SHIW data and define two categories of capital income which
are missing in our data: interest income earned on government bonds, and other capital income (from
deposits, stocks, bonds, and mutual funds). This distinction is necessary because SHIW data are reported
after tax, and the tax withheld on government bonds is lower. We convert data into before-tax income
by using a tax rate of 12.5% for government bonds, and 26% for other capital income. For each of these
two categories, we regress capital income on dummy variables that capture i) quantile in the distribution
of total income, ii) age above/below 45 years old, iii) gender, iv) year. Using the estimated coefficients,
we impute capital income for each child, parent and year in our dataset, relying on the assumption that
the tax system being monotonic implies that the individual rank in the before-tax and after-tax income
distribution is the same. We take into account that dividends are subject to different tax rules if holdings
represent a substantial share of the stock of a firm (qualified holdings) or not. We estimate that in 2015
(2000) approximately 36% (33%) of all dividends were earned on non-qualified holdings of stocks, while
the remaining 64% (67%) corresponded to qualified holdings. Dividends from qualified holdings are
included in tax returns while dividends from non-qualified holdings are not, thus this is the portion of
capital income we are missing. We also account for the fact that starting 2004 only approximately 50% of
dividends from qualified holdings have to be reported on tax returns.
