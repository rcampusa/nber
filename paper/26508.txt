                                           ABSTRACT

Can measured risk attitudes and associated structural models predict insurance demand? In an
experiment (n = 1,730), we elicit measures of utility curvature, probability weighting, loss
aversion, and preference for certainty and use them to parameterize seventeen common structural
models (e.g., expected utility, cumulative prospect theory). Subjects also make twelve insurance
choices over different loss probabilities and prices. The insurance choices show coherence and
some correlation with various risk-attitude measures. Yet all the structural models predict
insurance poorly, often less accurately than random predictions. Simpler prediction heuristics
show more promise for predicting insurance choices across different conditions.

1       Introduction

In this paper, we consider the relationship between risk attitudes and insurance demand from a
new angle. Much of the research in this area has focused on inferring risk attitudes from observed
insurance choices. We evaluate this relationship from the other direction and instead measure
risk attitudes and then examine the extent to which these measures predict insurance decisions.
We ask two interrelated questions.1 First, do measured risk attitudes correlate with insurance de-
mand? Second, do structural models incorporating different combinations of risk attitudes (such
as expected utility or cumulative prospect theory) predict insurance choices well?
        We are motivated by an underlying tension in the literature analyzing insurance demand in
market settings. A number of studies use observed insurance choices to estimate structural models
of risk preferences, and then use those structural models to inform policy by predicting demand
in alternative market conditions (e.g., Cohen and Einav, 2007; Decarolis et al., 2019; Handel et al.,
2015). The value of these counterfactual policy evaluations hinges on whether the model predic-
tions are accurate. Papers in this literature tend to adjust for observable heterogeneity and factors
such as inertia, and these adjustments have important effects on model predictions. Yet there are
rarely opportunities to validate the underlying risk preference structure assumed in the models
using out-of-sample tests. Having the right structural model of risk attitudes is important both
for the model's out-of-sample predictions and for the validity of any welfare conclusions drawn
about policy.
        There is evidence that a range of behavioral factors may affect insurance demand, leading to
substantial misspecification for models incorporating only classic risk aversion (e.g., Abaluck and
Gruber, 2011; Abito and Salant, 2018; Barseghyan et al., 2013; Bhargava et al., 2017; Handel, 2013;
Handel and Kolstad, 2015; Sydnor, 2010). This motivates an interest in models incorporating alter-
native sources of risk attitudes, such as loss aversion and probability weighting (Barseghyan et al.,
2018). A leading example is Barseghyan et al. (2013), who estimate a more flexible structural model
and conclude that probability distortions explain choices better than classic risk aversion. It is not
yet clear, though, whether this model or other suggested behavioral models predict insurance
choices out-of-sample more accurately. It is also fundamentally challenging to separately identify
different possible behavioral models and motivations from insurance data alone. A given willing-
ness to pay for insurance can typically be rationalized by many different preference motives, and
in many studies there is not sufficient underlying variation in choice sets and loss probabilities to
differentiate these motives (Barseghyan et al., 2013; Sydnor, 2010).
    1
    We pre-specified these questions in our randomized controlled trial registration with the American Economic
Association (AEARCTR-0002783).




                                                      1
       Our focus is on measuring risk attitudes and developing structural models from one set of data
and studying how well those measures and models predict insurance decisions out-of-sample.
We use an incentivized experiment to measure risk attitudes using lottery choices and to elicit
demand for insurance in different scenarios. We conduct our experiment with students at the
University of Wisconsin­Madison and in an online experiment via Amazon's Mechanical Turk,
recruiting a total of 1,730 subjects across the two platforms. While the ultimate goal is to inform
our understanding of real insurance markets, the advantage of using a lab experiment to study
this question is that insurance demand in market settings is partly influenced by factors other
than risk attitudes, including awareness, institutional details (e.g., sales channels), and variation in
subjective beliefs about loss probabilities (Collier and Ragin, 2019). A laboratory experiment offers
a controlled environment to isolate the links between underlying risk attitudes and insurance
decisions.2 In addition, the laboratory allows us to exogenously vary the price of insurance; truly
exogenous variation in prices is rare in market data.
       We measure risk attitudes using decisions in a lottery task. The lotteries are adapted from pro-
cedures used previously in the literature (e.g., Tanaka et al., 2010) and are designed to allow us
to jointly measure different components of risk attitudes: utility curvature, probability weighting,
loss aversion, and a preference for certainty. We evaluate utility curvature and probability weight-
ing in both the gain domain and the loss domain, leading to six primitive preference motives.
For each of these motives, we calculate a nonparametric measure (an ordinal preference measure,
with no assumed functional form) and a parametric measure (with an assumed functional form).
Our parametric measures are generally in line with estimates from other studies. For instance, we
find that the majority of subjects display inverse-S probability weighting in both the gain domain
and loss domain. We also observe a median coefficient of loss aversion of 2.7, which is broadly
consistent with estimates in prior studies.
       In the insurance task, we expose participants to the possibility of a modest loss of their earnings
from a real-effort task conducted at the beginning of the experiment. Participants choose the
proportion of the potential loss they want to insure (from 0% to 100%).3 They make decisions
in twelve scenarios, which differ in the loss probability and the price of insurance (i.e., loading).
While there are no equivalent studies to benchmark these choices against, the choice patterns
vary significantly across different combinations of loads and probability, indicating that subjects
   2
     The laboratory experiment also allows us to study attitudes toward risky lotteries and insurance choices over the
same-size financial stakes.

     Throughout the paper, we use the terms "coverage level," "amount insured," and "proportion insured" inter-
changeably to describe this coverage choice. When we refer to "insurance demand," we are referring to the coverage
level chosen at a given price.

actively consider the parameters of the choice decision. Subjects also obey the law of demand on
average, in that they purchase less insurance when prices are higher.
       The answer to our first question--Do measured risk attitudes correlate with insurance demand?--
is yes, at least modestly. Within an insurance-choice scenario, we observe modest correlations
between the level of insurance chosen and our measures of utility curvature, loss aversion, and
probability weighting. For each of these three measures, we find that a one-standard deviation
increase in the measured preference motive is associated with around a 4% increase in insurance
demand. Moreover, the correlations between probability weighting and insurance choices show
the expected interaction with the loss probability--stronger probability weighting correlates more
positively with insurance demand when the loss probability is low. We find no correlation be-
tween preference for certainty and insurance demand. These findings suggest that insurance
choices are related to a number of different underlying preference motives. In particular, our
results support the idea that better understanding motives such as loss aversion and probability
weighting can have value for understanding insurance demand. None of the three main pref-
erence motives, however, is clearly more important than the others. Moreover, when evaluated
jointly, they explain only a small part of the variation in insurance choices.
       To answer to our second question--Do structural models incorporating different combinations
of risk attitudes predict insurance choices well?--we use the lottery choices to parameterize sev-
enteen utility models that have been used previously in the literature, including classic expected
utility theory, cumulative prospect theory, rank-dependent expected utility theory, and a number
of other models.4 We then predict insurance choices by determining the level of insurance which
maximizes the target function of each parameterized model for each person in each insurance
scenario.
       If we look at the correlation of these model predictions and the amount of insurance purchased
within a particular insurance scenario, the results are consistent with the modest correlations we
observe when looking at the primitive preference motives alone. The highest correlations are for
models which combine probability weighting and utility curvature (i.e., rank-dependent expected
utility and prospect theory). The parameterized utility models have some ability to predict the rel-
ative amount of insurance that different subjects select within a scenario. However, in all cases
the correlations are quite modest--in the utility model with the strongest within-scenario corre-
lations, a 10 percentage-point increase in the predicted level of insurance purchased is associated
with only a 0.8 percentage-point increase in actual insurance purchased.
   4
     For prospect theory, we consider a number of different reference points that might be employed when considering
insurance decisions. All of the models we consider are "consequentialist" in the sense that (decision) utility is a function
of the distribution of potential final wealth outcomes experienced with the choice.




                                                             3
   A key question for structural models applied to insurance demand, though, is whether they are
valuable for predicting the level of demand for insurance (as opposed to the relative demand) and
whether they can do so well across different economic scenarios. Parameterized utility models are
useful primarily if they allow one to predict behavior in a range of counterfactual environments.
We find, however, that all of the utility models, including the ones incorporating loss aversion
and probability weighting, have low overall correlation with insurance demand. In fact, each of
the parameterized utility models performs worse than random choice in predicting the level of
insurance purchased.
   We attribute the poor predictive validity of these models to two primary inconsistencies be-
tween the model predictions and our subjects' choices. First, the models predict strong sensitivity
to the price of insurance. Subjects' actual insurance choices, however, respond to price in the
expected direction, but much more modestly. For example, a simple expected utility model cal-
ibrated from lottery choices predicts subjects to be more than six times as sensitive to price than
they actually are. Second, all the models predict that a (weakly) higher share of the loss will be in-
sured at low loss probabilities. Subjects' actual decisions show the reverse pattern--they purchase
more insurance when the probability of loss is higher.
   Our results add to growing evidence on the limited value and consistency of risk preference
estimates in the lab (e.g., Chapman et al., 2018; Friedman et al., 2019; Friedman and Sunder, 2011).
Our controlled experimental setting involves similar stakes between the lottery choices used to
elicit risk attitudes and the potential loss scenarios used to model insurance demand. We find that
a broad range of structural models parameterized with these risk attitudes have limited external
validity for predicting insurance choices.
   An important question, though, is whether these results primarily highlight the limits of trying
to model risk attitudes across context (e.g., between abstract financial lotteries and insurance), or if
they point to deeper issues in using structural models to predict insurance choices. We explore this
issue by looking within our insurance-choice data. For this exercise we adopt the framework from
Barseghyan et al. (2013) that allows for both classic risk aversion via a concave utility function and
generalized probability distortions. We estimate the model for each individual using a subset of
their insurance choices and then use the structural model to predict their decisions at other price
levels or other loss probabilities. The models parameterized using only risk attitudes elicited from
insurance choices show reasonably strong correlations between observed and predicted demand.
However, the structural model predictions perform worse than simple alternatives that are not
grounded in risk preferences. Both using an individual's average observed level of demand as a
fixed prediction for that person and creating individual-level linear models extrapolating demand
as a function of price or probability outperform the structural model. Similar to our main findings,


                                                   4
the structural model estimated using insurance choices predicts too much sensitivity to price and
struggles to capture how people select insurance at different levels of probability.
   Our findings offer new insights to the question of whether insurance demand reflects a stable
underlying set of risk attitudes. Prior literature has documented that there are meaningful rank-
order correlations between the choices individuals make in different insurance contexts, though
the correlations can be low across decisions with different financial stakes (Abito and Salant, 2018;
Einav et al., 2012). Despite this underlying consistency in choices, though, the limited attempts to
compare the fit of structural models across contexts or stakes have concluded that choices cannot
be rationalized by a single underlying model (Barseghyan et al., 2011; Collier et al., 2018). Our
results are consistent with these existing findings and extend them by highlighting that the limita-
tions in predicting insurance demand are shared by a wide range of structural models. Our results
from a controlled experimental setting also imply that the limitations of structural models are not
driven only by institutional factors that may affect decisions across real-world insurance settings.
There appears to be a more fundamental failure of established models of risk attitudes to capture
how people make decisions about insurance.
   There are a few implications of these results for both applied policy work and directions for
future research. For example, the Congressional Budget Office uses models to estimate health
insurance coverage under different policy environments (CBO, 2019). Historically, their models
relied primarily on an "elasticity approach" that modeled the responsiveness to prices and other
variables, but they have been moving toward an approach using structural models that incorpo-
rate risk preferences. Our results suggest a reason for caution in moving away from the elasticity
approach. Second, we believe our results should motivate further research into approaches that
incorporate features beyond consequentialist utility frameworks, such as decision frictions, lim-
ited consideration sets, and decision heuristics (e.g., Abaluck and Adams, 2017; Barseghyan et al.,
2019; Handel et al., 2015).
   The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. We lay out the underlying theoretical struc-
ture for our exercise in Section 2. In Section 3, we discuss the experimental design and the choice
patterns we observe for lottery choices and insurance choices separately. We provide our main
results on the predictions of insurance choices from the risk attitudes and structural models es-
timated from lottery choices in Section 4. In Section 5, we present the results of estimating the
structural model within the insurance choices. We conclude and discuss in Section 6.

2       Theoretical Basis

The paper is concerned with eliciting preference motives and using them to predict insurance
demand. In our analysis of the data, we use two approaches to evaluate the ability of risk attitudes
and structural models to predict insurance demand. First, we consider the relationship between
insurance demand and preference motives in their raw form. In this approach, we simply correlate
the elicited preferences with insurance demand to gauge their predictive power. In the second
approach, we assemble the preference motives into seventeen different structural models and test
the insurance demand predictions of these models against the empirically-observed demand.


2.1     Preference Motives

To elicit primitive preference motives, we first construct a decision model such that these mo-
tives have both a definition and implications for decision-making behavior.5 We begin with a
standard cumulative prospect theory (CPT, Tversky and Kahneman, 1992) preference functional.
We also consider an extended version of this model that adds a parameter which can regulate a
preference for (or against) certainty. This general model allows for the most common preference
motives in risky decision-making, including those hypothesized to drive insurance demand (see,
e.g., Barseghyan et al., 2013; Callen et al., 2014; Sydnor, 2010). The model is also useful because,
for the decisions faced by subjects in our experiment, it nests several other models (see Section
3.2).
      We represent risk as lotteries with n outcomes. Each outcome xi  R has a probability pi
and outcomes are indexed such that x1  ...  xn . We describe a lottery with the notation
(x1 , p1 ; ...; xn , pn ). Preferences over lotteries are represented by the function

                                                         n

Here, outcomes are evaluated by the function
                                               
                                               u+ (x - r)            for x  r
                                       U (x) =                                                                    (2)
                                               u- (x - r)            for x < r

in which r describes the reference point, u+ is the utility function over gains, u- is the utility
function over losses and  is a loss aversion parameter. u+ and u- are assumed to be strictly

      Parts of the following section and Section 3.2 resemble the theoretical considerations of the companion paper to
this, Jaspersen, Ragin, and Sydnor (2019). The companion paper considers a question distinct from the analysis here
but is based on the same experimental data and thus utilizes the same approach to preference elicitation.

                                 w+ (        i                    i- 1
                                             j =1 pj )   - w+ (   j =1 pj )     if xi  r
                             i =                                                                                 (3)

                                             j =i pj )   - w- (   j =i+1 pj )   if xi < r.

       If one assumes the reference point to be defined by current wealth, the standard CPT pref-
erence functional includes five different behavioral motives that influence behavior in decisions
under risk and thus insurance demand. We begin by outlining our "nonparametric" measures of
these motives (denoted by capital letters), which do not assume a specific underlying functional
form. If the utility function is not linear, it shapes an attitude towards risk. We denote this concept
of utility curvature in the gain and loss domains as U C + and U C - , respectively. The shape of
the probability weighting functions in the gain and loss domain similarly influence risk attitudes.
We assume that deviations from the identity line are in the form of either S shaped or inverse-S
shaped probability weighting functions, with an inflection point around the middle of the unit
interval. Our measures P W + and P W - denote the extent to which the gain domain, respectively
loss domain, probability weighting function is inverse-S shaped. Lower values of these measures
imply an S shape of the function, while higher values imply an inverse-S shape. Lastly, a slope
difference between utility in the gain domain and utility in the loss domain denotes loss aversion
(LA) of the individual. Higher values of LA indicate a steeper slope in the loss domain than in the
gain domain.
       In addition to these five standard CPT preference motives, we add a potential sixth motive, a
preference for certainty. We model this motive after Schmidt (1998), who axiomatizes a decision
model and develops a measure for certainty preference.6 While payouts of risky prospects are
evaluated with utility functions u+ or u- , payouts in prospects with a certain outcome are evalu-
ated by a function v . Because we are within a CPT framework, u+ (0) = v (0) = 0 must hold. We
thus model the value function as
                                                 v (x) = u+ (x).                                                 (4)

Here,  > 1 implies a preference for certainty, while  < 1 implies a preference for risk. We
model and elicit the certainty preference CP in the gain domain. CP is elicited with the help of
a separate choice table. As such, all other preference motives are elicited as if a standard CPT
preference functional was assumed (i.e., they are measured independently of CP ).
       The motives introduced above are not parametric in nature because we have not yet assumed
a fully parametric structure for Equations (2) and (3). Our elicitation procedure allows us to as-
   6
    Note that this motive has distinct implications from the preference for certainty already inherent in probability
weighting (Andreoni and Sprenger, 2012).

sess these motives ordinally using statements in which preference motives change ceteris paribus
in subjects' answers to our preference elicitation task. The specific assumptions allowing us to
do so are given in Section 3.2. Formal derivations of the elicitation procedures are provided in
Appendix B.
       In addition to the nonparametric motives, we also aim to calibrate a parametric structure of the
preference functional. The parameters shaping the structure are our "parametric" measures of the
six preference motives, and we refer to them with Greek letters. Our parametric structure involves
assumptions similar to Tanaka et al. (2010), after which our preference elicitation procedure is
modeled. Specifically, we assume a utility function shaped by

                                                                           +/-

The two forms are similar but not equal to standard assumptions in the literature. The utility func-
tion closely resembles the iso-elastic form, which has been the workhorse of preference elicitation
                                                                                                          x1-
(e.g., Andersen et al., 2008; Tanaka et al., 2010).7 Its general functional form u(x) =                   1-     is not
appropriate for prospect theory, because the model requires u(0) = 0 and the iso-elastic form is
not defined at x = 0. We thus opt for the expression in (5), which is very close to iso-elastic but
does not match the structure completely. For the sake of easy interpretation, the  coefficients can,
however, be seen as approximate coefficients of relative risk aversion.8 We code  - such that a
higher value implies more concave curvature so that the interpretation of the nonparametric U C -
and the parametric  - are congruent. Equation (6) is a slight modification of the one-parameter
Prelec (1998) probability weighting function, with  +/- = 1 giving the identity (no probability
weighting),  +/- > 1 implying the typical inverse-S shape, and  +/- < 1 implying S shaped
probability weighting.9
   7
      Many papers in the literature use the power formulation u(x) = x , which is a special case of the iso-elastic
function. The power function, however, is limited to modeling relative risk aversion less than or equal to one, which is
insufficient to grasp the utility curvature of many individuals over laboratory stakes.
   8
     The exact coefficient of relative risk aversion is  + x+1
                                                            x
                                                               .
   9
      In Prelec's original formulation, inverse-S probability weighting is decreasing in  . Our modification makes
inverse-S probability weighting increasing in  , so that all primitive preference motives are increasing in their mea-
sures. The adjustment does not affect the properties of the weighting function.

      Measuring loss aversion is not trivial and several measures have been proposed in the liter-
ature (Abdellaoui et al., 2007). The parameter  has an intuitive interpretation only when using
power utility. In the utility function used here,  + and  - also shape the absolute values of the
utility function in the gain and in the loss domain such that  must be interpreted in combination
with these parameters (Balcombe et al., 2019). We thus create an index     ^ , equal to the average
absolute ratio of utility values over a range [-xmax , xmax ] such that

                                           ^=-
                                                        xmax
                                                               u- (-x)
                                                                       dx.                                        (7)
                                                    0          u+ (x)

Similarly, the preference for certainty is not fully captured by  in the certainty value function
v (x). We use the index ^ developed by Schmidt (1998), where

                                                     v (x) - u+ (x)
                                               ^=                   .                                             (8)
                                                           u+

This index measures the difference between the two utility functions in units of marginal utility
over lottery prospect outcomes.


2.2     Structural Models

In addition to analyzing how the primitive motives explain insurance demand, we assemble the
preference motives in various structural decision models to predict insurance demand. The mod-
els involve individuals with wealth y who face a loss L with probability p. They can purchase
insurance with a coverage level   [0, 1]. Once purchased, the policy provides coverage for a
share  of the loss if it occurs. The insurance premium for coverage level  is calculated as qpL,
where q is a relative loading factor. At q = 1, the premium is actuarially fair. If q exceeds one, the
premium includes a risk premium. A structural model predicts insurance demand by determining
the level of  at which the model's objective function is maximized. In the experiment, subjects
choose  in twelve different insurance scenarios with varying levels of p and q . The models are
thus used to make twelve predictions of  for each subject.
      We test seventeen different structural models which have been proposed in the literature. The
models, their generalized objective functions, and their possible variants are summarized in Ta-
ble 1. This is a comprehensive list of the possible structural models for which our preference
elicitation procedure provides us information. All of these models are context-independent--the
evaluation of one action does not depend on the other available actions.10 For each model, we
  10
     Because they involve psychologically distinct concepts, context-dependent models, the most prominent of which
are regret theory (Loomes and Sugden, 1982) and salience theory (Bordalo et al., 2012), cannot easily be parameterized
with our elicitation procedure. The preference elicitation tables in our experiment, which are summarized in Tables 2

assume that individuals are narrowly focusing on the decision at hand in our experiment and do
not integrate the outcomes of this experiment with background wealth.
    We begin with a simple expected value calculation (EV) and then consider increasingly com-
plex models that increase the number of parameters involved. The first three models, expected
utility theory (EU), dual theory (DT) and reference-dependent preferences under property A3'
of Koszegi and Rabin (KR, 2007) each feature one primitive preference motive. These are util-
ity curvature, probability weighting, and loss aversion, respectively.11 Rank-dependent expected
and 3, render six indifference relationships between prospects which would enable us to calibrate both a regret theory
and a salience theory preference functional within some margin of error. However, the tables were not designed with
this goal in mind, which might lead to framing and boundary effects. We thus refrain from the exercise.
   11
      For modeling probability weighting in DT and RDEU, we use the lower Choquet integral such that the probability
of the loss event is weighted first. This seems appropriate as insurance decisions regard so called "bad news events"
(Sarin and Wakker, 1998).



                                                                10
utility theory (RDEU) and cumulative prospect theory in the loss domain (CPT- ) combine the two
motives of utility curvature and probability weighting. Other combinations of two motives have
seldom been proposed in the literature. More general reference-dependent preferences of Koszegi
and Rabin (2007, property A3) can be seen as a model combining utility curvature and loss aver-
sion. The model, however, requires further assumptions to calibrate using our data (Argyris et al.,
2019). All three preference motives are combined in the CPTNLIB model in which purchasing full
insurance is taken as a reference point (see Novemsky and Kahneman, 2005, for a psychological
rationale for this reference point).
         For some of the models, we include different variants. We elicit utility curvature and prob-
ability weighting in the gain domain and in the loss domain, and consider EU, DT and RDEU
using parameters in both domains. For most models, we also add a variant with a preference for
certainty. In the reference dependence model, adding a preference for certainty seems infeasible
and there are no prior implementations of the concept.12
         It is worth noting that the parameters of utility function, probability weighting function, and
loss aversion are not the same for the different structural models. While CPTNLIB and CPT- can
simply utilize the parameters of the model in equation (1), all other structural models restrict
some elements of (1). In expected utility theory, for example, the probability weighting function
is restricted to the identity line and the preference elicitation procedure is adjusted accordingly.
Similarly, some theories only draw from a select number of preference elicitation questions, such
as considering only choices among lottery prospects in the gain domain.


3        Experimental Design and Resulting Choice Patterns

3.1        General Structure and Subject Recruitment

After an initial screen with a consent form (and a bot check for online participants), our experiment
consists of the five stages outlined in Figure 1. All subjects begin with the typing task, where they
can earn $5.00 in virtual currency by correctly typing two passages of text from an image into a
text box. Subjects are told they must correctly transcribe each passage to earn their payment and
continue to the next stage (we allowed transcriptions with errors to continue after three minutes).
    12
      If such a preference motive were to be added, it seems in the spirit of the model to add it in the gain-loss utility
function. However, we use the choice-acclimated personal equilibrium (CPE) to predict insurance demand in this
model, as suggested by K    oszegi and Rabin (2007, p. 1058). In this equilibrium, gain-loss utility disappears if full
insurance is bought, and so a preference for certainty would not affect the purchasing decision. In CPTNLIB , purchasing
full insurance is the reference point and thus implies a value of 0 by definition, also implying no role for certainty
preferences.

                          Figure 1: Structural outline of the experimental design




Subjects then complete the "preference task" and the "insurance task" as described in following
subsections.13
       After both tasks are complete, the computer randomly selects one question to play out, col-
lecting the insurance premium (if applicable) and drawing a virtual ball to determine whether
any additional money is gained or lost. After the outcomes are determined, subjects complete
a questionnaire including the "general risk question" of Dohmen et al. (2011) and demographic
information (namely, age, sex, location, income, and education). Finally, we provide a validation
code to enter in mTurk or provide to the experimenter.
       Experimental sessions with a total 1,730 subjects were conducted in March of 2018. 1,352 sub-
jects were recruited on the online recruitment platform Amazon Mechanical Turk (mTurk) and
conducted the experiment online.14 The other 378 subjects were recruited without any restrictions
from the subject pool of the BRITE laboratory at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The sam-
ple sizes were based on an ex ante power calculation which rendered target sizes of 1,350 and 350
subjects for mTurk and in-person experiments, respectively. These targets were registered in the
American Economic Association Randomized Control Trial Registry. Subjects were on average 33
years old and 53% of subjects were male. Summary statistics of demographic characteristics and
other experimental data are provided in Appendix C. On average, experimental sessions were
about 25 minutes long and subjects earned $6.27.15


3.2      Preference Task

Our preference measurement tasks are based on the lottery tables of Tanaka et al. (2010). The
Tanaka et al. study involved three lottery tables designed to elicit probability weighting and util-
  13
      We randomly vary whether the preference task or the insurance task is presented first. Each task begins with a set
of instructions, a practice task, and several questions to ensure subjects understand the instructions.
   14
      To participate in our mTurk human intelligence task (HIT), mTurk workers must have completed at least 100 prior
HITs with an approval rate of 95% or greater. There were no other filters, though some participants failed a browser
compatibility check at the beginning of our experiment. While our experiment was live, we monitored the popular
mTurk worker forums (e.g., TurkerHub, mTurkCrowd) and found no threads discussing our experiment to any other
degree than that it was a good opportunity to earn money.
   15
      Subjects in the in-person experiments were additionally paid a flat fee of $6 to comply with laboratory standards.
To avoid income effects, this additional payment was not mentioned until the end of the experiment.


                                                          12
ity curvature in the gain domain, as well as loss aversion. We make two major adjustments to
elicit additional preference motives and make fewer assumptions. First, we change the stakes and
probabilities to permit a greater range of elicitable utility curvature and probability weighting.
Second, we add three additional lottery tables. The first two allow us to elicit utility curvature and
probability weighting in the loss domain, separately from those measures in the gain domain. The
third table allows us to elicit a preference for (or against) certainty in the sense of Schmidt (1998).
Our preference elicitation task thus includes six lottery tables.
       We outline the stakes and probabilities for each set of lotteries in Tables 2 and 3. These lotteries
involve potential gains between $0.50 and $60.00 and potential losses between $0.10 and $4.00
(taken from the $5.00 typing task earnings). In the experiment, each of the six tables is provided on
one screen, with probabilities illustrated with urns containing colored balls.16 Each row indicates
the question number for possible selection at the end of the experiment, and subjects click radio
buttons between the lotteries to indicate their choice. To encourage subjects to think carefully
about their choices, the "Next" button is hidden for twenty seconds. We randomize the order
of the six tables, the left-right display of the lotteries, and whether the stakes are ascending or
descending.
       There are a total of 101 choices across the six tables. To lower the cognitive load from making so
many decisions, we automate monotonic choices--if a subject switches from Lottery A to Lottery
B, we automatically select Lottery B for all subsequent choices on the screen. If the subject switches
a Lottery B choice back to Lottery A, we automatically switch all higher choices back to Lottery
A as well. We also simplify the choice sets by specifying the same probabilities for Lottery A and
Lottery B (except for the CP table, where one lottery is a certain outcome).
       Each lottery table, with the exception of the certainty preference table, includes a choice with
a first-order stochastically dominated (FOSD) option (highlighted in italics in Tables 2 and 3).
Choosing these options may indicate a lack of attention by participants. We construct an indicator
for whether a subject violated FOSD in any of these five choices and use this as a proxy for inat-
tentive participants. In Table 4, we report the Spearman rank correlations of the lottery choices.
We designed the tables so that they measure different aspects of the preference functional, so the
correlations are relatively low. One might be concerned that low correlations are the result of ran-
dom choice. The high correlation between the choices in the GD1 and CP lottery tables, however,
indicates deliberate behavior by subjects, as the lotteries in these two tables are similar.
       We use the subjects' answers in the preference task to construct the "nonparametric" and
"parametric" preference measures briefly described in Section 2.1. Below, we describe the con-
struction of both measures from the choice tables and the resulting choice patterns in detail. In

Appendix B, we offer formal derivations of each preference measure under our elicitation proce-
dure.


3.2.1   Nonparametric Preference Measures

In the nonparametric approach, we refrain from making further structural assumptions on the
elements of Equations (1) through (4) and use a ceteris paribus approach for the elicitation. That
is, we assume for the sake of measuring each preference motive that choices in the corresponding
tables are guided only by that preference motive. For example, we assume that a subject has
a more concave utility function if he chooses the less risky Lottery A in tables GD1 and GD2
more often. The nonparametric measure of gain-domain utility curvature (U C + ) is constructed as
U C + = GD1A + GD2A . (For reference, the captions in Figure 2 summarize the construction and
interpretation of each measure.) The only necessary structural assumption on the gain-domain
utility function u+ is that there is a single parameter regulating its global risk aversion. Under
the corresponding assumptions, more concave loss-domain utility is implied by more Lottery B
choices in LD1 and LD2 and thus U C - = LD1B + LD2B .
   For the nonparametric measure of probability weighting, we assume that the probability weight-
ing function has an inflection point towards the middle of the unit interval and is either S shaped
or inverse-S shaped. For the gain domain, the shape is dictated by a single parameter such that
the degree of inverse-S shape of the function can be measured by adding those choices in the gain
domain tables which have a better outcome with a low probability (i.e., which would be over-
weighted if the probability weighting function was inverse-S shaped). The measure is calculated
as P W + = GD1B + GD2A . The corresponding loss domain measure is determined according to
the same logic, so P W - = LD1B + LD2A .
   To measure a preference for or against certainty, we adopt a procedure similar to that of Callen
et al. (2014), who recently highlighted this preference motive. Subjects face table CP which is equal
to table GD1 except that the less risky Lottery A in table CP is a certain payment of the lower
outcome of Lottery A in table GD1. If a subject makes more Lottery A choices in CP than in GD1,
we can conclude that an outcome paid with certainty has a higher value than that outcome has in
a lottery setting. The nonparametric measure for certainty is calculated as CP = CPA - GD1A .
   Our loss aversion table LA differs from the other preference tables--rather than varying out-
comes along its rows, the table varies the probabilities of fixed outcomes. This allows us to elicit
loss aversion from a greater possible range. Lottery A involves a small gain and a small loss,
while both gain and loss are multiplied by 10 for Lottery B. The probability of the gain increases
down the rows, increasing the difference in expected value between the lotteries. Under our ce-

teris paribus approach, the more loss averse a subject is, the larger will be the required difference
in expected value to switch from Lottery A to Lottery B, so LA = LAA .
       Figure 2 shows the distributions of our nonparametric preference measures based on the sub-
jects' choices in the experiment. The distributions show few extreme or corner values, and most
seem to be single-peaked. Recall that the gain (loss) utility curvature measure is a simple sum of
the number of safe choices in tables GD1 and GD2 (LD1 and LD2). If we had chosen a too-narrow
spectrum of the riskiness of the lotteries in those tables, we would observe high frequencies of
subjects with U C + and U C - at either 0 or 32. While such values occur, they are infrequent com-
pared to other choice patterns and alternative measurement scales in the literature. The measures
of P W + , P W - , and CP subtract the choices in two tables and thus could lead to a bunching
around 0 if subjects chose the same number of safe choices in multiple tables. While such an effect
seems to occur in 10­20% of the probability weighting measures, more than 30% of subjects have
a CP value of 0. Such an answer pattern in CP , however, is not a sign of inattentive choices by
the subjects. In the CP measure, a value of 0 implies that subjects have no distinct preference for
or against certainty, which makes a concentration of answers on this point natural. The nonpara-
metric measure of loss aversion results from a single lottery table, which may raise concerns about
corner solutions and a tendency of subjects to switch in the middle of the table. Both tendencies
can be observed to a small degree but neither of them appear to dominate the choices of most
subjects.


3.2.2     Parametric Preference Measures

For the parametric preference measures, we assume the functional forms detailed in Equations (5)
and (6). With the help of these functional forms, a subject's choices in the preference measurement
tables imply six indifference statements with six open parameters ( + ,  - ,  + ,  - ,  and ).17
The tables are designed such that any combination of choices in the six preference measurement
tables will lead to a solvable system of equations as long as the subject did not make a choice that
violated FOSD.
       We solve the system by first determining ( + ,  + ) and ( - ,  - ) from the indifference relation
implied by the choices in the gain domain tables and the loss domain tables, respectively. The
implied values from the possible combinations of answers both in the gain domain and in the loss
domain are displayed in Figure 3. Here, the upward-sloping lines indicate choices in the table
  17
     We make the assumption that switching from Lottery A in one line to Lottery B in the next line implies indif-
ference for a hypothetical lottery statement between those two lines. Consider, for example, a subject who chooses
Lottery A in the first four rows of GD1 and Lottery B in all subsequent rows. This implies the preference rela-
tions (2.50, 0.8, 2.00)    (5.00, 0.2, 1.00) and (2.50, 0.8, 2.00)  (5.50, 0.2, 1.00). By our assumption, it also implies
(2.50, 0.8, 2.00)  (5.25, 0.2, 1.00).

GD1 (LD2) and downward-sloping lines indicate choices in GD2 (LD1). We designed the tables
such that switching in the middle is consistent with common elicited values of the respective
parameters, and we indicate these choices with thick lines. The lines for the tables differ in the
sign of their slope because in tables GD1 and LD2 the safer lottery has a worse outcome in the low-
probability event than the riskier lottery while in tables GD2 and LD1, the safer lottery has a better
outcome in the low-probability event than the risky lottery. As such, more safe choices in GD1
and LD2 can either be caused by more concave utility or by less inverse-S probability weighting,
while more safe choices in GD2 and LD1 can either be caused by more concave utility or by more
inverse-S probability weighting. The difference in slopes along with the chosen parameters for

choices in the respective table. The intersection of two lines sets the parameter pair.


the tables ensure that each choice combination has exactly one intersection in Figure 3 and thus
implies a unique utility curvature/probability weighting pair.
    As can be seen in Figure 3, the preference measurement tables are designed with two goals in
mind. First, we want to identify a sufficiently broad range of parameter values such that utility
could be both concave and convex and that probability weighting could be both inverse-S and S
shaped. Second, we want to minimize the required number of decisions while also limiting the
number of corner choices made by subjects. We thus calibrate our tables such that the implied
parameters are centered around previous measures from the literature (e.g., Harbaugh et al., 2010;
Tanaka et al., 2010; Tversky and Kahneman, 1992). Choices in the middle of the tables thus imply
concave utility and inverse-S shaped probability weighting in the gain domain (panel (a)) and
linear utility and inverse-S shaped probability weighting in the loss domain (panel (b)). Once  + ,
 - ,  + and  - are calibrated from the choices in GD1, GD2, LD1 and LD2, we use the indifference
relationships implied by choices in CP and LA to calculate  and  as well as the correspond-
ing indices ^ and ^ . Because these two parameters are dependent on the prior values of utility
curvature and probability weighting, there is no clear range for them preset by the choice tables.
    Distributions of the parametric preference measures are displayed in Figure 4. As with the
nonparametric measures, they show relatively few corner solutions and subjects do not seem to

Note: The parameters , ,    ^ , and  ^ denote our measures of utility curvature, probability weighting, certainty pref-
erence, and loss aversion, respectively. Superscripts + (- ) indicate that the parameter was elicited in the gain (loss)
domain. The number of subjects summarized above is less than the total 1,730 experiment subjects because paramet-
ric measures are not calculable for subjects who make FOSD-violating choices. Due to the elicitation procedure and its
associated calculations, some extreme values could appear for both    ^ and  ^ . To limit the influence of such outliers on
our results, we winsorize both measures at the 99th percentile and ^ values additionally at the 1st percentile. We report

be biased strongly towards choosing in the middle of the table. The distributions further appear
single-peaked. In the gain domain, we observe concave utility functions (u+ > 0) and inverse-S
shaped probability weighting functions ( + > 1) for most subjects. In the loss domain, probabil-
ity weighting is commonly inverse-S shaped ( - > 1), but fewer subjects show concave utility
(u- > 0). Nevertheless, the majority of subjects still display risk aversion due to utility curvature
in the loss domain, which makes our results at odds with the common assumptions in models
such as cumulative prospect theory. As expected from the nonparametric CP measure, the index
of marginal preference for certainty is near zero for most subjects, indicating that this preference
motive plays a minor role.18 We report means and medians of the parametric preference measures
in Table 5.19 The means and medians for the mTurk sample and the UW sample appear very simi-
lar. Overall, the median subject has concave utility and inverse-S shaped probability weighting in
both domains, is loss averse with  ^ being about 2.5, and does not have a distinct preference for or
against certainty. These parameters are broadly consistent with other estimates in the literature.
   18
      Other studies have found significant preference for certainty among their subjects (e.g., Callen et al., 2014; Stango
and Zinman, 2019). However, Vieider (2018) suggests that this could stem from randomness in subject responses.
We are susceptible to this criticism as well--if choices were made randomly, roughly 65% of our subjects would be
classified as having a preference for certainty. This is evident in Table 5, which shows that the mTurk sample (which is
susceptible to more noisy decision making) demonstrates a slightly higher preference for certainty on average than the
in-person sample. In addition, our elicitation procedure varies payouts while the elicitation procedure of Callen et al.
(2014) varies probabilities, so differences in the elicitation tasks might also be the cause of the discrepancy in results.
   19
      Summary statistics of the nonparametric measures are not particularly informative because the motives are ordi-
nally scaled. We provide those summary statistics in Table C.2 of Appendix C. We also report the pairwise Pearson
correlations of the nonparametric preference measures in Table C.3.

Note: Histograms include observations for the 1,276 subjects (both online and in-person) who did not violate FOSD
in their preference measurement choices. In plots (c) and (f), a small number of outliers make the central part of the
distribution difficult to see. For display purposes, we exclude outliers from these plots. Certainty preference is plotted
from -2 (2nd percentile) to 2 (96th percentile). We also omit loss aversion parameters above 11 (95th percentile). In each
histogram, the y-axis is the fraction of subjects. Note that the scales of the y-axes differ for the different preference
measures.


    We report the pairwise Pearson correlations of the parametric preference measures in Table 6.
For these and all other inductive statistics using the preference measures, we standardize the mea-
sures such that they are measured in units of standard deviations (indicated by the subscript std).
As would be expected from a behavioral perspective, the probability weighting parameters are
positively and significantly correlated between the two domains ( = 0.338). For utility cur-
vature, we observe a similarly strong, but negative correlation between domains ( = -0.230).
This is interesting as it provides evidence that there is an underlying motive of diminishing
marginal sensitivity for some subjects (Tversky and Kahneman, 1992). However, this motive is
not strong enough to lead to convex utility in the loss domain for most subjects. We see that a
more concave utility function is typically accompanied by more inverse S probability weighting
(+ = 0.288, - = 0.249), while loss aversion is negatively correlated with probability weighting
and has a mixed association with utility curvature.

Note: Preference motives are standardized by subtracting the mean and dividing by standard deviation. For our sam-
ple size of 1,276 subjects with estimable parametric preferences, a correlation is statistically significant at the 10% level
if it is larger than 0.047, at the 5% level if it is larger than 0.055, and at the 1% level if it is larger than 0.073 (in absolute
values). We report correlations for the nonparametric preference measures in Appendix C.


      The calibrated parameters are also used in the structural models introduced in Section 2.2. As
stated above, some of the models (namely RDEU and CPT) can utilize the elicited preference pa-
rameters directly, while others restrict some elements of the preference functional (such as setting
 = 1 in the case of EU). For these restrictive models, we derive model-specific parameters taking
the restriction(s) into account. Applying such restrictions can, however, lead to situations in which
two choices by a subject imply different values for the same preference parameter. For example,
                                              +
in EU, a choice in GD1 can imply one value of EU , while a choice in GD2 can imply a different
         +                                                                                 +
value of EU . A similar inconsistency can occur in DT models with conflicting estimates of DT .
If such inconsistencies arise, we calculate the parameter separately for each relevant lottery table
and use the average parameter value in the structural model.
      Eliciting preference parameters from choice lists allows for a quick elicitation procedure based
on relatively few choices of the subjects. One potential drawback is that using few choices to elicit
risk preferences can lead to inference from noise in the decision process. Alternative procedures
use a larger set of choices and base preference inference on maximum likelihood estimation (e.g.,
l'Haridon and Vieider, 2019). Such procedures, however, have the risk of leading to fatigue by
experimental subjects which is particularly a concern for experiments carried out online. We thus
follow much of the recent literature (Callen et al., 2014; Sprenger, 2015; Tanaka et al., 2010) and use
fewer choices with the potential drawback of over-interpreting noise. We discuss the robustness of
our main findings in light of the potential for noisy decisions by subjects at the end of Section 4.2.

In the insurance task, subjects make twelve insurance decisions. For each decision, they face the
potential to lose $3 of their $5 typing task earnings under various loss probabilities. Loss proba-

                  probability of loss and loading factor displayed above.


bilities are stated in percentage terms and visualized with an urn of 20 white and red balls, where
drawing a red ball results in a loss. Subjects can insure against the potential loss by purchasing a
level of insurance ranging from 0% to 100%, in one-percent increments. In the event of a loss, the
insurance covers the selected percentage of the $3 loss.20 Subjects change their insurance choice
by moving a slider on the screen (see screenshots of the task starting on page 29 of Appendix G).
Every time the slider is set to a value, the screen displays the chosen level of insurance coverage,
the corresponding insurance premium, and the covered and uncovered loss amounts in case of a
loss.
       We present the twelve insurance scenarios in random order. These scenarios differ in the prob-
ability of loss and the relative loading charged for the insurance policy. The combinations of loss
probability and loading in our experiment are outlined in Table 7. In each insurance scenario,
we hide and disable the "Next" button for ten seconds to encourage subjects to explore various
coverage levels.
       We plot the distributions of coverage levels chosen for each scenario in Figure 5. It is apparent
that insurance for low-probability losses tends to result in subjects choosing corner solutions of
full or no insurance. For the scenarios with a 5% (10%) loss probability, 36.8% (27.1%) of choices
are for 0% coverage and 18.6% (17.5%) are for 100% coverage. This is consistent with prior stud-
ies showing a bimodal distribution of insurance demand at low probabilities (McClelland et al.,
1993). As loss probabilities (and thus absolute premium amounts) increase, subjects select corner
solutions less often--at 70% loss probability, 71.7% of choices were for partial coverage. Insur-

     One could be concerned that this response format, while being consistent with theoretical analyses of optimal
insurance demand (see Schlesinger, 2013), is different from those insurance decisions commonly observed in real insur-
ance markets where individuals typically choose between a small set of available policies. We also conduct the main
analyses of this paper treating insurance demand more discretely by (i) rounding subjects' replies into bins of 25% cov-
erage and (ii) rounding them into either no or full insurance coverage. For both discrete formats, we make a new set of
structural model predictions. Results are consistent with the main text across all analyses. A more detailed description
of these analyses and their results is given in Appendix F.

ance demand also appears to decrease as loading increases--the mean coverage level is 71.3% at a
load of 0.80 and decreases monotonically to a mean of 31.5% at a load of 2.50. Interestingly, when
loading was actuarially fair or better, subjects chose partial (no) insurance 65.1% (12.1%) of the
time.
    In Table 8, we report the Spearman rank correlations of the coverage level selected for each
insurance scenario. All coverage level choices are positively correlated with each other. Choices
over scenarios with a common probability generally have the highest correlation. Scenarios with
common loading factors do not appear to be substantially more correlated than scenarios with
different loading factors. For example, among the scenarios with a loading factor of 1.50, the
scenario with loss probability of 5% has a high correlation with the 10% loss probability scenario.
However, as the loss probability is increased to 20% or 40%, the correlation with the 5% scenario
steadily decreases. This observation illustrates an important point to note from the correlation
table--correlations generally decrease as the difference in loss probabilities increases.

     Note: Insurance scenarios are labeled in the first column and the third row as P[probability]L[loading * 100]. For our sample size of 1,730 subjects, a correla-
     tion is statistically significant at the 10% level if it is larger than 0.040, at the 5% level if it is larger than 0.047, and at the 1% level if it is larger than 0.062 (in
     absolute values).
      To illustrate the demand response to price more explicitly, we plot average insurance demand
as a function of the loading in Figure 6. Average insurance demand is downward sloping in price
at all loss probabilities, showing general adherence to the law of demand by our subjects. Further,
insurance demand increases with loss probability at all loads except for a load of 2.5, where aver-
age insurance demand for loss probabilities of 5% and 10% is virtually identical. These graphical
observations are corroborated by statistical analysis. A simple pooled OLS model estimated on all
insurance choices (Table 9) shows statistically significant effects of both loading factor (negative)
and loss probability (positive) on insurance demand.

4.1     Predicting Insurance Demand from Preference Motives

We now consider whether the preference motives are correlated with insurance demand. For this
purpose, we run a series of linear regressions with coverage level as the dependent variable (inte-

                                                 26
gers between 0 and 100).21 In the first analysis, we regress the coverage level on each preference
motive separately, clustering standard errors by subject and correcting p-values for multiple hy-
pothesis tests (Table 10).22 We include a fixed effect for each of the twelve insurance scenarios, so
the coefficient estimates indicate whether a given preference motive can explain variation of the
subjects' insurance demand within each scenario. The results indicate that utility curvature in both
domains, loss domain probability weighting, and loss aversion have statistically significant corre-
lations with insurance demand, whether they are measured nonparametrically or parametrically.
For probability weighting in the gain domain, we also observe a significant positive effect when it
is measured parametrically. A preference for certainty does not seem to have any significant effect
on insurance demand. These results are in accordance with theory for most behavioral models
which have been proposed in the literature, as long as these models do not feature a preference
for certainty.
       These regressions, however, do not account for the correlation between different preference
motives. Particularly for the parametric measures, which are calibrated dependent on the values
of the other parameters, this can pose a significant bias for inference. To address this, our next
analysis specifies regressions in which all preference motives are included together. As with the
single-preference regressions, we include insurance scenario fixed effects and cluster standard
errors on the subject level.
       We report the results of these estimations in Table 11, with the nonparametric measures in
columns (1) and (2) and the parametric measures in columns (3) and (4). In column (1), loss do-
main probability weighting and loss aversion significantly correlate with insurance demand. The
linear term for probability weighting, however, does not correctly capture the theoretical predic-
tion that those with S-shaped probability weighting should overweight lower probabilities but
underweight higher probabilities. To allow for this dynamic, in column (2) we introduce an in-
teraction between probability weighting measures and an indicator for whether the probability of
loss was greater or equal to 40%. Consistent with theoretical predictions for inverse-S probability
weighting, we find that probability weighting has a positive and significant correlation with insur-
ance demand for scenarios with a low probability of loss. The effect is offset once the probability
of loss is greater than or equal to 40%. This construction also leads to a negative and significant ef-
  21
      It could be argued both theoretically and from the empirical distributions that the dependent variable insurance
demand is left- and right-truncated. When this is taken into account via a Tobit estimator, the results remain virtually
unchanged in sign and significance as can be seen in Appendix D.
   22
      In all our regressions involving multiple hypotheses, we correct p-values using the Sidák (1967) method. Details
of each adjustment are in the respective table note.

involving the parametric preference measures. For comparison, we also exclude FOSD violators from regressions us-
ing nonparametric preference measures, with results in Appendix E. All models contain fixed effects for each of the 12
insurance scenarios. In each panel, p-values have been adjusted using the Sidák (1967) method for the six hypotheses
tested. Standard errors clustered by subject are in parentheses. Stars *, **, and *** denote statistical significance at the
0.10, 0.05, and 0.01 levels, respectively.

fect of gain domain probability weighting on insurance demand in high loss probability scenarios.
There is, however, no significant effect in low probability scenarios.23
      The results for the nonparametric preference motives are corroborated and extended by the
results for the parametric preference motives, reported in columns (3) and (4) of Table 11. In these
regressions, we only consider those subjects who do not violate FOSD because we cannot calibrate
a preference functional for those who violate FOSD. For most preference motives, the coefficients
increase in their value indicating a higher predictive power for the (standardized) parametric pref-
erence motives. The exceptions are the preference for certainty and probability weighting in the
loss domain. However, when considering the estimation including the interaction structure in
column (4), it is clear that probability weighting in both domains has the predicted effect on insur-
ance demand. The biggest difference between the nonparametric and the parametric preference
motives is the significant effect of gain domain utility curvature on insurance demand in the lat-
ter. The nonlinear transformation due to the parametric structure and the sample including only
non-FOSD violating subjects increase the predictive power of this element.24
      While the statistical significance of the coefficients in Tables 10 and 11 seems generally encour-
aging for the predictive power of behavioral decision theories on insurance demand, the estimated
coefficients are modest in scale. Using coefficient estimates from Tables 9 and 11 allows for some
back-of-the-envelope calculations regarding effect size. Increasing the loss aversion of a subject
by one standard deviation has the same positive effect on insurance demand as decreasing the
loading q by about 32 percentage points (2.60/8.18).


4.2     Predicting Insurance Demand from Structural Models

We next assemble the preference motives into the seventeen structural models outlined in Table 1
and see how well these models predict insurance demand. For each model, we calculate the opti-
mal coverage level for each of the twelve insurance scenarios. Summary statistics for the observed
insurance demand and for each model's prediction are given in Table 12. Cursory observation
shows that while some models predict similar average demand levels (such as EU, DT, RDEU,
and CPT- ), other models predict too much (KR, CPTNLIB , and almost all models with a preference
for certainty) or too little (EV) demand.
   23
      One interpretation of this joint result is that there is a single underlying probability weighting motive which does
not differ between the gain and loss domains. Our measures exhibit similar distributions between the two domains
and correlate strongly with each other ( = 0.338, see Table 6), providing evidence of this relationship. Under this
interpretation, our joint result implies a positive and significant effect of probability weighting on insurance demand at
low probabilities and a negative and significant effect at high probabilities.
   24
      For comparison, we conduct the nonparametric regressions from Tables 10 and 11 and restrict the sample to non-
FOSD violating subjects. We report our estimations in Table E.1 of Appendix E. There is no substantial difference in
results.

    To assess each model's predictive validity more thoroughly, we first examine the correlation
between the prediction and the empirically-observed insurance demand. The Pearson correlation
coefficients over all 1,276 non-FOSD violating subjects are provided in column (1) of Table 13.
The results show a positive and significant correlation between model predictions and observed
demand for all decision models which do not feature probability weighting (EV, EU, and KR).

    Note: Table displays summary statistics of the observed insurance demand and the insurance demand pre-
    dictions of the 17 analyzed structural models for the 1,276 non-FOSD violating subjects. Model predictions
    are made by choosing the coverage level which maximizes the respective target function given in Table 1.


Models which feature probability weighting do not significantly correlate with observed demand
or even have a negative correlation. Adding the preference for certainty to any of the models de-
creases the correlation with observed demand. This corroborates the results in Section 4.1, which
show CP to have little explanatory value. Lastly, the correlation coefficients show that using pref-
erence parameters elicited in the loss domain often leads to a slight increase in the explanatory
value of a given structural model.
   Positive and significant correlations show that some of the models can explain part of the
variation in observed insurance demand. However, positive correlations do not imply predictive
accuracy--for example, they ignore the absolute level of the prediction. An alternative procedure
is to compare the models' predictions with randomly generated ones in a "horse race" (Gather-
good et al., 2019). In our horse race (columns (2) to (4) of Table 13), we compare the predictive
ability of three non-behavioral benchmarks to each of the structural models. In each column, we
report the proportion of choices where the structural model denoted in the row outperforms a
particular benchmark (i.e., is closer to the observed coverage level). The structural model is supe-

    Note: For our sample size of 1,276 subjects for whom we can make parametric predictions, the correlation
    in column (1) is statistically significant at the 10% level if it is larger than 0.047, at the 5% level if it is larger
    than 0.055, and at the 1% level if it is larger than 0.073 (in absolute values). Table cells in the "Horse Race"
    columns are the frequency with which the specified model in each row predicts coverage level choice at
    least as well as the prediction rule in the column header. "Random choice" specifies a random uniform dis-
    tribution of predicted coverage from 0 to 100, which we repeated 1,000 times for each choice (the average
    random prediction across repetitions ranged from 46.3% to 53.6%). "Overall average" specifies the aver-
    age coverage level of 46.5% for every prediction. "Scenario average" specifies the average coverage level in
    each of the 12 scenarios as the prediction for all choices in that scenario. This ranges from 30.8% in the sce-
    nario with 10% loss probability and a loading of 2.5 to 73.5% in the scenario with 70% loss probability and
    a loading of 0.8.


rior if the proportion exceeds 0.5. Our benchmark in column (2) is choosing a random coverage
level from a uniform distribution, which we perform 1,000 times for each choice. None of the sev-
enteen models we analyze can predict insurance demand better than a random number generator
the majority of the time. Those models with a higher correlation coefficient generally perform
better (with KR being the exception), but even EV and EU- --the models with the highest corre-
lation coefficients--do not outperform predicting coverage levels randomly. Columns (3) and (4)
of Table 13 report similar horse race analyses, where the benchmark predictions are the overall
average insurance demand (46.5%) or the average insurance demand within a scenario (ranging



                                                              32
from 30.8% to 73.5%, depending on the scenario), respectively. Both of these benchmark predic-
tions perform better than the random choice benchmark and thus none of the structural models
outperform them either.
       The horse race results in Table 13 seemingly imply two contradictions. First, even models
that show a correlation above 20% with observed insurance demand are not better at predicting
demand than random choice. Second, the primitive probability weighting motive shows some
explanatory power when correlated with insurance demand (Tables 10 and 11), but significantly
decreases predictive power once it is integrated into a structural model. The reasons for both of
these observations in part stem from the way the structural models respond to changes in loading
(q ) and probability (p). We examine these responses in Figure 7, where we compare observed
insurance demand to predicted demand over values of q and p (holding the other constant).
       The first contradiction--a disconnect between correlations and horse race performance--is
the result of models predicting a more extreme price response than what our subjects exhibit.
Panel (a) of Figure 7 shows the change in insurance demand due to an increase in loading if
the loss probability is fixed at 10%. Both observed insurance demand and predicted insurance
demand are downward-sloping as loading increases. This leads to a positive correlation between
observed demand and model predictions. The magnitude of the price response, however, differs
substantially--the observed demand curve is relatively flat, while many of the structural models
(such as the highlighted EU- ) predict a much stronger reaction.25 The predicted reaction will
thus be more extreme than the observed reaction. The two rightmost columns of Table 12 provide
evidence for this effect, as many of the models which perform badly in the horse race analysis also
predict a higher proportion of corner solutions than are observed empirically.
       The extreme demand response is compounded by structural models which predict only cor-
ner solutions. Of the models analyzed here, only those featuring utility curvature (EU, RDEU and
CPT) can lead to an interior solution for optimal insurance demand. All other models will always
predict either 0% or 100% coverage, which strongly disadvantages them in a horse race analysis.26
This is also the reason why the average prediction of the EVCP model looks very close to average
observed demand (Figure 7), but individual predictions of the EVCP model perform badly in the
horse race analysis. While the average prediction might be close to the average observed demand,
all individual predictions will be corner solutions. Even in models which allow for interior pre-
  25
      To compare these price responses numerically, we regress predicted and observed insurance demand on Probabil-
ity and Loading (as in Table 9). In the "Predicted" regression, the dependent variable is the predicted demand according
to EU- and the estimated coefficient on Loading is -55.69. In the "Observed" regression, the dependent variable is
the observed insurance demand (excluding FOSD violating subjects) and the estimated coefficient on Loading is -9.16.
Thus, the predicted reaction to price is 6.08 times what is observed.
   26
      To see this, observe in Table 1 that models without utility curvature have linear target functions in  and will thus
always lead to corner solutions. Utility curvature makes the target functions non-linear and potentially concave in ,
allowing for interior solutions.

Note: Figure displays observed and predicted insurance demand as a function of premium loading q when the loss
probability is fixed at p = 10% (panel (a)) and as a function of loss probability p when the premium loading is fixed
at q = 1.50 (panel (b)). Observed demand (thick black line) is reported for all 1,276 non FOSD-violating subjects. The
other lines in the figure show the average predictions of the seventeen structural models listed in Table 1 using the

dictions, corner solutions can still appear frequently. If insurance is simply too expensive (and
the coverage level is predicted to be 0%) or when probability weighting or loss aversion feature
strongly (and the coverage level is predicted to be 100%), the structural models will overshoot ob-
served demand reactions and perform badly in the horse race. Another contributing factor is that
correlation coefficients are not affected by the absolute levels of the predicted insurance demand.
In the horse race analysis, however, absolute levels directly affect the relative performance of each
model. As such, any model which on average predicts too much or too little insurance demand
has a positive correlation with observed demand, but performs poorly in the horse race.
    The second contradiction--probability weighting performing well until it is integrated into a
structural model--stems from the difference in explaining demand variation between subjects and



                                                         34
explaining demand variation between scenarios. In panel (b) of Figure 7, we display the observed
and predicted demand response to changes in the loss probability at a fixed premium loading of
1.50. As demonstrated in Figure 6, observed insurance demand increases with the loss probabil-
ity. However, in models with probability weighting (such as the highlighted RDEU- ) predicted
insurance demand decreases with increasing loss probability as long as the probability weighting
function is inverse-S shaped.27 This is the most common shape of the weighting function elicited
from our preference elicitation tasks, so all structural models featuring probability weighing pre-
dict people will buy more insurance when the probability of loss is low. This discrepancy is the
reason for low or even negative correlations between the models' predictions and observed de-
mand. The structural models without probability weighting do not predict a negative influence of
loss probability on insurance demand (such as KR) or do so to a smaller extent (such as EU). Their
predictions thus correlate positively with observed demand across scenarios.
    The analyses of Table 10 and columns (1) and (3) of Table 11 show a positive correlation be-
tween probability weighting and insurance demand. However, because probability weighting in
those analyses is a fixed parameter for each subject and does not further interact with the decision
situation, those analyses only examine whether the preference motive can explain variation in in-
surance demand between subjects within each scenario. Even when an interaction structure with
the loss probability is specified in columns (2) and (4) of Table 11, the analysis features insurance
scenario fixed effects such that again only between-subject variation is studied. For between-
subject variation, probability weighting has explanatory power. When considering the results of
the two analyses in combination, we can thus conclude that probability weighting does influence
insurance demand, but that an additional mechanism connected to loss probabilities is likely also
at work. The nature of this additional mechanism is a compelling question for future research.
    To further investigate how loading and probability affect the predictive validity of the tested
structural models, we use regression to control for these factors. Specifically, we regress observed
insurance demand on the predicted insurance demand for each model. In Table 14, we report the
results of our estimations for the ten structural models that do not include a certainty preference.28
We begin with a set of univariate regressions in panel (a). We then incorporate fixed effects for the
loss probability (panel (b)), the premium loading (panel (c)), or the twelve scenarios (panel (d)).
The regression results corroborate our interpretation above. Results in panel (a) are by construc-
tion very close to the correlation coefficients displayed in column (1) of Table 13. Panel (b) shows
   27
      Technically, the required condition is not an inverse-S shape, but decreasing relative overweighting of the probabil-
ity weighting function. See Jaspersen, Peter, and Ragin (2019) for a discussion of this property and a formal derivation
in the RDEU framework.
   28
      Adding a preference for certainty decreases the predictive validity across all models and leads to the same quali-
tative conclusions otherwise. See Appendix A for results on the seven models involving a certainty preference.



                                                            35
that once probabilities are controlled for, the predictive validity of models including probability
weighting increases and becomes statistically significant. Controlling instead for the premium
loading in panel (c) (and thus reducing variation between the scenarios solely to variation in loss
probability), the predictive validity of all models decreases to the point of negative correlations for
all models except KR. Panel (d) displays the regression analyses with scenario fixed effects, such
that both probability and loading are controlled for. With scenario fixed effects, the decision mod-
els explain only differences between subjects, but not between scenarios. In this case, only models
which feature probability weighting (DT, RDEU, and CPT) have positive and significant correla-
tions between their predictions and observed insurance demand. For this last analysis, models
which combine probability weighting and utility curvature (i.e., the RDEU and the CPT- models)
show the best predictive validity.

Note: Dependent variable is the coverage level selected by the subject. Explanatory variable of interest is the predicted level of coverage using the specified
model. The only other explanatory variables are fixed effects as noted. The sample in each regression is the 1,276 subjects with estimated preference param-
eters (who did not violate FOSD). In each panel, p-values have been adjusted using the Sidák (1967) method for the ten hypotheses tested. Standard errors
clustered by subject are in parentheses. Stars *, **, and *** denote statistical significance at the 0.10, 0.05, and 0.01 levels, respectively.
   Some further conclusions can be drawn from the results in Table 14. The relatively high predic-
tive ability of the EV and EU models in panel (a) is due to their ability to explain demand response
to increases in the loading, as evidenced by the change in coefficients in panel (c). Panel (d) shows
that little explanatory power in these models is due to their ability to explain between-subject
variation in insurance demand. Further, the preferences measured in the loss domain appear to
have higher predictive validity than those in the gain domain. Finally, loss aversion does not fare
well when included in the structural models to explain insurance demand. There are three models
which each feature only one behavioral motive--EU includes only utility curvature, DT uses only
probability weighting, and KR features only loss aversion. Of those three, the KR model with loss
aversion has one of the lowest reported coefficients in panel (d). Of the more complex models, the
one with the lowest coefficient, CPTNLIB , is the only one that features loss aversion. However, loss
aversion has one of the largest coefficients in Table 11. This suggests that loss aversion has a sig-
nificant relationship to insurance demand, but that there is no well-established structural model
that leverages this predictive power well.
   One possible explanation for the low observed correlations could be randomness in the insur-
ance decisions. To investigate this, we divide the subjects in our sample roughly into quartiles
based on the number of times the subject violated the law of demand (increasing insurance de-
mand at higher loads). We consider subjects who never violated the law of demand as exhibiting
the most consistent choices, and subjects who violated three or more times as making the least
consistent choices (the other quartiles being subjects who violated only once and subjects who
violated twice). For each subsample, we calculate the correlation between observed demand and
each structural model's predicted demand, as in column (1) of Table 13. In addition, we regress
observed demand on predicted demand with scenario fixed effects, as in Panel (d) of Table 14.
Our findings are in Appendix E, with the correlations in Table E.2 and the regressions in Table E.3.
Even for the most consistent group, the relationships between observed and predicted insurance
demand are moderate and, in line with our analysis above, no model has a higher correlation
than expected value maximization. The only difference we find is that insurance demand for the
most consistent subjects now has small positive correlations with models incorporating proba-
bility weighting. The least consistent subjects (i.e., those who violate the law of demand three
or more times) tend to make decisions which have much less correlation with structural model
predictions.

5   Robustness: Eliciting Preferences Using Insurance Choices

Our results show that structural models estimated from lottery choices have limited ability to
predict insurance choices. This suggests that we cannot yet identify a portable model of risk
attitudes that can be applied across these contexts.
    An open question, though, is whether this is because there is something about decision making
in insurance environments that is not well captured by the prevailing structural models or if the
problem is primarily in the transfer of preferences across domains. Our setting eliminates some
obvious concerns with using models across domains by having the choices made in the same set-
ting, at nearly the same time and for similar financial stakes. Nonetheless, it is possible that other
issues limit the portability across context, yet within a particular financial context (e.g., lottery
choices or insurance) structural models may have strong predictive power.
    In this section, we test this possibility by analyzing the predictive power of structural mod-
els when we work only with the insurance data. This exercise was not part of our original pre-
specified research plan, but strikes us as valuable for exploring the implications of our main re-
sults. However, because this analysis was not pre-specified, we focus our attention on estimating
a more limited set of structural models than in our main analysis.
    Our goal is to identify a subset of the insurance choices made by subjects that can be used to fit
a structural model and then use the resulting fitted model to predict the choices that subject made
under other insurance conditions. To simplify, we focus on two cases in our data that allow us to
test the ability of the models to predict either across different prices (i.e., loads) or across different
probabilities.
    For the first case, we analyze the four choices subjects made under different loads when the
probability of loss was 10%. We use the choices the subjects made at the middle two loads of 1.25
and 1.50 as our observed data for the modeling exercise, and then use the model to predict the
choices under the other two loads of 1.00 and 2.50.
    We adopt the structural model of Barseghyan et al. (2013), which incorporates both a standard
utility function and generalized probability distortions without assuming a form on the probabil-
ity weighting function. The model of the (decision) utility for an insurance choice in this frame-
work is


                      (p)u (w - (1 - )L - qpL) + (1 - (p)) u(w - qpL),                                 (9)

where (p) is the generalized probability distortion. We maintain our assumptions from the orig-
inal analysis, and assume that subjects' choices are non-stochastic. This lets us use the result of
Jaspersen et al. (2019), who show that two coverage level decisions at two different values of q > 1


                                                   39
are sufficient to elicit (p) and u, provided that u can be described by a parametric form with a
single parameter that is monotonically related to the function's curvature. The condition for this
result is that subjects purchase more insurance at lower levels of q . To further simplify our elici-
tation procedure, we limit the sample of subjects to those who purchase less than full insurance
at both loadings and we assume that subjects who purchase no insurance at q = 1.5 maximize
their utility at exactly  = 0. Our sample restrictions lead to a sample size of 481 subjects for this
analysis.
       To assess the quality of our predictions, we report the same two metrics which we already
considered in Table 13: the correlation between observed and predicted demand and a horse race
of the prediction against a benchmark. For the latter, we only use random choice as a benchmark
for the sake of brevity. The results of the analysis are shown for each predicted insurance scenario
in the top panel of Table 15. The first row shows the results for the utility function used in our
main analysis. The second and third rows use a CRRA and a CARA utility function, respectively,
as a robustness check. Since the results are consistent between the different functional forms, we
focus our discussion on our initial parametric assumption.
       On both reported measures, the model predictions perform markedly better than the predic-
tions from the models calibrated using lottery choices. For example, there is a correlation coeffi-
cient of 0.42 between the predicted and actual choices when subjects faced high loads of 2.50 and
the predictions of the structural model out-perform random predictions 64% of the time.
       Although this result looks more favorable for structural modeling, another way to assess the
value of the structural model is to compare it to simpler predictions that do not incorporate mod-
eled risk attitudes. We test two such alternatives and show the results in the bottom panel of
Table 15. The first model simply calculates the average insurance demand for each subject across
the q = 1.25 and q = 1.50 scenario and uses this personalized average to predict insurance de-
mand for the individual in the other two scenarios. This model performs better than the structural
model predictions in both scenarios, considering both the correlation and the horse race. The dif-
ference in performance is large and significant (p < 0.001).29 This suggests that using a structural
model calibrated on the information provided by two insurance scenarios to predict a different
one performs worse than simply using the information in its raw form. In addition, the differ-
ence in performance between the structural model and the average demand is larger at q = 2.50
than it is at q = 1.00 such that predicting insurance demand from a structural model becomes less
informative the further the predicted scenario is removed from the elicitation scenarios.
  29
    Significance in the differences was calculated using the web utility from Lee and Preacher (2013). The correlations
between observed and the Eq. (5) predictions are 0.7945 and 0.6786 for q = 1.00 and q = 2.50, respectively.

Note: The table reports the results of our calibration analysis in which we use the coverage level decisions in the sce-
narios with loss probability 10% and loading factors 1.25 and 1.50 to calibrate the decision model in Equation (5) and
use it to predict insurance demand in the scenarios with loss probability 10% and loading factors 1.00 and 2.50. Results
are reported for the 481 subjects with (q=1.5) < (q=1.25) < 1 at p = 10%. Rows in the top panel indicate the utility
function used in the analysis. In the bottom panel, we offer two non-utility models for comparison. The first non-utility
model uses the average demand for loading factors 1.25 and 1.50 to predict demand in the other two scenarios. The
second non-utility model calibrates an individual linear demand function  = bq + c for predictions. Correlations are
Pearson coefficients. Horse race results are reported against a uniformly distributed random number.


    The second simple alternative model is a linear demand function of insurance coverage in the
loading. Specifically, we use the demand function  = bq + c. We calibrate b and c at the individual
level based on the subject's choices for q = 1.25 and q = 1.50. We then use the individual's
estimated line to predict insurance demand for q = 1.00 and q = 2.50, bounding the predicted
coverage choices at 0 and 1. This model performs best among all tested procedures for predicting
insurance demand with q = 1.00 and shows the highest correlation for q = 2.50. In this high
loading scenario, it does however have the worst performance in the horse race analysis due to
predicting too many corner solutions.
    To understand the results of our analysis better, we plot the predicted and observed insurance
demand for the structural model prediction and the Average Demand prediction for both scenar-
ios in Figure 8. We can see that the poorer predictive quality of the structural model is again rooted
in the over-responsiveness to price--it predicts too many cases of full insurance at low loadings
(panel (a)) and too many cases of no insurance at high loadings (panel (b)). The average demand
shows no such overreactions and is thus the better predictor.
    Our insurance demand data also feature four scenarios at different loss probabilities (5%, 10%,
20% and 40%) but the same loading of q = 1.50. We again use the two middle choices (10%
and 20%) to calibrate the insurance choices for 5% and 40% loss probability. For this analysis, we
cannot use the probability distortion model of Barseghyan et al. (2013), because we require a model

of the subject's reaction to a change in probability. Instead, we incorporate probability weighting
using the common rank dependent expected utility format with a one-parameter Prelec (1998)
weighting function. Though not strictly necessary for the calibration, we limit the analysis to the
same 481 subjects used above to ensure comparability. The results of the analysis are shown in
Table 16. We can see that the results for predicting the 5% loss probability scenario look similar
to the analysis with varying loading factors. As mentioned in Section 3.3, the insurance choices
for low loss probabilities are highly correlated. However, when considering the predictions for
insurance demand with a 40% loss probability, the model has a strongly decreased performance
in terms of both correlation and the horse race. As in the main analysis, the model structure
has a hard time predicting insurance behavior when loss probabilities change strongly. The most

important conclusion to be taken from the results in Table 16 is, however, that the model structure
is again outperformed by the simple models using average insurance demand and linear demand
over probabilities.
    In summary, using insurance choices to calibrate the parameters of a decision model seems
to lead to better predictions than using lottery choices. However, aggregating the information
gained from insurance choices in a decision model is less informative for other insurance decisions
than simply aggregating the information in an average. This seems discouraging for model-based
policy recommendations, which we elaborate on in the next section.


6    Discussion and Conclusion

The results of our experiment call into question the ability of common consequentialist structural
models of risk preferences to predict insurance demand. We find moderately-sized and statis-
tically significant predictive power for the three most commonly discussed primitive preference
motives of insurance demand: utility curvature, probability weighting, and loss aversion. De-
spite these correlations, however, assembling these motives into structural decision models leads
to poor predictive validity in our setting, particularly across different insurance scenarios.




                                                           43
   Our work adds to mounting evidence that there may simply be no single underlying model
of risk preferences that can adequately capture attitudes toward financial risk in different do-
mains, and toward insurance in particular. Our results are consistent both with a broader literature
that has shown inconsistency in measures of risk aversion across different elicitation strategies in
the lab (e.g., Chapman et al., 2018; Friedman et al., 2019; Friedman and Sunder, 2011) and with
Barseghyan et al. (2011) who find that choices across insurance context in field data cannot be
rationalized by an expected utility model with stable underlying preferences. A distinguishing
feature of our approach is that we are considering simultaneously a very wide range of structural
models that have been posited in the literature.
   This suggests that there may be significant value in research that aims to better illuminate the
alternative decision processes that shape decisions about insurance and other financial risks. For
example, research has suggested that decision editing phases (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979; Mc-
Clelland et al., 1993), information frictions (Handel and Kolstad, 2015), and limited consideration
sets (Abaluck and Adams, 2017; Barseghyan et al., 2019) may play an important role in how people
make decisions about insurance. These approaches could potentially help explain why many peo-
ple in our experiment purchased no insurance at low loss probabilities--these events might have
been ignored. There is likely also value in better understanding the types of systematic heuristics
people use when evaluating insurance, similar in spirit to recent work examining debt-repayment
heuristics (e.g., Gathergood et al., 2019). The evidence from these studies does not yet provide a
conclusive picture of how people make insurance choices and there may be significant heterogene-
ity across people, but research in this area is starting to develop techniques for better identifying
relevant decision processes.
   Until we have a better understanding of the decision processes at play in insurance choices,
economists may benefit from being more cautious about using structural models. Yet this does not
imply that there is no scope for counterfactual predictions in insurance markets. Prior research
has shown that insurance choices correlate to some degree across contexts. Our work adds to that
point and helps to highlight that it may be possible to use data on insurance choices to predict
choices in somewhat different economic conditions. The key implication, though, is that these
predictions may be better if they are based on the direct patterns of observed choices rather than
structural models of risk attitudes.

Appendix B           Theory on Preference Elicitation
This paper uses the same experimental data and preference measures as the study in Jaspersen, Ragin, and
Sydnor (2019). Since the analysis there does not consider the insurance demand tasks, both studies analyze
distinct research questions. However, because they both use the same preference measures, the contents of
this appendix are to a large part identical to a corresponding appendix in Jaspersen, Ragin, and Sydnor
(2019).

B.1     Nonparametric Preference Measures
There are six tables in the elicitation procedure: GD1, GD2, LD1, LD2, LA and CP. The first five are
repeated choices between two binary lotteries, the last one is the choice between a binary lottery
and a certain outcome. The choices are depicted in Figure B.1.

   In accordance with Section 2.1, i = 1 and j = 2 in tables GD1, GD2, and LA and i = 2 and
j = 1 in tables LD1 and LD2.

B.1.1   Utility Curvature and Probability Weighting in the Gain Domain
Assuming a full CPT preference functional, we evaluate the lotteries in the GD1/ GD2 tables as
EV = w+ (p)u+ (large gain) + (1 - w+ (p))u+ (small gain). In these tables, only the large gain of
Lottery B changes. Adopting the notation that the large gain is x2 and the small gain is x1 , the




                                               Appendix, p.2
                                                                                  [For Online Publication]
indifference large gain on Lottery B fulfills

       w+ (p)u+ (x2,A ) + (1 - w+ (p))u+ (x1,A ) = w+ (p)u+ (x2,B ) + (1 - w+ (p))u+ (x1,B ).          (B.1)

    We first consider the ceteris paribus elicitation of utility curvature. When changing the indif-
ference value for x2,B to x^2,B and keeping everything but the utility function fixed, we signify
the change in the utility function by the transformation g (·) of which we know that it must be
increasing. The new indifference relationship implies

 w+ (p)g (u+ (x2,A )) + (1 - w+ (p))g (u+ (x1,A )) = w+ (p)g (u+ (^
                                                                  x2,B )) + (1 - w+ (p))g (u+ (x1,B )). (B.2)

   From g (·) > 0, we know that g (u+ (^
                                       x2,B )) - g (u+ (x2,B )) > 0. We can thus see from (B.2) that

 w+ (p)g (u+ (x2,A )) + (1 - w+ (p))g (u+ (x1,A )) > w+ (p)g (u+ (x2,B )) + (1 - w+ (p))g (u+ (x1,B )). (B.3)

    We proceed by using w+ to define  as a probability measure of the random variables x          ~ and,
respectively, u+ (~
                  x). This can be done because w+ (p)  [0, 1] and all payoffs are in the gain domain,
so the decision weights add to one. Under this probability measure, we know from (B.1) that the
expectation of u+ (~ x) is equal between lotteries A and B. From p being equal for both lotteries,
we further know the skewness of u+ (~      x) under the probability measure  to be equal between
both lotteries (Ebert, 2015). From Chiu (2010) we thus know that Lottery B is a mean-preserving
spread in u+ (~x) under the probability measure  . As such E [g (u+ (~  xA ))] > E [g (u+ (~
                                                                                           xB ))] is true
if and only if g < 0. Thus, a higher value of x2,B in GD1 and GD2 implies more concave utility
curvature.
    For the ceteris paribus elicitation of the probability weighting function, we again consider the
indifference relationship at two points x2,B and x  ^2,B with x2,B < x ^2,B . The respective probabil-
ity weighting functions for the two indifference relationships are w+ and w     ^ + . We have the two
equalities:

       w+ (p)u+ (x2,A ) + (1 - w+ (p))u+ (x1,A ) = w+ (p)u+ (x2,B ) + (1 - w+ (p))u+ (x1,B ).          (B.4)

       ^ + (p)u+ (x2,A ) + (1 - w
       w                        ^ + (p))u+ (x1,A ) = w
                                                     ^ + (p)u+ (^             ^ + (p))u+ (x1,B ).
                                                                x2,B ) + (1 - w                        (B.5)
                                        ^ + (p)[u(x2,B ) - u(x2,B )] on the right hand side to obtain
   We subtract (B.4) from (B.5) and add w

     ^ + (p) - w+ (p)][u+ (x2,A ) - u+ (x1,A ))] =
    [w                                                  ^ + (p) - w+ (p)][u+ (x2,B ) - u+ (x1,B ))]
                                                       [w
                                                                 ^ + (p)[u+ (^
                                                                +w           x2,B ) - u+ (x2,B ))].    (B.6)

         ^ + (p)[u+ (^
   Since w           x2,B ) - u+ (x2,B )) > 0, (B.6) becomes

       ^ + (p) - w+ (p)][u+ (x2,A ) - u+ (x1,A ))] > [w
      [w                                              ^ + (p) - w+ (p)][u+ (x2,B ) - u+ (x1,B ))].     (B.7)

    From the construction of the table, we know u+ (x2,A ) - u+ (x1,A )) < u+ (x2,B ) - u+ (x1,B )).
                   ^ + (p) < w+ (p). A switching row lower in the GD1/GD2 tables thus leads to a
(B.7) thus implies w
smaller decision weight on the large outcome of each lottery.
    We have structured the tables such that pGD1 < pGD2 and assume the inflection point of the
probability weighting function to be between these two probabilities. Under this construction, if
the decision weight on pGD1 becomes smaller, we have less inverse S-shape or more S-shape in


                                              Appendix, p.3
                                                                                 [For Online Publication]
the weighting function. If the decision weight on           pGD2   becomes smaller, we have more inverse
S-shape or less S-shape in the weighting function.

B.1.2    Utility Curvature and Probability Weighting in the Loss Domain
Assuming a full CPT preference functional, we evaluate the lotteries in the LD1/LD2 tables as
EV = w- (p)u- (large loss) + (1 - w- (p))u- (small loss). In these tables only the large loss in
Lottery A changes. The indifference gain fulfills

         w- (p)u- (x2,A ) + (1 - w- (p))u- (x1,A ) = w- (p)u- (x2,B ) + (1 - w- (p))u- (x1,B ).               (B.8)

   We change the indifference value to x  ^2,A < x2,A and the utility function gets transformed by
function g (·). The new indifference value now fulfills

 w- (p)g (u- (^
              x2,A )) + (1 - w- (p))g (u- (x1,A )) = w- (p)g (u- (x2,B ) + (1 - w- (p))g (u- (x1,B )). (B.9)

   We again use the positive first derivatives of u(·) and g (·) and transform (B.9) such that

 w- (p)g (u- (x2,A )) + (1 - w- (p))g (u- (x1,A )) > w- (p)g (u- (x2,B ) + (1 - w- (p))g (u- (x1,B )). (B.10)

    We proceed as in the gain domain. Under the probability measure  defined by w- , the utility
lottery of Lottery A is a mean-preserving spread of that of Lottery B. As such, E [g (u- (~    xA ))] >
       -
E [g (u (~xB ))] if and only if g < 0. Thus, a more negative value of x2,A (and thus a later switching
row) is, ceteris paribus, associated with more convex utility curvature/ less risk aversion.
    For probability weighting, we again consider two different indifference relationships. One at
xA,2 and one at x  ^A,2 with x^A,2 < xA,2 and different probability weighting functions w- and w    ^-.
We have the two equalities:

        w- (p)u- (x2,A ) + (1 - w- (p))u- (x1,A ) = w- (p)u- (x2,B ) + (1 - w- (p))u- (x1,B ).               (B.11)

        ^ - (p)u- (^

    From the construction of the table, we know u- (x2,A ) - u- (x1,A )) < u- (x2,B ) - u- (x1,B )) < 0.
                   ^ - (p) < w- (p). A switching row lower in the LD1/LD2 tables thus leads to a
(B.7) thus implies w
smaller decision weight on the more negative outcome of each lottery.
    Since in CPT, the probability weighting function uses the upper Choquet integral in the gain
domain and the lower Choquet integral in the loss domain, the implications of this theoretical
result can be interpreted as for the gain domain described above. We have structured the tables
such that pLD1 < pLD2 and assume the inflection point of the probability weighting function to be

                                                                          [For Online Publication]
between these two probabilities. Under this construction, if the decision weight on pLD1 becomes
smaller, we have less inverse S-shape or more S-shape in the weighting function. If the decision
weight on pLD2 becomes smaller, we have more inverse S-shape or less S-shape in the weighting
function.

B.1.3      Loss Aversion
Assuming a full CPT preference functional, we evaluate the lotteries in the LA table as EV =
w+ (p)u+ (gain) + w- (1 - p)u- (loss). As such, the probability of the gain leading to indifference
fulfills


          w+ (p)u+ (x2,A ) + w- (1 - p)u- (x1,A ) = w+ (p)u+ (x2,B ) + w- (1 - p)u- (x1,B )              (B.15)

       or equivalently

                                             w+ (p)(u+ (x2,B ) - u+ (x2,A ))
                                       =                                        .                        (B.16)
                                            w- (1 - p)(u- (x1,A ) - u- (x1,B ))
    Given functions w+ , w- , u+ , u- , we can see that a higher indifference probability always leads
to a higher . Observe

B.1.4      Certainty Preference
To accommodate a preference for certainty, we utilize the model of Schmidt (1998). We integrate
this model into CPT similarly as he has integrated it into EU. All evaluations of uncertain pay-
ments are made by a utility function u(x) and evaluations of certain payments are made by a
value function v (x).30 For a preference regarding certainty to appear, the utility and value func-
tions must differ, whereas the difference is usually assumed to be monotonic for all values of x
(Vieider, 2018). As such, when we can observe v (x) > u(x) (v (x) < u(x)) for some value of x,
we assume the preference for (against) certainty to persist everywhere in the preferences of the
individual except at zero. Zero is excluded such that the prospect-theoretic convention that the
utility/value function crosses at the origin is upheld.
    The only table in which a certain payment appears is the CP table. It is structured such that
x2,B > xA > x1,B > 0. It is obvious that when we assume that u(x) does not change, a higher value
of x2,B implies a stronger certainty effect. Consider the two equalities implied by indifference
values x2,B and x^2,B with x
                           ^2,B > x2,B and the corresponding value functions v (x) and v ^(x).

                                v (xA ) = w+ (p)u+ (x2,B ) + (1 - w+ (p))u+ (x1,B ).                     (B.18)

                                ^(xA ) = w+ (p)u+ (^
                                v                  x2,B ) + (1 - w+ (p))u+ (x1,B ).                      (B.19)

       See Schmidt (1998) for a discussion of the terminology "utility function" and "value function."

                                                                                     [For Online Publication]
   Subtracting (B.18) from (B.19), we gain

                               ^(xA ) - v (xA ) = w+ (p)[u+ (^
                               v                             x2,B ) - u+ (x2,B )].                     (B.20)

   By assumption, x  ^2,B > x2,B renders v^(xA ) > v (xA ) and thus with a fixed utility function of
u(x) an increase in the certainty preference.

B.2   Analysis Using Parametric Preference Measures
For the parametric measures of the preference parameters, we assume that a switch from Lottery
A to Lottery B at row h implies that the subject would be indifferent between the average lotteries
A and B between rows h - 1 and h. In every table, only one value varies with each row. As such,
the average lotteries are the simple mid-point between the two different values. We signify this
indifference value with a bar. When the switch occurred at a corner solution (which did not violate
FOSD), then we assume the indifference value to be the same distance below the value indicated
in the row as it would be above it if the switch occurred one row before the corner solution.
    For the utility function and the probability weighting function, we assume the parametric
forms summarized in Section 2.1. Using these assumptions, we identify the values of  + ,  - ,  + ,
 - ,  and  which solve the six equations

In Equation (B.23), the index CP/GD1 indicates that the values are equal in both tables.
    Directly eliciting values of  and  results in bad measures of loss aversion and certainty pref-
erence (Abdellaoui et al., 2007; Schmidt, 1998). For loss aversion, the shapes of u+ and u- also
influence how utility is traded off between the gain domain and the loss domain. We thus use an
index for loss aversion that takes this into account. We use the negative average ratio of utility
in the loss domain and the gain domain over the spectrum of relevant values for the LA table.

Note: Summary statistics are presented for the 378 in-person subjects at UW-Madison, the 1,352 online subjects recruited
through Amazon mTurk, and all 1,730 subjects together. GRQ is the self-reported risk aversion measure of Dohmen
et al. (2011). Final payment to the subject does not include the $6 "show-up fee" paid to UW participants. Num times
violated FOSD is conditional on having violated FOSD at least once. Understanding score is the subject's rating of how
easy or difficult the study was to understand, with 1 indicating very easy, 5 indicating very difficult, and 3 indicating a
neutral response.

Column 1 contains only the nonparametric preference scales. Column 2 adds an interaction between the PW prefer-
ences and a dummy for "high probability" (Prob  40 = 1 if the probability of loss is 40% or 70%). Columns 3 and
4 replicate columns 1 and 2 using the parametric preferences. In each column, p-values have been adjusted using the
Sidák (1967) method. Standard errors clustered by subject are in parentheses. Stars *, **, and *** denote statistical sig-
nificance at the 0.10, 0.05, and 0.01 levels, respectively.

Note: Sample is restricted to subjects who did not violate FOSD. Dependent variable is the coverage level selected by subject i. All models
contain fixed effects for each of the 12 insurance scenarios. Columns 1-6 replicate columns 1-6 in Panel A of Table 10, with p-values adjusted
for six hypotheses using the Sidák (1967) method. Columns 7 and 8 replicate columns 1 and 2 in Table 11, with Sidák-adjusted p-values for the
hypotheses in each column. Standard errors clustered by subject are in parentheses. Stars *, **, and *** denote statistical significance at the 0.10,
0.05, and 0.01 levels, respectively.

Appendix F             Alternatively scaled insurance choices
The analysis in the main text treats insurance demand as a continuous and cardinal scaled mea-
sure. This appendix demonstrates that our results are robust to alternative assumptions about the
scale of the variable. The first two columns of Table F.1 compare the correlations between observed
demand and model predictions when treating insurance demand as cardinal (column 1, equal to
analysis in main text) and treating it as ordinal (column 2).
    The other analyses reported in this appendix treat insurance demand as a discrete measure.
In the first analysis, we round answers of subjects in the experiment to the nearest increment of
25%. We adjust our predictions such that they indicate which of five possible discrete alternatives
(0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) maximizes the objective function of the subject. Analyses are then
carried out using estimators that take the ordinal nature of the reported scales into account. The
correlations reported in the rightmost two columns of Table F.1 are calculated as Kendall's Tau.
The regressions in Tables F.2 and F.3 use an ordered logit estimator. In the analyses using predicted
insurance demand as the independent variable, we use dummy variables to indicate the predicted
value. The second analysis of insurance demand as a discrete measure restricts observations and
predictions even more and only considers no insurance (0%) or full insurance (100%) as possible
options. The results in Tables F.4 and F.5 use logit estimators and a dummy variable for 100%
coverage to reflect this binary nature of insurance demand.

Note: Dependent variable is the coverage level selected by subject i, rounded to the nearest 25%. All models contain
fixed effects for each of the 12 insurance scenarios. Column 1 contains only the nonparametric preference scales. Col-
umn 2 adds an interaction between the PW preferences and a dummy for "high probability" (Prob  40 = 1 if the
probability of loss is 40% or 70%). Columns 3 and 4 replicate columns 1 and 2 using the parametric preferences. In
each column, p-values have been adjusted using the Sidák (1967) method. Standard errors clustered by subject are in
parentheses. Stars *, **, and *** denote statistical significance at the 0.10, 0.05, and 0.01 levels, respectively.

Note: Dependent variable is the coverage level selected by the subject, rounded to the nearest 25%. Explanatory variables of interest are a set of dummy variables indicating the specified
model predicted a coverage level of 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100% (a prediction of 0% coverage being the excluded category). The only other explanatory variables are fixed effects as noted. The
sample in each regression is the 1,276 subjects with estimated preference parameters (who did not violate FOSD). In each panel, p-values have been adjusted using the Sidák (1967) method
for the ten hypotheses tested. Standard errors clustered by subject are in parentheses. Stars *, **, and *** denote statistical significance at the 0.10, 0.05, and 0.01 levels, respectively.

Note: Dependent variable is coverage level selected by subject i, rounded to the closer of 0% or 100%. All models con-
tain fixed effects for each of the 12 insurance scenarios. Column 1 contains only the nonparametric preference scales.
Column 2 adds an interaction between the PW preferences and a dummy for "high probability" (Prob  40 = 1 if the
probability of loss is 40% or 70%). Columns 3 and 4 replicate columns 1 and 2 using the parametric preferences. In
each column, p-values have been adjusted using the Sidák (1967) method. Standard errors clustered by subject are in
parentheses. Stars *, **, and *** denote statistical significance at the 0.10, 0.05, and 0.01 levels, respectively.

Note: Dependent variable is the coverage level selected by the subject, rounded to the closer of 0% or 100%. Explanatory variable of interest is a dummy variable equal to
1 if the specified model predicts 100% coverage and 0 otherwise. The only other explanatory variables are fixed effects as noted. The sample in each regression is the 1,276
subjects with estimated preference parameters (who did not violate FOSD). In each panel, p-values have been adjusted using the Sidák (1967) method for the ten hypotheses
tested. Standard errors clustered by subject are in parentheses. Stars *, **, and *** denote statistical significance at the 0.10, 0.05, and 0.01 levels, respectively.

Appendix G         Collection of experimental data
Here, we provide screenshots of the full experiment given to the mTurk subjects. In-person sub-
jects completed an identical experiment, without some mTurk-specific questions (e.g., entering the
mTurk worker ID). Each box represents a different screen.
    The experiment begins with a browser compatibility test and confirmation of the mTurk worker
ID. This also prevents bots from continuing the experiment.




   Then, subjects are presented with an overview of the experiment.

    Following the overall instructions, subjects complete the real-effort task. This involves man-
ually typing a passage correctly into the provided text box. Every character must be correct to
pass.31 The font used in this passage is resistant to optical character recognition. There were five
possible passages, and each subject was randomly assigned to complete two of them.




    Subjects are then notified of their payment for the task.




  31
     If the subject took longer than three minutes for a particular passage, we allowed them to continue to the next
passage. This was not disclosed to subjects. In every case, the subject had entered the full text but had made a typo.

   The lottery task begins with a set of instructions and three questions to ensure subjects under-
stood them.

   Subjects who answer the questions correctly may continue to the lottery task. Subjects who
answer incorrectly may not continue until they have answered the questions correctly.




   Lotteries are presented in random order, and question numbers update automatically. In this
example, the LA questions are presented first.

   To encourage subjects to make careful choices, the "Next" button is hidden for 20 seconds on
each lottery page.

   The insurance task begins with a set of instructions and two questions to ensure subjects un-
derstood them.

   Subjects who answer the questions correctly may continue to the insurance task. Subjects who
answer incorrectly may not continue until they have answered the questions correctly.




    Insurance scenarios are presented in random order, and question numbers update automati-
cally. In this example, an insurance scenario with a 10% probability of loss is presented first. We
have selected 0% coverage here.




   To encourage subjects to make careful choices, the "Next" button is hidden for 10 seconds on
each insurance page.

   The next randomly-selected insurance scenario involves a 40% chance of loss. We have selected
50% coverage here.

    The next randomly-selected insurance scenario again involves a 10% chance of loss. We have
selected 100% coverage here.




   The nine remaining insurance scenarios have identical layouts, so we omit them from this
appendix. The last question is numbered Q113.




                                       Appendix, p.31

   After all choices are made in the experiment, the computer randomly selects one decision to
play out.




   In this example, Question 44 is the randomly-selected decision. We confirm to the subject
which selection he/she originally made and the possible outcomes. Then, they click the button to
draw a "ball."




    The computer then displays the outcome of the draw and outlines the subject's payment. Ama-
zon mTurk requires variable payments to be paid as a "base" plus a "bonus." We were clear in
the mTurk posting that our task involved variable payments paid as bonuses. This appears a
common way to compensate subjects, and no subjects expressed confusion about the payments.
During our pilot studies, we had built a positive reputation in a number of third-party websites
for paying bonuses quickly, so nonpayment risk was a minimal concern. All pilot participants
were excluded from our main experiment.

  Immediately after the draw, we ask the GRQ. The direction of the scale (0-10 or 10-0) is ran-
domly assigned.




   Finally, we ask the following demographics questions and follow-up questions about the ex-
periment.

    After all questions are answered, we provide a final "Submit" screen to remind subjects about
the upcoming validation code.




   For mTurk subjects, the study concludes with a validation code to connect their experiment
outcomes to their mTurk account. In-person subjects were provided with a validation code to
write down and bring to the experimenter for payment.
