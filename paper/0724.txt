                 Tax Aspects of Corporate Pension Funding Policy



                                       ABSTRACT



     This paper explores four models of firms' pension liabilities. All

of the models yield the result that if it is the stockholders who gain or

lose from a change in the market value of pension fund assets, a pension

fund invested entirely in bonds will maximize that gain. If a firm's

pension liabilities are considered to be no more than the present value

of accrued benefits, then most plans for salaried employees would maximize

the pension's value by having their assets entirely in bonds. However,

for less well funded plans such as most union plans, holding both stocks

and bonds or even all stocks may maximize the value of the firm.. Implicit

contracts on the liability side of the pension balance sheet can encourage

holding some stock, but implicit contracts on the asset side are likely

to encourage increased bondholdings.

 Introduct ion

         What are the advantages of a firm holding all bonds, all stocks,

 or a mix in its pension fund? Is a firm better off making the minimum

 or maximum contributions to its pension plan? Does the firm's pension

 funding policy matter at all to the stockholders?

          The task of this paper is to clarify the crucial assumptions on

 which the answers to each of these questions depend, and how those assumptions

 affect the answer.

          Models developed by Black [1980] and Tepper [1981], Sharpe [1976],

 and Miller and Scholes [1981] are all discussed. An extended version of

 the Sharpe model, actually drawing n all three earlier models, is also

 presented.

          The reasons for the differing results of the models can be classified

 in two groups: assumptions about the asset side of the pension fund balance

 sheet, and assumptions about the liability side. Sharpe's basic approach is

 to look at the explicit terms of the pension contract. Black looks at the

 explicit liabilities of the pension plan but both he and Tepper tend to treat

 these liabilities as general obligations of the firm, Their model approximates

 the Sharpe model except in cases where a plan termination would lead to losses

for the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). Miller and Scholes have

in mind a model with very complex implicit contracts between the firm and its

employees regarding pension benefits——assets backing pension liabilities may

well exceed the money in the fund, and pension liabilities may also exceed

the amount to which the firm has explicitly committed.

1.   The Black—Tepper Model

         The thrust of the models of Black [1980] and Tepper [1980) can be

seen by taking an augmented balance sheet approach to pension fund analysis.

Black considers the pension fund liability to be no more than the accrued

liability of the pension plan——that is, the plan's explicit, legal liability.

(For a discussion of this concept of pension liability see Bulow [1979]).

Were it not for tax reasons, pension debt would be comparable to ordinary

debt. Furthermore, were it not for taxes bonds in the pension fund would

be a perfect hedge against either kind (ordinary or pension) of debt.1
         The fact that bonds in the pension fund can offset ordinary

debt presents a tax arbitrage situation. Bonds in the fund earn the pre—

tax rate of return. Ordinary debt issued by the firm may be financed with

tax deductible interest payments. Thus, an extra dollar of ordinary debt

and an extra dollar of bonds in the pension fund provide a net tax benefit.

         Unfunded pension debt, on the other hand, is very costly according

to Black and Tepper. If the firm does not establish a pension fund its employees

can contribute to an IRA account and earn the before—tax rate on bonds.

Thus, employees will only be willing to sacrifice current wages for a qualified

pension plan if they are offered the pre—tax bond rate. Furthermore, in a

competitive labor market if labor supply is inelastic and the firm could earn

the pre—tax rate by funding its pension plan such a rate of return would have

to be offered to employees.

         The Black—Tepper analysis is formally derived below under two sets

of circumstances. In the first case, Merton Miller's [1977] argument that

there is no equilibrium advantage to corporate debt financing is assumed to

hold. In the second case, the result is examined in the situation where

there is a tax advantage to debt financing. A simplification that does not

alter the results here is that all corporate debt will be assumed to be riskiess.
                                            3


         The fact that debt is assumed to be riskiess does simplify the

analysis in two ways: First, there are no problems involving the relative

seniority of pension debt. This enables us to abstract from issues relating

to the workers gaining security (at someone's expense) if more money is

placed in the fund. Second, worker security is unaffected by whether the

plan holds stocks or bonds. These problems are not major if it is assumed

that pension contributions and investment policy are implicity or explicitly

negotiated, If they are, the firm cannot gain at the expense of employees

through funding or investment policy, and the fact that the Black—Tepper model

as presented here abstracts from possibilities of this sort is unimportant.

         Let V =   present value of firm's non—pension assets
             S = market value of stock held in the pension plan

             B =   market value of bonds held in pension plan
             D =   market value of firm's non—pension debt
             L =   market value of bonds required to pay off all
                   pension liabilities accrued to date

             X = maximum amount by which S +     B   may exceed L

               =   rate   of interest on riskiess bonds

            t = corporate      tax   rate

That is, L is the present value of accrued pension liabilities, discounted at

the pre—tax nominal interest rate.

         Consider a two period model. In the first period the firm contracts

for some pension liabilities, acquires real assets, and puts money into its

pension plan. The pension money is invested in stocks and bonds. Then to

maximize shareholder wealth the firm must
                                        4




 (1.1)                             B(l+r)(1_t )    D(l+r(l—t      ))       L(l+r   )(l—t )
         Maximize V +   S(l—t) +                                       -
                                   (l+r(1-t)       (l+r(l—t))              (l+r(l—t))
 subject to

         S + B — L < X,     S >   0, B > 0


 if the Miller argument holds. The explanation of (1) is that the value of

 shareholder claims is equal to the present value of all the claims the firm

 o'ns less the present value of the after—tax cost of paying off all bondholders

and pensioner claims.

         The bonds held in the pension fund will earn a rate of return              r,

and thus be worth B(l+r6) at the end of the period. This amount must only

be discounted by the after—tax rate r(l_t). Debt on the firm's balance

sheet costs rE (l—t) after tax, and must be discounted at the same rate.

Finally, the firm will have to pay pension beneficiaries a rate of return

rc on pension claims because th3t is the rate they can earn in IRA            accounts
or, say, in defined contribution plans run by competitors. Stockholders,

however, will only discount these paYments by the after—tax bond rate of

rq(l—t). Also pension assets and liabilities are only worth 54 cents on

the dollar (l_t) because liabilities can be absolved with pre—tax dollars.

         This version of the model assumes that firms can only contribute

the maximum amount deductible for tax purposes. Actually, as Tepper points

out, a firm can sometimes contribute beyond the deductible limit and gain tax

postponement benefits. Such benefits would not appear in a two—period model.

         For any set of assets V and pension debt L the way to maximize

shareholder wealth is to set S = 0 and B = X +    L.   The value of D is
                                                  (B—L)rt
indeterminate. The gain from having a plan is                          Thus, firms
                                                  (l+r (1   ))•

should fund entirely with bonds, and put as much money as possible into

bonds. If the plan is underfunded, the fir-rn loses because employees

could have earned rB on their own. For every dollar that the firm can

overfund, however, it earns the pre—tax rate of return while stockholders

only expect the post—tax rate on such riskiess securities.

           Whereas legally a fir-rn is limited to operating a fully funded

plan, judicious choice of actuarial assumptions can actually enable a firm

to vastly overfund, For example, IBM has 5,000 million dollars in pension

assets and lists its pension liabilities at 5,000 million. However, the

liability figure is calculated by discounting future benefits at a 4—314

percent rate of interest. Using current interest rates would yield the

result that IB'1 is several billion dollars overfunded,

           Now consider the case where there is a tax advantage to debt

financing via the tax deductibility of interest payments. Thus future debt

payments should be discounted at the pre—tax rate of interest. The manage-

ment's problem is then to

(1.2)     Maximize V +                                        —                           —
                                                 (l±r)                 (l+r)

           The last constraint limits the amount of tax-advantaged debt that

the firm can issue, The assumption above is that (1) a dollar of pension

debt displaces a dollar of ordinary debt, and (2) a dollar of bonds in the

pension fund fully offsets a dollar of ordinary debt. This model can be
                                               6



dressed up so that the optimal amount of debt is endogenously determined

by perhaps some tradeoff between bankruptcy costs and tax benefits, but

the resulting analysis would be identical.

           Solving (1.2) yields S                                    (l—t )
 the firm should try to issue as much ordinary debt as possible.               The vay

 to do this is to hold as many bonds as possible in the pension fund,

 because each dollar of bonds allows the firm to issue one more dollar

 of ordinary debt.

               There are a couple of points to make about the "non—Miller" analysis.

 First, no one I know claims to understand much about "debt capacity.t' What if

 the "debt capacity" constraint is different from that above: for example,

 D + CL    —   B —              <   k (unfunded pension liabilities plus ordinary debt
                     S)(l—t0)
 are less than or equal to "debt capacity").             In this case, there is an

 advantage to being funded to increase the amount of ordinary debt the firm

 can support, but no advantage to holding bonds rather than stock in the

 pension fund.

               If debt capacity is proportional to a firm's beta (so that there

 are no tax advantages to diversification) then in a model where all

 securities yield the same pre—tax returns adjusted for risk holding zero—

 beta stocks in         the   pension fund would yield the same tax advantage as

                         (Of course, it may be quite difficult to create a      zero—beta
 holding       bonds.
  stock portfolio.) In           a Miller   world, zero—beta stocks have a lower pre—tax

  return   than bonds and are not a good pension investment. Thus, in a Miller

  world the tax advantage of funding a plan is due to the firm being able to

  earn the pre—tax rate of returt' on bonds held in the fund. The tax advantage

  is directly related to the plan's interest income.             In a non—Miller world the
                                   7




advantage of funding a plan is that the amount of ordinary debt that

the firm can issue is increased, and a bigger interest tax deduction is

received. Of course, in the non—Miller model selling bonds and acquiring

a zero—beta portfolio of stocks in other firms, with the stock held in

the corporation's general account, would provide the same tax advantage.

        The contrast is most notable in the case of junk bonds which bear

a strong resemblance to equity. In the Miller model such investments are

ideal for pension funds because they yield taxable interest coupons that

exceed the risk—adjusted total return on the security. In a "debt—capacity"

model where the tax advantage came through increasing the amount of ordinary

debt one could issue, holding junk bonds would yield no advantage over

holding equivalent—risk equities in the pension plan.
         Another point to make is that many firms may effectively be in a

 zero marginal corporate tax bracket. Airlines and utilities often pay

very low current federal taxes. Oil companies have started paying the

last few years, but it is possible that they have political reasons for

wanting to pay income taxes. For such firms the tax value of extra "debt

capacity" is zero because there is no more tax liability to offset. Thus,

on the margin there would be no advantage to either funding a plan or

holding bonds.2 In a Miller world, however, where the tax advantage arises

directly through the plan assets there would still be the same advantage

 to putting bonds in a fund.

         There may also be a tax advantage to timing contributions to allow

for changes in corporate tax rates. The corporate rate was as high as

 (52.8 percent in 1970) and is now 46 percent. Further reductions are

possible. The individual firm may certainly find its tax rate changes

over the years.
                                    8



        Also, it should be noted that there are ways for a corporation to

receive interest income taxable as dividends through the use of special

investment companies (see Bulow [1979)). If such tactics can be employed

at low cost then the tax advantage of being able to earn tax free interest

would be significantly aller.3

         Sunmarizing, the firm must pay the pre—tax rate of return on its

pension liabilities. In the Miller world it derives a tax advantage through

holding bonds in the plan that also earn a pre—tax rate of return.    (Returns

on equity already reflect a corporate tax.)     If the firm has more bonds than

are needed to cover its liability, it derives a tax advantage relative to

having a defined contribution plan, In a non—Miller world the tax advantage
of funding a pension plan is derived from the fact that increased plan

funding increases the amount of ordinary bonds the firm can issue, with

tax—deductible interest payments.


2. The Sharpe Model

         Sharpe [1976) recognizes that directly adding the pension fund

to the balance sheet does not take into account the value of the pension

put. As an approximation, he takes the pension liabilities guaranteed by

the PBGC to equal the present value of eployees' claims, or roughly L in

the notation of the previous section. In Section 4 the Sharpe analysis is

extended to take into account the precise PBGC rules,

         Again, resorting to the two—period model, the workers' claim is

fixed at L(l+r8) at the end of the second period. The firm owns the plan

assets, but has the right to put the liability to the government in return

for the plax assets plus 30 percent of the firm's equity. Equivalently, the

firm can be thought of as having a call on the plan assets with an exercise

price equal to L —   .3E, where E is the market value of the firm's equity.
                                       9
                                                                                -
 This result derives from the fact that If pension assets are less than

 guaranteed benefits the firm has to make up the difference up to 30 percent
                 4
 of net worth.

          In determining funding policy the firm must trade off, in a Miller

 world, (1) the tax advantage to holding bonds in a pension fund and earning

 the pre—tax rate of interest, and (2) gains the firm may make from the

 government by putting the pension fund's assets to the government for L — .3E.

 For any given level of pension funding the optimal investment strategy is to

 hold either all stocks or all bonds. (Sharpe and Har:ison have proven that

 this result will hold up in the multi—period context.) Generally, holding
 bonds will yield a tax advantage so that the bonds in the fund have a

 positive net present value while equity investments have a zero net present

 value. However, the riskiness of the stocks may make a call option on the

 equities more valuable than a call option on a portfolio of bonds. In

 either event, either an option on a portfolio with 100 percent bonds or

 an option on a portfolio with 100 percent stock will be at least as valuable

 as an option on a portfolio containing positive amounts of both assets.

        To see that you would want to hold either all stocks or all bonds

if you are choosing between just two assets, add the following notation:


       VS = the value of a firm's call option in a pension fund's assets

              if all the assets are invested in stock.

       VB =   the    value of a firm's call option on a pension fund's assets

              if all the assets are invested in bonds.

       V = the       value of a firm's call option on a pension fund's assets

              if lOOn percent is invested in stock and the remainder in bonds.

              the (uncertain) terminal value of each dollar's investment in

              in stock. If aF is invested in stock at the beginning of
                                           10



                 the period the stock portfolio is subsequently worth

                 cFP.
             =   the (uncertain or certain) terminal value of each dollar's
                 investment in bonds.

         E       market value of firm's equity.


On exercise date

        V = Max(0,      FP5 + .3E —   L)

        VB = Max(O, FPB       .3E —   L)
        V        Nax(0, oFP + (l_oDFPB + . 3E — L)


        That is, the firm    will   only exercise the call option and pay off

all liabilities if the sum of the assets in the plan plus thirty percent

of the market value of the firm's equity exceeds the present value of the

pension liabilities. By stochastic dominance, then, we can find that

Vc < aV5 + (l—a)VB for 0 <       < 1.      That is,


        Max(0, aFP5 + (l_cz)FPB ÷ .3E —         L)   <

                                                                         =
        Max(O, cxFP5 + .3ctE — aL) + Max(0, (l_cx)FPB + .3(1)E — (l—a)L)

       aNax(O, FPs + .3E - L) + (l—a)Max(0, FPB + .3E — L)


        So we know that on the last day an option on the portfolio containing

some stocks, bonds, and firm equity will be at most as valuable as a portfolio

of options on the same assets with the same cumulative exercise price. This

result is due to Nerton [1973]. Consequently, one would be at least as

happy today owning a of a call option with payoffs identical to those produced

by the all—stock portfolio and (1—a) of a call option with payoffs identical

to those produced by the all—bond portfolio as with an option on a portfolio

invested a in stocks and (1—a) in bonds.
                                      11

            Once we have the result V <         +
                                           V        (l_a)VB the rest is easy:
 ciV + (l_a)VB <    Max(V   VB). That is, unless the market value of the

 call options yielded by the all stock and all bond portfolio are identical

 one will necessarily prefer owning a call worth either V or VB rather

 than some linear combination of the two.

            Thus, combining two observations:       (1) an option on a portfolio

 is worth no more than a portfolio of options and (2) the weighted average

 of the market values of the options in a portfolio of options must be no

greater than the market value of the most valuable option we find that a

firm cannot do better than a portfolio with either all stocks or all bonds.

            Sharpe and Harrisson [1981] are working on a paper which will show

that in a multi—period model one will always want to hold either all stocks

or all bonds each period.

        If the amount of money plus the value of thirty percent of the firm's

equity in the pension fund is low, stocks will likely be the better invest-

ment because holding bonds will guarantee that the firm's call option expires

worthless. If the fund has a great deal of money, the ability to put the

fund to the PBCC becomes less valuable and an all—bond strategy makes sense.

            A further obvious implication is that if a firm adopts the all—

bond policy, and gives up on the pension put having any value, the firm

should bepouringmoney into the pension fund as fast as it can. This result

is similar to the Black—Tepper result, If, on the other hand, the firm's

decision is to go all equity there is no tax advantage to putting money

in the plan but the pension put becomes more valuable as less and less money

is invested in the plan. Firms which are underfunded, then, might try to

minimize contributions and maximize the risk of the pension portfolio subject

to whatever constraints are imposed on them by their actuaries1 interpretation

of ERISA.
                                  12

        If the Miller model does not hold, the same "debt capacity" issues

that arose in the first section of the paper reappear. The tax advantage to

holding bonds instead of stocks would be determined by how much additional

"debt capacity" was created by holding bonds rather than stocks.
         The primary conclusion of this type of analysis, then, is

that there is a tax advantage to holding bonds arid, often, an advantage

in terms of the value of the pension put to holding stocks. In the

simple example above, the firm would either hold as many bonds as

possible or as little stock as possible. However, it should be noted

that if the firm feels constrained to limiting the riskiness of its

pension portfolio it may do well to hold bonds plus very risky stocks

(or call options) rather than a portfolio with the same variance but all

equities. In the context of the Miller model, the tax advantage of holding

bonds earning the pre—tax rate is maintained while holding portfolio variance

constant means that the pension put has not been devalued. In Section 4,

when a more elaborate version of the PBGC rules are introduced, it will be

possible to have cases were the firm holds a portfolio with some stock and

some bonds even if portfolio choices are only between one bond mutual fund

and one stock mutual fund.


3.   The Miller—Scholes Model

         Miller and Scholes [1981], in an interesting paper, go beyond

looking at the explicit terms of the pension contract. They argue that

defined benefit pension plans involve implicit contracts between the

firm and its employees.

          There is something of a puzzle as to why defined benefit plans

exist, when from the point of view of defining the value of any employee's

claim and any employer's liability a defined contribution plan is so much
                                 13

simpler. e argument is that a defined benefit plan can be overfunded

while a defined contribution plan cannot be, thus providing a tax advantage

in the Sharpe and Black—lepper models to overfunding.   Another reason, also

tax related, is that defined benefit plans systematically bias the accrual

of pension benefits to older workers, who may wish to receive a higher
fraction of their total compensation in pension benefits than would

younger workers. Defined contribution plans are more limited as to

how much benefits can be tilted to older workers. However, it is

difficult if not impossible to find a firm that keeps as much money as

possible in its pension fund.   (Though firms such as IBM and Morgan, Stanley

do have much more than enough to cover the present value of accrued liabilities.)

Also, Scholes argues that tax lawyers can probably find a way to tilt pension

compensation to older workers without resorting to a defined benefit plan.

       Miller and Scholes suggest a third reason for the existence of defined

benefit plans. They contend that the point of tying benefits to salary is

to signal an implicit contract. The employee's pension is tied in part to his

final salary, and salary is tied to how well the firm does. If the firm

has a good year, the worker participates in the windfall through both

high salary and a pension based on that salary. If the firm does poorly,

the worker also participates by getting a lower salary and a pension based

on that lower salary. There is an ex—post settling up with workers having

an implicit agreement tying their fortunes to the firm.

         Such a settling up could also be accomplished through bonuses or

just through raises to people receiving a defined contribution pension

benefit, but the defined benefit plan makes total compensation much more

sensitive to salary. Thus, if the firm and its employees wish to have total

worker compensation tied to the firm's eçuity but do not want the employee's

total non—pension compensation to change quickly, then a defined benefit
                                         14

 plan with an implicit agreement tying salaries to the firm's progress is a

 sensible idea.

          While the Black—Tepper and Sharpe models both attributed to

 the stockholders (or the PBCC) the gains or losses on the pension

 portfolio, Miller and Scholes' view of the complex implicit contract

 between the firm and the employees is that the stockholders are often

 out of the game completely.

         Miller and Scholes argue that there are many similarities

between defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Whereas in a

defined contribution plan the workers explicitly benefit or lose from

any gains or losses on the pension portfolio, in a defined benefit plan

workers have an implicit contract giving them those same gains and losses.

However, the workers also hold part •of the equity of the firm      in   the Miller—

Scholes model. This equity can be held explicitly, to a limited extent,

through shares of stock held in the pension fund. Mostly, it may be held

in the form of treasury stock.

         In a defined contribution plan, pension liabilities are perfectly

correlated with pension assets——if the stocks and bonds in the fund rise

in value the present value of the liability to the work force rises by the

same amount. In the Miller—Scholes interpretation of a defined benefit

scheme, pension liabilities are also highly correlated with pension assets——

including the company's own     stock   that is implicitly held.

        While Miller and Scholes actually appear to have an extremely rich

model in mind, at the risk of being overly simplistic I will write down a

potential one—equation version.

        Let C =    the level of benefits guaranteed by the PBCC
           PE      equity in th firm implicitly included in pension assets
            T =    value   of emplo'ee benefits if the plan itm-iediately terminated.

             S =   current   market value of stocks held in the pension plan

            B =    current   market value of bonds held in the pension plan
                                          15


          The model is:


 (3.1)   T Min(Max(G, S +   B   -I-
                                      FE), L(PE, S, B))

          If the plan terminated at any moment the workers would receive

 at least C——the amount guaranteed by the PBCC. If implicit plus explicit

plan assets exceeded C then in a termination the workers would receive a

package of benefits equal to the total value of the plan assets, up to a

maximum of L(pE, S, B). If the firm did well then both the asset and

liability side of the pension balance sheet would rise. However, we will

leave open the possibility that if plan assets became sufficiently great

the workers would not receive all of the gain.

         In negotiating compensation for the coming period, the firm offers

workers a choice of packages of equal cost to the firm. Each package

defines a schedule L(PE, S, B), C, contributions to the plan, arid an invest-

ment policy. The firm is quite content for the employees to choose any of

the packages.

         The workers may well choose a package consisting of some stocks

and some bonds. The simplest example is when neither the pension put or

the ability of the firm to call away the pension assets for L(PE, S, B)

has any chance of being effective. Then the value of the workers' claims

are exactly equal to S + B + PE. Just as workers in a defined contribution

plan may choose to hold some equities even if the net present value of debt

securities (because of tax reasons) is higher, the e.plovees in the defined

benefit plan may make the same decision.

         There are two important, interrelated, questions that ust be asked.

First, what would happen if the plan became overfunded. For example, what
                                     16


 if L(FE, 5, B) was a random variable equal to 15 percent of the firm's

 market value plus the value of 50 million dollars worth of stock and

 40 million dollars worth of bonds, but the firm had over $90 million

 (say, $110 million) in the pension fund. Miller and Scholes agree if

 a plan can be overfunded in this way it makes sense for the firm to

 hold its share of the plan assets in bonds so as to earn the pre—tax

 rate of return in a Miller [1977] world. However, they claim that

 "The IRS will not allow corporations to fund a pension fund in excess

of the pension promise" (p. 18). The IRS, though, confines itself to

looking at the explicit terms of the pension contract and, as pointed out

earlier, many firms do in fact overfund their explicit pension liabilities.

Given that firms can overfund, one would, according to Miller—Scholes'

reasoning, expect any stockholder assets stored in the pension fund to

be held in bonds. Thus, the argument with the Black—Tepper and Sharpe

models center around whether it is the shareholders, the employees, or

the PBGC whose wealth is correlated with the return on pension assets.

In all three models, if the stockholders are the beneficial owners of any

pension assets they desire to hold those assets in bonds.

         A second question relates to the nature of the implicit contract

between the firm and the employees regarding the pension fund. In the

Miller—Scholes model the firm's own stock may be held by the plan in the

form of an unfunded liability. However, the employees have an explicit

claim on the stocks and bonds held in the plan and not on other securities

held by the firm. One might make an argument for a slightly more extensive

implicit contract of the following sort: the ecplovees receive a return on

a portfolio of stocks, bonds, and firm equity but the only assets held in
                                   17


the pension fund are bonds. For example, in the case above, employees

wanted 50 million dollars worth of stock, 40 million dollars of bonds,

and 15 percent of the firm's equity. W'nat if instead of holding 50

million dollars of stock and 40 million of bonds in the pension plan

the firm held 90 million of bonds in the plan, 50 million of stock

outside the plan, and borrowed 50 million dollars, with an implicit

agreement that the workers would get the return on the stock and the

firm would get the returns on the bonds in the pension plan. If such

an implicit arrangement were possible, an all—bond strategy for invest-

ment in the plan would again make sense unless more could be extracted

ex ante from the government through underfunding and making use of the

pension put. Thus, the Miller—Scholes model encompasses certain types

of implicit arrangements, but there are also some somewhat explicit

arrangements——e.g., that workers have a claim on pension fund assets

and some firm equity, rather than just a more general implicit claim.

This is not meant to be a criticism of the Miller—Scholes model; rather

a clarification of the kind of contracts they are referring to.

        Myron Scholes has pointed out that essentially the same result

as the more extensive implicit contract can be achieved, in the context

of the Miller [1977] model by the plan holding mostly bonds plus some call

options and reproducing the riskiness of a portfolio of some sto'cks and

bonds. As mentioned earlier, in the Miller model the tax advantage of

having a plan is directly proportional to the amount of interest payments

the firm can receive in its plan on a tax—free basis. In a debt capacity

model the implicit contract arrangement does enable the firm to issue more

bonds on its own account to offset the bonds in the pension fund. However,

such a model does not yield any advantages to holding a bonds plus options
                                      18

 portfolio: in the debt capacity model all tax advantages come from

 increasing debt capacity, and altering the pension portfolio's composition

 but not changing its risk characteristics does nothing to increase debt

 capacity.

         The Miller—Scholes model can also be presented using the augmented

 balance sheet approach. The balance sheet, for a firm with no ordinary

 debt, looks like this:5



                  Assets                            Liabilities
         S   stocks in pension fund        L =   firm's   pension liabilities
         B = bonds in pension fund

         V firm's non—pension assets       E =   stockholder's   equity




         The liability is the one specified by the implicit contract between

the firm and its workers. Firms are constrained to not deposit more money

in the fund than the present value of the workers' total implicit pension

claims less the value of their claims on the firm's non—pension assets.

By choosing the appropriate mix of stocks and bonds in the pension fund,

the fir-rn can perfectly hedge its pension liability.

        If the nature of the agreement is that the employees own whatever

is in the pension plan, plus some fraction of other assets, the firm should

be quite content to let employees choose the asset mix of the portfolio.

However, another interpretation of the implicit claim is that the workers

have a claim providing well—defined benefits in each possible state of nature

and what assets are held specifically in the pension plan does not alter

the nature of this claim.
                                  19


        In this case, the tax arbitrage scheme discussed above can be

employed. The firm should issue ordinary debt D in an amount equal

to S, the amount of stock needed to hedge out the pension claim. The

stock in the pension plan should be sold and replaced with bonds. The

proceeds of the debt issue can be used to acquire an equal amount of

stock on the corporation's own account. The net result: on an augmented

balance sheet basis assets are increased by S   D and ordinary debt of D

is issued. It is clear that under either the Miller [1977] or debt

capacity model a tax gain is made: both the amount of bonds in the pension

fund and the amount of ordinary debt has increased. The firm is still

perfectly hedged against its pension liability: it is just that the stock

in other firms that it needs to hedge this liability is held outside the

pension fund instead of inside.

        With the Miller model the firm can achieve the same, objective

approximately by holding mostly bonds plus a few options in the pension

portfolio: the tax advantage coming from holding bonds is still produced.

In the debt—capacity model the bonds plus options strategy does nothing for

debt capacity and hence provides no tax advantages.

        Summarizing, Miller and Scholes see a defined benefit plan as being

much like a defined contribution plan with three major differences:      (1)

workers are guaranteed a minimum benefit C; (2) workers have an implicit

claim on part of the firm's equity, and (3) workers may have a maximum benefit.

In the defined benefit plan the workers are the primary beneficial owner of

pension assets. If a fund does contain some assets of which the stockholders

are the beneficial owners, those assets ought to be bonds. The Miller—Scholes

analysis is the first analysis we have seen which allows for a strategy of

the firm holding some stock and some bonds in the pension plans.

4. Extended Sharpe Model

         A more extensive version of the Sharpe model, allowing for a

more detailed look at ERISA, and also considering the possibility of

certain implicit contracts on the liability side of the pension fund

balance sheet (but not on the asset side) also yields circumstances

under which the employees may be the ones who benefit from the returns

to the securities in the pension fund portfolio, thus allowing for the

possibility of a portfolio with some stocks and some bonds. This model

looks at the specific rules of ERISA and, assuming different types of

contracts (explicit or implicit) between firms and workers, draws impli-

cations for funding policy.

         Let A = accrued pension benefits

             F = funded benefits       S + B

            FE =   firm   equity in the event of plan termination

                   (negative if the firm has to contribute funds)

         The major differences between guaranteed and accrued benefits

are that (1) nonvested benefits are not guaranteed; (2) there is a limit -

to the amount of benefits an individual can receive each year from the
PBGC; (3) benefit increases due to plan amendments only become gradually

guaranteed over a five year period.

         The third item—that benefit increases only gradually become

guaranteed is extremely important for union pension plans. If a new con-

tract is signed every three years, then for two of every three years benefits

due to the last two new contracts are not fully guaranteed. For plans where

benefits are related to salary amendments tend to be much less frequent, ;o

virtually all vested benefits may be guaranteed. Eoever, as explained in
                                     21


Bulow [1979] salaried plans tend to be much better funded than union

plans and thus the guarantee of payoffs may well be much less valuable.

         Under ERISA the firm's net equitY upon termination (pre—tax)

can be written as


(4.1)   FE    Max(F - A, Min(0, Max(F - C, —


         If   accrued benefits are less than the amount of money in the

pension fund the firm can actually terminate the pension fund and get

money back. If accrued benefits are greater than funded benefits then

the workers get whatever is in the pension fund, subject to a minimum of

the guaranteed benefits. If pension assets are less than guaranteed

benefits the firm has to make up the difference up to 30 percent of the

firm's net worth, where net worth is the market value of the firm's

equity according to the PBGC opinion letters.

         The value of the workers' claim upon termination is


(4.2)   T = Max(C,   Min(A, F))

         Taking the PBGC rules literally, we can now look at the explicit

position of the firm and the workers under various funding levels, and

examine investment policy. As a first approximation we will follow Bulow

[1979] and assume constant renegotiation of pension benefits and funding

policy, and assume A, E, F, and C change continuously. The advantage of

this approach is that no "boundaries" get crossed so that if, for example,

F > A at the beginning of a period F > A also at the end of the period

(an instant later). After going through the analysis with this approxima-

tion the effect of modifying this assumption will be discussed.
                                           22

         Table 1 summarizes which party bears the risk of changes in

pension fund asset values for various levels of funding.

         If a plan is significantly underfunded (line 1: F <          C   —   .3E)
the firm is liable for 30 percent of its equity and the PBGC is left

having to pay the balance. If a fir-rn is in such a situation (where it

plans to eventually exercise the pension put or, like Chrysler, may find

it advantageous in its dealings with the government to at least have the

threat of putting a large liability—--even if the threat is never exercised)

it is only the PBCC's liability that is reduced by an increase in F.

Clearly, the fir-in has no compelling incentive to increase F through contri-

butions, so contributions to the plan would be minimized. In this analysis,

the fir-rn is indifferent to holding stocks or bonds in the portfolio, as

are the employees. This result will be modified later.

         If C > F >      G    — .3E the workers will come out with C, the PBGC

will have no liability, and thus the firm has a fixed liability of C.

Consistent with the analysis of earlier sections, the firm would benefit

most by holding an all-bond portfolio.
                                           23

              If A > F   >   C   then workers benefits are worth F. The firm has

 no interest in changes in plan value. Consequently, the fir-rn should be

 willing to hold whatever assets the employees want. As Miller and Scholes

 [1981] point out, despite the tax advantages of bonds employees may well

 choose to hold some equity in the fund under these circumstances. With

 the Miller [1977] model the employees may choose to hold bonds plus call

 options.

             Finally, if F > A the employees are fully protected: all benefits

will be paid off in the event of plan termination. In this case it is

again the firm which bears the risk of changes in plan asset values. The

firm   has   a certain liability of A. Again, it would choose to hold all bonds

in the plan to get a maximum tax advantage.

             The remainder of this section will discuss four questions related

to the funding decision in this extended Sharpe model. First, we have

always assumed that the aegal funding maximum has been independent of the

assets of the plan. There is a question as to whether this is true. Second,

empirically which of the four categories of level of funding are most firms

likely to fall into? A third related question is whether certain restricted

implicit agreements may change one's view of accrued benefits. Fourth, what

is the effect of allowing for the possibility that boundaries may be crossed

so that, for example, a plan may change from being "underfunded" (F < A) to

being "overfunded" (F >          A).
             The first question is are the maximum funding level and the invest-

ment decision at all related? I have no good answer. However, consider an

extremely well funded plan such as IBM's, which manages to generally keep

all accrued benefits funded, with accrued benefits discounted at 4—3/4 percent.

If IBM invested strictly in bonds with a yield to maturity of roughly three
                                   24


times the assumed interest rate, it would be quite clear that most of

the money in the IBM plan was there to fund not—yet accrued benefits.

It is at least possible that the firm would be forced to reduce its
                    8
level of funding.

         In answering the second question, as to which funding category

most plans fall into——one must differentiate between union and non—union

pension plans; or, more to the point, flat dollar versus salary—related

plans. In a flat dollar plan, benefits are raised every few years, and

a new unfunded liability is created. This liability will be funded over

ten to thirty years. Thus, there is always a large supply of unfunded

liabilities——especially in an era of inflation where new benefits may be

a high fraction of total benefits. Also, as mentioned earlier, there can

be a significant difference between guaranteed and accrued benefits in a

union plan. A flat dollar plan is likely to be at least somewhat under-

funded, unless its interest rate assumption is extremely low and the plan

has existed for a long time.

         Plans in which benefits are tied to salary usually are well

funded. The actuarial reason is that such types of plans have salary

growth assumptions that are typically within a few percent of plan interest

rate assumptions. (The effective benefit growth assumptions for a flat

benefit type plan is zero.) The big increase in nominal interest rates

has reduced the present value of accrued benefits so that salaried plans

tend to be fully funded.

         Additionally, because salaried plans do not need amendments to

raise benefits, guaranteed benefits differ from accrued benefits only

because of limits on individuals' annual benefits and the difference
                                       25


between accrued and vested benefits. This amount can be quite

small.

         Salaried plans, then, appear to be usually overfunded (F > A)

and seldom in a situation where A > F > C.          Thus, it is unlikely that

the plan should hold stocks unless there are some implicit agreements

between the employees and the employer that make accrued benefits an

understatement of employees' pension claims. Union plans are much more

likely to be in a situation where A >       F >   C, and even without any implicit

arrangements the employees bear the risk of changes in the value of

pension assets in that circumstance.

         Finally, there is the question of what happens when contracts

are negotiated for long periods, so that "boundaries" may be crossed and

an underfunded plan may become an overfunded plan before any change in

policy occurs. First, it is important to note, as Miller and Scholes

[1981] emphasize, that equilibrium requires that firms cannot gain by

choosing funding policies that systematically take advantage of the stock-

holders. Funding policy is negotiated, so that no gain can be made at the

expense of the employees. Thus, the only participant in the pension fund

who can be gamed against is the government. Bowever, it is also important

to note that even if pension policy is negotiated it is important to have

some idea of what a given funding policy that has been negotiated provides

for the employees.

         For a badly underfunded plan (F < C — . 3E) equity funding clearly

makes sense if bonds are highly correlated with C. Portfolio variance is

inrreased and the firm has a better chance of reducing its liability.

Ideally, it might only wish   to   hold one stock, but prudent man    rules   may
                                       26
require it to hold many. In such cases where the amount of any given

stock held is limited it is possible that the firm may wish      to   hold

some types of bonds. That is, if the firm is constrained by "prudent

man" requirements to hold at least 100 securities it is quite possible

that the portfolio which maximizes the value of the pension put may

include a number of securities that are bonds. This is because short

tern bonds are not a close hedge against pension liabilities, which are

like bonds with extremely long durations. The way to maximize the value

of the pension put is to create a portfolio with as low a correlation

(preferably a negative correlation) as possible with the pension liabilities.

        It is important to note here that there is no particular incentive

for the firm to exercise its pension put so long as its minimum legal

requirements for maintaining the plan are less than the value of newly

guaranteed benefits. One reason firms may not be exercising now, then,

is that it might be even more attractive to exercise later.

        Consider a firm    that   is thinking of exercising its pension put

(F + .3E <   C).   The costs of delaying exercise are (1) the minimum

contributions to the plan that the firm will be required to make plus

(2) any premia that must be paid to the PBGC. The benefits to delay are

that (1) any newly accrued guaranteed benefits directly reduce labor costs

because employees can regard such compensation as certain to be paid;         (2)

if the pension portfolio does well the firm can keep any increase in the

value of F beyond G — . 3E;and (3) any dividends that are paid on the firm's

stock reduce the market value of the PBCC's claim on the firm's assets,

because this claim is not dividend—protected. It is possible that F + .3E < C

but it is still in the firms' interest to keep their plans operating.
                                          27

        This type of analysis is a realistic depiction of the PBCC's

problem in writing tougher rules for pension plan contributions, and

for setting the terms under which multi—employer plans (generally

greatly underfunded) can enter the insurance system. By making the

cost of staying in the system more expensive the PBCC encourages immediate

terminations. However, not getting tough has even greater costs. The

market value of the PBGC's liability is exactly the negative of the market

value to the firm of the pension put. If this put has a positive value

the only way to forestall exercise is to make the terms for continuation

sufficiently lenient that the firm's claim upon continuing the plan has

at least as great a present value as it would upon immediate termination.

        The fact that few firms with substantially underfunded plans

actually do terminate does not dilute the value of the pension put even

without the above argument. The firm can be compensated for not terminating

its pension fund through the behavior of other government agencies besides

the PBGC.

        One of the reasons for the Chrysler loan guarantees may have been

to save the PBCC from bankruptcy through a Chrysler default. While de facto

Chrysler has not terminated its pension plan it may have gotten full benefit

from its option to terminate.

            With modest uriderfunding (G — . 3E < F < C) a portfolio of all

bonds also limits employees' benefits to C.            It is conceivable they would

be willing to compensate the firm for lost tax benefits (less increase in

value of the pension put) in return for the firm placing some stock in

the portfolio. With C — . 3E    < F   <   C    if F is clcse to C — . 3E the firm

may prefer stocks just to take advantage of the pension put, and if F is

near G employees may encourage the firm to hold some stocks so that benefits
                                    28



might possibly rise in value above G. The stockholders would be compensated

for the employees' call on the pension assets and the net cost (lost tax

benefits plus change in value of pension put) through including equity in

the portfolio.

          In these cases of lost tax benefits the employees and employer

would clearly jointly gain if they could establish an implicit agreement

with the firm to hold some stocks for the employees' benefit outside the

pension plan and to hold bonds for the employer's benefit within the plan.

Also, as mentioned earlier, according to the Miller [1977] model holding

bonds and options will dominate holding an equally risky stock portfolio

for the employees, in the case where no implicit agreements are possible.

          If C < F < A the employees get to put the assets to the employers

if assets fall below G and the employers get to exercise a call on the

assets if assets rise above A. As employees hold more stock in the plan

the value of the pension put falls and of the pension call call rises.

           Finally, if F > A it is hard to see any reason to hold

stocks. Throughout this analysis G and A have been assumed to be

constants. It should be emphasized that, as extremely long—term

obligations, G and A fluctuate perhaps more rapidly than do pension

assets.

           Summarizing, if the explicit analysis is carried through,

nonunion plans will generally find F > A, in which case all debt financing

seems called for. The exceptions to this rule would be caused by (a)

implicit pension liabilities exceeding the explicit liabilities; or (b)

institutional constraints on what a prudent portfolio may consist of.

In a flat dollar plan, however, it appears very likely that the workers
                                   29



will be responsible for any change in pension asset values. In that case,

the firm will be indifferent as to what is held in the plan and will hold

whatever the employees desire.



Conclusion

        Several models of pension liabilities have been presented here.

The basic conclusions are as follows: In the Black—Tepper model the

present value of the employee's claim is independent of the pension fund

portfolio, and the possibility of making money from a plan termination

is ignored. The stockholders gain or lose from any change in pension fund

asset values, and wish that those assets be held in bonds because either

(a) with a Miller {1977] model bonds earnings the pre—tax rate of return

are a positive net present value investment or (b) with a debt capacity

model, bonds in the plan may increase debt capacity.

        The original Sharpe model also gives employees a claim with a

value independent of the value of the firm's pension portfolio. However,

the firm also holds a valuable pension put. The firm will wish to either

fund as little as possible and hold all stocks (assuming that stocks have a

lower correlation with pension liabilities than do any fixed income

securities), thereby taking advantage of the pension put, or fund as much

as possible and hold all bonds for the Black—Tepper reasons.

        Under the Miller—Scholes model the employees have a complex implicit

claim on the firm. If that claim includes whatever assets are in the pension

fund, then the stockholders cannot gain by altering the pension portfolio.

(Under the assumptions of the Miller [1977] model, however, the employees

will gain from having bonds plus options rather than stocks and bonds.)
                                   30



        However, if it is merely that the employees hold a claim which

may be hedged by holding stocks in the pension fund, then in the Miller—

Scholes model also the firm should try to hold as many bonds as possible

in the pension plan and, if hedging the pension liability is desirable,

the liability should be hedged either with stocks outside the pension

plan or, under the Miller [1977] model, with call options in the pension

portfolio.

        The extended Sharpe model, which looks at the explicit terms of

ERISA, notes that if the market value of pension fund assets exceeds the

present value of guaranteed benefits but is less than the present value

of accrued benefits, then the employees have a claim worth exactly the

market value of the pension fund's assets. Many union plans may have

assets in this range. In such a situation the firm will be happy to let

the employees choose investment policy. Outside this range, the extended

Sharpe model yields the same strategy as the original Sharpe model: either

all stocks or all bonds, depending on whether the pension put or the tax

advantage of bonds is more valuable.

        In general, if the Miller [1977] model is assumed, then if firms

are the beneficial owners of any assets in the pension fund they would

want those assets to be held as bonds if the plan is well funded (to

maximize tax advantages) and as stocks if the "pension put" becomes more

important. If the employees are the beneficial owners of the assets they

may wish any combination of stocks and bonds, as in a defined contribution

plan. If the Miller model is assumed, then the tax advantage of holding

bonds is indirect, and the argument must be made that holding bonds in the

plan increases firm "debt capacity" and allows for more on—balance sheet debt.

         Clearly, the important question to be answered is who in fact

does bear the risk of changes in pension asset values. That question

is answered in a slightly different manner in each of the above models.

                                FOOTNOTES


 1. The crucial elements about Black and Tepper's view of the pension
     liability are that (1) the workers negotiate a claim whose value
     is independent of the pension fund's performance, and (2) the
     possibility of gaining at the expense of the PBCC is ignored.
     They can accoimnodate views of implicit pension contracts, so long
     as the contracts do not make the terminal value of benefits dependent
     upon fund performance.

     The same results can also be achieved by making assumptions about
     worker preferences. For example, a stronger than needed assumption
     would have, workers indifferent among all streams of pension benefits
     with the identical present value. Then the problem of the firm could
     be thought of as how to minimize the present value of pension costs,
     given the present value of pension liabilities, the tax laws, and the
     stipulation of ignoring the PBGC.

2. However, to the extent that such firms can sell off their tax shelters
    to other firms in the normal corporate tax bracket these firms benefit
    equally from extra debt capacity. Therefore, only if the firm could
    not dispose of its tax benefits would there be no advantage to holding
    bonds. Since many firms (especially financial institutions) are in
    low but positive average tax brackets and high marginal brackets (see,
    e.g., Feldstein and Summers [1979]) every year despite changes in
    income, one might assume that in fact some of these firms are able to
    dispose of excess tax shelters.

3.   Fischer Black has pointed out to me that the effectiveness of such
     funds has been reduced by Revenue Ruling 80—345. Rhile in principle
     these funds can in fact turn much interest income into dividends, it
     should be noted that very substantial portfolio turnover may be
     necessary to achieve this purpose.


4. As a technicality, the percentage'is more like 3/13, or 23 percent.
    If a firm has a market value of $10 million it can be liable for
    $3 million. If stockholders anticipate this payout the market value
    of equity will only be $10 million if it would be $13 million without
    the pension payout.

5. This approach was suggested to me by Nyron Scholes.

6. This assumes that the PBGC values guaranteed benefits at market for
    the purposes of assessing firm liability. Actually, the PBCC has its
    own set of interest assumptions derived from looking at insurance
    company rates which tend to be quite conservative (averaging about
    eight percent at the end of 1980). For the consequences of this effect,
    see Bulow [1979].

7. For example, if stocks are more highly correlated with the price of
    annuities than short term bonds are, then holding short term bonds
    is the way to maximize the value of the pension put. This may be
    true if the stock market tends to fall in response to an increase
    in long term nominal interest rates.

8. However, as long as the amount of interest income the firm could
    receive would increase, the net tax impact of such a move would
    still be favorable.
