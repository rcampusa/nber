                    FOREIGN BONDS IN THE INTERWAR PERIOD


                                  ABSTRACT


     This paper examines the patterns of defaults, renegotiations, and

final settlements on foreign borrowing of several Latin American govern-

ments in the interwar period. One goal of the paper is to provide a

detailed historical account of the borrowing and renegotiation experience

of five Latin borrowers (Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, and Peru).

Another goal is to provide a quantitative assessment of the amount of debt

relief that was implicit in the negotiated settlements of the defaults that

were reached in the 1930s and l940s. In general, the pattern of default and

renegotiation resulted in substantial, though not complete, debt relief, in

the sense of reducing the present value of debt repayments from the sovereign

borrower to the bondholders,

    1. Introduction


           The Latin American debt crisis of the 1980's has regenerated
    academic interest in the widespread bond defaults of the 1930's,
    an experience that Feems to parallel recent events. The decade
    preceding each crisis witnessed a significant increase in lending
    to developing countries and to Latin America in particular.
    Repayment difficulties were widespread and triggered mainly by
    external shocks, including sudden shifts in commodity prices and
-

    real   interest rates and slump-induced reductions in demand by
    industrialized countries for developing countries' exports.
    There were ex       post   accusations of myopic behavior by
    international bankers, notably of a relaxation in credit
    standards, characterized by overly aggressive bond marketing in
    the 1920's or loan—pushing in the 1970's.           When sovereign
    borrowers reneged on their loan contracts, creditors faced the
    expensive and time-consuming process of renegotiation.
           The differences between these two eras are just as striking.

    The institutional arrangements of today's capital markets are far
    more sophisticated than in the 1920's as are the macroeconomic
    policy tools utilized by governments in the pursuit of stability.
    The existence of the International Monetary Fund as a referee for
    the extension of new credit is especially important in creating a

    cooperative environment for avoiding outright default.           In

    addition, the legal consequences of sovereign default have become
                                                                2

more harsh since the 1930's.1        Furthermore, private-sector
lending to sovereign entities today consists almost exclusively
of syndicated bank loans instead of publicly-floated bonds. For
bondholders, debt moratorium simply means a capital loss.      For

the money-center banks, default on sovereign debt could mean
failure, with unpredictable consequences on the international
economy.    Such default, however, may well be less likely than a
bond default since potential defaults are more easily rescheduled
with fewer creditors at the negotiating table. The difficulty in
resolving interwar defaults was a reflection of the myriad of
bondholders whose consent was required.     Nevertheless, it was
this very same dispersion that allowed final settlements to
include partial debt forgiveness. Therefore, as an illustration
of the process and consequences of negotiation and settlement,
albeit in different institutional and legal environments, the
interwar defaults of Latin America remain of great interest.
     Historical parallels reach back much further than the
1930's.     As one of us has written earlier, before the current
debt crisis broke out:
     The history of international capital movements since at
     least the early nineteenth century is characterized by
     large—scale borrowing of developing regions, and large—
     scale defaults.      Many of the same debates over
     prudential standards, government guarantees of foreign
     loans, rescheduling of debt, and so forth have been

          •The sanctions that private creditors can impose on
defaulting countries have increased significantly through changes
in international law since 1945.   Although these legal remedies
have not been called upon in the current crisis, they may well
serve as another incentive for sovereign borrowers to avoid
outright default. See Lewis Alexander (1987).
                                                                   3

      pursued for one-hundred-fifty years. And even many of
      the actors remain the same. A number of Latin American
      countries that are still among the most problematic for
      foreign loans first entered the London bond market upon
      independence in 1822—1825, and defaulted soon after,
     setting in train a hundred years of alternating
     solvency and default.2
     Intermittent bond defaults were a normal cyclical occurrence
for Latin America by the late nineteenth century.     As a rule,
they were rapidly followed by settlement so that parties on both
sides could get back to the business of shifting capital from
Europe, especially Britain, to the periphery.3      Because these
default settlements involved the forced rewriting of loan
contracts, some modern observers have suggested that they are
directly comparable to today's multilateral reschedulings.4
However, such a characterization obscures an essential component
of the nineteenth century bond settlements -—    substantial    debt
forgiveness.
     In contrast to the nineteenth century pattern, the defaults

and subsequent negotiations of the interwar period were greatly
disruptive to capital inflows to Latin America, with some bonds
evading permanent settlement for decades. The general impression
is that penalties for choosing to default in the 1930's were
severe.     Access to credit was, indeed, limited for decades
following the numerous defaults, and capital flows of equivalent

century lending.

magnitude to those of the 1920's did not reappear until the
1970's.     However, the aftermath of these bond defaults is not
well understood.        One question is whether exclusion from
international    borrowing was a consciously-imposed penalty of
default or whether the general breakdown of international capital

markets accompanying (and somewhat preceding) the defaults of the
Depression era, followed by the turmoil of World War II and the
emergence of new international financial institutions, created
this international capital immobility without discrimination. In
an attempt to discover the existence and harshness of penalty
imposed on interwar borrowers in Latin American, it seems
sensible to start by comparing outcomes for defaulters to   those
for   non-defaulters.

      This paper adds to recent investigations of the realized
cost of foreign capital to individual sovereign borrowers5 in
Latin America and assesses the impact on that cost of choosing to
default or not to default in the 1930's. A central emphasis of
this analysis is the calculation of the extent of debt
forgiveness implicit in the sequence of debt moratorium,
anonymous buyback of debt at deep discounts, and eventual
renegotiation of the bond contracts. Argentina, Bolivia, Chile,
Colombia, and Peru were selected as illustrative examples of
borrowing behavior. Argentina was one of the few Latin American


        See Eicherigreen and Portes (1986), Eichengreen (1987),
and Lindert and Morton (1987) for independent investigations of
many of these questions, using different samples of countries but
generally reaching the same conclusions.
                                                                 5

countries in the 1930's which maintained full servicing on its
national debt; the other four countries mentioned joined the
burgeoning ranks of sovereign defaulters.
      By calculating the net present value of the stream of income
and repayments on the dollar-denominated external government
bonds of these countries, we show that defaulters and non-
defaulters in Latin America had very different rates of loan
repayment in present value terms.       Argentina, the sole non-
defaulter in our study, made substantially larger loan repayments
in present Value terms, but was not' rewarded by easier credit
access in the postwar period.       Furthermore, it appears that
.interwar defaults, like those of the nineteenth century, resulted
in   eventual settlements of a concessjonary nature which we would
characterize as new contracts written to share the burden of the
unforeseen contingency that led to default.
      Debt relief in present value terms came in three forms:
firstly, the debtors anonymously repurchased bonds at deep
discounts during default; secondly, the final settlements
extended maturities and lowered interest rates; and, thirdly,
unpaid interest was never capitalized.      However, principal was
not cancelled for any of the countries of this study. This kind
of relief may well be mutually beneficial to creditors and
debtors.6    Default did not mean that the countries paid nothing.
Many offered partial payments even during default, and after


      6 See Sachs and Huizinga     (1987) for the argument that
relief can be mutually beneficial in today's setting.
                                                                6

settlement, the countries resumed payment on a substantial scale.
The defaulting countries repaid far less than full present value
on their loans but far more than zero. -

     The   next part of this paper provides some descriptive
background on interwar lending to Latin America.       The third
section discusses the subsequent defaults of the 1930ts, the
extent of buybacks of debt on the open market at deep discounts,
and the terms under which final settlements were reached in the
following decades.   The fourth section presents results on the
actual payments made by four Latin American defaulters and one
non—defaulter over the lifetime of the relevant loans.       The

present value of receipts and payments by the country on its
national and nationally—guaranteed dollar bonds and the ratio of
the present values of payments to principal provide alternative
measures of the effective cost of lending from the creditor's
point of view and indicate the ex post borrowing terms available
to the Latin American states.    The fifth section explores the
longer term repercussions of default, examining the flows of
external finance to these countries in the 1950's and early
1960's when penalties of restricted credit access against
defaulters might have been enforced. The final section provides
a summary of results and conclusions of relevance to the Latin
American debt crisis of the 1980's.

2. Lending   in   the Interwar Period


     Foreign lending to Latin America has a long history as
predominantly private funds have been repeatedly channelled into
the region in the forms of loans to governments or private
enterprise, as well as equity capital.          Each episode of
substantial capital inflow has displayed a distinctive character
but all have included some signs of failure of capital markets,
the details of which bear lessons for present experience. The
wave of lending through the nineteenth century to the newly-
independent Latin American states, mostly by Britain, exhibited a
recurring pattern of lending, default, and settlement, with only
moderate financial repercussions on the defaulters and, for the
latter part of the period, no extended exclusion from
international capital flows.7
     The far shorter and more dramatic period of lending between
the world wars witnessed the rise of New York as the dominant
financial center and an acceleration of loans to governments in
Latin America.       Although the value of Latin America's gross
external obligations never matched that of North America, Asia or
Continental Europe, its debt was highly concentrated in a few
countries, especially Argentina and Brazil.    Furthermore, Latin
America accounted for up to one quarter of new capital issues
floated in the United States by foreign entities in the 1920's,
borrowing over $2 billion in bonds on the New York market as well


        Again, see Fishlow (1985).
                                                                 8


as accounting for almost half of American direct investment.8
When the general speculative surge in financial markets collapsed
in 1929, Latin American borrowers were pushed into widespread
default as the world economy tumbled into depression.    However,
it should be remembered that in contrast to Latin American
repayment difficulties of the 1980's, Latin American defaults in
the interwar period were but a footnote to defaults by larger
European borrowers and the breakdown of international markets.
     World War I marks a significant break in the previous
pattern of international finance. The United States emerged-as a
net creditor while Britain's lending subsided in response to its

declining savings rate.      The overall level of international
capital flows, however, never recovered to that of its heyday in
the period 1870 to 1914; flows of real private investment between
1914 and 1930 were only two—thirds as great as between 1900 and

19l3. Furthermore, during the interwar period, developmental
finance for the periphery was overshadowed by lending between the
industrialized countries for reconstruction and servicing of war
debts.

     The lending of the interwar period, primarily in the 1920's,
created a new pattern of large capital flows going to sovereign
debtors (rather than to the private foreign debtors more
important in nineteenth century lending). The new central actor,
the United States, responding to the relatively long and

defaultless boom period of the 1920's, provided rapidly rising
flows to Latin America, peaking in 1927 and 1928, then dropping
off in 1929 as U.S. domestic asset returns peaked, declining
sharply as a result of the 1929 stock market crash, and trailing
off to zero by 1931.
       After the end of World War I, the U.S. had stepped up its
investment flows to Latin America in response to improved
economic opportunities.     Some Latin American countries had used
wartime senii—autarky as a chance to expand industrialization. As
export prices rose after the war, the borrowers' debt servicing

capacity improved.     Both the Latin American governments and U.S.

investors were eager for foreign investment.      Between 1914 and
1919, U.S. investment in Latin America increased by half, and
over the next decade, 1919 to 1929, it doubled from its 1919
level.10 Between 1925 and 1929, net long-run capital flow from
the United States was $200 million per year on average. In real
terms, this flow to Latin America probably exceeded the previous
levels reached by British capital in the decade preceding World
War I, although it should be noted that American lending was a
far smaller share of the u.s. 's current account surplusU and of
its income12 than Britain's in the half century before World War

      The principal borrowers in the early 1920's were the
national governments of the stronger countries such as Argentina,
Brazil, Chile, and Cuba. As the boom in public borrowing in the
New York bond market grew over the course of the decade, riskier

countries and numerous political subdivisions --                  provinces,
departments, and municipalities --        also   found it possible to sell

their bonds to American investors.14              Between 1920 and 1929,
foreign dollar bonds issued by Latin American countries totalled
$2.2 billion of which $1.3 billion was owed by national
governments. 15 However, flotation of. securities remained

primarily a    South American phenomenon (with the exception of
Cuba) .   Venezuela bucked the trend and chose instead to retire
all external debt with the aid of petroleum royalties while
Mexico and Ecuador were unable to float bonds, suffering from
impaired credit standings arising from recent and unsettled
defaults.     Fourteen Latin American countries did issue dollar
bonds by the end of the decade.
      These capital flows were equally significant from the
perspective of the foreign lending operations of the New York
market.16 Between 1924 and 1928, Latin American security issues

Bondholders Protective Council (1934), pp. 102-8, 14551. For
amounts issued by the five I.atin American states in this study,
see the detailed debt histories in Appendix B.
     16 It should be noted that overseas investment was never as
large a share of the capital market in the U.S. as in Britain.
In the 1920's, foreign security issues averaged just 14% of all
issues in the U.S., hitting a maximum of 18% in 1927, then
                                                                  11

constituted 24% of all new foreign bonds in the U.S. market.      In

addition, 44% of all direct investment between 1925 and 1929 went
to Latin    America.   Meanwhile, other lenders had shifted away from
the region.       Britain continued to accept new flotations in
London, mainly to finance railroads, in the amount of £132
million ($650 million) between 1924 and 1930, but this gross flow
was offset by large amortizations of old bonds and the sale of
assets to Latin American nationals.17 By the end of the decade,
Britain and the United States, the two major foreign investors,
had together accumulated a stock of investment claims of all
types equivalent to four times the value of exports for Latin
America as a whole while the ratio of long-term external public
debt to exports stood at 1.49.18 This level of debt burden was
not to be reached again until the 1970's but in recent years has
been far surpassed.       The changing pattern of debt burdens from
1920 to 1945 can be observed in the debt ratios of Table 1. What
is most striking is the relatively modest size by today's

falling to 7% in 1929. From Fishlow (1985), p. 424.
     17 United Nations (1955), pp. 14,18. Fishlow (1985), p.

capital issues in London for the entire 1920 to 1931 period.

standards of both debt stock and debt servicing to exports
throughout the period.
     During this decade, capital markets became increasingly
accessible and generous to Latin American borrowers as the United

States, arid Britain to a lesser extent, provided substantial
long-term funds. As overseas issues crowded the New York market,
the issuing houses set up extensive branch networks which
successfully marketed the bonds to individual investors, eager
for the large premiums they offered over domestic returns. The
investment climate seemed much improved over the past, claimed
Madden, Nadler, and Sauvain in their 1937 review of America's
overseas lending. During previous lending episodes, foreign bond
defaults had been numerous and direct investment often generated
tension.   In the 1920's, virtually no defaults occurred on the
over 800 foreign bonds issued in the U.S. nor on non-American
lending.
     As long as the capital markets of the world were
     willing to absorb new foreign issues and debtors could
     continue to borrow, there was no transfer problem, and
     hence no occasion for suspending external debt
     service. 19

     After the fact of widespread default on these loans, the
U.S. Senate inquiry committee of 1932, as well as many
contemporary observers, blamed excessive enthusiasm by the
American investment houses and accused them of violating the
principles of business ethics, utilizing such selling methods as

permanently-stationed overseas representatives, deceptive

prospectuses, and bribery of foreign government officials.
Fishlow (1985) believes the real blame lies with a combination of
the speculative surge occurring in all U.S. asset markets and the
strong competition for overseas loans that New York faced from
London, reflected in falling commissions and risk premia as the
1920's progressed.20      Mintz (1951) adds that bond quality
deteriorated over the three successively higher waves of
financial activity of 1921 to 1929 (as measured ex post by rates
of default) but investor confidence grew. The long absence of
default encouraged an illusion of safety and ever more optimistic
projections by bankers whose techniques of risk analysis were
understandably unable to predict a crash.
     The average yield to maturity on Latin America's dollar bond
issues ranged from 8% in 1921 to 6.3% in 1928, consistently above
the yield on U.S. high-grade corporate bonds.   In addition, the
borrowers paid an average of 4% bankers' commission on top of an
average initial sale discount of 3%•21 For the five countries of
this study, the average yield at time of issue on national and
nationally-guaranteed bonds during the 1920's ranged from 6.2%
for Argentina to 7.6% for Bolivia.22 The annual average for the
five countries together varied from 8 to 99 basis points above
the U.S. low-grade (Baa) corporate rate (except for in 1923 and
1924 when only Argentina issued bonds and at rates 99 and 47
points below the Baa rate.) It is interesting to note that risk

premia paid by these borrowers did not fall significantly through
the decade. In fact, premia over the U.S. Baa rate of yields at
date of issue rose up to 1927, then fell slightly from 1927 to
1930 as lending slackened.     This pattern is most dramatic for
Argentina whose premium rose from 99 basis points below the Baa
rate in 1923 to 60 points above in 1927.          Only Colombia,
borrowing in 1926 to 1928, maintained decreasing premia over all
years (from 172 to 116 to 91 extra points)
       The rising amounts of sovereign debt claims, a higher
proportion of which were short-term and all of which were issued
at higher interest rates than pre-war loans, left the borrowing
countries heavily dependent on revolving credit and the
continuous rollover of debt.    The international capital market
improved over the course of the 1920's in its ability to funnel
investment funds from creditor countries to debtors, but even at
the time, there were signs of the precariousness of existing
international financial arrangements as compared to those pre-
war.    The high average rates charged on overseas loans required
equivalent returns on actual use of the funds and eventual higher

export growth to enable repayment.

3. Default Experience and the Terms of Final Aareements


     The business recession beginning in 1929 severely undercut
the ability of foreign debtors to provide funds for debt service
in their own currency and to transfer those funds into the
currencies of their creditors.     Both budget and balance-of-
payments difficulties arose as export prices as well as volumes
began to fall and as the joint effects of protection, depression,
and the closing of international capital markets devastated both
trade and government revenues (most of which were trade-related
taxes such as import duties).    The 25% fall in the U.S. price
level between 1928 and 1932 was accompanied by a fall in world
commodity prLces which pushed up the cost of debt servicing in
real terms.   The 30 to 40% fall in the prices of coffee, of
petroleum, of wheat, and of tin, created serious difficulties for
Colombia, for Colombia and Peru, for Argentina, and for Bolivia

respectively.22   Ratios of public debt service to exports rose

dramatically for all of these countries in the first few years of

the 1930'S.23
       More importantly, the collapse of international financial
markets eliminated the normal rollover of debt so that debt
service obligations exceeded the value of new lending and net
capital began to flow out of the region. In addition, during the
active lending of the 1920's, many debtor countries came to rely
on new external loans to provide foreign exchange to enable them
to meet their foreign currency interest payments, supplementing
that acquired through export trade.24 The "cross-over point" of
annual payment obligations surpassing new investment flows was
reached before defaults occurred and so cannot be interpreted
simply as a reaction by creditors to unanticipated defaults.25
Instead, the cut-off of new lending may have encouraged debtor

of public debt service, actual or scheduled (if default
occurred), as a proportion of exports:

countries to consider defaulting since a crucial part of the
penalty of default is the refusal of further credit.26 These
countries were left with greatly increased burdens of debt but
severely reduced means of payment and no available instrument for

international settlement through negotiation to substitute for
default.

     The first default was by Bolivia in January of 1931, after
its failure to meet sinking fund payments in December of 1930.27
When payments stopped, the U.S. fiscal agent for the issue (who
cashed the bond's coupons as they came due with funds provided by
the debtor)- then declared it to be in default and the bond
contracts to be broken.     Peru followed suit soon after in April
as did Peruvian provincial and municipal governments.        Chile
succumbed to the combined pressures of revolution and a severe
slump in the nitrate and copper industries in August, breaking
its long record of compliance with external obligations.       The
government imposed exchange restrictions preventing the transfer
of funds abroad, forcing the default of Chilean non-national debt
as well.    All three of these countries defaulted following
political upheaval and the institution of revolutionary
governments who tended to place a low priority on the maintenance
of a good credit standing.     Once the ice was broken, however,
defaults by other Latin American countries (and by European

     26 See Sachs (1982).
     27 See Tables 2 to 5 for summaries of the debt histories of
the defaulting countries of this study.
                                                               18

borrowers) followed in rapid succession.         By 1934, only
Argentina, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic, out of all the
Latin American states, had not suspended normal debt servicing.28
     Default was made easier by its very commonness.     The
     failure of the entire system went far beyond the
     capacity of individual bankers to ameliorate, and none
     tried . . . Capital markets were essentially closed to
     long-term movements and only functioned to sustain
     short-term flight to the United States, providing
     little incentive for conformity with the rules.29

     The loan contracts of the defaulted bond issues technically

guaranteed against loss of principal or interest, usually by
pledging the 'good faith and credit' of the government as well as
by the common inclusion of a security clause assigning specific
government revenues or properties30 to the fulfillment of the
stipulated servicing. However, when defaults occurred, it turned
out that these guarantees were meaningless. The relevant assets
were rarely within reach of the creditors.      Bondholders were
faced with the difficult problem of a sovereign debtor, with the

     28 And even in Argentina, some non—national dollar bonds
went into default for a brief period. It is sometimes argued
that the readjustment of inter-ally debts and reparations
payments in the 1920's for the former creditors to the world,
Britain, France, and Germany, set a tempting example for the
periphery, and in combination with the derogation of the gold
clause by Britain in 1931 and the U.S. in 1933, succeeded in
undermining Latin American belief in the sanctity of contracts.

     29 Fishlow (1985), p. 429.
     30 Revenues from natural resources or domestic monopolies
such as railroads or the tobacco industry and properties such as
bullion or commodities were popular backing assets. For example,
Peru's nineteenth century loans were secured on its valuable
guano deposits while a 1922 British loan to Brazil was backed by
coffee. From Borchard (1951), Part II, Sec. VII.
                                                                   19

rights and powers of a state, unable to be sued without its
consent, and over whom foreign creditors had negligible legal
influence.      The United States government refused to employ
economic sanctions or to claim redress on behalf of its
nationals, leaving bondholders with only negotiation through
privately-formed committees as a means of arranging resumption of
payments. 31

       Furthermore, defaulting countries gained the advantages of
being able to write off part of their_debt through favorable
readjustment plans in the future as well as the possibility of
substantial buybacks of debt at a considerable discount since the
uncertainty of default depressed bond prices by 75% or more.32
The debtor would repurchase its own bonds in the open market at a
price less than 100, a procedure sometimes allowed under the
original bond contract. For example, of the 36 bonds considered
in this study, 23 of the contracts allowed such redemptions at
market prices.      After default, with those contracts broken,
countries engaged in this practice whether previously allowed or
not.

       Table 6 summarizes the experience of the five debtors during

default, presenting estimates of buybacks at deeply-discounted
prices in the period between the original abrogation of the bond
contracts and the date of final and binding settlement. Peru was

the dollar in 1939.

Bolivia had buybacks in 1957 only.
Colombia defaulted on sinking fund payments of its guaranteed issues
  in 1932, on interest payments of these issues in 1933, and on sinking
  fund and interest payments of its national issues in 1933. Final
  settlement was reached on its national issues in 1941 and on the
  guaranteed issues in 1942. As a result, its buybacks include the
  years 1933 through 1940 for its netionalissues (with the addition
  of $14,500 retired in 1941) and the years 1931 through 194]. for its
  guaranteed issues.

most active in this process, purchasing 31% of the principal
outstanding at default at an average price of 21 cents on the
dollar. About one-fourth of these buybacks occurred in the early
years of default, but most took place in the late 1940's during
the period of its unilateral offer to bondholders (at an average
price of 22 cents) .   Colombia repurchased a smaller percentage
but over a shorter period and is the only country directly
accused by the Council of encouraging a low market price for its

debt for the purpose of discounted redemption.33        Chile too
bought back a significant amount of its debt, with about one-
third occurring in the first few years of default.     The Chilean

government's sense of timing must have been less keen than that
of Peru or Colombia because the effective discount was only 41%.
The same might be said of Bolivia's government who failed to take
advantage of the shockingly low prices to which their debt sank
in the 1930's, repurchasing almost none. The net effect of this
generally unobserved and uncontrollable activity on the part of
debtors was to lighten the burden of debt before or during
negotiations on adjusted service.34
     Argentina stands out as the only major Latin American debtor
to abide by its original bond agreements and continue full
service on its national debt.         Carlos Diaz—Alejandro (1983)

         See Appendix B.4. Colombia's Debt History for details.
         Argentina's bona contracts allowed repurchases through
the sinking fund at market price. Between 1931 and 1936, it
purchased a modest 15%, all through normal sinking fund payments,
at an average price of 73.

argues that Argentina chose not to default on its bonds because

of the over-riding importance of its export dependency on Britain
whose financial institutions used their considerable political
clout to force an agreement upon Argentina. The notorious Roca-
Runciman Treaty of fl33 provided limited guarantees for Argentine
exports in return for onerous concessions including Continued
debt service payments.   The government must have believed that
any tampering with debt service was sure to be commercially and

politically costly.   But it seems that continued servicing also

had high political costs.    The external economic pressures on
Argentina were 'additional causes of xenophobic antagonisms
toward the very visible control that foreigners held over vital
segments of the national economy,"35 antagonisms which were
crucial in the subsequent rise of Peron.36
      By the late 1930's, many countries' ability to service
their debt had markedly improved.     Many governments had made
unilateral offers of readjusted service which, depending on their
terms, a number of bondholders had accepted.     Such acceptance
gained the creditor some immediate coupon payments but at the
risk of nullifying the original legal commitment and lessening

pressure on the borrower.37 Bondholders indicated their approval
of the new contract for repayment and the dissolution of the old

by having their bonds stamped appropriately by the fiscal agent
who would mark them as assenting or by exchanging the old bond
certificates for new ones with the amended servicing obligations.
Payments on coupons would then begin according to the new
contract.     Most of these offers were adhered to by the debtors

(who had, after all, dictated their terms).          However, even
                                                 -
unilateral offers could break down.38

     With the added advantage of having bought back some portion
of their outstanding debt at well below par in foreign markets,
the Latin American defaulters became disposed to negotiate a
formal settlement (to replace the often confusing series of
unilateral offers) with Britain's Corporation of Foreign
Bondholders (established in 1868) or the United States' new
Foreign Bondholders Protective Council (established in 1933),
both private bondholders' committees.      Readjustments were not

negotiated by the issuing houses involved because of potential
conflict of interest.       Instead, the two private committees
emerged. Britain's Corporation was an experienced and respected

     '      Colombia's unilateral offer of 1941, rejected by the
Council, was never superceded by another agreement. Insufficient
pressure by the bondholders, most of whom accepted the offer from
the start, or anyone else, left the Republic with no incentive to
increase servicing.
     38 In 1940, Chile regretfully admitted that it had reneged
on the terms of its 1935 offer by diverting funds away from
promised payments but continued to do so at an increasing rate,
adding to the pressure for it to make a new offer of servicing.
                                                                  23

institution by the interwar period while the U.S.'s Council
served to replace a long series of ad hoc and sometimes competing
bondholders' negotiating committees.39 - However, "in the absence

of the lure of future capital flows (and the threat of their
blockage) the power of the U.S. Bondholders Protective Council
was nil,"40 claims Fishlow (1985).     Perhaps as a result of this
limited bargaining power, discussions with debtors tended to
revolve around the debtor's "capacity to pay", a phrase
signifying the appropriate degree of debt forgiveness since the
result was generally the    consolidation   and extension of existing
debt with significant reductions in interest and extensions of
maturities with some modicum of recognition paid to interest
arrears.      After a readjustment plan was agreed upon by both
debtor government and bondholders' committee, bondholders were
individually free to accept or reject the settlement, but once
the committee accepted a plan and ceased negotiating, further
concessions from the debtor became unlikely.
     In some cases, outside inducements assisted the negotiating
process. In the post-1945 period, the new International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development would not lend to countries in
default, a policy which in the immediate postwar years hit Latin
America    hardest.   Chile had made a unilateral and ungenerous
offer to holders of its defaulted issues in 1935, but then failed
to uphold even its undeinanding terms, to the continuing dismay of

the U.S. Council. It was not until Chile made an application for
a $40 million loan from the IBRD in 1946 that it saw fit to
renegotiate a more lasting debt readjustment plan.    The Bank's

policy on outstanding default was to take the country's attitude
into consideration but not to play an intermediary role nor to
disqualify the borrower.41 Nevertheless, its pressure on Chile
to settle with its bondholders was sufficient to elicit a new
plan in 1948 which the U.S. Council could see fit to recommend.
The day after Chile announced its settlement, the IBRD announced
its approval of a $16 million loan to Chile.         The Chilean
settlement provided new 46—year bonds in exchange for national,
Mortgage Bank, and municipal external bonds.    Interest arrears

were to be compensated as arranged under the earlier plan which
had provided variable annual payments averaging 20% of the past
interest due since 1935 (with no capitalization).    Current and
future interest, originally contracted at 6 to 7%, would be paid
at a rate of 1.5% in 1948, rising to 3% in 1954. By comparison,
the yield on U.S. Baa corporate bonds in 1948 was 3.47%. Most of
the old bonds had been due in the early 1960's so the adjustment
of maturity to 1993 represented a thirty-year extension.
     The terms of individual agreements varied but in general,
the ones that lasted were the result of negotiations with the
bondholder organizations and provided interest rate reductions
ranging from 50 to 70% of the original rate (leaving a new rate
of 3% in most cases) and extensions of maturities by twenty to

thirty years. In general, a partial payment for unpaid interest
was offered, summed without capitalization, often in the form of
extra bonds.   Chile, Colombia, and Peru achieved settlements of
this type in 1948, in 1941, and 1953 respectively. The maturity
of Peru's debt was stretched out to 50 years while Colombia's was
only 30 years. Chile's settlement included payment of about 12%
of its unpaid interest since default, Colombia's included about
20%, and Peru's included about 15%. In 1958, after many failed
attempts, Bolivia reached a more forgiving arrangement, involving
a 35—year extension of maturity, a 3% interest rate, and
provisions to pay less than 8% of accumulated unpaid interest.
     It is interesting to note that the longer a debtor held out,
the better it fared in the conditions of settlement.        Colombia
settled unilaterally but early and so paid more.    Overall, the
level of debt forgiveness involved in these settlements was
clearly substantial.    The yield on U.S. Baa corporate bonds
ranged from 4.3% in 1941 to 3.5% in 1948 to 3.7% in 1953 and 4.7%
in 1958.42 Thus, the new contracts for the defaulting countries
provided finance at less than the U.S. Baa market yield whereas
the original contracts yielded consistently more than these
rates.

     The final settlements achieved by these interwar defaulting

debtors, after long and tangled negotiations and many false
starts, can be characterized as containing a realistic element of

debt forgiveness.      With an acceptable agreement in hand,
countries could return to paths of growth and development

unhindered by an excessive overhang of debt. By 1945, the ratio
of the stock of public external debt to yearly exports for Latin
America as a whole had declined substantially to •7743,
benefitting from the combined effects of the recovery of
international trade and the widespread practice of repurchasing
bonds below par.


4. Estimating the Extent of Default and Debt Forgiveness


        In this section, we estimate the extent to which the debtor
countries reduced the burden of debt servicing via suspension of
debt payments and renegotiation of debt contracts.      To measure
the extent to which debtors escaped the burden of debt servicing,
we calculate the present value of the borrowing and net
repayments of bonds issued in the 1920's and 1930's for several
Latin American countries.     This measure is calculated using all
of the long-term nationally-guaranteed bond debt issued in
dollars and outstanding through the 1930's for five Latin
American countries:      Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, and
Peru.     A comparison of these measures for defaulters and non-

          Diaz—Alejandro (1983), pp. 27—28.
More specifically, from Table 1, the ratio of the stock of public
external debt to exports in 1945 was:

Argentina       23%
Bolivia         75%
Chile          156%
Colombia        61%
Peru            93%.
                                                              27

defaulters will indicate the effective level of debt forgiveness
inherent in the process of default and settlement as well as the

direct ex post benefits of choosing default.44
     All nationally—guaranteed dollar bonds issued after 1920
were included,45 each issue being tracked from the date of issue

until redemption (or 1980).    Dollar debt in the form of bonds
constitutes the majority of public debt for all of these
countries, and the debt of the central or national governments is

usually the dominant componentof total foreign debt.
     Dominick and Dominick, a New York investment house,
published a compilation of all foreign loans issued in the United

States and still outstanding in 1936.    These listings provided
information on principal amount, issue price, and contract
provisions for the sinking fund.    The bonds were then followed
from year to year, using a variety of sources46 to obtain data on
prices, amount of the principal outstanding at year's end,

     44 Other authors have calculated similar measures for other
samples of bonds. Eichengreen and Fortes (1986) use a basket of
33 dollar bonds issued in the 1920's by foreign governments or
with government guarantees and estimate the realized rate of
return to lenders to be 3.25%. They do not consider the impact
of discounted buybacks.   Lindert and Morton (1987) track all
bonds issued by ten governments from 1850 to 1970, including
Argentina and Chile. They calculate a number of summary measures
in both real and nominal terms, finding that bondholders received
a positive return premium of .44% overall and of 1.21% for bonds
issued from 1915 to 1945.
         A Bolivian issue of 1917 with 23—year maturity was
included because it marks the first of Bolivia's small borrowings
in the New York market.
     46 The main sources used were the annual eport of the
Foreign Bondholders Protective Council and the monthly Bank an
Quotations Record.
                                                               28

interruptions of contractual payments on interest or principal,
and the conditions of subsequent resumption of servicing.      In

all, the bonds followed consisted of fourteen Argentine bonds on
which no default occurred and four Bolivian, twelve Chilean, six
Colombian, and four Peruvian issues, all of which experienced
default, as well as the exchange bonds offered by each defaulting
country as part of its default settlement.
     For each bond, information on market prices, on contractual
interest obligations, and on amounts outstanding for each year
was combined to generate estimates of annual payments of interest
and principal. We assume that principal payments were made at
market prices when sinking funds allowed repurchase at prices
below par or when unrecorded buybacks occurred. Information on
the extent and terms of debt buybacks is problematic only for the
first few years after the onset of default. Almost all of the
original contracts allowed repurchases at market value, and prior
to default, all repurchases were reported in a timely fashion to
the fiscal agents. Buybacks durina the period of default did not
get reported at all to either the Council or the agent until
settlement negotiations began and then only intermittently until
a final settlement was reached and relations normalized. All of
these countries initiated negotiations soon after default at
which time total repurchases during the preceding period were
confessed.   The gap in reporting rarely exceeds three or four
years.   Equal repurchasings during each year were assumed if no
other indication was available. Adjustments were also made when

 Default occurred in 1932 for Colombia and in 1931 for other defaultors.
 Th. present value ratio post-dafault is the ratio of repayments after
   default to principal outstanding at default, both discounted to 1931.
                                                              29

there were service provisions for stamped (indicating acceptance
of revised contractual obligations) as well as unstamped bonds,

using reported information on acceptances.
     The payments for all bonds in each year were summed so that
national totals could be calculated. The pattern of receipts and

payments for each country are displayed in Graphs 1 to 5.
Present values of the payments were calculated using a risk-free

discount rate, the yield to maturity on U.S. government bonds of
comparable length.47   This discounting evaluates the yield on
issues from the investor's point of view, assuming that investors
chose Latin AmerIcan government bonds as long-term holdings
Finally, the resulting present values of borrowings, payments,
and net payments and the ratio of payments to principal were
calculated as summary measures. The ratio of repayments to debt
flotations can exceed 1.0 if the debt is mostly repaid and at
coupon rates in excess of the U.S. government rate.    The ratio
will be less than 1.0 if the risk premium on coupon rates was
insufficient to compensate for the non-payments of interest and
principal and for the buybacks at discounted prices.
     As can be seen from Table 7, Argentina paid an enormous sum
in present value terms for the monies it borrowed abroad.    Its

stream of payments on interest and principal turned positive in
1928 and remained so except for 1937 when a new credit influx
pushed it negative again.    (See Graph 1.)    The present value
ratio of payments to principal reveals that when adjusted to

        See Table A.11 in the appendices.
                                                                       30

present values, Argentina paid out 1.25 times what it received.
The other debtors appear to have done very well in their dealings

with international capital markets.            The net present values of
their dollar bonds to investors are definitively negative, and
their present value ratios are well below unity. By borrowing
heavily in the 1920's and then defaulting, these countries spread

out their repayments over a much longer period of time than
Argentina who repaid promptly. (See Graphs 2 to 5.)            Chile, the
biggest borrower after Argentina, acheived effective debt
                                  -

forgiveness of almost 50%.            Peru, the most successful defaulter
as measured by present value ratios, repaid just over half of
principal in present value terms, although on substantially
smaller total borrowings than Chile.                Bolivia, essentially
reneging on its debt obligations for over thirty years, gained
forgiveness equivalent to Chile's for the moderate sums it
managed to borrow in the 1920's.            Colombia, on the other hand,
defaulted completely on its obligations for a very short time
(actually paying no interest for only three years) and quickly
made a unilateral offer to settle, giving its debt a small
negative net present value and leaving its present value ratio
substantially higher than the other three defaulters although
still well below unity.       These levels of debt forgiveness were
indeed an outcome of post—default behavior, as is made clear by
the   bottom   half of Table 7.

       Naturally, the defaulting countries display present value
ratios substantially lower for the stream of payments after
                                                                  31

default than those over the entire lives of the bonds.
Consequently, although principal was never forgiven for any of
these countries, cancellation of unpaid interest and buybacks at
less than par had an equivalent effect. But it is also important
to note that the present value ratios are substantially above
zero, indicating that much of the debt was indeed repaid despite

lengthy periods of default.
      Thus, default resulted in substantial debt relief in the
longer run, ranging from 15% to 48%.        This relief was not
completely intended but was the joint product of unobservable
debtor activity (in redeeming bonds at below par) and the limited
negotiating power of the Foreign Bondholders' Protective Council.
It was not that the Council was oblivious to behavior such as
debt buybacks but rather that it had no choice but to accept the
inevitable.     These countries had defaulted and reasonable
settlements according to capacity to pay needed to be arranged.


5.   The Repercussions of Default in the 1940's and 1950's



     Argentina paid dramatically more for the foreign capital it
had borrowed in the 1920's than did the four defaulters. Were
there offsetting advantages that accrued to Argentina in future
decades?      One legacy of the 1930's defaults was sharply
restricted access by JJ,,   developing countries to international
capital markets until the late 1960's.        However, Argentina
managed to secure credit for refunding purposes and one new loan

Notes:

Exports are of goods and services.
Government external finance includes local and central government
     nonmonetary assets and           liabilities.
Private external finance includes long and short tern assets and
     liabilities.
Total external finance is the sum of government and private external
     finance, official transfers and net direct investment.

All data taken from Tables A.l. to A.lO.

through the issuance of dollar bonds in the late 1930's.     The

government retired all $246 million of its national bonds in 1937

with the issuance of $129 million of 35-year external conversion
bonds and substantial domestic debt. In 1938, an additional $25
million 10-year bond was floated.48       The risk premium was
slightly lower than for its earlier loans, but a conversion loan
is inherently less risky. The new issues yielded an average 4.7%
when the U.S. rate on Baa corporate bonds hovered around 5.2%.

(Earlier borrowing had yielded 6.2%, approximately equal to the
Baa rate over that period.) Thus, Argentina's good behavior did
seem to earn it some return in easier credit access during the
1930's when capital markets were closed to most Latin American
countries.   However, such credit access was short-lived and was
ostensibly provided merely to insure repayment of earlier bonds.
Argentina, as will be seen below, received no special treatment
after this episode in the late 1930's. (See Table 8.)
     In the period 1930 to 1945, a number of Latin American
governments were repatriating, and thereby significantly
reducing, both foreign debt and equity claims.   By 1945, a large
portion of the external debt of Latin American countries had been

repurchased in the open market, often at prices dramatically
below par.   Meanwhile, Argentina was repurchasing at close to

par49 and redeeming at par a good part of its external debt,
causing its stock of public external debt to drop by 55% between
1940 and 1945.       In addition, the Chilean and Colombian
governments took over some of the bonds of non—national entities
as part of default settlement plans in the early 1940's, causing
their stocks of public external debt to rise.     (See Table 1.)
For dollar bonds specifically, between 1930 and 1945, the value
of all Latin American issues outstanding dropped by almost 40%.50
     In the late 1940's and the 1950's, net flows of external
finance switched direction and became positive again.    In these
years, private capital flows to Latin America were much higher
than official government flows and predominantly took the form of
direct investment. International financial and money markets had
not yet recovered from the 1930's so the only indirect investment
was a modest and erratic flow of suppliers' credits. As late as
1960, Latin America owed half of its total stock of debt to
suppliers.51 Direct investment, on the other hand, was somewhat
larger, undertaken mostly by U.S. enterprises through the
reinvestment of earnings, starting off in the petroleum industry,
then increasingly spreading to manufacturing and the extraction

         The prices of Argentine issues never fell much below 75
after 1935, leaving the government unable to reduce its debt at
the hefty discount available to defaulters and seemingly
unwilling to take advantage of what discount there was. Perhaps
such behavior, although technically allowed under the bond
contracts, would have threatened the conversion bonds.

of other minerals. The net inflow of private capital, direct and
indirect, averaged $740 million per annum for 1950 to 1956.
However, for 1954 to 1956, prompted by economic and political
instability in the region, private long-term capital flowed out
at an estimated rate of $40 million per annum.          In 1957,
sufficient change had occurred to draw this speculative flow
inward again and at a level twice that for the early 1950's.52
     Official flows from the U.S. Export-Import Bank and IBRD
provided some additional capital through the 1950's. Of the five
countries of this study, Chile and Argentina benefitted most from
Export-Import credits, granted for the purposes of financing
commercial arrears on imports from the U.S. as well as for
infrastructure projects, while Chile and Colombia received the
bulk of IBRD funds to this group, the funds being directed
towards the expansion of electric power and transportation
facilities.53    However, both private and official external
finance remained at relatively low levels and varied
substantially from year to year in response to political as much
as economic events.
     The flows of external finance to each of the five countries
over the whole period of 1950 to 1964 are summarized in Table 8.
These trends are of direct relevance to the analysis of the cost
of default to the borrowing countries because it was not until
the 1950's that the world had recovered from depression and a

second world war.    Although flows of international capital are
modest in this decade, the supposed penalty for defaulting must
have been paid then, if at all.54 Therefore, it is of interest
to note that as a percentage of exports, the defaulters managed
to obtain equivalent or larger capital flows than Argentina.
     Over the period of 1950 to 1964, all five countries
experienced rising flows of external finance as shown in Table B
(broken down into categories of government sector, private
sector, official transfers, and a composite including the
previous categories and direct investment).        Argentina does
compare favorably with the other four countries in its ratio of
private finance to exports.      It achieved reschedulings which
consolidated short-term obligations into longer term debt both in
1956 after the overthrow of the Peron regime and again in 1959-
60, the latter assistance package constituting its first
significant postwar inflow of capital. Chile received slightly
more government finance over the period than the others because
of higher inflows in the early 1960's (partly bilateral
refinancing and partly loans for earthquake reconstruction). It
is rather amusing that Bolivia, the worst behaved of the five in
terms of timely settlement of default, not reaching a lasting
agreement until 1958, displays the highest ratio of external
finance to exports (although only because of official transfers)




         See Eichengreen (1987) for some econometric tests of this
hypothesis.
                                                               36

     It is difficult to argue that any particular trend
inevitably emerges from perusal of this data.55 Not only must
the accuracy of capital flow information for this period be
somewhat suspect, especially given the existence of conflicting
estimates from different sources, but the modest size of the
flows and their high variability preclude any strong conclusions.
As different categories of external finance waxed and waned over
the period, switching the total flow from negative to positive
and back again, trends are possible to identify only through the
use of multi-year averaging.      These switches can in many
instances be explained by particular political events, e.g., a
new American foreign policy or the overthrow of a regime
unfriendly to foreign capital. Nevertheless, it can be said that
Argentina, having conscientiously retained its creditworthiness
by honoring its debt service obligations, did not receive
nciiceably better treatment in the 1950's in return for its
drnirable behavior in the previous two decades.      Any lasting
effect of reputation formed on the basis of behavior in the
1930's was an incidental factor in determining access to foreign
capital in the 1950's.




     55 In a similar vein, Eichengreen (1987) fails to find
evidence that default in the interwar years affected the ability
to borrow in the period 1945 to 1955 from cross—section
regressions of all external debts of governments for 32 countries
in 1955 and regressions of private portfolio lending for 18 Latin
American countries for 1946 to 1955.

6. Conclusions


     The defaults of the 1930's present lessons for contemporary

experience because these countries actually ceased payment on
their foreign debts and these defaults were acknowledged,
accepted, and eventually negotiated on favorable teris to the
debtors.   Examining the conseq'.iences of defaults that emanated
from an era with so many similarities to the present provides, at

the least, some interesting commentary on policies beinc
advocated today for Latin American debtors.

     From the borrower's perspective, the costs of default
involve both a direct component of actual payments made or
existing debts and an indirect component of reputational effect
on future access to credit. On the basis of the five countries
studied here, it seems that both of these costs were low, so los.
as to be negative. The empirical results on ac.tual payments over
the life of all of each country's dollar bonds indicate the level

of debt forgiveness that occurred. That relief was substantial,
if the basis for comparison is the experience of Argentina, the
single country that did not default.     The debt burden of the
defaulting countries was lightened not only by liberal final
agreements with bondholders but also by the debtors' practice of
secretly entering the bond market and buying their debt at deer
discounts during default.    It also seems that the costs of
default in terms of future external financial flows were
negligible. When the countries returned to international capital
                                                                 38

markets in the 1950'S, no apparent systematic difference between
the defaulters and the non—defaulter emerges, the patterns being
dominated by other factors.      This result is consistent with
findings in Eichengreen (1987) and Lindert and Morton (1987).
     The terms of the final agreements settling the defaults of
the 1930's were highly favorable to debtors and, contrary to
current rescheduling practices, involved a sharing of losses.
The unpaid interest during the period of default was sumirted
without capitalization and added to the total stock of principal
due. The resulting total was consolidated into a new bond issue
with a maturity of 30 to 50 years. Full present values were not
demanded, and there was little fastidiousness about interest
arrears. Maturities were extended to concessionary lengths while
interest rates were reduced below yields available on comparably
risky assets.   These deals were struck with realism, as fair
co promises between creditors and debtors coping with the
.fz.erinath of severe unforeseen external shocks which rendered- the

debtors' abrogation of contracts excusable.45
     Fish].ow (1985) describes nineteenth-century lending to Latin

America as a process of default-induced disruption of capital
flows followed by timely settlements allowing the resumption of

lending for development purposes.    By comparison, it seems then
that the trouble with the interwar period was not default per se
but the general breakdown of trading and capital flows which


         See Grossman and Van Huyck (1985) for a formal model of
excusable default.
                                                             39

removed incentives for rapid adjustment of servicing.     Henry
Wallich (1943) observed that debt forgiveness was both desirable
and necessary to relieve the overhang of Latin American debt and
improve the prospects of a return of international capital flows
to the region.     Thus, a possible lesson of the tumultuous
interwar experience is that there may be potential gains to
creditor and debtor from negotiating reasonable default
settlements and the debtor's reentry to the international system
more quickly.
     Changes in the regulatory, legal, and political environment
have led to a different outcome so far in the 1980's.   No debt
forgiveness has yet been granted, partly because the U.S. serves
as the contract enforcer that was lacking in the 1930's. As a
result, it is quite possible that today's process of settlement
through temporary reschedulings has been to the detriment of
debtors and creditors and that the failure to reach realistic
settlements in the timely manner of the 19th century may instead
recreate much of the pain of the interwar period.

Appendix B. Country Debt Histories


     This appendix provides more detailed histories of debt for

each of the five countries.         These descriptions are drawn
primarily from FBPC Annual Reports, notes in the IMF Balance of

Payments Yearboo)cs, and Bitterman (1973).



3.1. Argentina's Debt History


     Between 1923 and 1928, 289.8 million of dollar bonds were
publicly offered by the Republic of Argentina of which nine
issues were contracted at 6% and one of $20 million at 5.5%. Of
the ten issues, all allowed retirement through purchases at
market prices and further all-owed the government to increase
these sinking fund payments (the total to be spent in principal
payments each year) at will.
     Argentina's aggregate demand faced severe deflationary
pressure in the early 1930's because of the fall in export
demand.    Surprisingly, Argentina achieved a shallower post-1929
decline than the United States through a combination of
relatively loose monetary and fiscal policies and the suspension
of convertibility to gold in 1929. However, total debt service
payments by the government, mainly to foreigners, occupied an
increasing share of the budget, rising to 28% of government
expenditures in 1933.1     Nevertheless, the Argentine government

resisted pressures to default, preserving full payments of
interest and principal despite the lack of new loans in the early

1930's.
     Diaz-Alejandro (1983) attributes this good behavior to the

monopsony power of Britain over Argentine exports.       The Roca-
Runciman Treaty of 1933, the formal expression of this influence,

guaranteed that
     the United Kingdom ...    will
                                  not impose any restriction
     on the imports of chilled beef into the United Kingdom
     from Argentina ... below the quantity imported in
     1932, unless ...     it
                           appears to the Government to be
     necessary in order to secure a remunerative level of
     prices. .    . (In
                     exchange for which) Whenever any system
     of exchange control is in operation in Argentina,
     there shall be available, for the purpose of meeting
     applications for current remittances from Argentina to
     the United Kingdom, the full amount of sterling
     exchange arising from the sale of Argentine products in
     the United Kingdom .                    -


-The treaty also provided for moderate sterling and Swiss Franc

loans to Argentina. Most importantly, the enforcement incentive
spilled over into continued payments by Argentina on its dollar
bonds as well.
     Full service was maintained on all of Argentina's national
bonds throughout their history, but both provincial and municipal

dollar bonds did experience interruptions in payments which were

soon readjusted.      Between 1925 and 1930, Argentina's provinces
borrowed $103 million in bonds of which some underwent default in

1932 and 1933.      Adjustments involving exchange bonds at lower
interest rates but covering all of the original principal and

uncapitalized interest arrears were reached in 1935 to 1938, with

the remaining few settled in 1941. Municipalities also borrowed
in this period, totalling $28 million in bonds between 1924 and
1928 and defaulting on some in 1932 and 1933.    Agreements were
reached in 1938 to redeem some issues early with all interest
paid, in 1939 to exchange some for new bonds, and in 1942 to
redeem some at par with full interest.
     The outstanding balances of $246 million on Argentina's ten
national issues were retired in 1936 and 1937, funded partially
from the proceeds of a new loan of $128.5 million of 35-year
Conversion Dollar Bonds carrying interest at 4.5% and 4%
(yielding 4.6%) and partially by the issuance of domestic debt.
ifl 1938, another new loan of $25 million at 4.5% (yielding 5.1%)
was issued to pay for property acquired by the City of Buenos
Aires and for a national public works program.    As the Foreign
Bondholders Protective Council was happy to point out,
     The Argentine Government, unique in Latin America as
     the only Government which has met throughout the
     depression full service on its bonds, was again able
     this year to profit by this enviable record by raising
     another loan on this market.3
However, the bulk of these new bonds merely replaced older issues
rather that bringing a new net flow of capital into the country
although the lower interest rates of 1936 to 1938 enabled
Argentina to trade 6% bonds for 4% or 4.5% new issues with
extended maturities.

    Argentina's payment patterns for the years 1936 and 1937,
when redeeming all outstanding dollar bonds while issuing a much
lesser amount of new dollar debt appear extreme unless all debt,
internal as well as external, is considered. (See Graph 1.)
Between 1936 and 1937, funded (long-term) dollar debt fell by
$80.7 million and total national foreign debt (including non-
dollar and short-term obligations) fell by $91.5 million (mostly
because of a decline in short-term loans).     However, domestic
debt over this period rose by $86.6 million, due primarily to an
increase in domestic long-term debt, part of a continuing pattern
of steadily rising internal debt over the years 1936 to 1940.
Thus, the dramatic jump in net payments on dollar bonds was
offset by changes in domestic borrowing.
     Between 1946and 1949, under Argentina's new 1946 policy to
convert external debt to internal debt, the government used
reserves earned from export surpluses during World War II to pay
off its foreign debt and to repurchase its railroads from British
investors.     All national dollar bonds were called in for
redemption.    It also required its provinces and cities to
repatriate as much of their foreign debt as bore interest greater
than the rate fixed for Argentine domestic securities.        All

outstanding provincial and municipal dollar debt was redeemed as
a result.

     Again, the payments pattern illustrated in Graph 1 require

explanation.   During 1946, funded dollar debt fell from $139.5
million to zero while total national foreign debt fell from
                                                              46



$159.0 million to $34.1 million (including the redemption of the
60.2 million Swiss Franc loan of 1933). Total debt service was
not as burdensome as these large external principal payments seem
to indicate because of the government's spending of the dollar
balances it had earned during World War II from export surpluses
as well as the steady rise of domestic debt (as in the 1930's).
     This policy of conversion of foreign debt extended to non—
dollar issues as well.    In 1946, Argentina redeemed all of its

Roca Agreement Swiss Franc Loan of 1933, having already called
its loans in gold pesos in 1934, those in lire in 1938, and those

in pesetas in 1942.      By the end of 1949, it had retired all
national obligations payable in sterling except for one Roca
Agreement Loan of 1933, of which £4.2 million remained.
Argentina- contracted no further long-term debt in the form of
dollar bonds issued in thá U.S; narket.         -




     By   1950, Argentina had accumulated large arrears on
  ercial debts to U.S. suppliers and banks, having used up all
of its reserves earned in wartime to redeem external long-term
debt and purchase foreign-owned assets, especially the British-
owned railroads, as well as covering postwar trade deficits. In
1950, the U.S. Export-Import Bank provided a loan of $96.5
million at 3.5% to a consortium of Argentinian banks, guaranteed
by the central bank, to assist in the liquidation of these
arrears on private and public short-term dollar debt to U.S.
commercial creditors.    However, in 1956, after the overthrow of
the Peron regime, refunding-was again necessary to consolidate
                                                                 47




$353 million of trade-related debt with Europe, resulting in the
establishment of the Paris Club in May of that year.

        In 1959, Argentina received its first significant inflow of
capital in the postwar period, in the form of credits to assist
stabilization.      The IMF provided $100 million on standby, a
consortium of nine U.S. banks provided $75 million to finance
arrears, and 54 European banks supplied matching funds,
conditional on the IMF standby which required Argentina to unify
its exchange rate.       In 1962-63, at which point Argentina had
$2649 million outstanding of funded external public debt (mostly
medium-term supplier credits), the servicing of which took up
about 25% of exports, another refunding was achieved with the
help of the IMF, the U.S. Treasury and U.S. AID in exchange for
instituting anti-inflationary policies and devaluing the exchange

B.2.     Bolivia's Debt History


        Between 1917 and 1928, Bolivia publicly offered four issues
of dollar bonds totalling $68.4 million at 6%, 7%, and 8%. All
four issues allowed retirement through purchase at market prices
with sinking fund payments set by the bond contract. Unable to
negotiate short-term loans from American banks in 1930 to
postpone debt—servicing pressures, Bolivia defaulted on its
interest payments in January of 1931 (having defaulted on sinking
fund payments in December of 1930) and then, in 1940 and 1947, on
                                                               48



the principal of its 6% and 8% loans respectively.       Only $3
million was repatriated during the default period, 1931 to 1969,
at discounts of over 80%. Nevertheless, by 1944 unpaid interest
(of $60 million) just exceeded principal outstanding (of $59
million)
     In June of 1948, a presidential announcement proposed a plan
of reduced interest payments starting at 1% and rising to 3% by
1955, with past interest compromised by the issuance of a new
$100 bond for each $1000 outstanding to cover 18 years of
arrears.   Bolivia had amassed $78 million of arrears of which
this scheme would capitalize 7%. However, the Bolivian Congress
failed to approve this proposal (as well as the national budget)
before retiring for the year.        Subsequent general political
turmoil, including a new president in 1949, delayed passage of
the debt plan until. 1950.     This plan wasnever executed due to
procrastination by the executive in the interim, followed by a
   tary coup in May of 1951, and then the new presidency of Paz
Estenssoro in April of 1952.
      In June of 1957, the terms of a new plan of service were
announced for Bolivia's four defaulted dollar bonds, of which $56
million remained outstanding in public hands. Published in June
of 1958, this 1958 Plan proposed that each $1000 bond be stamped
to indicate a new par value of $1100, the additional amount being
in full payment of unpaid interest to the first coupon date in
1957 and constituting about 5% of the accumulated arrears.
Interest payments on the new par value, beginning in the second
                                                              49



half of 1957 would be made at 1% through 1959, at 1.5% for 1960
and 1961, at 2% for 1962 and the first half of 1963, and at 3%
for the second half of 1963 and thereafter to maturity in 1993.
Beginning in 1962, the stamped bonds were to be exchanged for new

dollar bonds which would be provided with a cumulative sinking
fund, of 1.5% per annum for 1962 through 1966 and 1% thereafter,
to retire the bonds through purchases in the market or through
drawings by lot at par. The offer remained open for acceptance
through 1964, then was extended to 1969. From 1958 to 1964, any
bond stamped received all interest paid since 1958.   Because the

Bolivian government was undertaking a comprehensive monetary and
economic stabilization program involving extensive reforms of
government fiscal policy, the U.S. Foreign Bondholders'
Protective Council recotrnnended acceptance of this settlement

plan     By December of 1961, over 70% of outstanding bondshad
been stamped, indicating bondholders' approval of the 1958 Plan.
       Interest was paid according to the 1958 offer from 1958
through the first coupon date of 1960. However, in July of 1960,

remittances ceased.     In December of 1961, the government
announced one coupon payment of $8.25 per $1100 bond, i.e.,
available to stamped bonds only, for each of the years 1962 and
1963, an effective interest rate of .75%, but promised two coupon
payments in 1964 (and did pay a 1.75% rate) and indicated its
intention to return to full compliance with the 1958 Plan as soon

as possible. The November 1964 military coup caused some delay
              the promised new bonds, and so in March of 1966, a
                                                                 50



new proposal for delivery of these bonds was announced, but again

a long delay ensued during which economic conditions worsened.
In 1969, negotiatiOns were finally completed under which Bolivia
resumed adjusted service on its 61.9 million of outstanding
dollar bonds, paying 3% interest with no allowances for arrears.

As of December of 1985, $47.1 million remain outstanding although

none have been traded since 1982.
        Although Bolivia remained in default for almost 30 years, it
did receive some new capital flows after the 1930's. (See Tables

A.3 and A.4.)      The U.S. Export-Import Bank extended credits of

$15.5 million in 1942, $16 million in 1949, and $2.4 million in
1955.      In 1953, the U.S. and Bolivia struck an agreement on
economic assistance to provide agricultural commodities and to
promote mineral exports.      In addition, the U.S. government gave
Bolivia grants totalling $21 million over the period 1946-54. In
1956, the IMF provided a stand-by agreement for $7.5 million (of
   ;h $4 million was drawn) and, with the U.S. government, three
lines of credit totalling $25 million to form an exchange
stabilization fund in return for which Bolivia adopted fiscal and
trade policy reforms.        Continued default did render Bolivia
ineligible for IBRD developmental loans in the 1950's even though
it was a member of the Bank.

B.3. Chile's Debt History


     Between 1922 and 1930, Chile issued dollar bonds totalling
$297 million of which $185 million were national debt (seven
issues at 6 to 7%), $90 million were nationally-guaranteed
corporate debt (five issues at 6 to 6.75%), and $21 million were
non-guaranteed municipal debt (three issues at 7%). Three of the
national issues allowed retirement at market prices, of which two
also allowed the government to increase sinking fund payments at
will. The remaining four Republic issues and all five guaranteed

issues allowed redemption only through drawings at par, although
sinking fund paymenbts could be increased.
     Chile reacted to the initial shock of world depression as

did Argentina by expanding government spending. However, amidst
political turmoil, its short-lived socialist government of 1931
to 1932 eagerly increased the government budget without the
restraint shown by Argentina.    A growing fiscal deficit only
worsened the burden of debt servicing rose as government revenues
continued to decline.    The government concluded that it was
necessary to suspend external debt service and imposed exchange
restrictions to force default on non-national issues as well.
     Interest and sinking fund payments were defaulted for each
national or nationally-guaranteed bond in turn as semi-annual
payments came due, starting in August 1931 until January 1932, at
which time $261 million of these dollar bonds remained
                                                               52



outstanding.   The municipal issues similarly defaulted, between
November 1931 and March of 1932 (with $20 million outstanding
from original principal of $21 million).
     In 1934, the Foreign Bondholders' Protective Council
protested Chile's arrangements to serve its short-term
obligations and to extend its trade commitments to the U.S., both

of which would absorb foreign exchange, without considering
servicing on its defaulted long-term debt.     In October of the
same year, the government passed Law 5580, to take effect in
January of 1935, which stipulated that revenues from the income

tax paid by copper companies and from government profits from the
nitrate industry would be turned over to the Amortization
Institute which would use half as interest and half as
amortization payments on all outstanding foreign (including non-
dollar) debt, no other funds to- be provided for its servicing.
This plan offered reduced coupon payments to be announced in
    ary of each year and available only to bondholders who had
their bonds stamped in agreement with the provisions of the Law.
The Law also set up provisions for a sinking fund for redemption
of the bonds by direct purchase below par in the market or by
drawings at par.   (Nine out of the twelve national and guaranteed
issues did not allow such purchases below par in the original
bond contracts.)

     The government claimed that although the country's economic
situation had improved (in terms of its capacity to pay), because
its foreign loans had, originally been granted based on
                                                             53



expectations of export revenues, it was appropriate that the
interest of creditors be linked to the prosperity of commodities
whose markets were strongly influenced by the policies,
particularly trade restrictions, of the creditor countries. The
Council recommended refusal of this plan, given that in 1934 the
contractual payments on all foreign debt amounted to $41 million
(of which $27 million was interest) while Law 5580 provided a
mere $4 million for servicing (of which $2 million would be
interest) and, in addition, to collect under the plan, the
bondholders were required to waive the rights derived from the
original bond contracts.
     Between April of 1936 and January of 1939, a total of
$39.885 per $1000 bond was offered in interest payments if the
bondholder assented to Law 5580 (by having the bonds stamped),
with back interest payments available to new participants until
January of 1940 for Republic and Republic-guaranteed issues (by
which time 81% of these bonds had been stamped) and until August
of 1940 for municipal issues.     All subsequent annual interest
offers were available only during the same calendar year and
required both assent and surrender of all previous coupons.
Between 1935 and 1948, these partial payments amounted to about
20% of the contracted interest.
     By 1940, the Chilean government was busily diverting
promised funds elsewhere instead of redeeming its debts, and
servicing became even more stringent. A December of 1940 decree
ordered the transfer of $6 million from the Amortization
                                                                54



Institute to the Treasury for the rehabilitation of 1939
earthquake damage (although the government apologized to
bondholders and promised to return to the provisions of Law 5580
in 1941.) However, in 1942, Law 7160 set an extraordinary tax on
copper companies, thereby reducing the revenues available for
debt service. These revenues were also reduced by diversion from
the amortization account of some $22 million between 1941 and
1949.     Furthermore, none of the bonds repurchased under the plan
were presented to the fiscal agent for cancellation and so
continued to participate in the pro rata distribution of
interest.

        Upon refusal of a $40 million loan from the IBRD in
September of 1946, Chile rethought its servicing strategy.      In
the spring of 1947, the chilean government held discussions with
the FBPC which réjected the Chilean proposal of a reduction in
principal.    Then, in March of 1948, Chile presented an exchange
   r for all its dollar bonds under Law 8962 to replace the 1935
law's provisions. The Council commented that "the proposal was a
recognition on the part of the Chilean authorities of the need
for acceptable service."4 A new issue of 46-year dollar bonds of
the Republic would be exchangeable at par for the presently
outstanding bonds of the Republic, the Mortgage Bank, and the
municipalities, consolidating them into a single loan.        They
would bear reduced interest, starting at 1.5% in 1948 and rising
to 3% in 1954 and thereafter. Bondholders who had not assented

          FBPC (1949), p. 103.
                                                                         55




     to Law 5580 and those who assented late were to receive all
     compensation previously offered under that plan in non-interest
     bearing scrip, redeemable over a period of ten years. The offer
     was held open until December of 1970, and the Council recoriunended

     acceptance.    By December of 1949, 77% of the outstanding bonds
     had been exchanged under this offer. More importantly, the IBRD
     approved a $16 million loan to Chile on March 25, 1948, the day
     after the announcement of this settlement.
          In 1950, Chile terminated the allocation of revenue directly
     to the Amortization Institute, and the Treasury began to allocate
     directly the funds necessary to service foreign debt.         Interest
     payments continued under the 1935 Law until 1967 for those who
     assented to that settlement but not to the 1948 Law; the
     remaining amounts outstanding fell to zero by 1970. The 1948 New
     Bonds- were serviced- faithfully until the   remaining   principal was
     recalled in 1978.
          Chile also had substantial non-dollar debt during this
     period.    Between 1885 and 1929, numerous bonds were issued in
     sterling and in 1929 and 1930, a small amount was borrowed in
     Swiss Francs. In 1930, when Chile owed $157.9 million in long-
     term dollar debt, it also owed $160.5 and $16.2 in sterling and
     Swiss Francs respectively (converted to $      at   par). Default on
     non—dollar obligations occurred at the same time as on dollar
     bonds, and the subsequent settlement plans were extended to these

     issues as well.     Law 5580 included all foreign debt from the

-   ::s9rt.    The 1948 exchange offer was made available to sterling
                                                              56



debt in Decexrber of that year and to Swiss Franc debt in August

of 1949.   By the end of 1949, 92% of sterling debt and 81% of
Swiss Franc debt had assented to the offer.
                                                                 57




B.4. Colombia's Debt History


     Between 1926 and 1928, Colombia publicly offered dollar
bonds in the form of two national issues at 6% for $60 million
and four nationally-guaranteed Agricultural Mortgage Bank issues
at 6% and 7% for $16 million.       Between 1924 and 1929, siX
Departments and four municipalities borrowed $67.4 million at
6.5% to 7.5% and $26.1 million at 6.5% to 8% respectively in the
form of dollar bonds without national guarantee.        Both of the
Republic issues and three of the Mortgage Bank issues allowed
retirement through purchases at market prices.          One of the
Republic issues also allowed the government to increase sinking
fund payments.
     Starting in October of 1931, some of Colombia's .inunicipal

issues began defaulting on sinking fund payments. One municipal
issue defaulted on interest payments as well in December. By the
end of 1932, most of the municipal and departmental issues had
defaulted on interest and sinking fund, and the nationally-
guaranteed Agricultural Mortgage Bank issues had defaulted on

sinking fund only.    It was not until 1933 that the Republic
issues defaulted and the Mortgage Bank issues ceased payment on
interest.   By October of 1933, all issues were in default, at
which time $66.1 million of national and nationa11y-giaranteed
bonds and $82 million of departmental and municipal bonds as well

as $13.2 of defaulted sterling debt were outstanding.
                                                               58



    Reduced interest payments were made on the two national
issues after default. In 1934, a payment of 1/3 cash and 2/3 non-
interest scrip (not redeemed for cash until 1937) was offered for
two coupons on one bond and one coupon on the other. Two more
coupons were paid on each in 1936 entirely in 4% scrip (redeemed

in 1946).   In 1940, the government paid half of the contractual
interest on the two bonds for that year upon surrender of both
coupons and turned in to the fiscal agent $6.0 million in bonds

(about   10% of the amount outstanding at the time of default)
purchased since 1933 at prices ranging from 16 to 27.
     In June of 1941, Decree 1388 went into effect, offering a
settlement plan for the national issues. New 3% bonds, External
Sinking Fund Dollar Bonds due 1970, were offered in exchange at
par for the $43.7 outstanding national bonds with convertible
certificates for half of the unpaid interest arrears between 1935

and 1939. The Foreign Bondholders Protective Council protested
    ..nst the inadequacy and unfairness of this offer which was
.ot based on what Colombia plainly can do.     It represents the
most Colombia reluctantly has been willing to do." 5 The Council
objected especially because the decree claimed the government's
"right to stop payments if at any time economic or fiscal
conditions prevent the country from promptly and completely
servicing the new issue"6 and because Colombia was fully
servicing its internal and short—term obligations throughout this

period.      Furthermore, the Council claimed that Colombia had
maintained a favorable balance of trade with the U.S. all through

the late 1930's, with its export surplus exceeding ten times the
interest requirements on its dollar bonds. The Council denounced
a published statement of the Colombian Minister of Finance in
which he
     enunciates the policy of Colombia to be to lower the
     interest rate as much as possible in order to depress the
     value of the bonds and take advantage of the necessities of
     the bondholders who are obliged to sell their bonds at the
     low prices forced upon them by the Colombian Government
     itself.7
Nevertheless, "the Council does not feel justified in expecting
that the Colombian Government will make any more favorable
proposal to the bondholders,"8 and the Council was right.      No
subsequent offer was made on the Republic issues.    By 1945, 88%
of the national issues were reported exchanged. This offer was
unique in becoming a final and binding settlement without the
stamp of approval of the Council.

     In July of 1942, the same exchange bonds were offered for
the Agricultural Mortgage Bank issues with convertible
certificates for $100 of interest arrears (equal to about 20% of
interest owed) and to non-guaranteed mortgage bonds from the Bank
of Colombia, the Mortgage Bank of Bogota, •and the Mortgage Bank
of Colombia for 75% of their face amount only, with past interest

cancelled.     Since no additional new bonds had been authorized,

                                                              60



exchanges were made with new 3% bonds redeemed since 1941 by
Colombia. At this time, it was revealed that approximately 50%
of all the mortgage bonds had been repatriated but not returned
to the fiscal agent for cancellation between 1933 and 1942 when
market quotations ranged from 14 to 38.
     In November of 1944, the same offer was extended to City of

Bogota bonds, again with all past interest cancelled, at which
time it was reported that 60% of these bonds had been bought back

during default.   In addition, one other municipal issue reached
its own settlement in 1944.      The other two cities and all
departments continued in default until 1949 when new 3% bonds of
the same obligors, guaranteed by the Republic, were offered in
exchange for 120% of the principal amount outstanding, in
compromise of all interest arrears since 1932.-      This offer
received the recommendation of the Council. Almost 50% of these
issues had been repurchased on the open market after default. By
      77% of the bonds had been exchanged.
     Colombia had a smaller amount of sterling debt on which it
defaulted at the same time as on its dollar bonds. Five national
sterling bonds issued between 1906 and 1920 totalling $12.9
million in principal and one Agricultural Mortgage Bank issue of
1929 for $.6 million constjtited all of Colombia's non-dollar
long—term debt until the 1933 and 1934 issue of $6 million in
Funding Certificates (similar to the 1934 scrip issued in
dollars). Service was resumed in July of 1942 along the same
lines as the plan for dollar bonds but with no exchange for new
                                                                 61



bonds.   Half of interest arrears was paid in 3% scrip while
current and future interest was to be paid at half the originally
contracted rate.

     Colombia fared moderately well in the 1950's in terms of
external finance.   (See Tables A.7 and A.8.)   It received IBRD
loans totalling $36 million between 1949 and 1954 to finance road
and railway construction and hydroelectric works. Between 1955
and 1960, IBRD extended the country $75 million more.    It also
received $53 million between 1946 and 1954 from the Export-Import

Bank (and from U.S. commercial banks guaranteed by the Export-
Import Bank and the Colombian government).      Between 1955 and
1960, Colombia received an additional $142 million to refinance
arrears on import payments of private importers and commercial
banks. Colombia did not undergo any reschedulings in the 19501s
or early 1960's, its debt having a relatively low   proportion   of

supplier credits to total, leaving it more manageable than that
of other Latin American states.



B.5. Peru's Debt History


     Peru issued 94.5-million of dollar bonds in 1927 and 1928.
Of these, $90 million were three national issues at 6% and 7%
while the remaining amount consisted of $1.5 million borrowed by
the Province of Callao at 7.5% with the guarantee of the national

government and $6.5 million borrowed by the city of Lima at 6.5%.

Tild Republic issues allowed redemptions only through drawings at
                                                               62




par or 105.    The provincial issue allowed retirement through
purchases at market prices.
     Peru defaulted on its dollar obligations between April of
1931 and March of 1932 at which time $91 million of principal
remained outstanding.    Funds remaining with the fiscal agent
allowed partial payments (of .5% to 3.25%) on account of one
additional coupon in 1932 for the national and provincial issues.
In 1937, small payments of .5%, less than 10% of the interest due

for that year, were offered by Peru on its national issues if the

next two coupons were surrendered.      The Foreign Bondholders
Protective Council suggested that approximately two-thirds of
bondholders accepted this payment.    The Council objected that
this small sum amounted to less than 1.5% of the Peruvian
government's budget for 1936.
     In 1940, Peru adjusted a short-term dolLar banking credit,
payincz up its interest arrears and arranging future payments at a
     'duced from 6% to 2% and also continued paying interest on
...ne only foreign debt on which it never defaulted, the Sterling
GuanoIton, at 4% instead of the contracted 7.5%; however, it
attempted no action on its dollar bond obligations. In 1941, the
existing Peruvian Bondholders Committee for the national issues
threw in '' towel,      and the Foreign Bondholders Protective
Cour41 took over responsibility for negotiations.
     Until 1945, Peru's only offer of settlement was on what was
described as 'the Mexican basis', at one sol to the dollar, which

would have resulted in a reduction of principal by approximately
                                                                 63


85%.    In 1945, the Peruvian Congress considered a bill proposing
redemption of service on the external dollar debt by providing
for interest from 1945 to be paid at 1%, rising to 3% by 1950,
and for a sinking fund of .5% per annum. The interest arrears of
the 15 years of default up to August 1945 were to be cancelled.
This bill was never passed.

       In February of 1947, the Peruvian Congress passed Law 10832,
authorizing the government to resume service on the defaulted
dollar and sterling loans on terms less generous than those
considered in 1945.       The Law provided that interest up to
December of 1946 was to be cancelled. New exchange bonds were to
be issued due 1997, Series A through D, corresponding to old
issues of the Republic and of Callao. Series Edollar bonds were
provided to cover two sterling issues.      Interest would then be
paid- at 1% for 1947 and 1948 and at 2.5% -thereafter.     Sinking
fund payments would be .5% per annum of the total amount issued,
to purchase bonds below par in the market or to draw bonds at
par.    In addition, the City of Lima was empowered "to resume
service on its foreign debt in the manner that it may deem
convenient."     (FBPC, 1949, p. 314).    The Council recommended
refusal of this pl&n because it called for the complete
cancellation of interest arrears over 15 to 16 years, amounting
to 90% to over 100% of the remaining principal outstanding on the

issues, because "the ultimate interest rate of 2.5% is lower that
                                                                  64




the Council has ever agreed to recommend for foreign national
bonds,"9 and because
     this legislation does not purport to authorize an
     offer, subject to acceptance by bondholders (as is
     customary and necessary in bond adjustments) but to be
     a unilateral change made by Peru in its contracts with
     all bondholders, with or without their consent.1°
Furthermore, the Council considered the service obligation to be
unacceptably low as a proportion of the government budget or of
exports. Nevertheless, by 195]., 64% of the bonds had assented.

     In November of 1951, following negotiations with         the
Council, a new readjustment plan was announced, with the
Council's recommendation for acceptance. This offer was to take

effect in January of 1953, providing another set of exchange
bonds with conditions similar to those of the 1947 bonds, with a
maturity of 1997 but paying interest of 3% from 1953 as well as
offering non-interest bóaring scrip for 10% of the unpaid
interest arrears of 1931 to 1946 (to be paid off over 15 years).
Both those bondholders who had accepted the 1947 exchange and
those who had not were entitled to participate.       All Coupon
payments made under the 1947 offer would be paid in a lump sum to
those who had refused the 1947 offer upon acceptance of the new
exchange. The new plan also included a new Series L bond issue
in exchange for Lima's defaulted dollar bonds.     The offer was
originally to terminate in 1954 but was extended four times to a
final termination date of 1970. It was not extended to cover the

        FBPC (1949), P. 316.
     10 FBPC (1949), p. 314.
                                                               65



Series E bonds (for the old sterling loans) until 1954. By 1957,
95% of the bonds had assented.

     Peru's non-dollar borrowings were small by comparison.    it

had two national sterling issues for $6.3 million in 1922 and
$10.0 million in 1928 and one municipal issue by Liina for $.6
million in 1911.     The 1928 sterling loan and the Lima loan
defaulted at the same time as the dollar bonds; however, reduced
service (at 4% rather than 7.5%) on the Sterling Guano Loan of
1922 was maintained until redemption in 1960.      In 1947, the
bondholders of the two defaulted issues were offered Series E
dollar bonds under Law 10832, and in 1954, new Series E bonds
were offered with the improved service discussed above. All 1947
Series E bonds were exchanged by 1961.
     Further external financial flows are recorded in Tables A.9
and A.lO. Peru received a nuxnberof loans from the U.S. Export-
Import Bank, including $.5 million in 1945 and then $16 million
more between 1950 and 1955 to private Peruvian companies,
especially mining companies. Between 1955 and 1960, it provided
$149 million more of which $100 million was granted to a Peruvian

copper company to develop mines in the south of the country and
the rest to finance various imports.     IBRD has also extended
loans.   Between 1952 and 1954, it provided $3 million for port
improvement and agricultural equipment imports and $39 million
between 1955 and 1960. Finally, the U.S. gave an additional $11
million to Peru in this period as bilateral aid.

Appendix C. Notes on Methodoloav


    These notes explain the specific definitions and assumptions
used in the cost of borrowing calculations and include a list of
additional data sources.
     The cost of borrowing was calculated in terms of present
values of borrowings, of payments, and of net payments on all of
each country's national and nationally-guaranteed dollar bonds
issued from 1917 onwards, each issue being tracked from the date

of issue until redemption (or 1980).            Each bond's stream of
actual receipts and actual payments, including interest and
amortization and other buyback payments, was converted into
comparable present value by discounting to the issue year for
each bond and then to the common base year of 1920, using the
yield to maturity on u.s. long government bonds for the- year of
issue and for 1920.        country totals are the sum of the net
present values for all its issues.
     Net Present values include principal received as negative
payment amounts and are calculated for each country as follows:

        B   1980                 —(t—t0b)                     —(tOb—l92O)
NPV —              Vtb *(1 + rob)           *   (1 + r1920)
        b=l t—t
                                                                  67



where vtb = payments in year t net of new principal for bond b;

      rob      U.S. interest rate in issue year of bond b;
      tOb —    issue   year of bond b;
    r1920 =    U.S. interest rate in 1920;
        b = bond issue.

     Principal received is estimated as the issue amount of the
bond valued at the issue price in the market minus the bankers'
spread for that country for that year.         Principal amount and
issue prices are from D & D (1937). Bankers' spreads by year and
country are from Lewis (1938) or by country averaged over the
period from Madden (1937).
     Interest payments for year t for each bond are calculated as
the contractual interest rate on all bonds outstanding at the end
of the previous year.          If bonds must be stamped to receive
interest under a settlement plan, then the annual payment is
calculated on the amount of stamped bonds outstanding.            If

interest was paid in scrip, the amount is recorded for the year
in which it became payable in cash.

     Outstanding bonds indicates the end-of-year value for bonds
still outstanding in the hands of the public, generally as
reported by the fiscal- agent for the issue. Amounts are from UNPD
for 1912-21 and from various volumes of 0 & D for 1924-32, of
FBPC for 1934—57,61,64,67, and from MBR for 1970—80.         Missing
years are extrapolated to lie on the trend between the existing
data points.

     Reductions in amounts of principal outstanding (amortization
payments) are valued as follows. If the redemption is recorded,
then the amount called is valued at par (unless otherwise
specified in the bond contract). If official redemptions did not
occur, then it is assumed that all retirement of bonds occurred
through purchases at market price after default and in accordance
with the provisions of the original bond contract before default.
Buybacks that occurred during the period of default did not get
reported to either the Foreign Bondholders Protective Council or
the fiscal agent until some offer of settlement was made. These
buybacks are assumed to have taken place at an even rate during
these periods of non-reporting. It should be noted that all of
the post-default settlement plans allowed for buybacks at less
than par as did 12 out of 36 of the original bond agreements.
Market prices and dates of redemptions are froth various volumes
of FBB for 1923—33, of D & D for 1924—32, of FBPC for 1933—44, of
B & QR for 1945—59,71—80, and of S & P for 1960—70.
     Descriptions of the original bond contracts and the nature
and timing of defaults are from D & D and FBPC. The details of
settlement plans are from FBPC, including partial interest
payments or payments via scrip during default, amounts stamped in
assent, and estimates of buybacks on the market below par.
    United States interest rates are recorded in Table A.l2 and
are from BMS and FRB.
