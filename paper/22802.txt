                                           ABSTRACT

Nonlinear cost-sharing in health insurance encourages intertemporal substitution be- cause
patients can reduce their out-of-pocket costs by concentrating spending in years when they hit the
deductible. We test for such intertemporal substitution using data from the RAND Health
Insurance Experiment, where people were randomly assigned either to a free care plan or to a
cost-sharing plan which had coinsurance up to a maximum dollar expenditure (MDE). Hitting the
MDE—leading to an effective price of zero—has a bigger effect on monthly health care spending
and utilization than does being in free care, because people who hit the MDE face high future and
past prices. As a result, we estimate that sensitivity to short-lasting price changes is about twice
as large as sensitivity to long-lasting changes. These findings help reconcile conflicting estimates
of the price elasticity of demand for health care, and suggest that high deductible health plans
may be less effective than hoped in controlling health care spending.

1        Introduction
      Most health insurance contracts generate nonlinear pricing of health care, as the marginal
price of health care typically falls with health care spending due to deductibles and out-of-
pocket spending limits. This nonlinear pricing creates an incentive for intertemporal substi-
tution, because patients can minimize their out-of-pocket costs by concentrating spending in
years when they have hit the deductible. Little is known, however, about whether patients
in fact respond to the dynamic incentives of nonlinear pricing by substituting health care
across periods.
      Studying intertemporal substitution is important for at least two reasons. First, with
the important exceptions of Einav et al. (2015) and Cabral (2016), most of the literature
on health care demand and the effect of insurance on spending has neglected intertemporal
substitution, and estimated in a wide range of price elasticities, from as small as -0.2 to
as large as -1.5 (for example, Manning et al. (1987); Eichner (1998); Zweifel and Manning
(2000); Cardon and Hendel (2001); Bajari et al. (2014); Dalton (2014) and Kowalski (2015,
2016))). Most papers assume that health care decisions are made statically on an annual
basis, meaning that there is no scope for future prices to affect current demand. Estimated.
However, if there is intertemporal substitution, then patients may respond very differently
to a temporary price change than to a long-lasting one. Therefore, depending on the sources
of price variation used for identification, one might draw dramatically different conclusions
regarding price sensitivities. Accounting for intertemporal substitution makes it possible to
separate elasticities with respect to permanent or temporary price changes, and may help
reconcile the disparate elasticity estimates in the literature.1
      Second, intertemporal substitution affects the response to high deductible health plans,
which are now common in the American health insurance landscape. Regulators, insurers,
and policymakers tolerate the weak risk protection of high deductible health plans out of
1
    Intertemporal substitution has been studied in other settings. For example, Hendel and Nevo (2006a,b)
    show clear evidence of intertemporal substitution and find that failing to account for it leads to biased price
    sensitivities. The labor supply literature has also noted that different sources of price variation—anticipated
    or unanticipated, and permanent or temporary wage changes—yield different responses (Blundell and
    MaCurdy, 1999). In that context, short- and long-lasting wage changes generate differential elasticities
    because of income effects, not stockpiling of leisure. In the health care context, we expect that income
    effects are less important, but stocking up on deferrable care is more important.

the hope that they will reduce health care spending. This view implicitly assumes that
care foregone in one year because of the high deductible represents a permanent reduction
in health care spending. But if patients are deferring needed care, then their spending
may be higher in future years, either because deferrable problems become so severe that
they must be addressed, regardless of the cost, or because once patients finally do hit the
deductible, they stock up on care, retiming deferrable procedures to a year when their
price is low. Thus a key question for the effectiveness of high deductible health plans is
whether patients intertemporally substitute in their demand for health care. Evidence of
intertemporal substitution would suggest that high-deductible health plans may not be as
effective as hoped in controlling overall health care spending.
   We begin in Section 2 by developing a test of the null hypothesis of no intertemporal
substitution in health care demand. The key to our test is that, in the absence of intertem-
poral substitution, demand depends only on current prices, so people who hit the deductible
and face a temporarily low price should spend at the same level as people who permanently
face the same low price. The “price” of health care is difficult to define when patients face
a nonlinear price schedule, however, because it is not clear whether patients respond to the
expected end-of-year price, as a forward looking patient would (Ellis, 1986), or to the spot
price of the next dollar of care, as a fully myopic patient would (Aron-Dine et al., 2015;
Einav et al., 2015; Brot-Goldberg et al., 2015; Abaluck et al., 2015; Dalton et al., 2015).
We sidestep this issue by looking at spending in the last month of the coverage year, when
essentially all uncertainty has been resolved, making the spot price and expected end-of-year
price nearly the same.
   Implementing our test requires addressing two challenges. First, patients select into in-
surance plans. Patients with high anticipated spending are likely to select more generous
plans, confounding any naive comparison between high deductible plans and more compre-
hensive ones. Second, hitting the deductible is endogenous to spending, making it hard to
draw any casual inference regarding how spending respond to prices. We solve both chal-
lenges by taking advantage of the RAND Health Insurance Experiment (Newhouse and The
Insurance Experiment Group, 1993). As we describe in Section 3, the experiment entailed
random assignment to either a free care plan, or to one of several plans with nonlinear cost-


                                              2
sharing, that entailed a fixed coinsurance rate up to a maximum dollar expenditure (MDE).
This random assignment solves the selection problem.
   To solve the endogeneity problem, instead of examining those who hit the MDE, in
Section 4 we compare spending of all patients in cost-sharing to all patients in free care.
Although overall spending is much higher in free care, we find that by the end of the coverage
year, average spending in cost-sharing is slightly higher than in free care, even though most
people do not hit the MDE. This implies that spending is much higher among those who
actually hit the MDE than it would have been had they faced a permanent price of zero.
Quantity response, as measured by episodes of care, appear similar. The data therefore reject
the null hypothesis of no intertemporal substitution. The evidence supporting intertemporal
substitution is particularly strong for dental care and medically deferrable care, which is
straightforward to retime, and weakest for acute care, which cannot be retimed.
   We provide in Section 5 a simple quantification of how much health care demand responds
to unanticipated and permanent price changes. A one-time, unanticipated price decrease of
0.1 (i.e. a 10 percentage point decrease in the coinsurance rate) increases spending by $17
per month (12% of the mean), and increases the number episodes by 0.036 (7% of the mean).
If instead this price change were permanent, then the monthly spending effect would only
be $7.1, and the episode effect 0.029. Overall, short-run effects are about twice as large
as long-run effects, and the difference is much greater for dental care and for deferable
procedures than for acute care. We decompose the divergence between short and long run
price sensitivities into an anticipation effect (during sales, people stock up on care health
care in anticipation of high future prices) and an offset effect (after a sale, people cut back
as there are fewer unmet needs). For spending, we find that the anticipation effect is most
important: when people hit the deductible, they spend a great deal more, but this is not offset
by particularly low spending in the first months of the next coverage year. But for episodes,
we find both effects are important. We find no evidence, however, that the acceleration of
deferrable care leads to fewer acute problems in the future. These results suggest that most
of the intertemporal substitution therefore reflects retiming of care, rather than stocking up
on general health capital.
   The divergence between the short and long run price sensitivities imply that different


                                              3
sources of price variation yield different price sensitivities. For example, (quasi-)random
assignment to insurance plans generates long lasting price differences, but hitting the de-
ductible generates much shorter price change. To illustrate this, we estimate a series of static
models that ignore intertemporal substitution and differ in their identifying variation (all
of which, we emphasize, is experimentally induced). Pooling both short- and long-lasting
price variation yields a price sensitivity about 8% larger than the long-run sensitivity. Using
only short-run price variation yields price sensitivities that are nearly 100% larger than the
long-run sensitivity, while including only long-run price variation yields an estimate nearly
equal to the long-run price sensitivity. These results reconcile some of the disparate elastic-
ity estimates in the literature. For example, Eichner (1998) and Kowalski (2016) use family
members’ accidents to instrument for other family members’ spending, since if anyone in
the family has an accident, everyone is more likely to hit the deductible. These studies find
elasticities on the order of -0.5 to -1.5, much larger than the elasticity of -0.2 found in the
RAND Health Insurance Experiment (Manning et al., 1987), but closer to the elasticities we
find when we use only within-person, short-run variation.
   Overall, we find an important role for intertemporal substitution in health care demand.
Many studies also find that demand responds to anticipated future policy changes (e.g.
Alpert (2016), Brot-Goldberg et al. (2015), Schmid (2016)). We show in an experimental
context that deductibles, not just coverage maxima, generate intertemporal substitution,
and that anticipatory responses to policy-induced price changes are not an artifact of the
policy change, but a common part of the response to nonlinear cost-sharing. This conclusion
differs from the original RAND investigators’ (Keeler et al., 1982; Keeler and Rolph, 1988),
who argued that sales effects and anticipatory spending were unimportant in the Health
Insurance Experiment. We offer a reconciliation in Section 6.

2     Modelling health care demand

2.1    Health care demand without intertemporal substitution

    We derive testable implications of the hypothesis that health care consumption in one
period does not affect the marginal utility of health care consumption in other periods, i.e.
that there is no intertemporal substitution in health care demand. This hypothesis implies
that health care demand exhibits only pecuniary dynamics: spending in one period may
affect the price of health care (or available income) in other periods, but not its marginal
utility. The main testable implication will be that people who face the same price of health
care this year, but different prices next year, have the same demand.
    While this implication is straightforward to derive, the model addresses two conceptual
difficulties that arise in the context of health insurance and other nonlinear pricing arrange-
ments. First, it is not obvious what the relevant price is, since patients may not understand
the link between current spending and future prices (and so they may overweight the current
price). Second, we want to compare spending of people who hit the maximum out-of-pocket
limit in a nonlinear insurance plan to people who have free care. This comparison is not
clean, though, because high spenders are mechanically more likely to hit the out-of-pocket
limit. The model implies that we can avoid the first problem by looking at demand in the
final period of the coverage year, when there is little uncertainty, and spending has no further
effect on future prices. The model also generates observable conditions under which we can
test for no intertemporal substitution by comparing everyone in cost-sharing (whether they
have hit the out-of-pocket limit or not) to everyone in free care, therefore getting around the
second problem.
    Model set-up Patients demand health care ht each month to maximize utility. Monthly
utility depends on ht , other consumption ct , and a preference shock εt , representing shifts
in the marginal utility of health care, for example an illness which necessitates health care
spending. We write
                                       Ut = u(ht , ct , εt )

The key assumption that this utility function embodies is that past health care consumption


                                                5
has no direct effect on utility; it affects choices only through the possibly nonlinear budget
set. This assumption is commonly and implicitly made in the literature. We further assume
that u is convex, although we do not assume that u0 > 0 for all h (since we observe finite
spending at a price of zero). To keep the model simple, we assume that the utility function
is quasilinear, so Ut = u(ht , εt ) + ct . This lets us ignore all savings decisions, so that the
only source of dynamics is the link between current health spending and future prices. We
explain below that allowing for income effects would strengthen our test.
   We assume that people face a piecewise linear annual budget set, with the slope and kink
points determined by the health insurance contract. Let C(h) give the out-of-pocket cost of
h dollars of health care spending. To preview the empirical application, we will assume in
particular that either health care is free, or that people face a coinsurance rate of coins up
to an out-of-pocket maximum of M DE, so the budget set is piecewise linear with a slope of
coins when h < M DE/coins and a slope of 0 above it. People begin the year with income
Y . Figure 1 illustrates this budget set.
   Demand In the simplest case of forward looking behavior, no uncertainty about ε, and
no income effects, demand is easy to characterize. Patients simply choose ht in each period
so that u0 (ht , εt ) = C 0 ( 12
                             P
                              τ =1 hτ ) ≡ p. Nonlinear prices mean there may be multiple solutions

to this first order condition, but at any interior solution, the marginal utility of health care
spending equals the end-of-year price p, regardless of the overall shape of C(·).
   However, the possibility of uncertainty and myopia complicates the analysis, since in
either case, patients cannot set their monthly marginal utility equal to p. We introduce
uncertainty and myopia with the following annual decision problem:

                                                 12
                                                 X
                                   U = max             β t E[u(ht , ct , εt )|It ]
                                        ht (·)
                                                 t=1
                                                                  !
                                                       X                  X
                            such that Y = C                  ht       +       ct
                                                         t                t


Uncertainty arises because patients only have limited information about future εt , repre-
sented by an evolving information set It . We allow for forward looking behavior when
β > 0, and an extreme form of myopia with β = 0.


                                                   6
      We solve this dynamic optimization problem by backwards induction. For notational
simplicity we assume that ε follows a first-order Markov process, so the state variables are
accumulated health spending Ht ≡ t−1
                                   P
                                     τ =1 ht at the beginning of month t, and the preference

shock εt . Let the function T (h, H) give the required (marginal) out-of-pocket payment for
health care spending h when total spending so far is H, and let T be the last period of the
coverage year.2 The Bellman equations are


                    Vt (Ht , εt ) = max u(h, εt ) − T (h, Ht ) + E[Vt+1 (Ht + h)|εt , Ht , h].
                                    h

                  VT (HT , εT ) = max u(h, εT ) − T (h, HT )
                                    h



We denote by ht (Ht , εt , T (·)) the period- and contract-specific policy function that is the
solution to this Bellman equation.
      This solution depends on β and on the joint distribution of ε across periods. However,
inspection of the period T Bellman equation reveals that in the final period, neither dis-
counting nor uncertainty affects demand. This is because, in the final month of the coverage
year, there are no meaningful dynamics—current spending does not affect future prices—and
all uncertainty is revealed. We therefore focus on demand in the final period of the coverage
year.
      Testable implications The first order condition for final period health care spending
hT for someone in a cost-sharing plan with accumulated health expenditures HT is


                                          u0 (hT , εT ) = T 0 (hT , HT ).


At an interior solution at the end of the coverage year, people choose health spending so that
the marginal out-of-pocket price, T 0 (h, HT ), equals the marginal utility of health. Corner
solutions with hT = 0 are empirically common; these happen when εT is such that u0 (0, εT ) <
T 0 (0, Ht ).3
      Letting p = T 0 (hT , HT ) denote the realized end-of-year price, we can therefore write final
2
    T (h, H) = C(h + H) − C(H).
3
    The first order condition also does not hold if an individual chooses consumption to end up exactly at the
    kink point. However this point is never optimal because the price is decreasing from one line segment to
    the next.


                                                        7
period demand as
                              hT = hT (HT , εT , T (·)) = h(p, εT ).                       (1)

Equation 1 says that two people who have the same end-of-year price will have the same
final-period demand, regardless of whether they face the same contract T (·). In particular, a
person in a nonlinear cost-sharing plan who hits the maximum dollar expenditure will have
the same final period demand as a person who was in free care all along.
   Note that by construction, a person who hits the MDE has less available income than a
person in free care (exactly the MDE less). If income effects are important, then this means
that spending should be higher in free care than for people who hit the MDE, as health is
a normal good. Precautionary savings motives generate a similar prediction. Allowing for
income effects thus strengthens our test, in the sense that they would make it harder to
detect higher spending among people who hit the MDE than among people in free care.
   We test this implication against an alternative hypothesis that future prices also matter
for demand. To do so, we would like to compare patients in free care to patients who have hit
the MDE in a cost-sharing plan. These patients face the same current prices, but different
future prices: patients in free care will continue to face a price of zero, but patients in the
cost-sharing plan will not, since not all patients who hit the MDE in one year will hit it in
the next.
   We cannot directly test this implication, however. To see this, consider expected demand
in free care and in cost-sharing plans among people who hit the MDE:


                                E[hT |free] = E[h(0, εT )| free]

                   E[hT |cost-sharing, hit] = E[h(0, εT )| cost-sharing, hit ]


Whether a patient hits the MDE depends on her past and current spending decisions, which
depend on past and current realizations of εt . As a result, E[h(0, εT )|cost-sharing, hit] 6=
E[h(εT , 0)|free], even with random assignment of plans and no intertemporal substitution.
Conditioning on realized end-of-year prices creates an endogeneity problem.
   We avoid this problem by looking at overall expected demand in cost-sharing plans,
averaged over people who do and do not hit the MDE. It is helpful to segregate people who,

                                                8
based on their entire history of ε, would or would not hit the MDE. To be precise, define
                            (                          T
                                                                                             )
                                                       X
                     ε∗ =       (ε1 , . . . , εT ) :         hτ (Hτ , ετ , T (·)) ≥ M DE/coins .
                                                       t=τ


This is the set of ε leading a person who faces an out-of-pocket cost function T (·) to hit the
MDE. Expected spending in cost-sharing can be decomposed into the probability weighted
average of spending among people who do and do not hit the MDE:


           E[hT |CS] = P r(ε ∈ ε∗ )E[h(0, ε)|ε ∈ ε∗ ] + (1 − P r(ε ∈ ε∗ ))E[h(p, ε)|ε ∈
                                                                                      / ε∗ ].        (2)


These expectations differ because people who hit the MDE face a different price and a
different distribution of εT . We may perform the same decomposition in free care, continuing
to split the ε by whether people would have hit the MDE in the cost-sharing plan:


           E[hT |f ree] = P r(ε ∈ ε∗ )E[h(0, ε)|ε ∈ ε∗ ] + (1 − P r(ε ∈ ε∗ ))E[h(0, ε)|ε ∈
                                                                                         / ε∗ ].     (3)


Comparing Equation 2 and Equation 3 shows that expected spending month T spending
is the same among people who would hit the MDE if they were in the cost-sharing plan,
regardless of which plan they are actually in. Thus the difference in expected spending in
month T between the two plans is


                                 (1 − P r(ε ∈ ε∗ ))E[h(p, ε) − h(0, ε)|ε ∈
                                                                         / ε∗ ].


This difference is negative as long as two conditions hold: some people do not hit the MDE
(so 1 − P r(ε ∈ ε∗ ) > 0) and demand is downward sloping on average for the people who
do not hit the MDE, so that the expectation is strictly positive. A sufficient condition
for downward sloping demand is that some people who do not hit the MDE nonetheless
have positive demand.4 Thus our main empirical test of no intertemporal substitution is a
comparison of demand in free care and and in cost-sharing. In the absence of intertemporal

    For these people, the first order condition holds, and concavity of u implies that demand is downward
    sloping at any interior solution.



                                                                 9
substitution, demand is lower in cost-sharing than in free care.


2.2    Alternative hypotheses

   The model so far assumes that health care spending in one period has no effect on the
marginal utility of health care in future periods. This is a standard assumption, but a strong
one, and here we sketch two alternative ways of modelling health care demand that create a
link between current health care utilization and future demand.
   First is the health capital model, originally developed by Grossman (1972), and econo-
metrically implemented by Gilleskie (1998); Blau and Gilleskie (2008); Khwaja (2010) and
Cronin (2016). Under this model, people derive utility from a stock of health H. They
may augment this stock by health care utilization, such as visiting a doctor, or by health
behaviors, such as better diet or exercise. The stock of health depreciates slowly, so that
health care utilization in one period leads to better health in the future. As long as health
is durable, health care spending can be shifted from one period to another while keeping
health unaffected, and so an anticipated price increase tomorrow may generate a spending
response today, and a large spending decline when the price change materializes.
   An alternative view is that, even in absence of durable health, some procedures are easy
to retime. For example, many tests such as colonoscopies or even annual check-ups can be
shifted forward or backwards by a few months with little loss of effectiveness. Patients who
anticipate a future price increase may therefore try to move forward such procedures to take
care of them when the price is low. As with durable health, if some health care needs are
deferable, then spending will rise before an anticipated price change, and decline after it
materializes, holding fixed the current price. These models imply that we should see the
biggest response to future prices in two kinds of care: easily deferrable care, and care that
produces long lasting benefits. On the other hand, we expect not to find an effect of future
prices on the demand acute care, which typically does not produce long-lasting benefits, and
by definition cannot be easily deferred.

3     Background and data

3.1     Experimental design and randomization

    The RAND Health Insurance Experiment, run from November, 1974 to February, 1982,
was a randomized field experiment to measure whether more generous health insurance
caused higher health care spending.5 The experiment ran at six different sites, chosen to be
broadly representative of the United States, and new families were enrolled over several start
dates. Families were selected at random in the site, but the investigators oversampled low
income families, and excluded very high income families, so the sample is not representative,
nationally or within the sites.6 At a given site and start date, families were randomly assigned
to one of several health insurance plans according to a finite selection model (Morris, 1979),
which explicitly balanced a subset of observable characteristics across plans. The plans all
covered inpatient and outpatient health care, as well as vision, prescription drugs, medical
supplies, and mental health and dental health. Families were also randomly assigned to an
enrollment term: three years for 70% of enrollees, and five years for the remainder. In all
analyses, we pool the three and five year enrollees, to maximize power.
    The plans primarily differed in their coinsurance rates. In the most generous plan, “free
care,” families faced a coinsurance rate of zero on all services. Three other plans had coin-
surance rates of 25%, 50%, and 95%. Figure 1 illustrates the budget set created by these
cost-sharing plans. A fifth plan, the “mixed” plan, had 25% coinsurance for medical services
and 50% for mental and dental. Patients in these plans were only responsible for cost-sharing
up to a maximum dollar expenditure (MDE), which was randomly set to 5, 10, or 15% of
family income, but capped at $750 or $1,000.7 Because the 95% coinsurance plan resembles
5
  Newhouse and The Insurance Experiment Group (1993) provides a detailed overview of the experimental
  design results of the experiment. Aron-Dine et al. (2013) offer a helpful summary for modern audiences.
  As Newhouse et al. relate, the initial motivation for the experiment was the widespread presumption in
  1970 that national health insurance was imminent, and the only question was how much cost-sharing it
  should have.
6
  The sample also excludes people aged 62 and older at enrollment, who would eventually obtain insurance
  through Medicare, as well as some disabled people, institutionalized people, and military families.
7
  This is in nominal dollars. Cost-sharing rules in the HIE were not inflation adjusted over the experiment;
  $1,000 in 1974 works out to about $4,600 in 2011, and $1,000 in 1982 works out to about $2,300. Note that,
  because the MDE was tied to family income, it varied from year to year, and families with zero income
  received de facto free care.



                                                    11
a straight deductible up to a stoploss, it is often called the “family deductible” plan. A final
plan, “individual deductible,” had a 95% coinsurance rate for outpatient care, but inpatient
care was free. In this plan, each individual had an out-of-pocket maximum of $150, but
family out-of-pocket spending was capped at $450.8 In some analyses, to maximize power,
we pool all cost-sharing plans together.
    Because of their nonlinear cost sharing features, the RAND plans anticipated the design
of modern health insurance plans. The family deductible plan, in particular, resembles
modern high-deductible health plans, since it has a coinsurance rate of nearly 100% below
the MDE, and an MDE that can be as much as 15% of family income. By comparison,
76% of plans on the Health Exchanges in 2014 were classified as “high deductible,” meaning
their deductible exceeded $1,250. The median silver plan in 2014 had a deductible of $2,500
and a maximum out-of-pocket expenditure of $6,300 (Coe, 2014), or about 12% of median
household income (DeNavas-Walt and Proctor, 2015).


3.2     Data and summary statistics

    We use the replication files which the original RAND investigators have made publicly
available.9 Our goal is to analyze the effect of free care relative to cost-sharing on health care
demand in the final month of the coverage year, so we aggregate spending and utilization
from the claims files to the person-month level, and inflate spending to 2011 prices using the
monthly CPI-U.10 In addition to the claims data, we use the demographic file for patient
demographic and background information; the eligibility file to record coverage and family
structure (to link patients within an insured family); and the episode of care file, to count
episodes and to find the date when a patient “hits the MDE,” i.e. when her or her family’s
out-of-pocket spending for the coverage year exceeds the maximum dollar expenditure. We

10
    Each claim in fact has multiple dates, including the date of service and date filed. We date outpatient
   claims by the date of service, and we date all inpatient claims by the date of the admission. We believe
   this is consistent with the cost-sharing rules for the experiment, where hospitalizations that span multiple
   coverage years appear to count towards the coverage year in which they began. For most patients, coverage
   began on the first of the month, so calendar months and coverage months align. But for some patients,
   coverage began on the 31st. In these cases, we align calendar and coverage month by shifting all dates
   forward one day.



                                                      12
use this information to define the end-of-year price as the coinsurance rate for patients who
did not hit the MDE that year, and zero otherwise. We define the monthly spot price
analogously: it is equal to the coinsurance rate for patients who have not hit the MDE by
the beginning of the month, and zero otherwise.
     We augment the claims data, which measure spending, with data on episodes of treat-
ment, which measure quantities. Episodes of treatment are groupings of claims reflecting all
spending for a particular treatment. Much of the original HIE analysis focused on episodes
of treatment (e.g. Keeler and Rolph (1988)). Episodes likely reflect patient decisions rather
than physician input, because the decision to seek treatment is likely-patient driven. The
episode data are classified into acute, chronic, and well-care, which consists of relatively
deferrable procedures, such as examinations or vaccinations. Importantly, the providers
themselves make this classification decision, and it reflects the deferrability of treatment,
not any information about spending or timing (Keeler et al., 1982). For each month, we
record the number of episodes of each type that took place during that month.11
     We make four restrictions to create our analysis sample. First, following the original
RAND investigators, we only include whole coverage years.12 Second, we exclude all Dayton
families from year 1; during this period, dental care was only covered in the free care plan,
so we do not see dental spending for the cost-sharing group. Third, we exclude a handful
of families with missing information on whether they have reached the MDE. Fourth, we
drop the 50% coinsurance plan from our analysis, because Aron-Dine et al. (2013) show that
the randomization appears to have failed for this plan. After these exclusions, our analysis
sample consists of 4,591 people in 1,820 families, across 214,320 person-months.
     Table 1 provides summary statistics by plan type. The first column shows the average of
the indicated variable in the free care plan. The remaining columns show the difference in
means in each cost-sharing plan, relative to free care. Because plan assignment was random
11
   We omit drug episodes (representing 1.6% of spending) from our analysis, because we cannot reliably date
   them. Prescriptions which span multiple years are defined as separate episodes for each year. For episodes
   continuing into a new year, the start date is imputed as the first day of the coverage year. Including these
   episodes creates a false impression of a surge in new health care on the very first day of the year.
12
   Specifically, this means we drop the first (partial) year of newborns and adopted children, the only late
   entrants; the final (partial) coverage year for people who attrit; any partial years from suspensions; and
   all post-death years for people who die. Following the original investigators, we include the final partial
   year for people who die, and treat post-death spending and utilization in that year as zero.



                                                      13
only for a given site and start date, we follow Aron-Dine et al. (2013) and report means
adjusted for site by start date fixed effects. Standard errors, clustered on family, are in
parentheses.
      The cost sharing plans, unsurprisingly, are less generous than the free care plans. The
MDE is about $1,500 in the individual deductible plan and $2,400-$3,000 in the other plans.13
Between 18 and 46% of people in the cost-sharing plans hit the MDE in a given year. People
in the less generous plans are more likely to hit the MDE (because a given amount of
spending makes it easier to do so), but end-of-year prices and are increasing with the sticker
coinsurance rate of the plan.
      These differences in plan generosity translate into differences in spending and episodes
of treatment. Total spending (not shown) is about $180 per person per month in free care,
and splits roughly evenly into inpatient, outpatient medical, and outpatient dental. There
is almost no spending on mental health care, so we do not analyze it further. Spending
is lower in the cost-sharing plans across all categories, and overall by $30-$70, or about a
third. The difference is largest in dental care and outpatient medical care, and for the least
generous plan, the family deductible plan. Episodes show a similar pattern: in free care the
average patient has 0.66 total episodes per month, and in cost-sharing patients have about a
third fewer. The table also records the fraction of people assigned to each plan who attrited,
defined as failing to complete the experiment as scheduled. Attrition is most common in the
family plan.


3.3       Balance and validity of randomization

      To interpret these differences as the causal effect of plan assignment, we require that
insurance plan assignment be uncorrelated with patient health care spending propensity.
This assumption can fail either if the randomization itself was unsuccessful, or if differential
attrition leads to selection of healthier people in less generous plans. We test for experi-
mental validity in Appendix A; we find that the plans appear balanced on pre-experimental
characteristics, including both direct measures of utilization and demographic variables.
13
     The MDE and other cost-sharing parameters are not exactly zero in free care because the reported amount
     is net of the estimated (and slightly non-zero) site-by-start date fixed effects.


                                                      14
    Our tests follow Aron-Dine et al. (2013) closely, but Aron-Dine et al. come to different
conclusions about balance after enrollment: they find that the plans appear highly unbal-
anced, on utilization or other variables, among people who complete the experiment. In
Appendix A, we reconcile these findings. The key difference is that Aron-Dine et al. (2013)’s
analysis of nonbalance at experiment completion includes the suspect 50% coinsurance plan.
As Aron-Dine et al. (2013) show, this plan appears unbalanced even at randomization (i.e.
before attrition), and we exclude it from the analysis. When we exclude it, we pass the
balance tests, but when we include it, we fail them. Nonetheless, given the differential at-
trition and refusal rates, we remain cautious about the randomization. Our main concern is
differential attrition, since our interest is in the changing time pattern of treatment effects—
whether they are growing or shrinking over the coverage year, rather than their absolute
level. In robustness tests, we attempt to address differential attrition by controlling for all
predetermined variables, interacted flexibly with time dummy variables. These extra con-
trols have no effect on the results. We also find similar results when we restrict attention to
a balanced sample, where changing composition cannot explain changing treatment effects.



4     Treatment effects over the coverage year

4.1    Estimating equations

    The model in Section 2 shows that we can test for intertemporal substitution by com-
paring health care demand in cost-sharing and in free care plans in the final month of the
coverage year. To do so, we estimate monthly demand in free care and in cost-sharing, ad-
justing for differences in site-by-start date and for general trends. Specifically, we estimate
regressions of the following form:

                         X               τX
                                          =12
       yit =                                     (βτyear F reeiτ,year + γτyear Costiτ,y ) + µt + θsem + εit ,   (4)
               year={first, middle, last} τ =1


for several outcomes y of person i in month t. There are three time indices in the regression: t
indexes calendar time (e.g. January, 1980), τ indexes coverage months (1-12), and year refers


                                                            15
to different coverage years (first, middle years, and final).14 In all specifications, we control
for a full set of demeaned calendar time dummies, as well as demeaned site-by-enrollment-
month dummies. Our interest is in the coefficients βτyear and γτyear , which measure the average
of yit in coverage month τ of a given year, for beneficiaries in free care and in cost-sharing
                                                                                    1
plans, after adjusting for trends and site-by-start date differences. For example, γ12 gives the
average of y in the cost-sharing plans in the last month of the first coverage year. Because
plan assignment is random conditional on site and enrollment month, βτyear − γτyear gives the
effect of being in free care, relative to cost-sharing, in relative month τ and year year. Our
                        year    year
primary interest is in β12   − γ12   , but examining the full set of monthly spending amounts
will be informative.
     In estimating Equation 4, we pool people assigned to three and five year terms. To
maintain power, we pool years 2, 3, and 4 for the five-year enrollees with year 2 of the
three-year enrollees; this treats all “middle” years the same. That is, β1middle is average
spending in free care in people in year 2 of a three year term and years 2-4 of a five year
term. Likewise we treat year 5 of the five-year enrollees the same as year 3 of the three-year
enrollees. Pooling this way lets us highlight beginning-of-experiment and end-of-experiment
effects. We have found similar patterns, albeit noisier, when we examine the three and five
year enrollees separately.


4.2     Results

     Prices Our test is valid only if end-of-year prices are in fact different between the cost-
sharing and free care plans. We begin by verifying this.15 Figure 2 shows the fraction of
people who have hit the MDE by the start of each coverage month, as well as the corre-
sponding average spot price. The figure simply plots the estimated values of β and γ from
Equation 4. In the free care plan, prices are always zero. In the cost sharing plan, spot
prices decline as more and more people hit the MDE. People in cost-sharing plans hit the
MDE steadily throughout the coverage year, and as a result prices fall steadily. However, by
14
   Calendar months and coverage months are not collinear because the experiment had staggered start dates,
   with every calendar month a possible start month.
15
   We also require that some people who do not hit the MDE nonetheless have positive demand in the last
   month of the coverage year. Average spending in this group is $51 (standard error: $3.8).


                                                   16
the start of the last month of the coverage year, only about a third of people have hit the
MDE, so even in the last month of the year, the average spot price is about 0.45. Thus in the
absence of intertemporal substitution, we should expect spending and episodes to diverge
between the two groups in the final months of the coverage year.16
     Spending Figure 3 shows the results for spending. We show total spending in Panel
A. Because this is noisy, we remove inpatient spending and plot total outpatient spending
in Panel B, and then we decompose outpatient spending into medical and dental spending
in Panels C and Panel D. Several striking patterns emerge from the figure. Total spending
does not show much of a pattern in free care, except for a dramatic surge at the end of the
experiment, when it shoots up from its average of around $175 per month, to over $300. The
time series of spending looks quite different in the cost-sharing plans. There, spending is
flat in the first half of the coverage year, at around $125 per person, and then rises sharply
in the second half of the year. By the end of the coverage year, spending in the two groups
has converged, and in the final month of the middle year, spending is actually higher in the
cost-sharing plan than in free care, in sharp contrast to the predictions of the model without
intertemporal substitution.17
     Total outpatient spending shows a similar pattern, but much more clearly because there
is less month-to-month volatility; spending surges in cost-sharing at the end of the coverage
year, and eventually rises above spending in free care. Decomposing outpatient spending
into medical and dental care shows an interesting pattern in free care: in the first quarter of
the experiment, patients spend about $70 per month on outpatient medical care, but over
the next few months spending falls, and remains roughly constant until the last month in
the experiment. Dental spending in free care is also high at the beginning of the experiment,
throughout the first year and especially after the first few months. In the cost-sharing plans,
outpatient medical care and dental care both show a pattern of rising spending at the end
of the coverage year, although it is more pronounced for dental care than for medical.
16
   The figure does not show the actual end-of-year price, only the beginning-of-month price in the last
   coverage month. However, on average 35% of people in the cost sharing plans hit the MDE, and the
   average end-of-year price is 0.43.
17
   To keep the figures readable, we have omitted confidence intervals. However Appendix Figure A.1 and
   Appendix Figure A.2 plot the monthly treatment effects, βτY ear − γτY ear , along with the 95% confidence
   interval for the difference, so that readers may more easily gauge the magnitude and statistical significance
   of the effect size over the coverage year.


                                                      17
      Episodes of treatment We extend our spending analysis to episodes of treatment in
Figure 4. We focus on non-dental well-care, dental care, and acute episodes because these
are straightforward to date.18 Panel A shows the number of well-care episodes by plan and
month. Well-care episodes in free care exhibit a clear U-shaped pattern over the experiment:
high at the beginning and end, but flat in the middle. In the cost-sharing plans, they rise
over the coverage year, and by the end of the first and middle coverage years, the difference
between cost-sharing and free care is small and statistically insignificant. Dental care shows a
nearly identical pattern, in both free care and in the cost-sharing plans. The high utilization
at the end of the coverage year suggests that intertemporal substitution is an important part
of demand for these categories of care, which are medically straightforward to retime.
      By contrast, acute episodes show a very different pattern, visible in Panel C. The number
of acute episodes rises steadily throughout the coverage year, especially in cost-sharing, but
without any obvious jump in the last few periods. Instead there is a steady rise in the
number of acute episodes in the cost-sharing plans in the second half of the coverage year.
But there are always substantially (and significantly) more acute episodes in the free care
plan than in the cost-sharing plans. Non-defferrable care shows no evidence for intertemporal
substitution. This is an important specification test: it shows that our results are not driven
by trends in utilization over the coverage year (that are specific to the cost-sharing plan),
nor by providers shifting when they date and file claims.
      Summary We summarize three important facts from these figures. First, people hit the
MDE smoothly throughout the year, but only about a third ever hit it, so end-of-year prices
are much higher in the cost sharing plans than in free care. Second, spending and utilization
are typically lower in cost-sharing plans than in the free care plan. Third, spending and
utilization exhibit different patterns within a coverage year. In free care, they are roughly
flat over the coverage year, but in cost-sharing plans, they rise in the last 1-3 months. By
the end of the year spending in the two plans is roughly equal. This pattern is especially
prominent for deferrable episodes, and for outpatient spending. Overall the results provide
18
     The remaining categories are non-acute chronic episodes, which are persistent and do not have a clear
     beginning or end, and hospital episodes. These are difficult to date because they often include maternity
     care, and the RAND investigators dated most maternal care at the beginning of the coverage year, when
     it might be anticipated.



                                                      18
strong evidence against the null hypothesis of no intertemporal substitution. Instead we
see that demand rises ahead of future price increases—at the end of the coverage year in
cost-sharing, and at the end of the experiment, in free care. This rise is most pronounced
for deferrable care, and least for acute care.



5        Estimating long- and short-run price sensitivities

5.1        Estimating short and long run price sensitivities

      The results so far show that intertemporal substitution is an important part of patients’
response to nonlinear cost sharing rules. If so, a long-lasting price change might have a
different effect than a short lasting one. To quantify these short and long-run price effects,
we estimate models of the form


                      yit = α + β0 priceit + β−1 priceit−1 + β1 priceit+1 + Xit θ + εit .                      (5)


The outcome of person i in month t, yit depends not only on the price in month t, but also on
the lagged price priceit−1 and the expected lead price priceit+1 . Additional controls always
include fixed effects for site-by-start-date, and for date.19
      This specification separates short and long-run price effects in a simple way. β0 measures
the immediate effect of a one-time, unanticipated price change; β−1 measures any offsets in
the next period from high or low spending in a given period; and β1 measures how much
demand rises or falls in anticipation of an expected future price change. A long-run price
change affects current, past, and future prices, so the per-period effect of a long-run price
change is β0 + β−1 + β1 . To estimate Equation 5 and recover the short and long-run price
sensitivities requires that we address several challenges.
      Measuring prices We measure priceit , priceit−1 and priceit+1 with the category-specific
current, lagged, and lead spot prices. Relating demand to spot prices is consistent with the
19
     It is possible to microfound this specification using a health capital model. If the demand for health care
     derives from the desire to build up a stock of health capital, then the level of health capital likely depends
     on past and future prices. In principle the entire history of prices matters, not just a single lag. However
     we show the results are robust to using a larger number of leads and lags.



                                                         19
evidence in Section 4; the rising spending over the coverage year suggests that spot prices
are relevant for patients.20 A further issue is that different categories of care—outpatient
medical, dental, and inpatient—have different coinsurance rates, depending on the assigned
plan. We address this issue by estimating category-specific regressions where the price in
each regression is the relevant one for that category.21 By aggregating category-specific
coefficients across all categories of care, we can obtain an estimate of the price sensitivity
of overall demand. That is, letting βτy represent the effect of pricei,t+τ (for τ = −1, 0, 1) on
y, we obtain the total spending response as βτtotal = βτOutM edical + βτOutDental + βτInpatient . We
obtain the total episode response analogously.
     Price endogeneity Measuring prices using realized spot prices raises a new challenge:
such prices are mechanical functions of lagged spending, given the insurance plan. If there
is any autocorrelation in εit , then prices will be correlated with the error term and OLS es-
timates will be biased. We solve this problem by instrumenting for price, using interactions
of plan assignment with coverage date and coverage year. We have 144 binary instruments,
created from the complete interaction among months (1-12) coverage year (first, middle,
last), and plan (25% coinsurance, mixed, family deductible, or individual deductible). These
instruments identify price sensitivities by relating plan- and month-specific treatment effects
over the entire course of the experiment to month-specific differences in prices. These instru-
ments are valid as long as the only reason that demand differs across the treatment arms in
a given coverage month and year is that priceit−1 , priceit and priceit+1 differ.
     Imputing prices in the first and last period A final challenge is that for all patients,
priceit−1 is missing in month 1, and priceit+1 is missing in the final coverage month. We
do not want to exclude these months, however, because they provide valuable information
about intertemporal substitution. Instead, we impute prices outside the experiment period
as a constant p̄, and we include dummy variables indicating imputed values of priceit−1 and
priceit+1 .22
20
   We remain agnostic whether this is because of partial myopia or uncertainty about the probability of
   hitting the MDE, however.
21
   We assume that there are no cross-category price effects. We have attempted to estimate such effects but
   lack the power to do so precisely.
22
   Note that the estimates are numerically invariant to the choice of p̄ because the instruments induce no
   variation in it. Our estimates are robust, however, to simply dropping the first and last month.



                                                    20
      If the random assignment is valid, this imputation is innocuous for the pre-period prices,
since randomization implies that on average all pre-determined variables are equal across
treatment arms.23 Randomization alone does not justify the post-period imputation, how-
ever. Instead we must assume that plan assignment did not cause people to change their
insurance plan generosity immediately after the experiment ended. We make this stronger
assumption so that we can use the spike in spending in the very last month of the experiment
to help identify βt+1 . Despite these imputations, priceit−1 and priceit+1 are still missing for
a handful of observations: the first month that newborns enter the insurance experiment,
the first month after temporarily suspended participants return, and the last month before
a temporary suspension. We drop these observations in estimation.


5.2        Identification and first stage

      Identification requires that the instruments induce linearly independent variation among
spot prices, future prices, and lagged prices. As we report below, our first stage F-statistics
are on the order of 500-1000 in all specifications, suggesting that our instruments are strong
indeed. The linearly independent variation in prices comes from turning over of the coverage
year, as can be seen in Figure 2. Over the coverage year, current prices and future prices
move together until month 12, when they diverge sharply. Thus we identify the differential
response to priceit and priceit+1 from the spike in spending at the end of the year.
      Likewise, priceit−1 and priceit move together except in the first month of the coverage
year and in the month of hitting the MDE. β−1 is therefore identified by three distinct
sources of variation: high spending in month 1 year 1 as people enter free care; any increase
in spending in the cost sharing plans from month 1 to month 2, as lagged price changes from
lower to higher; and any particularly large surge in spending in the month when people are
particularly likely to hit the MDE.
      It might be surprising that we can use the first and last month of the experiment to help
identify lead and lag price sensitivities even though we do not observe lead and lag prices in
23
     One concern is that if people had nonlinear cost-sharing plans before the experiment, and people assigned
     to free care cut back on care before enrolling, then in fact month 1 lagged prices differs by treatment
     status.



                                                      21
these periods. To understand how they contribute to identification, consider treatment effect
in year 1 month 1 relative to year 2 month 1. In year 1, randomization induces variation in
priceit and priceit+1 but not in priceit−1 . In year 2, however, priceit−1 differs as well. Thus
the difference in treatment effects between year 1 month 1 and year 2 month 1 helps identify
β−1 . Similar logic shows how the differential treatment effect at the end of the final year
helps identify β1 .


5.3     Short and long run price sensitivities

   Spending response Columns (1)-(3) of Table 2 show the estimates of Equation 5.
A one-time, unanticipated price increase of 0.1—an increase in the coinsurance rate of 10
percentage points—reduces current spending on outpatient medical care by $5, outpatient
dental by $12, and inpatient care by -$0.2, for an overall effect of $17 (standard error: $5).
Much of this spending represents low spending in anticipation of a future price decrease.
The coefficient on the lead of price indicates that half of the increase in outpatient medical,
and three quarters of the increase in outpatient dental, is anticipatory. Indeed the long-run
spending consequences of a price increase are less than half the short-run consequences for
medical care, and about a fifth for dental care.
   The overall-long response is $7, smaller than the short-run effect by $9.8 (standard error:
$5.7), or about 60% of the short-run effect. For outpatient medical spending, the long-run
response is about half the short-run response, and for dental spending, the long-run response
is only a sixth the short-run response. The inpatient estimates are too imprecise to compare
the short and long run spending responses. For spending, long and short-run price responses
diverge mainly because demand rises in anticipation of future price increases, not because
of any effect of lagged prices on current demand. Lagged prices do not have a significant
positive effect on current spending, and for dental care their effect seems to be negative.
This suggests that the high anticipatory spending is not later offset by lower spending after
the price change is realized.
   Episode response Columns (4)-(8) show the price sensitivity of episodes of care, broken
down by well-care (non-dental), dental care, acute, chronic, and inpatient. Overall, a one-
time price increase reduces monthly episodes by 0.36 (standard error: 0.03), with most of the

                                              22
response coming from well-care, dental care, and acute care. A permanent price increase has
a smaller effect, reducing episodes by 0.29 (standard error: 0.02). Well-care and dental care
drive the divergence between the short- and long-lasting price effects. For these categories,
the long-run effect is only 30-40% of the short-run effect. For acute, chronic, and inpatient
episodes, the long-run and short-run responses are closer.
      There is considerable anticipatory demand for well-care and for dental care, with lead
price sensitivity of 0.042 and 0.085, showing that episodes rise in the period before an an-
ticipated price increase. Interestingly, we also see that well-care episodes rises after a high
price period, holding fixed the current and future price: the coefficient on lag price is 0.023,
or about half the lead price coefficient, meaning that about half of the anticipatory demand
is later offset by lower demand when the price change materializes, pointing to retiming
of office visits, check ups, and screenings. Temporary price changes encourage people to
reschedule deferrable care to minimize out of pocket costs. We do not see, however, that this
extra utilization ahead of a price increase has any effect on acute episodes, which respond in
a negative, small and insignificant way to past prices. Although people get more deferrable
care when they hit the MDE, and they do seek treatment for more acute and chronic episodes,
this extra care does not translate into fewer future acute or chronic episodes, at least over
the time horizon that we are able to consider.24
      Summary For both spending and episodes of care, we have seen that the overall response
to a short-lasting price change is lower than the the response to a long-lasting price change.
Overall, in both cases, the short-run response is about twice as large as the long-run response.
This divergence is largest for dental spending and for well-care episodes, and nearly zero for
inpatient spending and acute medical care. It appears that hitting the MDE lets households
retime their deferable care to reduce their out-of-pocket spending. This extra care does not
translate into fewer acute episodes or less spending in future periods, however.
24
     We show 1-month effects here, but we have found similar results with up to six months of leads and lags.
     We lack the power to include many more leads and lags than this.




                                                      23
5.4        Robustness tests

      We show in Table 3 the robustness of our results to alternative specification choices. The
main threat to identification is the possibility of differential attrition among the different
plans. Although the balance tests indicated that differential attrition is not a problem on
average over the entire experiment, it is possible that changing sample composition leads
to changing spending, and so the time-varying effects of cost-sharing might be explained by
differential attrition. We address this concern in two ways. First, in Panel A, we augment
our main specification with a full set of interactions between coverage year dummy vari-
ables and the available pre-determined variables.25 These controls adjust for any changes in
spending resulting from differential attrition that is correlated with observed predetermined
characteristics. The point estimates are largely unchanged; the overall spending response is
slightly smaller, mainly driven by a lower inpatient spending response. The short-run effect
remains much larger than the long-run effect.
      As a second check that changing sample composition does not explain the results, we
show in panel B the results of estimating Equation 5 when we limit the sample to people
who participate in the experiment for their assigned enrollment term. This reduces the
sample size by about 15,000 person-months, as we drop all people who attrit, who were ever
suspended, and the newborns who entered after enrollment. These restrictions reduce the
estimated long-run price sensitivities; for overall spending it falls to -58.3. Again this decline
is mainly due to a fall in inpatient spending sensitivity.
      We conclude from these robustness checks that changing sample composition is unlikely
to account for the results. An alternative concern with our results is that we rely on arbitrary
lead and lag specifications to identify long and short-run price responses. As a robustness
check, we show in Panel C that none of the results are sensitive to the exact specification of
how lag and lead prices enter demand. We do this by including three lags and leads of price
instead of one; the results are similar when we include other numbers instead. The results are
highly similar, as are results from another specification (not shown) where we included six
25
     These variables are listed in Appendix Table A.1. The predetermined variables are often missing, and in
     such cases we set their value to -1, and include a dummy variable indicating missing, also interacted with
     coverage year dummies.



                                                       24
leads and lags. Finally, in Panel D, we verify that our treatment of the first and last month
of the experiment—when we must impute priceit−1 or priceit+1 does not substantially affect
the results. When we drop these months, our point estimates remain largely unchanged.


5.5    Consequences of ignoring intertemporal substitution

   We have shown that short and long-lasting price changes can generate substantially
different spending responses. To gauge the economic importance of this difference, we assess
how failing to account for intertemporal substitution could bias estimates of long-run price
sensitivity. This parameter is of interest because it governs the long-run effect of changes in
coinsurance rates.
   Table 4 shows estimated price sensitivities obtained from models that neglect intertem-
poral substitution. In the first column, we present our baseline estimates of 70.7. In the
next column, we re-estimate Equation 5, but omit pt−1 and pt+1 . These specifications are
otherwise identical to our main estimates; they have use the sample controls, controls, and
instruments. The price sensitivity is larger than our baseline by about 8%. This difference
arises because we now mix long-lasting price variation (coming from across plans) and short-
lasting variation (coming from predictable within-person changes in the spot price over the
coverage year). We show in columns (3) and (4) the consequences of just using short-lasting
or long-lasting price variation. In column (3) we add fixed effects to the analysis, and the
price sensitivity doubles to -142. With the fixed effects, all the price variation is within-
person, and so it is short-lasting; the estimate is close to the short-run estimates in Table 2.
On the other hand, when we use only the long-lasting variation induced by plan assignment
(obtained by using as instruments plan dummies rather than plan-month dummies), we get
a price sensitivity that is much closer to the baseline. The bias from neglecting intertemporal
substitution is most severe when most of the price variation is short-lasting. Finally we show
in column (5) that when we aggregate the data to the annual level and use the end-of-year
price as the independent variable (and plan assignment as the instrument), price sensitivity
is about 40% higher. This specification recovers Marshallian demand exactly if people have
perfect foresight about future health care needs over the coverage year and if there is no
intertemporal substitution. It closely resembles those used in the literature on estimating

                                              25
price sensitivity of demand for health care, where it is common to model annual spending
as a function of the end of year price (e.g. Cardon and Hendel (2001)). Thus, estimates of
price sensitivity that neglect intertemporal substitution are sensitive to the type of variation
used for identification. Long-lasting price variation yields a price sensitivity that is closer to
the long-run sensitivity; high-frequency variation yields an estimate closer to the short-run
sensitivity.



6     Reconciliation with original HIE findings
    We have argued that intertemporal substitution is an important part of how patients
respond to nonlinear cost-sharing, causing them to stock up on health care when it goes on
“sale,” with especially large anticipatory responses. Neglecting these dynamics can lead to
biased estimates of the long-run effect of cost-sharing on utilization. The original RAND
investigators, however, argued that intertemporal substitution was not an important part
of the response to cost-sharing, and found little evidence for anticipatory effects. Here we
reconcile these different conclusions.
    The original investigators considered the possibility of an over-response to sales, and an
early technical report, Keeler et al. (1982), used the first three years of data from the pilot
site in Dayton. They looked for intertemporal substitution by “looking at the experience
on the free plan at the start and end of the experiment, and by studying what happens to
families in the months just following the time they satisfy their deductible,” with a focus on
dental care and deferrable outpatient medical care (p. 48).
    Their analysis of free care found a surge in spending in the first few months of the
experiment and at the end. They conclude that these “transient effects ... were very minor,
representing no more than a doubling for the first quarter.” This is roughly consistent with
our findings, as well, although whether this is “very minor” is less clear. To study transient
demand in the nonlinear cost-sharing plan, Keeler et al. look at spending after people hit
the MDE. They break up the the year into three periods—before hitting MDE, the three
months after hitting, and the remainder—and call the period just after hitting the the MDE
the “sale” period. They find that, for most types of care, spending in the “sale” period is


                                               26
similar to spending in the post-sale period, and conclude that hitting the MDE does not
generate a transient demand response. In a later analysis, Keeler and Rolph (1988) looked
for anticipatory effects by looking at whether episodes became more common just before
people hit the MDE. They found no such effect, and concluded that anticipatory effects were
absente, likely because people could not easily predict when they would hit the MDE.
    The key difference between our analysis and the original investigators is in the timing
of when we look for intertemporal substitution and anticipatory responses. They focus on
the period around hitting the MDE, before and after. We focus on the end of the coverage
year. As Keeler and Rolph acknowledge, it is likely difficult to detect anticipatory effects
or pent up demand by focusing on fine timing around hitting the MDE. Households may
not know exactly when they hit the MDE (as has been pointed out by the original RAND
investigators), and may not appreciate the link between their current and future spending
(Einav et al., 2015; Dalton et al., 2015; Abaluck et al., 2015). On the other hand, by
the end of the coverage year, most families who hit the MDE will have seen a bill which
makes clear their financial position, and it is not hard to understand that in the future,
prices will be higher. Indeed, providers may help make this clear. Thus the myopia or
limited understanding of the insurance contracts may have made it difficult for the original
investigators to identify intertemporal substitution; by looking at the end of the year, we
avoid this difficulty.



7     Conclusion
    Studying data from the RAND Health Insurance Experiment, we found striking patterns
of health care spending over the insurance coverage year. In most months, spending is lower
in cost-sharing plans than in the free care plan. But in the last 1-3 months of the coverage
year, spending rises quickly in cost-sharing relative to free care, and by the end of the year
spending in the two plans is roughly equal. On the other hand, spending in free care is
roughly flat over the coverage year, but it is particularly high early in the first coverage year,
and it spikes dramatically at the end of the experiment.
    These patterns are inconsistent with the standard model of demand for health care,


                                               27
which assumes away intertemporal substitution. Instead they suggest that patients can
retime their care, especially for medically deferrable procedures and dental care, to reduce
their out-of-pocket expenses in the face of nonlinear cost-sharing rules. To quantify the
importance of intertemporal substitution, we estimate how health care spending responds
to lag and lead prices as well as current prices. The estimates suggest that short-run moral
hazard—the response to a one time, unanticipated price change—is substantially larger than
the long-run response.
   These results have important implications for health care spending and insurance design.
First, they help reconcile some of the disparate estimates of the price elasticity of health
care demand, since they imply that health care spending is more responsive to temporary
price changes—for example, hitting the deductible—than to permanent price changes, for
example, from insurance plan changes. Second, they suggest that high deductible health
plans may not be as effective as hoped in controlling health care spending. These plans
can reduce health care spending as long as patients do not hit the deductible. But in years
when patients do hit it—as they eventually will—the large short-run response means that
spending will make up for lost time, as patients stock up on care.
   The results also suggest avenues for future research. Although we believe that the results
from the RAND Health Insurance Experiment provide strong evidence for intertemporal
substitution, the data are now more than thirty years old, and it is unclear how closely
they apply to the current health care landscape. If anything, we expect that there are more
opportunities for intertemporal substitution now than there were in the past, for at least the
following two reasons. First, there are now many more elective and preventive procedures
possible than in the past, and many of these are likely straightforward to retime by at least a
few months. Second, consumers nowadays are likely more aware of the prices they face, due
to the increasing availability of information regarding one’s insurance coverage and medical
bills (Lieber, 2016). An important question for future research, then, is whether the behavior
we have documented here shows up in modern health care plans, as well as whether the
excess spending response to hitting the deductible represents high or low value care. Finally,
another important question is how alternative contracts—such as a rolling-window for the
deductible, or multiyear deductibles—affect spending and welfare.

Notes: Table shows the average of the indicated variable in the free care plan, and the difference relative
to free care in the cost sharing plans, both adjusted for site-by-start-date differences (see text for details).
Robust standard errors, clustered on family, in parentheses. Spending amounts are measured in 2011 dollars,
and the unit of observation is a person month, except for attrition, where the unit of observation is a person.
The average MDE is not exactly zero in free care because of the adjustment for site by start month differences.
Sample consists of all person-months in the RAND fee-for-service plans, excluding the 50% coinsurance plan,
excluding partial years cut short because of attrition, suspension, or birth, and excluding Dayton year 1,
where only the free care plan covered dental services.

Notes: Table shows estimates from a regression of monthly spending or number of episodes in the indicated
category on that category’s spot, lag, and lead price. Additional controls include a set of dummies for date
and site-by-start-date, plus dummies for year 1 and final month (when lag and lead price are imputed). We
instrument for prices using a set of dummies for plan assignment interacted with year by coverage month.
We report the Kleibergen and Paap (2006) F-statistic. The sample is defined as in the notes to Table 1 but
additionally excludes observations missing lead or lag price. It consists of 213,730 person-months in 1,820
families. Robust standard errors, clustered on family, are in parentheses.

Notes: Robustness of results in Table 2; see notes there. Short-run effect is the coefficient on spot-price, and
long-run effect is the sum of all leads and lags. In Panel A, we control for a set of fixed effects for interactions
between between coverage month, year, and the predeterminend variables. In Panel B, we limit the sample
to people who are continuously enrolled in the experiment for the assigned number of months. In Panel C,
we control for the first three lags and leads of price. Robust standard errors, clustered on family, are in
parentheses.

Notes: Table shows estimated long-run price sensitivity of total monthly spending, obtained from specifica-
tions that differ in the variation they use, the level of aggregation, or the way they measure price. Column
(1) is the baseline result presented in Table 2. In columns (2)-(6), we ignore intertemporal substitution in
various ways. All specifications also control for a trend (date fixed effects with the monthly data, or year×
start date fixed effects in the annual data), and the monthly specifications include dummies for first and last
month of the experiment. Robust standard errors, clustered on family, are in parentheses.

Experiment (except for the individual deductible plan and mixed plan). Patients pay a coinsurance rate up
to a maximum dollar expenditure, above which they do not pay on the margin for health care. See text for
further details on the plans.

A      Balance tests
    We test the validity of random plan assignment by looking at whether, in our analysis
sample, plans differ in predetermined characteristics. The RAND investigators collected
a host of information from potential study participants prior to randomization. This in-
formation was used to make sure that participants met eligibility criteria, and to assign
participants to plans (in hopes of achieving balance). Following Aron-Dine et al. (2013), we
divide pre-period variables into ones that directly measure health care utilization, and into
all others. We test for balance with regressions of the following form:
                                 X
                            yi =     βp 1 {plan = p} + µSSD + εi ,                      (A.1)
                                   p


Here yit is some pre-determined variable, and we include dummies for each of our plans. We
expect that assignment is random only conditional on site by enrollment month, so we also
include a set of demeaned site-by-enrollment month fixed effects. We omit the constant from
this regression, so βp is the average value of y in plan p, adjusting for differences in site and
enrollment month. If plan assignment is random, we expect that β1 = β2 = ...βP .
    We estimate this regression using the pooled panel data, even though the outcome does
not vary over time. Because our panel is not balanced, this approach gives more weight to
people who remain in the panel longer. To the extent that differential attrition may bias
our results, we would expect to find differences in predetermined characteristics, as attrit-
ers would be differentially underrepresented in some plans. Our test sample also excludes
newborns—the only people who joined the experiment after it began—who are missing all
predetermined variables.
    Appendix Table A.1 shows the results; in Panel A we report the coefficients for the
utilization variables, and in Panel B the coefficients for non-utilization variables. We also
report the p-value of the hypothesis that the plan coefficients are jointly for each outcome,
and at the bottom of each panel, that the coefficients are jointly equal across all outcomes.
The table shows that the utilization variables are well-balanced: although there are some
small differences in the probability of having a doctor and in the number of medical exams,
they do not point to more utilization in the free care plan, and we fail to reject the null
hypothesis that utilization is jointly equal. The results for the non-utilization variables are
similar. The predetermined characteristics are balanced across our treatment groups.
    This conclusion differs from Aron-Dine et al. (2013), who find that although plans appear
mostly balanced at the moment enrollment is offered, differential refusal and attrition leads to
unbalanced plans by the time the experiment concludes. There are several minor differences
between our approach and theirs—they use a cross-section of people, we use a monthly panel,
for example—but we show here that a key difference is the presence of the 50% coinsurance
plan, which we exclude from our analysis and tests (because Aron-Dine et al. note that offers
for that plan appear non-random), but Aron-Dine et al. include in their test for balance at
experiment completion. To show this, in Appendix Table A.2 we repeat our balance analysis,
but we include the 50% coinsurance plan, yielding the same set of plans as in Aron-Dine et
al. (2013). In contrast to our earlier results, we now find statistically significant differences
across the plans in the utilization and in the non-utilization variables.

Notes: Table shows tests for balance across different plans by reporting average values of predetermined
variables across the different plans. The first five columns show the estimated coefficients from a regression
of the indicated variable on dummies for plan assignment, as well as demeaned site-by-start-date fixed effects
(but no constant). The sample excludes the 50% coinsurance plan. The final column reports the p-value of
the hypothesis that coefficients are jointly equal across plans.

Notes: Table reconciles our balance tests in Table A.1 with the balance tests reported in Aron-Dine et
al. (2013), by showing that when we follow Aron-Dine et al.’s classification of plans and include the 50%
coinsurance plan, we fail the balance tests (as they do). The first six columns show the estimated coefficients
from a regression of the indicated variable on dummies for plan assignment, as well as demeaned site-by-
start-date fixed effects (but no constant). The final column reports the p-values of the hypothesis that
coefficients on the plan dummies are all equal
