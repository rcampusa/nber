     This paper uses panel data that cover the 1972—1979 period obtained from

the National Longitudinal Survey of the High School Class of 1972 to study how

male college students' employment while in college influences their academic

performance, persistence in school, decisions to enroll in graduate school,

and post—college labor market success. The analytic framework employed treats

in—school employment as endogenous and determines persistence by a comparison

of expected utilities.

 I. Introduction

     Recent and proposed cutbacks of federal financial aid programs for students

 attending institutions of higher education have serious implications for these

 institutions, individual students, and society as a whole. The institutions

must rethink how they will allocate their relatively scarce institutional

scholarship resources in the face of increasing student need.' Financial aid

packages have, and will, increasingly become more heavily weighted toward loans

and in—school employment. These changes will affect students' decisions to

enroll in higher educational institutions, their choices of colleges, the loan

burdens to finance education they assume, and their part—time employment levels

while enrolled in college.

     Society as a whole should be concerned about how these latter decisions

affect a number of educational and labor market outcomes. Will increased

employment while enrolled in college affect students' college academic perform-

ance either positively or negatively? How does such employment and academic

performance influence subsequent labor market success? How will the Increased

loan burdens associated with college attendance affect decisions to pursue post-

graduate education and/or the occupational choices of college graduates?

     This paper addresses some of these issues, using panel data that cover the

1972—1979 period obtained from the National Longitudinal Survey of the High

School Class of 1972 (NLS72).2 It provides evidence on the effects of employment

while in college on students' academic performance, persistence in school,

decisions to enroll in graduate school, and post—college labor market success A

large literature, primarily by noneconomists, has previously addressed the issue

of how work experience while in college affects academic performance and

persistence.3 This literature is not completely satisfactory in that it fails to

control for the possibilities that such employment is determined simultaneously

with choice of college and that persistence in college is at least partially
                                        —2—


determined by a comparison of the earnings streams an individual could expect to

realize if he continued on in, or dropped Out of, college.4 Our research

considers both of these problems.

     The plan of the paper is as follows. Section II provides our analytic

framework. Section III describes the data used in the analyses, while the

following three sections summarize our empirical results. Finally, Section VII

presents some concluding remarks and indicates directions for future research.

II. Analytic Framework

     Based upon a simple static family utility—maximization model, that is

sketched in the appendix, of the choice of college quality, student employment

while in college, expected academic performance, and expected post—college

earnings, one can obtain that

            w twi
     (la) t =   CX )


     (ib) Q = Q(X1)

     (Ic) A =   A(Z,Q,t)            A1 > 0, A < 0, A3 < 0

     (id) WP =   wP(z,A,Q,t)        WP1 > O 2 > 0, WP3> 0, WP4 > 0


     Here t is the time an individual is employed while in college, Q is

the quality of the college he attends, A is his expected academic achievement

while in college, WP Is his expected post—college wage, Z is a measure of the

student's ability and K1 is a vector of family and student background vari-

ables (e.g., student ability, family income, family size) that influence both

the choice of college quality and the time the student is employed while in

college. Equation (ic) can be thought of as an academic achievement production

function; presumably the less time spent working the more time the student will

have to study and the better he will do in college. Similarly, equation (id)
                                      —3—


can be thought of as an expected post—college earnings equation. To the extent

that employment while enrolled in college helps develop work habits or merely

signals other attributes (such as high motivation) that make potential

employees more attractive to employers, expected post—college wages will be

positively related to hours worked while enrolled in college.

     The focus of our attention is equations (ic) and (id). However, estimation

of (Ia) and (ib) provides instruments for hours of work and college quality that

are used by us below to test whether treating these variables as endogenous

alters estimates of the effects of work while in college on grade point averages

and post—college earnings.

     Unfortunately, although a recursive model, the system specified in (1)

ignores the sequential nature of the decisions being made. Specifically, each

year students make decisions on how many hours to work if they continue in

school and whether to continue in school (persist) or to drop out, all condi-

tional upon their prior academic performance, changing economic and family

considerations, and their expectations about the future. Hence, the above

research strategy must be modified. The approach we follow is described below.

     First, we estimate equations (la)—(lc) to ascertain the effect of freshman

year hours of work on freshman year grade point averages. Given an individual's

grade point average in his freshman year, we then ask what the probability is

that the individual continues on (persists) in college the next year? Presum-

ably an individual makes such a decision based on a comparison of his utility if

he remains in college, V5, with his utility, VD, if he drops out. We take

the former to be a function of the student's academic achievement to date (A),

his expected future earnings if he remains in college (Wp5), his employment

hours while in college (a measure of the consumption value the student gets from

education), a vector of variables that reflect his family's economic circum—
                                                     —4—


stance (X2) and random factors (c5). Similarly, his utility from dropping out

is assumed to depend upon academic achievement, the variables that reflect

economic circumstances, his expected future earnings if he drops Out (WPD), and

random factors (Ed).

       For ease of exposition, suppose VS and VD may be written

       (2a) V =             + usA +               + 135t +
                                                               '4S2   + E5       '1S'12S' u3S < 0

       (2b) VD = 0D +            Y1DA
                                        + I2DWPD +
                                                     14DX2 + ED
                                                                                 12D > 0.




Then we may specify that the individual's net utility from persisting in school

is given by the unobservable variable L,

                        —        =
       (3a) L =
                    V       VD       (YOS    0D + (-i5—ui)A + 3s)t
                + (145_14D)X2 + Y2SWPS —                      ÷ (ES_ED).
                                                     Y2DWPD


       Without loss of generality, suppose that

       (3b)   d =   1   if L> 0             (individual persisted in school)
               = 0      otherwise             (individual did not persist in school).



That is (3a) and (3b) together represent a structural persistence model——a

probit model if the error terms in (3) are assumed to be normally distributed.

       To estimate (3) one requires data on Wp5 and WPD. While we have proxies

for the former for individuals who persisted in college each year and proxies

for the latter for those who did not continue in college each year, we do not

have measures of both for any given individual. It is natural to try to obtain

estimates of these variables, based on the proxies, by estimating


       (4a) log W5 = ctX3               +u

for   the sample of individuals who persist and
                                            —5—



         (4b) log WPD = cDX3d+ Ud



 for the sample of individuals who do not persist, where X3          represents the

 vector of variables expected to influence future earnings (from (id)) in both

 "sectors" and u and ud are random error terms. Given the estimated
 vectors of coefficient,        and           we can then obtain estimates for any
                                       &,
 individual I of the expected values of both earnings streams from


        (5) log WPdi =   ;13    and log           =
                                                      aX31


        As is well known, estimation of (4a) by OLS on the sample of persisters and

of (4b) by OLS on the sample of nonpersisters may lead to biased estimates of

the 's; we may confound the effect of a variable on expected future earnings

for each group with its effect on the group In which the individual is located.

However, If the error terms in (3) and (4) are assumed to be jointly normally

distributed, then the two—stage procedure first suggested by James Heckman

(1979) and Lung Fei—Lee (1978) can be used to obtain consistent estimates of the

a' S.


        Briefly   this involves our substituting (4) into (3) and then estimating a

reduced form probit persistence model that includes A, t, X2 and X3 as

explanatory variables. These estimates can be used to obtain estimates of the

inverse Mills ratio which in turn can be added to (4) as an additional explana-

tory variable. Estimation of these augmented equations by OLS then yields

consistent estimates of the a for each sample. These in turn can be used with

(5) to obtain consistent estimates of log Wpd and log Wp5 for each indi-

vidual, which in turn permits estimation of the structural persistence equation

(3).
                                     —6—


     Once this process is completed, we move to the estimation of hours of work

and grade point average equations for those enrolled In the second year of the

sample, contingent on their behavior in the first year. This in turn leads to

subsequent estimation of second year persistence equations and the process is

repeated. For students initially enrolled in 2—year colleges, we terminate the

estimation after two academic years, while for those initially enrolled in

4—year colleges, we terminate the estimation after four academic years. In both

samples, we also estimate how hours of work have influenced graduation proba-

bilities for those who persisted in college up to our termination dates and, for

the 4—year sample, the probability of enrollment in post—graduate education.5

III. Data

     Our analyses use data from the NLS72, a national sample of about 23,000

high school seniors conducted in 1971—72, with follow—up surveys in the falls of

1973, 1974, 1976 and 1979. We restricted our analyses to male students who had

graduated high school by October of 1972, who were present in the first follow—

up survey and enrolled full—time In either a 2—or 4—year academic program in

October of 1972, and who reported both their grade point average for the 1972—73

academic year and their hours of work in October of 1972.6 This left us with an

initial sample of some 2,700 individuals, about 2,000 of whom were enrolled in

4—year colleges.

     Table 1 provides descriptive statistics on the October 1972 freshman year

hours of work for these students, as well as similar data for those of them

still enrolled in 2—year colleges in October of 1973 and enrolled in 4—year

colleges in October of 1973, 1974 and 1975. While less than one—third of the

4—year students were employed In October of 1972, over half of the 2—year

students were employed, with mean weekly hours of work among those working being
                                        —7—


 21.3 and 25.8, respectively. In succeeding years both the fraction of continu-

 ing students who were employed and the mean weekly hours of those who worked

 increased.

      Most of the variables used in our analyses come directly from the NLS72

 data file. The quality of the 4—year college a student attends is measured by

 the sum of the average math and verbal SAT scores of entering freshmen at the

student's college in 1972 and these data were obtained from Cass and Birnbauin

(1972). In cases where SAT scores were not available for freshmen at a college,

the mean SAT score for colleges with a similar Cass and Birnbaum selectivity

index was used.7

     Two key variables in the analyses each year are the expected future

earnings streams if an individual persists in school and if he drops out. Since

the data set we have only runs through 1979 and provides at most three years

information on earnings for individuals who ultimately graduated from 4—year

colleges, estimates of these streams must be based on truncated flows. This

obviously induces measurement error into their calculations. These earnings

streams are proxied by an individual's average annual earnings during calendar

years 1977, 1978 and 1979, and by his average weekly earnings during October of

those years.

     When estimating equation (4), we include only Individuals who report

positive   earnings levels in all three years in the sample. Thus, we exclude
individuals who are unemployed or out   of the labor force in any year during the

period and those who are enrolled in undergraduate or graduate or professional

schools during the period. These restrictions may cause us to overstate the

expected earnings of drop Outs (who are likely to be more frequently unemployed

than persisters) and to understate the expected earnings of persisters (who are

likely to be more frequently enrolled in post—graduate education than drop—
                                        —8—


outs). These problems, plus the problem that we only have access to at most

three years' earnings data for 4—year college graduates, decrease the likelihood

that we will find future earnings to be an important explanatory variable in the

structural probit models.

IV. Grade Point Average Equations8

     Table 2 presents estimates of the marginal effects of a student's hours of

employment in October of each year on his grade point average (GPA) that year.9

The NLS data enable us to focus on the 1972—73 GPA, the 1973—74 GPA, and the

1974—76 GPA; the latter for both students who attended college only in 1974—75

and for those who attended in both 1974—75 and 1975—76. The data also permit us

to distinguish whether the student was employed on—campus or off—campus in

October of 1974 and 1975, hence we can estimate if there are differenttal

effects of on—campus or off—campus work in those years.

     In each case, the student's grade point average on a linear scale with A

set equal to 4 and D set equal to 1, was specified to be a linear function of

his hours of employment, as well as a vector of control variables.° For the

1972—73 GPA equation, the latter included variables to capture the student's

high school GPA, rank in class, hours of work while in high—school, involvement

in other high school activities, family background, high school curriculum, SAT

scores, and the quality of the college being attended (for students at 4—year

colleges).U For the latter two GPA's, only the prior year's GPA and the

quality of the college were included.

    Column (1) for each sample includes both actual hours of work and an

instrument for hours of work; the latter obtained in each case from a Tobit

reduced form weekly hours of employment equation (e.g., equation (la)). The
                                        —9—


 latter variable is never statistically significant, which suggests that we   can

 legitimately treat hours of work as exogenous in these grade point average
 equations. 12

      Column (2) for each sample contains the hours equations when only actual

 hours of work are included. In these students' freshman year (1972—73), actual

 hours of work in October of 1972 is seen to have a negative influence on grades

of 2—year college students but not to influence grades of 4—year students.

However, even in the former case the effect is small. For example, a 2—year

college student who worked 25 hours per week would be predicted to have a grade

point average that was 0.1 lower than that of a student who did not work at all;

this should be contrasted to the mean first—year GPA of roughly 2.6 in the

sample. Moreover, as the table indicates, neither predicted nor actual hours of

work in October of 1973 are seen to affect the 1973—74 GPA.'3

     The bottom panel of Table 2 presents estimates of the effects of hours of

work in October of 1974 and 1975 on 4—year students' grade point averages during

the 1974—76 period. The NLS72 did not survey students in the fall of 1975 and,

while retrospective questions on fall 1975 hours of work were asked in later

surveys, grade point average data were not collected separately for the 1974—75

and 1975—76 academic years. Rather, students reported their grade point

averages for the entire two—year period. As a result, we analyze the third and

fourth years' data together. Estimates are presented of the effect of all hours

of employment, of on—campus hours, and of off—campus hours of work. Separate

estimates are presented for those students enrolled only in 1974—75 and those

enrolled in both 1974—75 and 1975—76.

     Given the small sample sizes in the former case, we focus our discussion on

the latter. The results in the bottom panel of Table 2 suggest that hours of

work can be treated as exogenous in the grade point average equations (predicted
                                      —10—


hours are never significant) and that only hours of work off—campus affect grade

point averages. However, the marginal effect of off—campus hours in the junior

year (positive) just offsets the marginal effect of off—campus hours in the

senior year (negative), so if a student worked the same number of hours in both

years the net effect on his grade point average was zero.'4

     In sum, we do not find any strong evidence for this national sample of

college students that hours of work during the academic year in the range that

students worked significantly (both in a statistical and a quantitative sense)

reduced grade point averages.

V. Post—College Earnings

    As described above, "selectivity corrected" expected future earnings

equations were estimated, with the logarithms of average annual and average

weekly earnings over the 1977—79 period used as expected future earnings

measures. Separate equations were estimated for individuals enrolled in college

one year who persisted in college the next year and for those enrolled one year

who dropped out the next year. Estimates were obtained for six samples; 2—year

college students enrolled in 1972—73, 2—year college students still enrolled in

197374, 4—year college students enrolled in 1972—73, 4—year college students

still enrolled in 1973—74, 4—year college students still enrolled in 1974—75,

and 4—year college students still enrolled in 1975—76.

    In each case, expected future earnings were specified to be a function of

the student's grade point average in the year, college quality (for students at

4—year colleges), the student's SAT score, whether he had any health limita-

tions, whether English was his primary language, whether he resided in a rural

area, four race dummy variables, the unemployment rate and average hourly

earnings in the state in which he resided, and his weekly hours of work in

October of the year. These equations also included estimates of the inverse
                                      —11—


Mills ratio, obtained from reduced form probit drop—out equation estimates for

each sample.'5 A complete enumeration of the variables in these latter equa-

tions is found in Ehrenberg and Sherman (1985).

     In general, the explanatory power of these models was not high. We did

find evidence, however, that higher grade point averages led to higher expected

future earnings for individuals who persisted in college in each year. Simi-

larly, attendance at higher quality colleges in 1974—75 and 197576 led to

higher expected earnings for 4—year college students who persisted in college in

those years. In contrast, we failed to find any relationship between hours of

work while in college and expected future earnings for any of the groups.

VI. Probability of Dropping Out, Probability of "Graduating—on—Time",
     Probability of Enrolling in Graduate School

     Given the expected future earnings equations of the last section, we can

impute consistent estimates of expected future earnings for each enrolled

student in each year if he drops out and if he persists in college. These in

turn can be entered into the structural probit persistence equation (equation 3)

and these probit equations estimated. In addition to the expected earnings

variables these equations include the student's weekly hours of work in October

of the academic year, a group of variables that control for his academic ability

and his grade point average to date, variables reflecting his family's economic

circumstances, and a vector of race dummy variables.'6

    Table 3 contains the coefficients of hours of employment from the various

probit drop—out equations. Also included in this table are hours coefficients

from reduce form probit models that sought to explain whether 2—year college

students in the sample enrolled in 1973—74 graduated by the fall of 1974,

whether 4—year college students in the sample enrolled in 1975—76 graduated by

the fall of 1976, and whether 4—year college students, who graduated by the fall
                                        —12—



of   1976, were enrolled in graduate or professional school at that time. Some of

the implications of these coefficients (and the other coefficients in the

underlying models) are found in Table 4 where we tabulate the implied marginal

effects    of working 20 hours/week while in college on drop—out, "graduate—on—
time", and enrollment in graduate school probabilities.
      Turning first to the freshman year results (columns (1) and (4) of Table
3), longer hours of work are associated with higher drop—out probabilities for
both 2—year and 4—year college students. The implied marginal effects of
increased    hours of work on the probability of dropping Out can be computed in a

straightforward manner, with the estimates for 2—year students taking into

account the indirect effect of hours of work that operates through its effect on

grade point averages (see Table 2). Evaluated at the mean value of all explana-

tory variables in the sample, save for hours of work and grade point average, an

additional 10 hours per week of work is associated with a 3 (at 0 hours) to 4.5

(at 40 hours) percentage point increase for 2—year students and a 1.5(at 0

hours)    to 2.2 (at 40 hours) percentage point   increase for 4—year students.'7 A

2—year (4—year) college student who worked 20 hours a week in his freshman year

would increase his probability of not returning for his sophomore year relative

to that for a student who did not work at all by 6.6 (3.2) percentage points,

ceteris paribus. This should be contrasted with first—year drop—out rates of

about 23 percent and 12 percent, respectively, for the 2—year and 4—year college

students   in the sample (Table 4).
      Turning next to the second year results (columns 2 and 5 of Table 3), they
indicate that increased hours of work in the second year again led to higher
drop—out probabilities for both 2—year and 4—year students. Indeed, evaluated at
the mean value of all explanatory variables,   the estimates suggest that a 2—year

(4—year) college student who worked 20   hours    a week would have a probability of
                                      —13—


 dropping out after his second year that was some 7.3 (3.4) percentage points

 higher than that for a student who didn't work at all. These numbers should be

 contrasted with second—year drop—out rates of roughly 26 percent (13 percent)

 for the 2—year (4—year) college students In the sample. Furthermore, the hours

coefficient in the 2—year college graduation (by the fall of 1974) equation

indicates that longer hours of work clearly reduced the rate at which nondrop—

outs graduate "on time". Only one—third of the persisters in 2—year colleges

had graduated by the fall of 1974 and, by increasing the length of time it

takes 2—year students to graduate, longer hours of work have an additional cost

to the students.

     Finally, we turn to the results for the third and fourth years, 1974—75 and

1975—76, for 4—year college students (columns 6—9 of Table 3). For these years

the NLS reported whether employed students worked on— or off—campus and we test

for possible differential effects of the two types of employment. The drop—out

equation coefficients suggest that off—campus, but not on—campus, hours of work

were positively associated with drop—out probabilities in both the third

(junior) and fourth (senior) years.'8 Ceteris paribus, a student who worked 20

hours a week off—campus in his junior (senior) year had a probability of

dropping Out of college that was about 3.0 (4.5) percentage points higher than a

student who didn't work at all that year. These numbers should be contrasted

with the drop—out rate in the sample of 9.3 (12.8) percent after the third

(fourth) year. Similarly, while weekly hours of work off—campus adversely

affected "graduation—on—time" probabilities, on—campus hours did not. Ceteris

paribus, a student who worked 20 hours a week off—campus in October of 1975 had

an 8.7 percentage point lower probability of graduating by October of 1976 than

did a student who did not work at all. This should be contrasted with the

overall graduation rate (by October of 1976) of 66.0 percent for the sample of
                                        —14—


those enrolled in October of 1975. Since the marginal effect of off—campus work

hours on the graduation rate was greater than its marginal effect on the drop

Out rate, working off—campus must also have increased the length of time it took

some persisters to get their degrees.

     In contrast, for students who had graduated by the fall of 1976, increased

on—campus hours of work in their senior year, but not off—campus hours, were

associated with a significantly higher probability of their being enrolled in

post—graduate education. Indeed, if a student worked 20 hours a week on campus

in his senior year, his probability of attending graduate or professional school

was 11.0 percentage points higher than that of students who didn't work at all

on—campus. This should be contrasted with the overall probability of post-

graduate enrollment of 20.3 percent in the subsample of graduates.

     It is difficult to know exactly what this latter result implies. On the

one hand, we know from the data that individuals who worked on—campus tended to

have higher grade point averages and to be enrolled in higher quality colleges.

On the other hand, these variables were controlled for directly in the equations

that underlie Tables 3 and 4. It is conceivable that, at least in 1975, many of

the students working on—campus were doing so in positions that were career

related and/or that increased their interest in post—graduate education.

VII. Concluding Remarks

    The analyses we presented in this paper have yielded a number of implica-

tions about how hours of work during the academic year affected the academic

achievement and post—college outcomes of full—time male students who entered

college in the fall of 1972. First, for the most part weekly hours of work in

the range that students in this sample worked, typically less than 25 hours a
                                      —15—


week (Table 1), tended not to adversely affect their grade point averages. The

only exception was for two—year college students in their freshman year and even

here the effect was quantitatively very small.

     Second, weekly hours of work in this range did have an adverse effect each

year on the probability that a student would be enrolled in school the next year

and, for those who did persist, reduced their probability of graduating on time.

Since we found no evidence that working while in college increased future

earnings for drop—outs or persisters, these adverse effects of hours of work

must result either from hours of work reducing the student's perceptions of the

consumption value of college or its reducing the number of courses they feel

they can handle each year. Either of these changes would reduce their net

utility from remaining in college.

     Third, when the data permitted us to distinguish whether students worked

on—campus or off—campus, only the latter was shown to adversely affect persis-

tence (a result also found by Astin (1975)) and graduation—on—time probabil-

ities. In contrast, working on—campus was associated with a higher probability

of enrolling in post—graduate education.

     Fourth, although hours of work while in college did not directly affect

post—college earnings (they did indirectly through their affect on persistence),

students' grade point averages did appear to be important, especially for

persisters. Moreover, there was some evidence that college quality also

mattered, at least for people who reached their junior or senior year in

college.

     We must stress, of course, that our results were for a cohort of students

who entered college over a decade ago, most of whom worked less than 25 hours a

week. Although we found no systematic nonlinear effects of hours in the

persistence equations, our results did suggest that the marginal effect of hours
                                         —16—


worked on drop out probabilities increased with hours worked.'9      Hence, if the

same model continues to hold today, longer work weeks for current students

caused by increased college costs but less than proportionate increases in

financial aid, should lead to greater than proportionate increases in their drop

out rates. To verify this it would be prudent to reestimate our models using

data for a later cohort of students.2'

        Several limitations of our analyses should also be stressed. First, given

the length of the longer paper that underlies this paper, we made no attempts to

see if the effects of employment while in college vary with the quality of

students, their race, or the quality of the colleges they attend. Clearly such

an extension is worth pursuing.

        Second, as pointed out by the referees, the associations we observe between

drop—out probabilities and hours of work while in college may be confounded by

omitted variables that affect both variables simultaneously. While we have tried

to minimize these problems by using rather comprehensive specifications of hours

of work and drop—out equations, an alternative approach would be to try to

estimate a fixed—effects type model directly.

        Third, our post—college earnings data were limited to at most three years

for 4—year college graduates and this limitation forced us to exclude people

enrolled in post—graduate education from our earnings analyses. This led to

considerable measurement error in the expected future earnings variables and,

not surprisingly, they never proved significant in the probit persistence

equations. It would be desirable to redo the analyses using a longer time

horizon; data now available from a later wave of the NLS72 data would facilitate

this.

        Finally,   our analyses ignored the effects of loan burdens students assume

to finance education on drop out probabilities, occupational choice, the choice

of college major, and the decision to enroll in post—graduate education. Only a

small   fraction of the students in   our sample reported total educational loan

burdens in any year that exceeded $5,000, so this omission may not have     been a

serious one for our sample. Yet we know that the loan burdens students are

assuming today are substantially higher, especially as they try to limit

employment while in college to a "reasonable" level. Analyses of more recent

data clearly must address the Issues these loan burdens raise.

   (1968), and D.J. Trueblood (1957). Many of these studies are summarized in

   A. Hood and C. Maplethorpe (1980).

4. Gee San (1984) does explicitly model the persistence decision in an economic

   framework.

5. The issue of when to terminate the estimation is difficult; it is well—known

   that many individuals who ultimately complete 2— or 4—year colleges take

   considerably longer than the normal length of the program (see e.g., Manski

   and Wise (1984). Indeed, in the sample we use in our analyses (described

   below) less than 25 percent of the students enrolled in 2—year colleges in

   both 10/72 and 10/73 had received a 2—year degree by 10/74. The limits we

   choose, while somewhat arbitrary, do have the advantage of reflecting

  expected (in some sense) normal progress in school.

6. The restriction to males is done to keep the sample as homogeneous as

  possible.    The restriction to students enrolled in 2— or 4—year academic
  programs    creates obvious selectivity problems; we ignore the effect of
  financial aid and other variables on the decision to enroll in college.

  There is a large literature on this question, see for example, Charles

  Manski and David Wise (1983).

7. This index runs from 1 to 8 with lower scores indicating more selective

  institutions. Over 50 percent of 4—year colleges were in category 8.

 8. The next three sections summarIze extensive empirical analyses and focus

    solely on the effects of hours of employment while in college. More

    completed discussions and coefficients of all of the variables included in

    each model are found in Ehrenberg and Sherman (1985).

 9. Data on weeks worked during the year was also available. Since some weeks

    worked occur during summer and vacation periods, weekly hours in October (at

    the start of the academic year) is probably a better measure of students'

    work effort while enrolled in school.

10. We also experimented with various nonlinear forms of the hours variable but

    found no consistent nonlinear patterns, either here or in any of the results

    that are discussed in the next two sections. See Ronald Ehrenberg (1984).

11. High school grade point average (CPA), rank in class, and SAT scores were

     not reported for some students in the sample. All students, however,

     reported scores on a battery of standardized tests. GPA, rank in class and

     SAT scores were imputed for nonreporters based on a regression for

    reporters of these variables on the battery of test scores.

12. This test for exogeneity, or more precisely the lack of correlation between

   the error terms in the hours and CPA equations is a variant of the test

   first proposed by D.M. Wu (1973, 1974). We also allowed for the endogeneity

   of college quality (Q) in the GPA equation, in this case the Wu test proved

   inconclusive and the coefficient of       was opposite in sign to that of Q.

   However, the inclusion of the endogenous quality measure never changed the

   coefficient of the hours variable in the CPA equation.

13. Experimentation indicated that October 1972 hours of work also never

   directly influenced 1973—74 GPAs, although they did indirectly for 2—year

   college students through their affect on 1972—73 GPAs, which in turn

   affected the 1973—74 GPA. This indirect effect of freshman hours was
                                              —22—


    exceedingly small, however. For example, working 25 hours per week in the

    first year would decrease second—year grades of two—year students by —.06

    points relative to the grades of students who did not work at all.

14. Table 1 suggests that average hours of work for those working were equal in

    the two years, although the fraction working increased.

15. Although we call these "drop out" equations, as first noted by Astin (1975),

    they might better be called "stop out" equations. Some students who do not

    persist in a year reenter college after a year or two away and ultimately

    graduate. See also, Manski and Wise (1983) on this point.

16. A more precise description of the variables in each year's drop—out equa-

    tions, as well as complete tables of results, is found in Ehrenberg and

    Sherman (1985).

17. Given the mean    values   of the other explanatory variables, an estimated grade

   point average is used based on the graade point average equations and the

   assumed value of hours of work.

18. Note that the point estimate of the on—campus hours coefficient in the first

   drop out equation, while statistically insignificant, is in fact roughly

   equal to the on—campus hours coefficient.

19. For example, the following table summarizes the marginal effects of an

   additional 10 hours of work per week on drop out probabilities for 4—year

   college students who were initially working either 0 or 40 hours/week (the

   third and fourth year numbers are for students working off—campus):

                           The Utility Maximization Model


     Suppose that the utility function of a family with a college—age child is
given by

     (Al) U =                                              U3 < 0.
                 U[(C,Q,t,W]          U1,U2,U4 > 0,


where C represents parents' consumption, Q the quality of the college that
the child attends, t the time that the student is employed while in college,
and Wp the student's expected post—college earnings stream. Presumably the
family derives positive marginal utility from increased consumption, from having
the child attend a higher quality institution (both for current consumption and
investment reasons), from having the student work fewer hours while in college
(which would free up more time for him to study and participate in extracurricu-
lar activities), and from higher expected post—college earnings for the student.
     Given a student's ability (z), his achievement in college (A), as
measured by objective variables like grades, depends upon the quality of the
college attended and the time the student spends on nonemployment activities
while enrolled in college. Presumably it is more difficult for a student of
given ability to "do well" at a better college and less time spent working
provides more time for studying. Hence

     (A2) A =   A(Z,Q,t)       A1   > 0,      A2,A3 < 0,


     The student's post—college wage is assumed to be related to his ability,
academic achievement, quality of college attended, and time spent working while
enrolled   in college. To the extent that employment while in college helps
develop work habits or merely signals other attributes (such as high motivation)
that make a potential employee more attractive to employers after graduation
from college, post—college wages will be positively related to hours worked
while enrolled in college.

     (A3) WP =   WP(Z,A,Q,t)         l'2'3''4 >            0.



    The    family   seeks to maximize the utility function (Al), subject to the
academic achievement function (A2), expected post—college wage (A3) and a number
of other constraints.        First, parents' consumption is equal to their total
                                                     —2—


 income (Y) minus their contribution to the student's college expenses (Xp).


            (A4) c=Y—x

Second, the total cost of the student's attending college, which is assumed to
be an increasing function of the quality of the college (E(Q)), is equal to the
suni of the parental contribution, the student's own financial contribution to
his education (X5) and the total (S) of the scholarship from the college, and
other public and private sources that he receives.

                                 .j..   v   ..   '
Finally the student's own contribution is determined by his wage rate (w)
multiplied by the number of hours he works during the summer and academic year
(tv).

           (A6) x = wt


           With suitable assumptions about the properties of all of the functions in
the model, one obtains a general solution to this maximization problem of the
f o rin:




           (A7) (a) X = X(Z,Y,S,w)

                 (b) Q        Q(Z,Y,S,w)

                 (c) t = t(Z,Y,S,w)

                 (d) A =      A(Z,Q,t)
                 (e) WP =        WP(Z,A,Q,t).

           Equations (A7) represent a recursive model of the "college enrollment—
college activity—college outcomes" process. Parental contributions to child-
ren's education (Xv), the quality of college the student attends (Q), and
the student's employment time (tv) are simultaneously determined by the
                                      —3—


student's ability (Z), family income (Y), the subsidy the student receives
for attending college (S) and his wage rate while in school (w). Ability,
quality of college and student employment time then affect academic achievement
(A) through the educational production function specified in (A7d). Finally,
the earnings equation in (A7e) generates post—college earnings (wP) as a
function of ability, academic achievement, quality of college, and time devoted
to nonemploynient activities while enrolled in college.
     Unfortunately, this system cannot be directly used as the basis for our
empirical work for a number of reasons. First, the assumption that college cost
is an increasing function of college quality is difficult to justify, given the
coexistence of high—cost private and low—cost public institutions.A' Indeed,
the whole issue of student choice of public vs. private institution is beyond
the scope of this paper.AZ
     Second, the subsidy or scholarship that a student receives from a college
is endogenously determined and depends upon factors like the student's ability,
the quality and costs of the college, the student's family size and income, and
federal financial aid policies. Although one can attempt to explicitly model
the scholarship level and embed it in the complete model, to do so requires one
to make either somewhat arbitrary variable exclusion, functional form, or
stochastic assumptlons.A3
     These concerns suggest that the following modified model be employed.
Suppose that we can write the equation for the scholarship received by the
student in a year as

     (A8) S = S(Z,Q,C,Y     ,x4)



where C represents the cost of attending the college, and X4 any other
exogenous variables (e.g., family size and race) that might affect financial aid
of fers.A4
     One can solve (A7b), (A7c) and (A8) eliminating 5, to get reduced form
hours of employment and quality of college attended equationsA5

where z now represents all of the exogenous variables implicit or explicit in
(A7) and (A8). Equations (A7d), (A7e), and (A9) yield equation (1) in the text.




                                  Appendix Notes


Al. However, if one restricts the analyses to private colleges, one does obtain
     a strong positive relationship between a college's tuition and its quality;
     the latter measured by the Cass and Birnbaum (1972) selectivity index for
     colleges.
A2. See Sherman (1985) for a treatment of thIs Issue
A3. Charles Manskl and David Wise (1983) and Winship Fuller, Manski, and Wise
     (1982) present attempts to include an endogenous scholarship level in
    models of college choice.
A4. Presumably parameters of federal financial aid programs also should enter
    into (A8), however at a point In time these do not vary across individuals
    or institutions, and so can be eliminated from cross—section analyses
    without loss of generality.
A5. Since the cost of the college the student attends is also endogenous and
    presumably determIned by the exogenous variables that appear in (A7), C
    is also eliminated from (A9).
