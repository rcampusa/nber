                                            ABSTRACT

        We investigate whether or not a beta increases with bad news and decreases with good news,
just as does volatility. Using daily returns for nine stocks in a double beta model with EGARCH
specifications, we show that news asymmetrically affects the betas of individual stocks. We find
that betas depend on two source of news: market shocks and idiosyncratic shocks. Some stock betas
depend on both while others depend on one. We categorize each stock return as belonging to one
of three beta process models, a joint, an idiosyncratic, and a market model based on the role of
market shocks and idiosyncratic shocks. Our conclusions differ from those of Brown, Nelson, and
Sunnier (1995) who worked with monthly aggregated data in a bivariate EGARCH model. We
believe that stock price aggregation in this previous research resulted in a loss of cross sectional
variation and consequently lead to weak results. If the asymmetric effect is more readily apparent
in daily data, then this may again explain previous researchers' inability to detect asymmetriceffects.
Our findings shed light on the controversy as to whether abnormalities in stock returnsresult from
 overreaction to information or from changes in expected returns in an efficient market. Finding an
 asymmetric effect in betas leads us to conclude that abnormalities can, at least partially, be explained
 by changes in expected returns through a change in beta.

 I. Introduction


        Given evidence on the predictive asymmetry of volatility, we investigate whether or

 not a beta increases with bad news and decreases with good news, that is, whether an

 asymmetric / leverage effect exist.

       Studies have documented the asymmetric effect of news on the volatility of stock

 returns. This "leverage or asymmetric effect" for individual stocks and market indices

 discovered by Black (1976) and confirmed by the findings of, e.g., French, Schwert and

 Stambaugh (1987), Nelson (1990) and Schwert (1990) refers to the fact that volatility

tends to rise following negative returns and fall following positive returns. The

asymmetric effect of news on volatility has been addressed in terms of two mechanisms:

financial and operational leverage and determinants of market risk premium. First,
financial and operational leverages capture the idea that if the value of a leveraged firm

drops, then its equity becomes more highly leveraged, causing an increase in volatility'

(Black (1976), and Christie (1982)). The second mechanism for the asymmetric effect

focuses on the positive relation between volatility and the expected market risk premium

(the expected return on a stock portfolio minus the riskiess rates). If the expected market

risk premium is an increasing function of market volatility, holding riskiess rates




   Christie (1982) shows that equity volatility is increasing in financial leverage, and hence there
is a negative relationship between the variance of returns and the value of equity. However,
Christie (1982) and Black (1976) point out that financial and operational leverage is not enough
to fully account for the asymmetry of volatility


                                                 2
    constant, an increase in market volatility implies a increase in expected return and in

 return lowers the stock price, contributing to the asymmetric effect in volatility2

           This evidence implies a way of explaining a time-varying beta. Ifthe risk premium

 is an increasing function of the volatility, and beta is a measure of sensitivity to risk, then

 the asymmetric effect in volatility may imply such an effect in beta too.3 The literature

 suggests that time variation of beta results from the variation in expected returns on the

 market portfolio and in relative risk of the firms' investment which causes fmancial or

 operational leverage. That is, if the beta of a leveraged firm's assets is positive then the

 beta of the firm's equity should rise in response to negative returns which increase the

leverage of the firm. Thus, it is reasonable to expect equity betas to be increasing in

leverage.4 In addition, increases in market shocks to the firms also cause increases in

beta and lead to an increase in expected returns on market. As a result, it should create a

drop iii the stock price (Ball and Kothari (1989)).

           This paper extends Brown, Nelson, and Sunnier (1995, hereafter BNS) who work

with monthly aggregated data in a bivariate EGARCH model. First, we explore the

different roles of market and idiosyncratic shocks, which is ignored in the work of BNS.

     SeePindyck (1984), Poterba and Summers (1986), French, Schwert and Stambough (1978),
 Bollerslev, Engle and Wooldridge (1988), Engel, Ng and Rothschild (1990), and Campbell and
 Hentschel (1992).
    Chou, Engle and Kane (1992) suggest another way to look at the time-varying beta. They
 estimate a time-varying parameter GARCH-M (TVP GARCH-M) model, which combines the
 GARCH-M model for the CAPM and the time-varying parameter model for measuring risk
 aversion. The basic ideas of this model are to explain the roles of riskaversion, to show the path
of varying market beta over time, and to propose instrumental variables for risk aversion.
   Leverage is a decreasing function of equity returns, provided firms do not maintain dynamically
constant market-valued capital structures. Maintaining a debtlequity ratio that isindependent of
equity returns would require continuous new issues or retirement of debt or equity. Firms would
need to respond to share price declines with retirement of debt, which seems unlikely. Ball, Lev,
and Watts (1976) provide evidence that such leverage adjustments do not occur immediately in
response to earnings-induced leverage variation.



                                                3
Since the beta of a firm measures sensitivity to risk, a series of abnormally negative

returns caused by market and/or idiosyncratic shocks may increase the beta of a firm.

Hence, the analysis of the asymmetric effects of news in betas gives specific information

about individual stock returns. For this reason, our model distinguishes the role of

market shocks and idiosyncratic shocks in determining asymmetric effects in a time-

varying beta process.

      Second, we use daily stock return data of individual firms rather than monthly

aggregated data (portfolio or dedile data) as used in BNS, to allow the separation of
market shocks and idiosyncratic shocks. Since asymmetric responses of beta to good and

bad news may be smoothed as the aggregated data is used, it is a more appropriate

approach to examine individual stock return. Using daily data allows examination of the

asymmetric effects in beta occurred in different frequency data.

      Third, while BNS use a bivariate EGARCH model, we use a double-beta model

(Engle and Merzrich (1996)) with an EGARCH variance specification. The double-beta

model is suggested for parsimony and computability. In contrast to a bivariate EGARCH

model, it directly uses market information to estimate the beta and variance of stock
returns.

      Using daily returns for nine stocks in a double beta model with EGARCH
specifications, We find a strong asymmetric effect in beta as well as in volatility. As a

result, it suggests the possible existence of a positive relation between beta and volatility

of individual stock return since these may be related to each other through asymmetric

effects to news.




                                             4
        We also fmd that betas depend on two source of news: market shocks and

idiosyncratic shocks. Some stock betas depend on both while others just depend on one.

We categorize each stock's beta as a one of three beta processes, a joint, an idiosyncratic,

and a market model, The joint model for a beta process is for a stock return which beta is

driven by market shocks and idiosyncratic shocks both. The idiosyncratic model explains

the time-varying betas which have asymmetric effects in idiosyncratic shocks. The betas

driven by market shocks belong to the market model.

        Our conclusions differ from those of BNS (1995). Using monthly portfolio and

decile data BNS fmd that asymmetric effects are absent in beta though they appear in

volatility. We believe that stock price aggregation in this previous research resulted in a

loss of cross sectional variation and consequently weak results. If the asymmetric effect

is more readily apparent in daily data, then this may again explain previous researchers'

inability to detect asymmetric effects.

       Our results also shed light on the controversy over cross-sectional stockreturns.

The most significant challenge which time-varying beta models can address is found in

the controversy of "abnormalities of stock prices".5 This controversy involves two

hypotheses: "overreaction to information" which causes the mispricing of the market (De

Bondt and Thaler (1989), Chopra, Lakonishok and Ritter (1992)) versus the systematic

changes in expected returns in an efficient market ((Chan (1989), Ball and Kothari
(1989)).

       De Bondt and Thaler (1989) and Chopra, Lakonishok and Ritter (1992, hereafter

CLR) fmd evidence of mean-reversion in stock prices. That is, "losers," stocks that have




                                            5
recently experienced huge losses, tend to subsequently outperform "winners," stocks that

have recently experienced price increases. They interpret this phenomenon as an
overreaction of the kind assumed in an inefficient market6 (such overreaction is

inefficient; an investor exploits these inefficiency gains when stock prices revert to their

respective fundamental value) and support the contrarian stock selection strategy that

consists of buying stocks that have been losers and selling short stocks that have been

winners. Many investment strategies, such as those based on the price/earnings ratio, or

the books/market ratio can be regarded as variants of this strategy. CLR also support the

overreaction hypothesis and show that this overreaction effect is stronger for smaller
firms than larger firms.

          However, Chan (1988) and Ball and Kothari (1989) argue that time-varying betas

and risk premia can explain the return performance of winners and losers.7 They fmd

evidence that the beta of individual stock rises (falls) in response to abnormally negative

(positive) returns. That is, there exists predictive asymmetry in conditional betas'

response to shocks. Ball and Kothari argue that this asymmetric response to good and

bad news explains the performance of winners and losers. They show that in an efficient


  See Reid and Lanstein (1985), Fama and French (1988), Lo and MacKinlay (1988), Porterba
and Summers (1988), Jegadeesh (1990), Lehmann (1990), Jegadeesh and Titman (1991) and
Brock, Lakonishok and Le Baron (1992).

  Black (1986), Poterba and Summers (1987), DeBondt and Thaler (1895, 1987), and Lehmann
(1990) support the inefficiency of market with the idea that the predictability of equity returns
may reflect the overreaction of stock prices, the misperceptions of investors in an inefficient
market.
   Zarowin (1990) supports market efficiency by analyzing return reversal behavior of stock
prices. However, he relates it with size effect claiming that the tendency for losers to outperform
winners is not due to investor overreaction, but to the tendency for losers to be smaller-sized
firms than winners. He claims when losers are compared to winners of equal size, there is little
evidence of any return discrepancy. He also shows that neither differences in risk nor in January
returns can completely account for the return discrepancy. He concludes that the winner vs. loser
phenomenon found by DeBondt and Thaler appears to be another manifestation of the size effect.



                                                6
market time-varying expected returns are caused by variation in expected returns on the

market portfolio, relative risk of a firm's investments, and leverage. Chan (1988) also

explores the correlation between the betas and the market-risk premium in the contrarian

strategy. He suggests that stocks whose values diminish become riskier on the basis of

financial leverage effect. From option pricing theory, a change in firm value has a bigger

effect on the market values of equity than on the market value of debt like liabilities of

the firm. Thus, barring any offsetting actions taken by the firm, the financial leverage of

the loser firm becomes bigger as the stock price falls, increasing the risk of the stock.

Likewise this leverage effect reduces the risk of a winner stock. Hence, the loser's beta is

positively correlated with the market risk premium, whereas the winner's is negatively
correlated with it.

       By fmding a weak asymmetric effect in beta, BNS support the overreaction theory

by finding no leverage effect in beta. BNS conclude that betas are not responsive enough

to account for the differing return performances of "winners" and "losers" and support

De Bondt and Thaler's claim, However, finding an asymmetric effect in betas leadsus to

conclude that abnormalies can be explained by changes in expected returns through a

change in beta supporting the claim of Chan and Ball and Kothari.

       In this paper, the time-varying beta of individual firm stock returns is investigated

in the context of an asymmetric effect of news, market shocks and idiosyncratic shocks.

Focusing on these two shocks, we suggest a model that allows one to distinguish two

shocks in the beta process. We use the double beta model with EGARCH variance

specification. The double beta model specification is used for parsimonious estimation

and computability. In this model market information is used as an explanatory in the



                                            7
estimation of the volatility and beta of the individual stock returns. For the empirical

analysis the daily data of twenty five firms' stock traded in NYSE and NASDAQ are

chosen. The stocks are those most widely held: Apple, AT&T, Bank of America, Bell

Atlantic, Chase, Coca-Cola, Compaq, Disney, Ford, Exxon, GAP, General Electric,

Hewlett Packard, IBM, Intel, Johnson & Johnson, JP Morgan, McDonald, Merck,

Microsoft, Motorola, Nordstrom, Sears, Sun, and Time Warner. We categorize each

stock's beta into three beta models based on role of two shocks, market shocks and

idiosyncratic shocks. They are a joint model, an idiosyncratic model, and a market
model.

         The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section II provides the

specification of the double beta model with EGARCH variance. Section III describes the

data of nine firms and the testing procedure. The behavior of time-varying beta
associated with asymmetric effect for each firm is examined and the empirical results are

summarized in Section IV. Section V concludes.

             = fl    r,, +         z1,,                                                   (2)



where z,, and z are uncorrelated i.i.d. processes with zero means and unit variances.

Here, °m,i            and   /3,   are,    respectively, the conditional variance of r,   the firm-

specific variance of r1,,         and   the conditional beta of i with respect to          Beta is

expressed in the following way:




             E,_1[r,     .,,,,1
        /3 =                                                                              (3)
                    E,i[rmt I



where E_1 [.J denotes expectation at time t-1.

        Equation (2) turns out to be the one factor model of Engle, Ng, and Rothschild

(1990)8 where fl         r, is    the market factor in      with conditional variance J3

while cii,    z      is the firm-specific component of risk with conditional variance o

This model implies that the individual excess return consists of two components, the

market factor effect and its idiosyncratic effect. By assumption, these two components of



K
  Engle, Ng, and Rothschild (1990) suggested the factor model as a parsimonious structure for
the conditional covariance matrix of asset excess returns. The basic idea of this model is that the
volatility of individual stock returns can be decomposed in two components, a systematic and an
idiosyncratic one. The systematic component is explained with the volatility of market return
while idiosyncratic one shows its own volatility that is not captured by the market.




                                                     9
returns are uncorrelated. The variance of the return is then given as the square of the

market beta times the market volatility plus the variance of the idiosyncratic error.

       One of the applications for a factor model for an individual stock is the double

beta model, which has one beta in the mean and another beta in the idiosyncratic

variance. Letting the idiosyncratic error itself be a univariate EGARCH process, the

double beta model of individual stock returns can be estimated by univariate EGARCH

variance with the market volatility as an input (Engle and Mezrich (1996)). Compared to

the bivariate EGARCH specification of BNS, this model is relatively parsimonious since

it uses market information directly in order to estimate beta and volatility of individual

stock returns. First, the volatility of market return is specified as an EGARCH process.

Second, beta and volatility of an individual firm are simultaneously estimated with its

own EGARCH variance specification using the market volatility as a regressor in the

individual variance equation.       Here, the double beta model is. chosen for model
specification as a factor model,

       In order to estimate the double beta model, the market conditional variance must

be specified. We assumed that the market conditional variance                 follows a univariate

EGARCH(l,1) process. That is,




        ln(a) a, + 6,,,      [ln(o,1_1) —a',,,] +9,,, z,,,,_1 + Ym[l Z,,,,_i —El z,,, II   (4)




By construction, °m 'Zm and Ym [I zm I —E I Zm I] are innovations in ln(a,1). The 9,,,

term in (4) allows for leverage effects. When 0,,, < 0, ln(o) tends to rise (fall)


                                                10
following the nagative market shock z,,, which drops (rises) in prices. If Tm > 0, the

Tm[I z   I—El z I] term raises (lowers) ln(c,) when the magnitude of a market shock is

larger (smaller) than expected. Taken together, terms °m Z,,, and      Tm[l z I—El z I] allow

the market's conditional variance to respond asymmetrically to positive and negative

returns.


           For the firm-specific return, a univariate EGARCH(1,1) conditional variance a

in the double beta model is changed to




           ln(c)=a1 +S [ln(c 1)—a1]+ .                +y[I z1 I—El z, I]+ln(cL) (5)



Here the appearance of a market volatility term ln(c,) in the volatility process of

individual stock return constitutes the difference between the double-beta model and the

bivariate EGARCH model. The market volatility is incorporated as a regressor in the

double-beta model. It means that market information feeds directly into the volatility of

the individual stock return. The intuition for the functional form of (5) is similar to that

for (4). If 0. <0 and        > 0, then the firm-specific conditional variance rises (falls) in

response to negative firm-specific shocks and in response to firm-specific shocks of

larger (smaller) magnitude than expected.

           The model for conditional beta, a8U' is constructed assuming an AR(l) process.9




                                               11
           fl1,    +8 .[J3,_ —c]+) •z,_1 +A, •z,_1                                       (6)




The )i. z and A,, z,,, terms allow for leverage effects in the conditional betas which is

suggested by Chan (1988) and Ball and Kothari (1989). If 2 is negative, the conditional

beta rises in response to negative idiosyncratic returns (non-market returns) and drops in

response to positive idiosyncratic returns. Similarly, if A.,, is negative, the conditional

beta rises in response to negative market returns and drops in response to positive market

returns.

       Finally, in order to implement the estimation, models for beta, the volatility of

market return and the volatility of individual stock return are specified in equations (4),

(5) and (6). For a given initial parameters and initial values of {r,,,} and     {}, we can
easily derive the {z },{zj,,},{a,},{aj2} and       {fi}   sequences   by computing the quasi-

likelihood functions recursively. The initial values are set to their unconditional

expectations.




III.       Empirical Applications


1. Data


           For this empirical analysis we use the daily stock returns of Apple, AT&T, Bank

of America, Bell Atlantic, Chase, Coca-Cola, Compaq, Disney, Ford, Exxon, GAP,

  BNS also choose AR(1) order for the bivariate system.

General Electric, Hewlett Packard, IBM, Intel, Johnson & Johnson, JP Morgan,
McDonald, Merck, Microsoft, Motorola, Nordstrom, Sears, Sun, and Time Warner. The

data is from January 1, 1990, to December 29, 1995, and comes from the New York

Stock Exchange (NYSE).1° In order to estimate the market return the S&P500 index of

the same period is used. Those prices are transformed into returns and are demeaned by

its unconditional mean.



2. Testing and Model Selection for Beta



          Investigating the beta process yields the information on how individual stock

returns behave. In reality, individual stock returns respond to shocks differently. This

gives the insight that each beta process may be characterized by the relative importance

of the two shocks, market shocks and idiosyncratic shocks. Three models of different

beta specifications are estimated for individual stock returns.

       The joint model considers the leverage effects of idiosyncratic shock, Zjtl and

market shock, z,,. If Ai is significantly less than zero, it could be that there exists a
leverage effect of idiosyncratic shocks in beta process. If there is bad news in the market

and such shocks have an asymmetric effect, L0 should be significantly negative. Here,

with significance of the coefficients, 2j   and   2, the arguments of Chan (1988) and Ball

and Kothari (1989) can be examined. In the idiosyncratic model market shocks z.i is

omitted to test the significance of market shocks in joint model. The market model is

estimated to test the significance of idiosyncratic shocks zi.i in joint model.

       The estimation procedure follows the "general to simple rule" applying the LR

(log likelihood) test. Model selection between joint model and idiosyncratic model is

based on testing how the market volatility affects beta."

1, the idiosyncratic   shocks, is zero under the null hypothesis.

        These tests have an additional benefit: one can verify the possibility of

multicollinearity of the market shock, zj, and idiosyncratic shock, zi in joint model.

Multicollinearity may occur because market information is directly used for the
estimation of beta and volatility of individual stock return. In that case, both may

incorporate each other to some extent, even though in theory these two terms should be

independent of each other. Multicollinearity might result in the insignificance of the

coefficients of those variables, whereas a fit with each of them alone

might produce a significant coefficient. Therefore, only looking at the general model,

Joint model, may give incorrect information regarding the importance of these shocks in

the beta process.




IV.     Results - Empirical Analysis of Nine Firms



        Using daily data for nine firms, we fmd that the time-varying beta as well as

volatility of an individual stock return has asymmetric effects of news, market shocks

and/or idiosyncratic shocks, The summary of the empirical analysis is presented in table




                                                 15
1. In table 1 each stock's beta is categorized as one of three beta processes: a joint, an

idiosyncratic or a market model.

       Table 2 reports the model selection and the parameter estimates for beta and

conditional variance for each of the nine firms. The results are summarized in the graphs

in Figures 1 to 25. Each figure consists of the stock price, the estimated betas from the

double-beta model with EGARCH, and the conditional variance of each stock return and.



1. Time-varying beta and time-varying variance



       These results lead to the following conclusions. First, the empirical results

support that time-varying betas are driven by the asymmetric effect of news. The results

can be characterized into three categories such as joint, idiosyncratic and market model.

For those models, the asymmetric effect is present as beta increases w.ith goods news and

decreases with bad news.

       Joint model is the beta series that idiosyncratic and market shocks both induce the

time-varying betas. One can see increases of betas as there is bad news of market or

individual firm itself while decreases of betas result from good news. Following the

"general to simple rule", idiosyncratic model and market model are rejected against joint

model, even though in some series such as Coca-Cola the two shocks, market and

idiosyncratic shocks, seem to be multicollinear. The series of Coca-Cola, Merck,

General Electric, Sears, Bank of America, Hewlett Packard, GAP, JP Morgan,




                                            16
McDonald, Intel, Compaq, Chase, and Ford belong to this joint model according to an LR

test.'2 (See figure 1 to 13.)

          Idiosyncratic model is applied when idiosyncratic shocks are the main reason for

the asymmetric effect, since bad idiosyncratic news increases the betas while good news

decrease the betas. LR test shows that Exxon, Microsoft, Apple, Johnson & Johnson, and

Sun belong to the model.'3 (See figure 14 to 18.)

          Market model is defmed as the process wherein beta is driven by market shock.

Betas of Disney, Bell Atlantic, Nordstrom, and Time Warner increase with bad market

news and decreases with good market news. Market model is chosen against joint model,

since the LR test for the significance of idiosyncratic shocks fails.14 One feature of this

stock is a small and weak leverage effect in conditional variance. Given the choice of

market model, this weak leverage effect in its own conditional variance is what is

expected and is further evidence of the existence of a positive relation between beta and

volatility of individual stock returns. (See figure 20 to 23.)




'  The time-varying betas of Coca-Cola were induced by both market and idiosyncrasies even
though market shocks were the main reason for the change of beta during the time period
examined. (See figure 1.) Merck experienced a price fall during 1992 when the market was in a
boom. However, in most of the remaining periods changes in prices present a similar pattern to
that of the market. During late 1990 the market shocks increased beta and the bad idiosyncratic
shocks caused beta to increase during late 1992 to 1993. (See figure 2.) Most of the shocks to
General Electric's stock returns also came from the market while the idiosyncrasies were found in
some periods. (See figure 3.) Most of Sears' shocks came from the market, but it experienced
good idiosyncratic news in late 1993. The asymmetric effect of bad market shocks increased the
beta while good idiosyncratic shocks induced the increase in beta. (See figure 4.) Once again,
one can see the role of two shocks of the asymmetric effects in betas.
13
    A lot of idiosyncratic shocks occurred on Exxon stock returns during the periods examined,
especially bad shocks. (See figure 14.)
14
   The existence of idiosyncratic shocks as a regressor in joint model does not make a difference
in the explanatory power of joint model compared to market model to support the result that the
time-varying beta of Disney stock is explained by the market shocks through an asymmetric
effect.


                                               17
         These results imply that the weak leverage effect in BNS's fmding results from

their analysis of aggregated data rather than the individual firm data used here. That is,

aggregated data loses much of the cross-sectional variation in individual firm betas.

Therefore, it is desirable to model conditional variance and beta at the individual firm

level.

         Second, the frequency of data should be emphasized in analyzing time-varying

beta. Asymmetric effects in betas are more apparent in high frequency data (daily data)

than in low frequency data (monthly). It may be another possible reason why BNS does

not have significant asymmetric effects in betas.

         Third, the analysis of both idiosyncratic and market shocks provides a better

understanding of individual stock returns' characteristics. For this purpose, the model

distinguishing these two shocks should be emphasized since the betas of individual stock

returns can be categorized based on the analysis of which shocks dominate the beta

process. Such analysis may give information regarding such things as hedging strategies,

which we have not explored. The different types of time-varying betas of individual

firms suggest that it is useful to form a portfolio for investment based on this information.

For example, a stock whose beta is driven by its own idiosyncrasy can be hedged against

a stock for which market shocks dominate the beta.

         Fourth, the asymmetric effect in variance itself is also found in market returns and

individual stock returns. The volatility of market and individual stock returns increase

with good news and decrease with bad news in the double-beta model with EGARCH

variance. However, this is not a surprising result since this phenomenon has been

addressed in the literature with different model settings. It leads to the implication that



                                              18
there may exists a positive relation between beta and volatility through a leverage

effect'5

       Last, these results address the controversy of "abnormalities of stock returns".

The observed phenomenon of stock return mean reversal is explained by two competing

hypothesis: predictable changes in the expected return in efficient market and stock price

overreaction in inefficient market.

       De Bondt and Thaler (1985) present the evidence of return reversal over long

periods. In particular, stocks that experience poor performance tend to outperform
winners during the subsequent years. They interpret the evidence as a manifestation of

irrational behavior by investors, which they term "overreaction". However, according to

Chan (1988) and Ball and Kothari it is due to systematic changes in expected returns and

expected returns on extreme winners and losers vary substantially follows from

pronounced changes in leverage.         Consistent with the prediction of the leverage
hypothesis, Ball and Kothari report that the betas of extreme losers exceed the betas of

extreme winners in subsequent years. Such a large difference in betas, coupled with

historical risk premiums, can account for substantial differences in realized returns.

       The results of this paper support the efficiency market hypothesis since the betas

change asymmetrically in response to news. BNS support the overreaction hypothesis

based on the result of insignificant asymmetric time-varying beta. However, when

different data of different time frequency is used, the asymmetric effect in beta becomes

significant implying the changes in expected returns, This results seems interesting since

15
   There may exist the asymmetry in beta's speed of adjustment to the news. While the beta
seems to adjust quickly to bad news, its response to good news looks slow. Once the beta
increases, even after the good news, it takes longer to decrease. This tendency can also be found



                                              19
there exists an argument that the systematic changes in return may not happen in the short

run data.



2. Model specification for time-varying beta process



       It is necessary to test for the AR(1) specification in the beta process since stocks

such as Motorola and AT&T may have the leverage effect of market or idiosyncratic

shocks in beta when beta is specified as a different AR order process.

        Motorola had a lot of idiosyncratic shocks during the 1990s. The joint model is

chosen by the LR test. However, contrary to theory the coefficients of the two shocks in

the joint model have a positive sign. The market shocks dominated the AT&T stock

return during the 90s, and as a result, the market model seems a reasonable model

specification for beta. However, in none of the models are any -of the coefficients

significant.

        One interpretation for these results is incorrect specification of AR(l) for beta

since AR(l) terms have such large standard errors. In this case, the incorrect order of

beta's AR leads to incorrect information about other regressors, two shocks Zj,t1 and Zm,t-1.

Another interpretation is the absence of asymmetric effect in beta. In order to evaluate

these two interpretations, the new model for beta with a different order should be

estimated.




in the volatility and seems to be another evidence for a positive relation between betas and
volatilities through the asymmetric effect.

                                   1 and k<co



         For the empirical test, zero order for AR in beta is chosen. The reason we include

no autoregressive term in beta is that this model gives a rough indication of whether

shocks in beta have a leverage effect.'6 If the coefficients of these shocks are negative

and significant, then we see the evidence of an asymmetric effect. The model

specification is transformed to,



         Joint model'    : fl =      +     z,,_1   +    Z,_1                              (8)

         Idiosyncratic model'      fl =      + )E . z_,                                   (9)

         Market model' : fl =a +,%,,,                                                     (10)




Idiosyncratic model' and market model' provide the same tests for joint model' as

idiosyncratic and market models provided for joint model.

         In the case of Motorola, idiosyncratic model' has a significant and negative

coefficient, 2, implying that the beta process is driven by its own idiosyncratic shocks.

This appears reasonable since stock returns of Motorola have a lot of idiosyncrasies.

These results support the first interpretation, that if we fmd the correct order of AR as


16
     However, this specification gives the beta extreme volatility. Considering a beta process is
time-dependent it does not seem to be a realistic model.
" Here rfl,t is the unconditional mean of beta and the OLS estimate was used as its initial value.


                                                   21
specification for beta, then it will have significant asymmetric effect of idiosyncratic

shocks in beta. (See figure 19.) For AT&T, market model' provides evidence to support

the argument since it has significantly negative value of the coefficient of the market

shocks. It is not a surprising result since the stock returns of AT&T were dominated by

market shocks. (See figure 24.) Therefore, these results support the first interpretation of

the leverage effect in beta on the condition that the correct specification for the AR order

of beta is suggested. As a result, Motorola is categorized as idiosyncratic model while

AT&T belongs to market modeL

       However, there seem to be stocks where the asymmetric effect may not be

apparent in betas. Those stocks are categorized into constant beta model. IBM had large,

bad idiosyncratic news, and moved in the opposite direction of the market. Idiosyncratic

model is a reasonable candidate since it has greater log likelihood value than other model

types. However, it has an insignificant AR(l) coefficient and a positive coefficient for

idiosyncratic shocks. It also gives two interpretations as in the case of Motorola and

AT&T above. First, the incorrect specification for the AR order in beta is the reason for

this result. Second, no asymmetric effect can explain the movement of beta over time.

       Those models are estimated for evaluation of these interpretations. If the

coefficient of Zj,t1, the idiosyncratic shock which dominated the stock return of IBM, has

a negative value, then there may be a leverage effect of idiosyncrasy in beta. The

estimation results of joint model' and market model' show the significance of these two

shocks in beta. However, the idiosyncratic shock still has a positive coefficient while the

market shock has a negative coefficient. Therefore, stocks such as IBM seem to support




                                             22
the second interpretation that there may be no leverage effect in betas and we categorize

IBM stock as a constant beta process.



V.     Conclusion



     We investigate whether or not a beta increases with bad news and decreases with

good news, just as does volatility. Focusing on the roles of market and idiosyncratic

shocks, which is ignored in BNS's work, we use daily returns for nine stocks in a double

beta model (Engle and Merzrich (1996)) with EGARCH specifications.

      Contradictory to BNS's results, we show that news asymmetrically affects betas of

individual stocks. It is desirable to model conditional covariances and beta at the

individual firm level. We also fmd that betas depend on two sources of news: market

shocks and idiosyncratic shocks. Some stock betas depend on both while others only

depend on one. It enables us to categorize each stock's beta as one of thee beta

processes. They are the joint model, the idiosyncratic model, and the market model. The

asymmetric effects of news may, in turn, provide the mechanism by which relate the

betas and volatiities positively. Furthermore, these effects are more apparent in high

frequency data (daily data) rather than in low frequency data (monthly data).

      We believe that stock price aggregation in BNS results in a loss of cross sectional

variation and consequently leads to weak results. If the asymmetric effect is more readily

apparent in daily data, then this may again explain BNS's inability to detect asymmetric

effects.




                                            23
     Our fmdings shed light on the controversy of whether abnormalies in stock returns

results from overreaction to information or stems from changes in expected returns in an

efficient market. Finding an asymmetric effect in betas leads us to conclude that

abnormalies can, at least partially, be explained by changes in expected returns through a

change in beta.

      The results may be also useful in other contexts that we have not explored. They

seem to be a potentially useful tool for investigating some hedging strategies since the

property of individual stock returns can be inferred from the analysis of a beta process.

The different types of time-varying betas of individual firms suggest a strategy for

forming a investment. portfolio. For example, a stock whose beta is driven by its own

idiosyncrasy can be hedged with a stock for which market shocks dominate the beta.

Further investigation of this is left for future studies.
