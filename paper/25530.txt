                                         ABSTRACT

There is a consensus that the proportion of suicides committed with a firearm is the best proxy
for gun ownership prevalence. Cerqueira et al. (2108) exploit the socioeconomic characteristics
of suicide victims in order to develop a new and more refined proxy. It is based on the fixed
effects of the victim's place of residence estimated from a discrete choice model for the
likelihood of committing suicide with gun. We empirically assess this new indicator using gun
ownership data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and suicide
registers of the US National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) from 1995 through 2004. We
demonstrate that this new gun proxy provides significant gains in correlation with the percentage
of households with firearms.

1.     Introduction

A number of papers have concluded that the spatial variation of the ratio of suicides
committed with guns to total suicides is the best indirect measure of spatial variation
of the prevalence of gun ownership. For instance, Kleck (2004), Azrael et al. (2004)
and Briggs and Tabarrok (2014) empirically assess an array of measures to
determine which has the highest Pearson’s linear correlation with survey data on the
percentage of households with firearms. They show that the proportion of suicides
committed with firearms is the proxy with the highest correlation.

However, this proxy has some shortcomings. First, because suicides are rare
events, it is not very precise for low-population localities. Second, it ignores the
detailed victim information commonly available in mortality data. To address these
limitations, Cerqueira et al. (2018) exploit the socioeconomic characteristics of
suicide victims in order to come up with a novel proxy for gun ownership. Specifically,
they estimate a discrete choice model for the likelihood of committing suicide with a
firearm controlling for the personal characteristics of the victims as well as fixed
effects. They derive the conditions under which the fixed effects reflect gun
prevalence in the geographic area where the suicides occur. Based on suicide data
from the Brazilian Ministry of Health, Cerqueira et al. (2018) estimate this proxy for
Brazilian micro regions. However, since there are no comprehensive survey data
available with information on gun ownership in Brazil, they were not able to validate
their proxy.

In this paper, we use US data to provide external validation by assessing how their
proxy performs relative to the proportion of suicides committed with firearms. First,
we estimate both indicators across states using mortality data from the US National
Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). We then compare their Pearson’s linear and
Spearman’s rank correlations with the percentage of households with at least one
firearm based on survey data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
(BRFSS) from 1995 to 1998, 2001, 2002, and 2004.

The remainder of this paper is as follows. Section 2 provides the theoretical
justification for the fixed-effects proxy. Section 3 describes the data, Section 4
discusses the main results. Section 5 offers some concluding remarks.




                                                                                     1
                                                                                                 2


2. The panel-based proxy

Denote by 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 the vector of socioeconomic characteristics of the victim of suicide 𝑖𝑖
in the location 𝑗𝑗 (state of residence): age, sex, race, marital status and schooling
level. Suppose that the individual decision of committing suicide depends on
personal characteristics 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 of the victim and on overall quality of life 𝑄𝑄𝑗𝑗 in location 𝑗𝑗.
Suppose also that the prevalence of firearms in location 𝑗𝑗, 𝐺𝐺𝑗𝑗 , depends not only on
population composition (𝑋𝑋𝑗𝑗 = ∑𝑖𝑖 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ), but also on the quality of life of location 𝑗𝑗, 𝑄𝑄𝑗𝑗 ,
which includes aggregate exposure to violence among other social stressors. These
assumptions imply that the individual decision to commit suicide depends both on
𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 and 𝑄𝑄𝑗𝑗 :

Pr(𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝐺𝐺𝑗𝑗 |𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝑄𝑄𝑗𝑗 ) = Pr(𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 |𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝑄𝑄𝑗𝑗 )Pr(𝐺𝐺𝑗𝑗 |𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝑄𝑄𝑗𝑗 ),        (1)

where 𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 1 if individual 𝑖𝑖 in location 𝑗𝑗 decides to commit suicide and zero
otherwise.

Similarly, 𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝐺𝐺 = 1 if victim 𝑖𝑖 in location 𝑗𝑗 commits suicide using a gun, and equals zero
otherwise. Suppose that quality of life affects the decision to commit suicide with a
weapon only through the decisions of committing suicide and possessing a weapon:


Pr(𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝐺𝐺 |𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 1, 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝐺𝐺𝑗𝑗 , 𝑄𝑄𝑗𝑗 ) = Pr�𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝐺𝐺 �𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 1, 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝐺𝐺𝑗𝑗 �,    (2)


Thus, if we estimate the probability in equation (2) using suicide micro data, we can
             �𝑗𝑗 from the location fixed effects - that is, the estimated coefficients of
then obtain 𝐺𝐺
the location dummy variables.

To estimate equation (2), we use a logit specification:


                                                                  𝐽𝐽
                                                exp(𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝛽𝛽+∑𝑗𝑗=1 𝐺𝐺𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 )
Pr�𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝐺𝐺 �𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖   = 1, 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , 𝐺𝐺𝑗𝑗 � =                           𝐽𝐽              ,       (3)
                                               1+exp(𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝛽𝛽+∑𝑗𝑗=1 𝐺𝐺𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 )




where: 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 1 if victim 𝑖𝑖 belongs to the location 𝑗𝑗 (with 𝑗𝑗 = 1, … , 𝐽𝐽), and equals zero
otherwise.




                                                                                                 2
                                                                                         3


We estimate Equation (3) using a maximum likelihood estimator and the resulting
             �𝑗𝑗 are the location fixed effects that will proxy firearm prevalence for
coefficients 𝐺𝐺
each location.

In short, the new proxy are the fixed effects of the victims' place of residence
estimated from a discrete model of suicide committed with a gun probability
controlling by victim demographic characteristics. For instance, teenagers are less
likely than adult male to use gun to commit suicide. A large proportion of teenagers
using a gun to commit suicide in a specific location would indicate a wider gun
availability in this location. The idea is that this anomaly should be captured by this
location fixed effect. This proxy will reflect well the spatial variation of gun prevalence
if the decision of using a gun to commit suicide conditional on the decision of
committing suicide does not depend on any aggregate factor that varies only across
location other than gun prevalence. This means that quality of life may affect the
number of suicides with a gun only through the decision of taking his/her own life
(and possibly through gun prevalence).

The presence of many locations with insignificant estimated fixed effects may distort
the ranking of locations by prevalence of firearms. Thus, we also estimate the
location fixed effects in equation (3) using a regularization technique that combines
estimation with automatic parameter selection. In particular, we restrict the objective
function to a sum of the absolute values of the fixed effects coefficients, as in
Tibshirani’s (1996) least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). This
constraint has little impact if the parameter is large enough, but may shrink some
coefficient estimates to zero if they do not contribute enough to the goodness-of-fit.
By forcing the coefficient estimates towards zero, Lasso selects the most relevant
subset of regressors. The objective function reads:


𝑙𝑙𝜆𝜆 (𝛽𝛽, 𝐺𝐺) = −𝑙𝑙(𝛽𝛽, 𝐺𝐺) + 𝜆𝜆 ∑𝐽𝐽𝑗𝑗=1 𝑤𝑤𝑗𝑗 |𝐺𝐺𝑗𝑗 | ,                                (4)

where 𝑙𝑙𝜆𝜆 (𝛽𝛽, 𝐺𝐺) is the logit maximum likelihood function.

Note that equation (4) coincides with the objective function of the logit estimator for
the case where 𝑤𝑤𝑗𝑗 = 0 for each 𝑗𝑗 = 1, … , 𝐽𝐽. Standard LASSO regularization works
with uniform weights (𝑤𝑤𝑗𝑗 = 1 para 𝑗𝑗 = 1, … , 𝐽𝐽), while the adaptive penalty
(adaLASSO) of Zou (2006) adopts |𝐺𝐺  �𝚥𝚥 |
                                           −𝜏𝜏                  �𝑗𝑗 denotes a consistent
                                               where 𝜏𝜏 > 0 and 𝐺𝐺
estimate of any initial 𝐺𝐺𝑗𝑗 . We calculate these weights with the standard logit estimator
   �𝑗𝑗 and fix 𝜏𝜏 = 1 in the same way as Zou (2006). As in Tibshirani (1996) and Zou
of 𝐺𝐺
(2006), we tune the choice of the shrinkage parameter by means of a cross-
validation approach that minimizes the mean square error.

                                                                                         3
                                                                                                    4


In sum, we estimate location fixed effects using: standard logit, LASSO and
adaLASSO estimators.



3. Data description

We employ data from the US National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). It
provides information about each suicide victim’s state of residence, age, gender,
ethnicity, marital status, and years of schooling.

The reference measure of gun ownership prevalence is the percentage of
households with at least one firearm, is based on the following Behavioral Risk
Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) surveys question: “Are any firearms now kept
in or around your home? Include those kept in a garage, outdoor storage area, car,
truck, or other motor vehicle”. Answers are: “yes”, “no”, “don't know/not sure” and
“refused”. In the estimation, we exclude the observations with answer “don't
know/not sure,” “refused,” or missing.

We only use data that are readily available for download. We collect information from
the US Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) website, which is only
available from 1995 to 1998, 2001, 2002 and 2004. Even in these years there are
states that do not collect this information or restrict the access to it. Table 1 shows
that from 1995 through 1998, there are few states per year in which we can access
this information. Thus, we combined the information of these years, giving priority to
more recent years. For instance, we only use New Jersey data for 1998, even though
we can access this data for 1995 and 1997, as well.

In order to estimate the proxies, we build a database of suicide victims excluding any
observation that violates any of these conditions: (a) age below 101 years old; (b)
state that reports education of suicide victims 3; (c) state with accessible information
on firearm ownership from the BFRSS (see Table 1).

Table 2 summarizes the number of suicide victims across the US states in our
sample. The huge dispersion reflects the immense difference in population size
across states. Approximately 53% of the victims committed suicide with a gun. Table
3 describes the distribution of personal characteristics of the suicide victims in our
sample. The vast majority of victims are male: about 80% in the overall sample and
87% of suicides using a gun. The average age of suicide victims is 44.4 in the 1995-

3
 Only the state of Georgia does not report education of the victims in 2001 and 2002. In 2004, 12
out of 51 states do not report education: Rhode Island, Washington, Wyoming, Oklahoma, New
York, New Jersey, New Hampshire, Montana, Michigan, Idaho, California and Georgia.

                                                                                                    4
                                                                                      5


1998 sample and increases one year if using a gun. In the 2000s, the average age
of suicide is 45.7 (total) and 48.3 if committed with a gun. One reason for this
difference is that the 1995-1998 sample contains suicide victims from only 21 US
states, so they may have a different social demographic composition from the US as
a whole. The victims in these 21 states are not only younger, but also more likely to
be single and with less than high school education. In all samples, more than 43%
are married, and this percentage decreases if using a gun. The fraction of white
victims is about 91%, and slightly higher if using a gun. Those who commit suicide
using a gun have slightly less years of education.


4. Validation

Tables 4 displays the coefficient estimates of the panel logit model for the probability
of using a gun to commit suicide. Apart from state fixed effects, we control for age,
age squared, and several dummy variables relating to categorical features: ethnicity,
gender, marital status, and years of schooling.

The probability of using a gun to commit suicide decreases with age. Males, blacks,
and married victims are more likely to use a gun to commit suicide. The pattern for
education is less clear, but it seems that those with high school degrees are more
likely to use firearms than those with college degree or less than a high school
degree.

Tables 5 to 9 display for the years 1995-1998, 2001, 2002 and 2004, the percentage
of households with a firearm ('Reference'), the proportion of suicides committed with
a gun ('SG'), and the new proxies based on the standard Logit, LASSO and
adaLASSO estimates of state fixed effects. These tables readily confirm that these
new indicators rank the states by prevalence of gun ownership better than the prior
proxy based on the proportion of suicides committed with a gun. Using the
information from Tables 5 to 8, we assess how much we increase the correlation
with the reference measure using one of these new proxies instead of the proportion
of suicides committed with a gun. Table 9 reports Pearson's linear and Spearman's
rank correlations between these proxies with the reference measure.

As expected, the proportion of suicides committed with a gun strongly correlates with
the reference measure, but the new proxies are even more correlated in every
subsample we consider. Note also that these new proxies all perform equally well,
exhibiting very similar correlations with the reference measure. This suggests that
neither the presence of insignificant state fixed effects nor the choice of the
regularization method greatly affects the correlation with the reference measure.



                                                                                      5
                                                                                      6


The average value of the linear correlations with the reference measure is equal to
0.83 for the proportion of suicides with a gun and 0.86 for the proxies based on state
fixed effects (Logit, LASSO and adaLASSO). Regarding Spearman’s rank
correlation, these values are 0.75 and 0.80, respectively. These results demonstrate
that conditioning on personal characteristics brings about significant gains in terms
of correlation with the benchmark with respect to the best indirect indicator in the
literature.


5. Conclusion

We empirically evaluate the new indicator of gun prevalence of Cerqueira et al.
(2018) and demonstrate that it correlates with the percentage of households with
firearms more than the prevailing proxy based on the proportion of suicides
committed with a firearm.

Unlike the proportion of suicides with a gun, the new proxy is a relative measure
since it is based on the fixed effects of the victim's place of residence estimated from
a discrete model of suicide probability. Thus, any variation of the proxy values
between a locality at different time points or from two different localities can only be
interpreted as a variation of gun prevalence if jointly estimated.

In future research, we aim to assess the performance of the new proxy in capturing
inter-temporal variation of gun ownership. This validity check would be important
because there exists no consensus in the literature that the proportion of suicides
committed with a gun (or any other proxy) would be a valid indicator of trends in gun
levels (see Kleck, 2004 and Azrael et al., 2004). We also aim to evaluate its
performance across localities with small numbers of suicides. Our plan is to access
restricted data from US General Social Surveys (GSS) and US National Center for
Health Statistics (NCHS) in order to build a county panel data for a large span of
time.

                         Gun prevalence across states - 1995-1998.
We report the percentage of households with firearm ('Reference') by state extracted based on
data of Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, years 1995-1998. We proxy for gun prevalence
across states using the proportion of suicides committed with a gun ('SG') or the standard LOGIT,
LASSO and adaLASSO estimates of the state based on suicide data of US Center for Health Statistics
(NCHS), 1995-1998. The numbers beside of each measure refer to the corresponding ranking of
gun prevalence.

                               Gun prevalence across states - 2001.
We report the percentage of households with firearm ('Reference') by state, based on data of
Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, year 2001. We proxy for gun prevalence across states
using the proportion of suicides committed with a gun ('SG') or the standard LOGIT, LASSO and
adaLASSO estimates of the state based on suicide data of US Center for Health Statistics (NCHS),
2001. The numbers beside of each measure refer to the corresponding ranking of gun prevalence.

                               Gun prevalence across states - 2004.
We report the percentage of households with firearm ('Reference') by state, based on data of
Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, year 2004. We proxy for gun prevalence across states
using the proportion of suicides committed with a gun ('SG') or the standard LOGIT, LASSO and
adaLASSO estimates of the state based on suicide data of US Center for Health Statistics (NCHS),
2004. The numbers beside each measure refer to the corresponding ranking of gun prevalence.

             Proxies correlations with the percentage of households with a firearm
We report Pearson's linear and Spearman's rank correlations between the percentage of
households with firearm and four different proxies of gun prevalence. The percentage of
households with firearm is based on data of Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 1995,
1996, 1997, 1998, 2001, 2002 and 2004. We proxy for gun prevalence across states using the
