                                          ABSTRACT

In this paper we analyze the impact of an increase in the local supply of immigrants on firms’
outcomes, allowing for heterogeneous effects across firms according to their initial productivity.
Using micro-level data on French manufacturing firms spanning the period 1995-2005, we show
that a supply-driven increase in the share of foreign-born workers in a French department (a small
geographic area) increased the total factor productivity of firms in that department. Immigrants
were prevalently highly educated and this effect is consistent with a positive complementarity and
spillover effects from their skills. We also find this effect to be significantly stronger for firms
with low initial productivity and small size. The positive productivity effect of immigrants was
also associated with faster growth of capital, larger exports and higher wages for natives. Highly
skilled natives were pushed towards firms that did not hire too many immigrants spreading
positive productivity effects to those firms too. Because of stronger effects on smaller and
initially less productive firms, the aggregate effects of immigrants at the department level on
average productivity and employment was small.

1     Introduction

This paper estimates the effect of immigration on firm-level productivity, capital investments, employment and

exports using French firm data in the period 1995-2005. We also analyze how these effects where different across

firms depending on their initial productivity and size and how immigration affected employment flows of natives

across firms and firm creation and destruction. Recent papers have found indirect evidence that immigrants

benefits firms’ productivity. Specialization of natives and immigrants in different and complementary tasks (Peri

and Sparber, 2009) may increase production efficiency and labor productivity at the local level. Highly skilled

foreign individuals, especially those in science and technology fields, contribute to innovation and increase the

productivity of a region or a city (Kerr and Lincoln, 2010, Peri et al, 2015). There is, however, scant direct

evidence of the impact of immigrants on firms’ productivity and employment due to limited data availability

and identification issues at the firm level. When analyzing the impact of immigration at the firm level, one has

to account for the heterogeneity that drives differences in firm-specific responses to a local change in immigrant

supply. Thus, simply analyzing the correlation between immigrant workers’ share and performance of firms is

likely to be uninformative of the effect of the first on the second.

    New data on French manufacturing firms and an identification strategy based on country-of-origin-driven

variation in the supply of immigrants across geographic areas (French Departments) allow us to focus on firm-

specific effects of an increase in immigrants. In particular, with our data, we can construct multiple outcomes

at the firm level in a panel of individual firms that can be followed over time.1 Merging them with Census data

we can also construct an instrument for the local change in supply of immigrants using a shift-share method

based on the pre-existing immigrants’ location at the level of a French ”départments” (local areas) interacted

with changes in the aggregate inflows of immigrants by country of origin. The increased immigration from the

European Union during the decade, driven by introduction of free mobility in 1992, provide an interesting event

to study. Our identification method is not new, as it builds on a traditional instrument proposed by Altonji and

Card (1991) and then Card (2001). However, the increased immigrant flows post 1992 and validity checks that

we perform to ensure that such an instrument is uncorrelated with pre-1992 economic conditions and trends

across French Departments, put our application on reasonably solid ground. We also control for several time-

varying, firm-level characteristics, and for firm fixed effects to reduce the concerns of lingering endogeneity and

omitted variable bias.

    Firm-level data allow us to analyze the effect of immigration in the context of firms with heterogeneous

initial productivity. We ask the crucial question whether immigration has a different impact on the initially

more productive or on the less productive firms. Hence, we estimate a response to immigrants that can depend
   1 Because of data unavailability for firms’ TFP and value added in 1995, our estimation sample is restricted to the period

1996-2005. See the data section for more details.

on firm’s initial productivity (which is highly correlated with its size and probability of exporting). If the

inflow of immigrants helps firms that are initially less productive, it can also help native workers in those firms,

preventing job destruction and encouraging growth. This would appear as aggregate complementarity with

native workers (as in Ottaviano and Peri, 2012). In this case immigration would be beneficial in particular for

firms lagging behind in the productivity distribution. The importance of studying the heterogeneous effect of

immigration across firms’ characteristics is supported by firm-level stylized facts showing that not all French

firms employed immigrant workers as of 1995, and that the share of immigrants hired exhibits a large variation

across firms and is correlated with the variation of other firm characteristics (see section 3.2).

   We also document that, based on aggregate statistics relative to their occupational distribution, the net

immigrant inflow in France during the 1995-2005 period was skill-intensive (see section 3.2). The employment

of foreign-born workers increased significantly more in occupations with high cognitive and analytical content

than in those with high manual content. The share of immigrants with a high school diploma (or lower)

decreased over that period from 74% in 1995 to 58% in 2005, while those with more than a 3-year university

diploma grew in percentage from 9% to 14% of the foreign population. Moreover, from Labor Force Survey

data we know that the share of immigrants in the group of tertiary educated increased from 5.7% to 7.1% over

the period 1995-2005. Hence their net inflow had a relatively larger share of college educated than in the native

population. As mentioned above, the increase in immigrants was mainly driven by EU citizens and a large share

of those was college educated. The findings of this paper should be interpreted as documenting the effects of

high-skilled immigrants on outcomes of manufacturing firms.

   This paper introduces two main novelties with respect to the existing literature. First, we focus on firm-level

outcomes and we only exploit within-firm variation when assessing the impact of a variation of immigration

supply in the local labor market on these outcomes. Second, we allow heterogeneity in initial firm productivity

to affect the response to immigration and we interact the local supply change in immigrants with the initial

productivity of firms to estimate the consequences of such heterogeneity (we also consider firms’ size and

immigrant share as proxies for initial productivity).

   We first show that a supply-driven increase in immigrants in an area pushes the average firm to hire im-

migrants. This is quite reasonable as larger supply of immigrants in the area will drive larger employment of

immigrants. Interestingly, such an effect is stronger for the subset of firms that initially had low productivity

levels. These firms were more likely to start hiring immigrants and hired more of them in the considered period.

Then we show that firms with low initial productivity also experienced the largest positive productivity effects

associated with immigration in the area. We also explore whether other outcomes, related to the productivity of

firms, such as exit, domestic market share, export and capital investments were affected by hiring immigrants.

We identify significant positive effects on exports and on the level of capital used by firms. Even for these



                                                         3
outcomes, in most cases the strongest effect is for firms starting with low levels of productivity and low share

of immigrants. These additional results are consistent with the idea that the productivity gains may be in part

driven by skill-capital and skill-technology complementarities within the firm that hired immigrants. We find no

evidence of a decline in native wages as a consequence of hiring immigrants. Rather, as a consequence of higher

productivity, native wages increased in the department. Interestingly, the composition of native workers across

firms also changed as a consequence of immigration. Highly educated native workers were pushed into firms

hiring fewer immigrants and contributed to increasing their wages. New immigrants had a small but significant

effect in reducing firm exit and seem to increase the size of small firms relative to large firms. These differential

effects and reallocation across firms imply a small aggregate effect at the department level as immigration spurs

convergence of productivity and of the size of firms by stimulating small, initially less productive firms more than

larger and initially more productive ones. Differently from a homogeneous effect on all firms, the heterogeneous

firm-level effects aggregate to a modest regional effect.

    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 puts this paper in the context of the existing literature

and introduces a simple framework to discuss the channels explored in the empirical analysis. Section 3 presents

the data and stylized facts. Section 4 discusses the empirical specifications and the identification strategy and its

limitations. Section 5 describes and comments on the estimates of the effects of immigration on firm outcomes.

Section 6 concludes the paper.



2     Framework and Literature Review

There is an abundance of studies on the effect of immigrants on the labor market outcomes of natives. These

studies analyze immigration at the national level (e.g. Borjas 2003, Borjas and Katz 2007, Ottaviano and

Peri 2012) or at the local level (such as Card 2001, 2009), and they use data from several different countries2

(see also the literature reviews by Longhi et al (2005), Kerr and Kerr (2011) and Lewis and Peri (2015)).

Much less is known, however, about the firm-level effects of immigrants or about the inter-firm adjustments

triggered by immigrants. This is in part due to the easier availability of labor market data (from census

and population surveys) rather than firm-level data including information on the place of birth of individuals.

Recently, aggregate studies suggest interesting mechanisms through which immigrants may be absorbed within

firms, such as adjusting the task specialization of workers (Peri and Sparber 2009; Ottaviano, Peri and Wright

2013), modifying the adopted production techniques (e.g. Lewis 2011), promoting accumulation of physical
   2 Some countries such as Germany (De New and Zimmermann 1994) and the UK (Dustmann, Fabbri and Preston 2005) are

particularly well studied. Recent papers study the labor market effect of migration by using individual level data from country-
specific surveys. Edo and Toubal (2015), using individual level data for France, find that immigration decreases the wage of highly
educated native workers by about 1% and contributes to an increase in the wage of low-skilled workers by 0.5%. Cohen-Goldner
and Paserman (2011), using individual-level data for Israel, find a 10% increase in the share of immigrants decreases native wages
by 1 to 3% in the short run, and has no effect in the medium-long run.




                                                                4
capital or expanding the number of establishments (Olney, 2013).

   Only very recent studies have used firm-level data to study the effects of immigration. Malchow-Moller,

Munch and Skaksen (2012), using data from Danish firms, find that immigrants substitute for natives within

individual firms. Martins, Piracha and Varejao (2012) using Portuguese data find no effect of immigrants on

the employment of natives at the firm level. These studies focus only on the wage and employment effects of

immigrants and hence they extend the classical labor approach to firm-level data. Hatzigeorgiou and Lodefalk

(2016) and Hiller (2013) consider more specific firm-level outcomes. They analyze the effect of immigrants on

firm-level exports, relying on a reduced-form empirical specification that correlates firm-immigrants and firm

exports. Ghosh et al. (2014) and Doran et al. (2014) study the effect of a reduction in the annual H-1B

cap (skilled immigrant visas) in the US on firm-specific outcomes (i.e. innovation, productivity, revenues and

profits). The first paper analyzes the impact of restricting the H-1B number on the outcome of all large US

firms, the second uses a smaller sample but exploits the randomness of a lottery allocation of . Ghosh et al.

(2014) find a significant reduction in size and productivity for firms that heavily depend on foreign H-1B workers

following the enforcement of a lower H-1B quota. The second paper does not find any impact on innovation

at the firm level from hiring fewer H-1B employees. Let us emphasize that an important difference between

our study and those using visa growth in the US is the free mobility of EU workers that constituted the bulk

of new foreign-born individuals in our sample. In the US, firms previously hiring workers are at a relative

advantage for hiring more, when the quota increases, as they are familiar with laws and procedures. In France,

EU citizens were easily available to firms, when barrier to mobility were removed. This fact may contribute to

the explanation of the finding that less productive firms hired more immigrants during the considered period

and it is an important difference between our analysis and the research on visa workers.

   Our analysis is focused on the impact of immigrants on firm-specific outcomes. We aim at first quantifying

the effect of an exogenous increase of immigrants in a labor market on firms’ productivity (and on other

productivity related firms’ outcomes). Then we also study whether the effect of immigration is heterogeneous

across firms with different levels of initial productivity (or initial size). Finally we analyze other margins of

adjustment, such as firm exit and native mobility and selection across firms in response to local immigration.

While the change in immigrant workers’ availability pertains to the local labor market, different firms may

respond differently to it and important outcomes such as productivity, capital investments and exports may be

affected. Recent studies (e.g. Peri 2011, Peri and Sparber 2009) suggest immigrants are often concentrated in

specific jobs and in specific production tasks. Different firms may be subject to productivity gains according

to their exposure to these jobs and their internal organization of productive tasks. More recently, Peri et al.

(2015) have emphasized that highly skilled immigrants in STEM jobs may increase productivity of US cities,

especially for college educated workers. Brunow et al (2015) began to analyze the correlation between cultural



                                                        5
diversity of workplace (as diversification of foreign employees in the firm) and firm productivity. A recent paper

by Haas and Lucht (2013) uses a general equilibrium model with heterogeneous firms (as in Melitz 2003) where

migrants imperfectly substitute for native workers and firms differ in their productivity levels and it shows, via

simulation results, that firm productivity increases with the immigrants’ share in the firm.

   To capture the variety of channels through which immigration may affect productivity and natives’ wages in

heterogeneous firms we consider the production function of a generic firm i within a labor market. We indicate
            F
with s =   N +F   the share of foreign-born workers in that labor market, where N and F indicate the employment

of natives and foreign-born respectively. Firms can adjust their technology and efficiency responding to the

native/immigrant composition of the labor force so that firm-specific productivity may depend on (s), via

externalities. The presence of more immigrants may also increase the number of foreign workers hired by the

firm (fi ), and it may also generate productivity gains (through specialization, complementarity and optimal

task allocation) that may vary across firms. We allow for immigrants and natives to be imperfect substitutes

in a CES production function (as in Ottaviano and Peri 2012, or Docquier, Ozden and Peri 2014) and we allow

firms to benefit from migrant’s externalities within the region. We represent this using the following production

function for firm i :


                                                         σ−1              σ−1   σ
                                        Yi = Ai (s)(βfi   σ
                                                               + (1 − β)ni σ ) σ−1                            (1)


In equation (1) we are assuming that hired immigrants fi and natives ni are combined into output (Yi ) with an

elasticity of substitution equal to σ > 1 so that the productivity of native workers may depend on immigrants

through complementarities. Immigrants have a specific productivity β that may differ from that of natives

(1 − β). The productivity of the firm also depends, however, on the proportion of immigrants in the local labor

market, s, through skill spillovers and externalities. While the CES component allows a positive wage and labor

productivity effect of immigrants on natives within the firm through complementarity, the productivity effect

may extend to the whole area either because of skill externalities (Docquier et al, 2014), technology adoption

(Lewis 2013) or efficiency reasons (Peri 2012) and it may vary across firms (hence the subscript i). Dividing

equation (1) by (ni + fi ) implies that output per worker, yi , and hence labor productivity of firm i, depends on

the share of immigrants in the firm, s    i   and in the region s as follows:


                                         Yi               σ−1                   σ−1   σ
                               yi =            = Ai (s)(βsi σ + (1 − β)(1 − si ) σ ) σ−1                      (2)
                                      ni + f i

The first term, Ai (s) captures the effect of the share of immigrants, through potential externalities, on the

productivity of firm i. The intensity of this externality can be different across firms. The second term, in

brackets, captures the within-firm complementarity effect between immigrants and natives. It impacts the



                                                               6
average labor productivity of a firm and it has an internal maximum (between 0 and 1) which is a value of si

corresponding to the “optimal” combination of immigrants and natives. This optimum is larger the larger is β,

the relative productivity of immigrants. For equal productivity of immigrants and natives, (β = 0.5) the second

term is maximized at si = 0.5. Hence, for similar productivity of immigrants and natives, an increase in the

share of immigrants in the firm will likely increase labor productivity in a firm through this channel at levels of

si smaller than 0.5 which is the case for most of the considered firms. At higher value of si the contribution of

that term can become negligible or even negative.3

   The average productivity effect of immigrants in a local labor market (in our case a French department) will

be the weighted average productivity of each firm, yi , with weights equal to the size of firms in terms of workers
       ni +fi
xi =   N +F .   Hence:


                                                     X                     X
                                              y=              x i yi =              xi (s)yi (s)                                      (3)
                                                   i∈F irms              i∈F irms

The notation above emphasizes that not just the productivity of individual firms, yi but their relative size, xi (s),

can be affected by the percentage of immigrants in the local labor market. Both the productivity and the size

of a firm may vary in response to changes in the local share of immigrants in different ways. Individual firms

hiring more immigrants may benefit from their internal complementarity with natives, or from externalities due

to spillovers effects. Firm creation and destruction (entry and exit) can also be induced by the presence of

immigrants. The reallocation of natives may also affect relative size of firms.

   Influential models of international trade (such as Melitz 2003, Bernard et al. 2003) have emphasized that

the opening to international market competition produces a selection of firms and affects the creation and

destruction of those. Opening to trade will affect firms differently depending on their initial productivity. The

local inflow of immigrants can also generate differential productivity effects across firms that may depend on

their initial productivity, specialization and hiring of immigrants. Hence equation (3) allows for possible effects

of immigrants on firm size (and on firm survival) that may vary across the initial distribution of firms.

   Our empirical analysis investigates, first, equation (2) at the firm level. In particular, we analyze how a

change in the local share of immigrants over time affects the productivity of firms, allowing different effects

along the initial productivity distribution. In particular, considering the variation over time of a linear version

of equation (2) we can write:



                                                       ∆yi = yia ∆s + yib ∆si                                                         (4)
                                                                                                   1    σ−1                   σ−1      1
  3 The   wage of native workers in firm i is given by the following expression wni = Ai (s)(1−s)− σ (βsiσ
                                                                                                              +(1−β)(1−si )    σ    ) σ−1 .
                          1
The extra-term (1 − s)    shows how the complementarity between immigrant and native workers affects native wages positively
                         −σ

and more strongly than average productivity in the firm.




                                                                     7
In (4) the operator ∆ captures the change over time. The term yia ∆s captures the firm-specific change triggered

by a change in the share of local immigrants, due to externalities and the term yib ∆si captures the change

in productivity in a firm due to increased share of its own immigrant workforce, due to complementarity.

Hence yia and yib are partial derivatives of firm productivity with respect to the immigrant externality and

complementarity effect, respectively. We are interested in analyzing how the effects vary depending on firm’s

initial heterogeneity. What expression (4) makes also clear is that even firms not directly hiring immigrants

may be affected by their inflow in the local economy as their productivity may depend on s through local

externalities, as shown in the first term yia ∆s. To analyze the heterogeneous productivity effects we will use

different measures and proxies of initial productivity levels (initial TFP, initial size, initial share of immigrants)

interacted with the change in local labor markets’ immigrant shares .

   The estimated impact of immigrants on individual firm productivity is only part of the total effect immi-

gration can have on average local productivity. Besides affecting the productivity of existing firms increases

in immigration can change their relative size, by pushing labor towards or away from firms that hire more

immigrants. By changing the competition environment it may also affect the creation/destruction of firms and

the selection of natives among them. Hence, decomposing the effect of a change in s on the average local area

productivity expressed by (3), gives the following equation:


                          X                                 X                               X

                        i∈∆F irms                         i∈F irms                        i∈F irms

The decomposition emphasizes that there are three potential channels affecting the local productivity effect of

immigrants. Beginning from the third term we will analyze how the change in immigrant share in a labor market

area affects individual firm productivity and how this effect differs across firms (as illustrated by equation 4); this

is the focus of our firm-level analysis which studies productivity effects allowing different forms of heterogeneity.

Then, the first term on the right hand side of equation (5), captures the effect on creation and destruction

of firms (∆F irms) due to an increase in s. Immigration can change the firm landscape by helping new firm

creation or affecting survival of existing firms. We will also analyze in detail the impact of immigrants on

these two margins. Finally the second term in equation (5) captures the effect of immigration in reallocating

workers across existing firms, through changing the relative size of firms, (∆xi ). Depending on whether firms

use technologies that complement immigrant skills more or less intensely, some may grow while others may

shrink in response to immigrants. By capturing the change in relative size of firms this term suggests that

also the selection of native workers (e.g. by skills) across firms may change and we will analyze this source of

heterogeneity and potential spillovers.

   The main goal of this paper is identifying an exogenous shock related to the inflow of foreign born workers

and analyzing the average and the differential impact on firm productivity, on firm creation, destruction and


                                                                8
on the reallocation of native workers across firms. The framework above acknowledges the existence of several

potential channels through which immigration can impact productivity and hence local employment/wages

within and across firms. We also analyze the impact on size, capital investment and exports that are important

outcomes at the firm level, and are related to their productivity performance. This framework is much richer

than the one used traditionally to analyze the labor market effect of immigrants which constraints many of the

above effects to be zero and only analyzes aggregate impact on employment and wages.



3     Data and stylized facts

3.1     Sources and summary statistics

Let us begin with a description of the data and some important stylized facts. In constructing firm-level variables

we merged several data sources. First, the Declaration Annuelle des Donnetes Sociales (DADS) database consists

of administrative files based on mandatory reports on employees’ earnings and characteristics. DADS data

contain yearly information about the structure of employment for each establishment in France.4 Each single

observation in this dataset corresponds to a unique establishment-year combination. At the establishment

level, DADS provides information on geographic location and industry, as well as the identification number

for the establishment (SIRET) and the parent enterprise (SIREN). In terms of employee characteristics, we

have information on the gender, age, place of birth (native vs. foreigners), total yearly gross and net earnings,

number of hours worked and occupation (both at two-digit CS and four-digit PCS-ESE classification), but not

educational attainment. Individual employees are not linked across years, but establishments are, hence, we can

construct the characteristics of the average employees in a firm (SIREN) for each year.

    To construct the variables on firm outcomes we also use two additional data sources that cover the whole

manufacturing sector. The trade variables used are from the Custom dataset, which provides records of all the

French firms exporting goods during the 1995-2005 period. Exports – quantified in tons and valued in Euros

– are available by firm, year, product (identified by an 8 digit code corresponding to the NC8 nomenclature)

and the country of destination.5 The other source we use is the Annual Business survey (EAE). It gives us

balance-sheet data information (e.g. value added, sales, value of the assets included in the capital stock, use of

intermediate goods) necessary to compute domestic market share, capital and total factor productivity. EAE

data are available for firms with more than 20 employees over the period 1995-2007. Matching all these sources

together, using the SIREN identification number, we obtain an unbalanced panel dataset of firms over the 1995-
   4 This database includes different units organized by year and region (12 years, 24 regions) which implies 288 separate databases

with more than 50 million observations per year were merged.
   5 For the number of products exported one needs to account for the fact that the product nomenclature changes over time during

the period considered. To avoid the problem of mistaking a change in code for a change in product we harmonized the product
nomenclature in the dataset, expressing all export and imports at the HS6 1996 revision.




                                                                 9
2005 period.6 However, some of the variables needed to compute the TFP measure have missing information

in 1995; for this reason our estimation sample in tables 5-12 (and A3-A9) is restricted to the period 1996-2005.

See appendix section A1 for further details on data coverage. Finally, the data about the immigrant and native

populations in each department each year are from (department-year) aggregation of DADS individual data.

Thus, we obtain the total number of immigrant and native workers in the department in year t. The share of

immigrants across departments in 1990 (used to build our instrument) come from INSEE Population Census.

The summary statistics of the outcome variables and of the share of foreign-born at the firm level are reported

in Table 1.


3.2     Immigrants Skills and Firm heterogeneity

During the 1995-2005 period, the net inflow of immigrants in France was highly skilled and unevenly distributed

across departments. We do not have information on the education of workers in the DADS data, so in or-

der to characterize the skill content of French immigration in the 1995-2005 we rely on the complexity and

communication-intensity of the tasks performed by workers (we follow Peri and Sparber (2009) and focus on

the dichotomy between communication and manual tasks to classify jobs along the communication-intensity

spectrum). To do so we combine measures from the O*NET database that associate the intensity of several

skills to each occupation in the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) - cross-walking this classification

with the occupational structure provided by the DADS.7 First, table 2 shows that immigrant inflow between

1995 and 2005 was much larger among the high-complexity than the low-complexity group of occupations.

The table shows the top 10 occupations by complexity index increased the percentage of immigrants in total

hours worked by 9.7 percentage points, while the share of hours worked by immigrants among low complexity

occupations increased only 2.6 percentage points (p.p.). Similarly, distinguishing production (blue collar) and

non-production (white collar) manufacturing workers, the first group’s share of immigrants increased by only 2.5

p.p. during the 1995-2005 period, while the second group increased by 9.3 p.p. Figure 1 shows the percentage

composition of immigrants in France (from the IEB dataset) from 1980 to 2010 by schooling degree. The largest

group is primary-educated immigrants, but their share has been declining fast, especially over the past 15 years.

Immigration of college-educated people, however, has been increasing rapidly (the top share in the bar chart).

Finally, over the 1995-2005 period, the share of immigrants with a high school diploma (or lower) decreased from

74% in 1995 to 58% in 2005. The share of immigrants with at least a three-year university diploma went from
   6 A standard concern in firm-level (unbalanced) panels is we observe only surviving firms. In our framework, the arrival of new

immigrants in the department might change the toughness of competition among firms in the same area, implying a survivor bias
in our estimation. To check for this potential bias, we re-estimate all our regressions on a balanced dataset including firms which
are present over the entire period. Results do not change. As a sample of this robustness check, in table A6 we show results on
TFP using a balanced database.

                                                                10
9% in 1995 to 14% in 20058 . Using Labor Force Survey data we could also compute the share of immigrants

(over total population) by education attainment. The share of immigrants in the group of tertiary educated

population increased from 5.7% to 7.1% over the period 1995-2005. Differently, the share of immigrants in the

group of unskilled population (with less than 3-year university diploma) decreased by 1 percentage point (from

6.7% to 5.6%). Overall, it is fair to characterize the net flow of immigrants into French manufacturing during

the 1995-2005 period as skill-intensive.

    A second interesting feature of the inflow of immigrants in France is their very uneven cross-regional dis-

tribution. First, the considered period is one of a significant increase in the foreign-born population in France

(from about 6% of the population in 1995 to 12% in 2005). Second, different regions had very different exposure

to immigrants. Some regions (such as Champagne-Ardenne and Lorraine) maintained a low exposure to immi-

gration over the entire period; other regions experienced increasing exposure to immigrants over time. As an

example, the population percentage of immigrants in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region increased from 6.3 points

in 1995 to 16 points in 2005 (with an average yearly growth rate by 25%). Other regions simply increased the

already-high share of immigrants over the same period. For example, in 1995 the Ile-de-France and Rhone-Alpes

regions already had relatively large immigrant shares of 10% and 9.6%, respectively, that increased significantly

to 21% and 18% in 2005, respectively.9

    Just as historical reasons produced large variation in the presence of immigrants across areas, the data show

a very large variation in the presence of foreign-born workers across firms. In 199610 36% of all French firms did

not employ any immigrant workers. The share of firms with 0 immigrants varies a lot across department. As an

example, in Seine Saint-Denis and Val d’Oise only 12% of all firms did not employ immigrants in 1996, while 78%

of firms did not employ immigrants in Nierre and Haute Marne. Only in the South-East department of Haute-

Garonne did all firms employ at least one immigrant worker. The share of firms that do not hire immigrants

is negatively and significantly correlated with the share of immigrants in the department, as shown in figure 2.

However there are some firms with no immigrants even in departments with large share of immigrants. The

large variation of immigrant share across firms is correlated to other firm characteristics. This underscores the

importance of controlling for firm characteristics and also the need for a sharper identification strategy not

based on the correlation between share of immigrants and productivity levels across firms. Table 3 shows the

linear correlation coefficients across French manufacturing firms between immigrants and productivity proxies

in year 1996. Each row of the table uses the variable listed in the first column as dependent in a regression,

on region and sector fixed effects and on either the immigrant share in the firm employment (column 1), or on

a dummy equal to one for having no immigrants and zero otherwise (column 2). The dependent variables are
   8 The   education composition of immigrants is also displayed in table A2 of the Appendix.
   9 Data   on the share of foreign population in 1995 and 2005 for all regions are shown in table A1 of the Appendix, that is available
online.
  10 The year 1996 is the initial year for our estimation sample.




                                                                    11
TFP, domestic market share, capital per worker and exports (all in logs). The first two are measures of labor

productivity, while the other two variables are positively correlated with it. The share of immigrants in the

firm is significantly correlated with all the firm outcomes considered. While such correlation may or may not

arise for causal reasons in our identification we will not use any of this cross sectional association to identify our

effect, but we will let the firm heterogeneity drive differential response to exogenous local immigrant inflow.



4     Empirical Framework

The goal of the empirical analysis is to help us understand the response of firms’ outcomes to inflows of

immigrants in the local labor markets. In particular we set up an empirical model that, controlling for firm

productive heterogeneity, analyzes the response of firm outcomes to local immigration shocks. We allow firms

with low initial productivity to react differently to a positive shock in migrant labor supply. For this reason we

allow firms that initially have TFP or total employment below the median or zero immigrant share to respond

to local immigration shocks in a different way than the rest of firms. We focus on a simple distinction between

firms below and above the median of average productivity (or size) to capture whether heterogeneous effects

imply a reduction (positive additional effect below the median) or an increase (negative additional effect) in

the productivity inequality across firms.11 We also consider specifically firms that initially had zero immigrants

to see if they respond to these shocks in different ways than the rest (in table 3 we show that firms without

immigrants are among the less productive ones). If immigrants have an effect that is complementary to a firm’s

technology, and their presence allows the adoption of more efficient technologies, those firms may exhibit a

particularly strong positive effect when they start hiring immigrants.

    Area-level changes in immigrant share, appropriately instrumented, can be considered an exogenous supply

shock for the firm. However, the size of the change in the firm’s employment share of immigrants depends also

on its own characteristics. Hence, variation of immigrants across departments represents supply-shock, while

variation of firms’ share of immigrants within the department provide evidence of heterogeneous responses. The

few previous studies on the impact of immigrants at the firm level (e.g. Malchow-Moller, Munch and Skaksen

(2012), Martins, Piracha and Varejao (2012)) combined the cross-sectional variation due to firm-level hiring and

the variation of immigrant supply across localities. This may confound variation in local supply with variation

in firms’ response to it. In our approach we will consider only exogenous area-level variation of immigrants as a

supply shock. Additionally, we will use the firm-level variation within a department to understand differential

firm response.

    The trade literature has previously related export shocks to firm-level outcomes (such as productivity and
  11 We will also check with a finer partition of firms by quartiles of initial productivity to show that the effect of immigration is
actually monotonic in initial productivity. See table A7.




                                                                 12
wages). In that context (e.g. Hummels et al 2014), it makes sense to consider a firm-specific export (or import)

shock because of the differential exposure of each firm to the growth of specific foreign markets. In our case,

immigration shocks are more reasonably considered as changes in the local availability of immigrant workers

and, as such, they are common to all establishments in a labor market. Then we allow individual firm to respond

differently according to their differential initial productivity. Our baseline empirical model is as follows:



             (y)i,s,d,t = φi + φs,T + φr,T + β1 sIM  MI
                                                          + β2 (sIM  MI
                                               !        
                                                 d,t             d,t    )d,t ∗ Ii (ki,1996 ≤ k) + β3 Xi,t + εi,t                   (6)


The variable (y)i,s,d,t represents an outcome relative to firm i in sector s, department d and year t. Our sample

includes the universe of French manufacturing firms with at least 20 employees between 1995 and 2005.12 Hence,

the index t takes values between 1995 and 2005. However, because of data unavailability for firm TFP in 1995,

our estimation sample is restricted to the 1996-2005 period. The term φi indicates a set of firm fixed effects,

meant to capture all the unobserved firm-specific factors affecting the outcomes of firms. Since, in our sample,

every firm belongs to a specific sector-department, firm fixed effects also capture department and sector-specific

unobserved factors.13 By introducing firm fixed effects we base our identification on differences with respect to

firm-specific average over time (within estimator). This reflects the spirit of equation (4) that describes how

changes in firm’s productivity depends on the change in immigrant composition of the local labor force. The

terms φs,T and φr,T are, respectively, sector-by-period and region-by-period fixed effects (one region is the union

of 4-5 departments according to the French administration) and are meant to control for unobserved region-

and sector-specific (time-variant) variables at a frequency of T years where T = 2.14 In particular, they could

capture local agglomeration effects or sector-specific technologies that change over time.15 As one period lasts

two years, those fixed effects fully absorb changes in French labor market legislation and/or sector technologies

that evolve slowly.16

    The term Xi,t captures a set of firm-specific time-varying controls, including a headquarter dummy (being

one if the firm is the head-quarter of a group), a foreign affiliate dummy (being one if the firm is an affiliate of a

foreign multinational firm) and the firm’s age. The explanatory variables of interest are: (i) sIM
                                                                                                d,t
                                                                                                    MI

immigrant population at time t in the department d where the firm is located;17 and (ii) the interaction of this
  12 As described in the data section, we rely on manufacturing firms with at least 20 employees, i.e. firms for which we have balance

sheet data from EAE.
  13 In our sample each firm belongs to a specific department-sector over the entire period. For multi-plant firms operating in several

sectors and regions we keep the sector and department of the biggest plant (in terms of total number of workers).
  14 Two-year period fixed effects imply that we have a dummy variable for a given region (or sector) every two years. We run several

robustness checks by changing the duration of the period. See Appendix table A5 for TFP estimation results using, respectively,
three- and five-year period definitions for the fixed effects.
  15 The fixed effects we introduce are the most demanding, while still maintaining reasonable identification power in the IV

estimation. The inclusion of region-by-year effects would render the instrument excessively weak. We will show several robustness
checks with regards to these fixed effects in Appendix table A5.
  16 One important shock in the French labor market might be represented by the EU enlargement, having added Eastern countries

in 2004 (free mobility of workers within EU). Although our period fixed effects control for this shock, France implemented the free
mobility of people from Eastern countries only in 2008 – outside our sample period.
  17 We consider 92 non-overseas departments of France for which we have data on the 1990 stock of migrants by the INSEE




                                                                  13
variable with the dummy Ii (ki,1996 ≤ k) that selects firms whose initial characteristic ki,1996 was below a certain

threshold. This variable aims at capturing the differential effect depending on initial firm characteristics.18

    We adopt three different specifications depending on the choice of the initial characteristic. Such charac-

teristic is meant to be correlated with initial productivity of the firm. Hence k represents alternatively, (i) the

share of immigrants in firm i as of 1996 and in this case the threshold is 0; (ii) the TFP of firm i as of 1996

and in this case the threshold is the sample median and (iii) the total employment of firm i in 1996 and also in

this case the threshold is the sample median. The change of immigrant share, sIM
                                                                              d,t
                                                                                  MI
                                                                                     , captures the exogenous

department-level change in immigrant supply, and the dummy, Ii (ki,1996 ≤ k), allows the outcomes of firms

that initially have no immigrants or low productivity (or size) to respond differently to such a shock

    We analyze several outcomes, (y)i,t , at the firm level. They are the log of total factor productivity (TFP), the

domestic market share (as further proxy of productivity), the logarithm of the capital stock, the exit probability

of firms,19 the number of plants per firm, the logarithm of exports, the number of served foreign markets, the

wage of natives in the firms and the employment of native workers in the firm. All those variables (except

exit probability) are positively correlated with productivity. Hence estimating a positive and significant β1 and

β2 coefficients for those outcome variables implies that immigration promotes convergence of those outcomes

across firms, stimulating initially less productive firms more than the rest. We estimate specification 6 on the

full sample of firms.


4.1     Identification issues and Instrumental Variables

Estimating equation (6) using least squares methods, even if we include fixed effects for firm-specific, region-

period and sector-period unobservable variables, leaves open the possibility that some omitted local conditions

may affect the changes in demand of immigrants and the changes in productivity/labor demand of firms si-

multaneously. District-specific yearly shocks, not observable to the researcher may drive a positive correlation

between the residual εi,t , in equation (6) and the explanatory variable, sIM
                                                                           d,t
                                                                               MI
                                                                                  . In our setting, the omitted

variable concern is more severe than the reverse causality problem, as the unobserved productivity shocks of an

individual firm do not have a significant impact on the department’s economic outcome, which is much larger.

In order to identify the part of the change in the immigration share at the department level driven by supply-

driven variation, rather than by local productivity shocks, we use a shift-share instrument based on the initial

spatial distribution of immigrants. Pioneered by Altonji and Card (1991) and used in several studies since then
Population Census (needed to compute our instrumental variable). Thus, the explanatory variable of interest takes 1,012 different
values (92 departments by eleven years).
  18 This implies that results would be restricted to firms that existed in 1996. To attenuate this limitation, we run two robustness

checks. First, we take the sub-period 2000-2005 and use the 2000 as starting year (using firms existing in 2000). Second, we run
equation 6 on a balanced panel with firms existing over the entire period 1996-2005 (no entry/exit). Results for both robustness
checks are reported in the online Appendix table A6 and confirm our baseline estimation results.
  19 We thank anonymous referee for suggesting this interesting firm outcome.




                                                                 14
(such as Card (2001), Card (2009), Peri and Sparber (2009), and Lewis (2013), among others), this approach

is based on the fact that, because of information and preferences, new immigrants tend to move to the same

area (French department) where previous immigrants from the same country already live. This is because they

know of opportunities in those locations from the network of immigrants, and because they enjoy the amenities

of living with their co-nationals. These reasons to co-locate are driven by preference and information, not by

demand shocks. Building on this idea we construct the imputed number of immigrants in district d, for each
                       \
year t = 1996 − 2005, IM M I d,t as follows. For each country of origin, o, we distribute the total number of
                                                            ^
immigrants in France for that group in year t indicated as IM M I o,t across departments, in proportion to the

share of that national group in the district as of 1990. By summing across countries of origin we obtain such

an imputed number of immigrants in each department:


                                  \
                                                 X      IM M Id,o,1990,Census        ^
                                 IM M I d,t =                                     ∗ IM M I o,t .                                   (7)

This method uses the initial distribution of immigrants from each country across districts interacted with the

aggregate inflow of immigrants by country of origin. District-specific labor demand changes between 1995 and

2005 should not be correlated with either term, as long as district-specific determinants of agglomeration of

some immigrant communities in the years before 1995 are not strongly correlated with demand changes in the

period 1996-2005. Since the only available data on total immigrants by country of origin in France are from the
                                                                               ^
Census, we also impute the yearly number of immigrants by country of origin - IM M I o,t - as follows:

                               IM M I o,t =                          ∗ IM M IF rance,t,DADS .                                      (8)
                                             IM M IF rance,t,Census

the first term in equation (8) is the share of immigrants in France from a given origin o in census year t (based

on Census data, INSEE). While the second term in equation (8), IM M IF rance,t,DADS , is the stock of foreign-

born individuals working in France at time t in the manufacturing plus service sectors and is obtained from

DADS data - which also provide the exhaustive sample of workers that we use (see section 3.1). Notice that we

include the total stock of migrants working in service and manufacturing sectors, while we include manufacturing

firms only when estimating equation (6).20 This increases the correlation of the instrument with the supply of

immigrants as manufacturing-specific shocks in a region should not affect aggregate flows. We then imputed

the share of immigrants in the department as follows:


                                                                    \
                                                                   IM M Id,t

  20 By focusing on the manufacturing sector, we also avoid any minimum wage issues (Salaire minimum interprofessionnel de

croissance, SMIC). Indeed only in service sectors (as touristic services, hotels and food services) the average hourly wage is close to
the minimum wage.



                                                                  15
In expression (9) the native population is fixed at year 1995 so as to avoid spurious effects due to the potentially

endogenous native population growth in the department over the 1996-2005 period. Internal mobility of native

workers due to local demand shocks could introduce significant spurious bias in the instrument if one uses

the contemporary (rather than initial) number of native individuals. The instrument captures the idea that

departments with a large initial share of immigrants (as of 1990) are likely to attract a larger share of new

immigrants coming from the same country of origin because of network effects. So different migration rates

from different countries, driven by changing conditions in sending country or policy variations or changes in

immigration costs (all factors likely to be unrelated to local demand shocks) have differential impact on French

districts depending on the distribution of these migrants. The implicit assumption is that the distribution of

immigrants across departments for each country of origin in 1990 were uncorrelated with the distribution of

changes in labor demand shocks in the department, conditional on firm fixed effects and region-period and

sector-period fixed effects. Some potential concern for this type of instrument may arise if the 1990 distribution

of immigrants across department is correlated with some economic conditions that affects subsequent changes of

productivity and employment in firms. To mitigate these concerns, we test whether the instrument is correlated

with initial economic conditions of the departments in the next section. We cannot test (due to lack of data)

whether they are uncorrelated with their trend preceding 1996; but we provide alternative tests supporting the

validity of the exclusion restriction. However, the instruments we use here are commonly used in this literature

and generally considered valid (i.e. uncorrelated with pre-1996 levels of economic activity). For these reasons we

consider our estimates as informative on the causal role of immigrants on French firms. In the next sub-section

we discuss in greater detail the validity of our instrumental variable.


4.2    Instrument validity

Before presenting the empirical results, we show evidence consistent with the validity of the exclusion restriction,

which is crucial to our identification strategy. In constructing the IV we assumed the distribution of immigrants

by origin country in year 1990 was orthogonal to subsequent productivity and labor demand shocks at the

local level. This is a strong assumption. Past income and productivity shocks, specific to departments, may be

persistent over time. This introduces the possibility that past income and productivity had an effect on the stock

of immigrants in 1990, and, through this channel, the instrument may be spuriously correlated to current firm’s

outcomes. To find some reassurance that the instrument constructed this way is not correlated with preexisting

economic patterns across departments, we calculate the correlation across departments between the instrument,

namely the change in the imputed immigrants over the period 1996-2005,21 and the average economic outcomes

in the departments as of 1996 (TFP, domestic market share, capital and trade). Table 4 panel A shows the OLS

correlation of imputed changes in immigrants and 1996 economic outcomes across departments. Reassuringly, we

do not find any significant correlation between the instrument and the preexisting average economic outcomes.

While this is a reasonable test, it does not rule out correlation of the instrument with pre-1996 trend in the

outcomes. A more accurate test would be to regress the trend in our outcome variables before-1996 on the

after-1996 trend of our instrument. While we do not have information on French firms’ TFP before 1996 we

perform two additional tests. First, we test the validity of our instruments, constructed for the second half of the

period only (2000-2005) relative to trends of the first part of the period (1996-1999). A significant correlation of

local shocks and immigration behavior over time could generate a correlation with pre-existing trends, casting

doubt on the shift-share procedure.22 Results reported in Table 4 panel B show that there is no statistically

significant correlation between the pre-2000 trend in local outcomes and the post-2000 trend in the instrument.23

As an alternative, instead of using trends in the outcome variables at the firm level, we check the correlation of

instruments with pre-existing labor market trends, available for the 1982-1990 period from French Census data.

Results reported in panel C of table 4 show that the instrument is not correlated with preexisting trend in local

labor market (department) variables.



5     The Effects of Immigration on Firms

Tables 5 to 12 show the estimated parameters on the explanatory variables of interest for specification (6) using

the full sample of firms in our dataset and different firm-level outcomes. These tables share a similar structure,

while using different outcome variables. We will describe the main features of the tables when commenting on

the estimates presented in table 5 and, even more in table 6 which introduces the main estimates relative to

productivity. Then we will comment on the parameter estimates for each of the other tables in the following

subsections that relate to different outcomes. As described in section 4, the estimation sample in tables 5-12

(and in the online Appendix tables A3-A9 which represent checks of robustness) covers the period 1996-2005.

We use firm characteristics measured in year 1996 to compute the dummy Ii (ki,1996 ≤ k) as in equation (6).

The sample used for all regression includes all manufacturing firms. The standard errors are clustered at the

department level in each specification so as to account for the correlation across firms and over time within a

geographic area.
 22 We  thank anonymous referee for suggesting this test.
 23 The  only significant correlation is for domestic market share but only at 10% and with the opposite sign that an endogeneity
argument would suggest. This is an accurate test for the exogeneity of the instrument after 2000. So, in Onlne Appenix Table A6
we show TFP baseline results for the sub-period 2000-2005. Results are qualitatively identical to the baseline estimations on the
full sample.




                                                               17
5.1    Firm’s hiring of Immigrants

In table 5 we show how the increased supply of immigrants in the department translates into local firms hiring

them. In particular, in panel A, we analyze how likely are firms that employed no immigrants at the beginning

of the considered period to begin hiring them in response to the increased supply. The dependent variable is

a dummy equal to one if the firm increases the number of immigrants from 0 to a positive share during the

considered year. The main effect –reported in row one of the table – captures how the probability of hiring

the first immigrant by a local firm increases as the share of immigrants in the area rises by one percentage

point. Then, the interaction terms in specifications (4)-(5) captures the additional effect for firms with initial

productivity below the median (the coefficient reported in the second row) or the interaction with firms whose

size was below the median in 1996 (the coefficient reported in the third row). In panel B of table 5 we also

analyze whether department specific migration shocks affect the number of immigrants hired by the firm (in

logarithms) and if this effect is stronger in firms with initial productivity (or size) below the median.

   These regressions are meant to establish whether firms become more likely to hire immigrants (and hire more

of them) when more immigrants are available as workers. What is more interesting is to analyze whether those

firms with initially low productivity or small size responded to the exogenous inflow of immigrants differently

than other firms. If firms are homogeneous in their response to newly available immigrant workers, and this

is independent of their productivity or size, one should expect that new immigrants are hired across firms

homogeneously or, possibly, in proportion to their size and productivity. This would imply probability of hiring

across firms and number of newly hired constant or proportional to firm’s size and productivity. Hence a negative

or null coefficient should be estimated for the interaction effects shown in columns (4) and (5) of panel A and B

of table 5. Alternatively, if smaller and less productive firms might be more inclined to start hiring immigrants

because of stronger complementarity, cost-saving and skill externalities in production, then one would observe

a positive effect on firms with initially lower productivity. In this case a larger supply of immigrants could

generate a stronger increase in the share of immigrants for smaller, less productive firms who can be moving the

new technologies, while firms with higher initial productivity will have smaller changes. Such scenario would

imply positive estimates of the interaction coefficient of columns (4) and (5).

   The first two columns of table 5 show the OLS estimates of the coefficient on the immigrant share of

employment in the department. The specification in column (1) includes region and sector fixed effects as

controls, while specification (2) also includes firm fixed effects. The 2SLS estimates, on which we focus, are

presented in column (3), which also includes a more demanding set of fixed effects (region-by-period and sector-

by-period) as well as controls for individual firm characteristics. In this specification we find that a one-percent-

population increase in immigrants in a district translates into a 0.57% higher probability for the average firm

to begin hiring immigrants (panel A); and to a 0.4% increase in the number of immigrants hired by the firm


                                                         18
(panel B). Controlling for firm fixed effects and instrumenting the inflow of immigrants produces a larger point

estimate of this effect, relative to OLS estimates. This indicates the presence of omitted variable bias in the

OLS specification attenuating the effect.

    When separating firms with low initial productivity (below the median), we find that these firms experienced

an extra boost from immigration, increasing their probability of hiring the first immigrant by a further 0.26%

(column 4, Panel A) and showing a much larger percentage hiring of immigrants in initially less productive

firms (Panel B). Column (5) shows the differential response related to initial size and reveals that firms initially

smaller than the median in 1996 had a significantly higher probability of beginning to hire immigrants and a

significantly larger (log) number of immigrants hired. Similar to the case of firms with low productivity, these

smaller firms responded to larger local supply of immigrants by increasing more substantially the probability

of a first foreign-born hire and the number of immigrants hired. We analyze in the next sections whether such

a higher propensity to hire immigrants, for initially small and less productive firms, was also associated with

larger estimated effects of immigrants on outcomes.


5.2     Firms’ TFP growth

A main objective of this paper is studying the effect of immigration on the productivity of firms. Such effect can

be positive if immigrants bring complementarity in production and/or if they create externalities by affecting

the choice of efficient technologies or efficient specialization. However, it can be negative if immigrants crowd

firms or other productive inputs. Previous papers (such as Ottaviano and Peri 2012 or Peri 2012) have analyzed

potential productivity effects in aggregate (state or urban) economies, but the analysis of firm-level effects is still

lacking. Table 6 shows the estimated effects of immigration, measured as the increase in the share of foreign-

born in the area (department) by one percentage point of the population, on firm productivity measured as

total factor productivity (TFP). We compute the TFP of firms assuming the production function is log-linear,

and hence productivity can be calculated as a residual from a log regression. We use the Olley and Pakes

(1996) approach (henceforth, OP), which accounts for the endogeneity in the use of inputs and improves on

the reliability of OLS estimates.24 A detailed description of the OP approach and of our calculations is in the

Appendix section A2.25

    In column (1) we show the average effect of immigration estimated using OLS and including only region
  24 As a robustness check we also compute the TFP using a CES aggregation of labor between immigrants and natives. By assuming

an elasticity of substitution equal to ten – consistent with Ottaviano and Peri (2012) and Peri (2011) – the CES aggregation of
labor is the following: (N atives0.9 + (Immigrants ∗ (ImmiW age/N ativeW age))0.9 )1.1 . Estimation results using this approach
are reported in table A6 columns (7) and (8). They are not too different from the simpler approach taken in the main text.
  25 The OP approach consists of a semi-parametric estimator using firm investment to proxy for unobserved productivity shocks.

This allows a solution to the simultaneity problem between inputs and output. The OP procedure also defines an exit rule to
solve for the selection issue in TFP estimation. Since OP relies on investment to proxy for productivity shocks (with investment
increasing in productivity), only observations with positive investment values could be used. See appendix section A.2 for further
details on TFP calculation.




                                                               19
and sector fixed effects and individual firm controls. Then in column (2) we add firm fixed effects to the

previous specification. These estimations may suffer from two problems. First, there can be bias from several

sources such as simultaneity, omitted variables and measurement error. If the correlation between omitted

productivity-increasing variables and the inflow of immigrants is positive, the bias of OLS will be positive.

Measurement error and omitted ”productivity” variables negatively correlated with immigration would bias the

OLS estimates downward instead. Second, in those specifications we do not allow for heterogeneous effects

of immigrants across firms. As a consequence of potentially contrasting biases it is hard to predict the sign

of the overall bias. Progressively including fixed effects and then using the IV estimation and, importantly,

allowing for heterogeneous effects across firms, should reduce those biases. In particular we observe that the

inclusion of firm fixed effects (from column 1 to column 2) increases the size of the estimated coefficient (i.e.

the correlation between immigrant supply and firm TFP) from 0.11 to 0.14. This suggests that unobserved

firm-level characteristics which are positively associated with productivity growth are also negatively correlated

with the local share of immigrants. Hence, omitting them produces a downward bias in the correlation. At the

same time, the effects of immigrants on firm productivity is revealed in columns (4)-(6) to be heterogeneous

and, in particular, such an affect is stronger for initially less productive firms. Such heterogeneity may also

contribute to the downward bias when it is not accounted for.

   For these reasons, we move to 2SLS estimates and first show in column (3) the average effect, estimated

including the full set of fixed effects as reported in equation 6. Increased immigration in the department is asso-

ciated with faster TFP growth in firms: a ten-percent-of-employment increase in immigrants in the department

(which is roughly the average overall growth rate of immigrants in French manufacturing between 1995 and

2005) corresponds to a 1.7 log point increase in TFP for the average firm in the department (corresponding to

an increase of about 1.7 percent). More interesting are the estimates in column (4), (5) and (6) in Table 6. They

show a stronger effect of immigrant share on TFP for firms that had no immigrants initially. The interaction

term has a positive and significant coefficient. The estimates in column (5) also reveal that the stronger effect of

immigrants corresponds to firms with a low initial TFP level (below the median). Those firms experienced an

additional TFP increase of 3.6 log points for each ten-percent-of-employment increase in the immigrant popu-

lation in the department, relative to firms with initially high productivity (above the median). As TFP may be

measured with error, we alternatively consider initial size in terms of employment, commonly considered as an

alternative measure of firms’ success. In column (6), we show that firms with an initial employment level below

the median experienced a TFP increase of 3.5 log points for each ten-percent-of-employment increase in the

immigrant population in the department, while for firms initially above the median size the effect was only 0.5

log points per ten-percent-of-employment increase. While in this and subsequent specifications we include one

dimension of heterogeneity at a time and emphasize that initial productivity, size and share of immigrants are



                                                        20
strongly (and positively) correlated, we also experimented with including two or three at a time. In general the

partition according to initial productivity is the most relevant one in identifying different responses of immigrant

share on productivity and other outcomes (these results are available upon request). To confirm that initial

productivity is monotonic in determining the TFP response to immigration we also estimate interactions with

a finer partition of firms by quartiles of initial productivity. The estimates can be found in the online Appendix

table A7, and they reveal that the effect of migration is monotonically decreasing in initial productivity, with

the strongest effect on firms with initial productivity below the 25th percentile and significantly positive effects

only for firms below the median.

    The effect of immigrants in boosting productivity of initially smaller and less productive firms may depend

on the fact that those are more willing to hire them, and to adopt technologies and specialization that benefit

from immigrants’ effects. This feature may also explain why in a simple OLS regression with few controls and

no firm fixed effects (as in column 1 of table 6) one finds an attenuated correlation (if still positive) between

immigrant inflow and firm productivity. Immigrants were more likely to flow to initially less productive firms,

in the France manufacturing sector, which may have help those firms cut costs, restructure production and

increase productivity more than large firms.

    The last row of table 6 shows the Kleinbergen-Paap F-statistics that measures the power of the instruments.

In the case of two endogenous variables, the immigrant share and its interaction with the initial characteristics

dummy, we use two instruments: the imputed immigrant share described above and its interaction with the

dummy. In table 7 we report detailed results for the first stage regressions of the 2SLS procedure. Our

instrumental variables are always highly significant in explaining the endogenous share of immigrants in the

department and its interactions with Ii (ki,1996 ≤ k) . The F-stat and the joint F-stat are always well above 10,

implying the instruments are not weak. It can be noticed that the instrumental variables are highly relevant and

that the main instrument is a strong predictor of the main variable (share of foreign-born), while the interacted

instrument is a strong predictor of the interaction term.26


5.3     Other productivity-related outcomes

The measures of productivity (TFP) used in the previous section are obtained as the residual from a firm-level

production function. Hence measurement error of inputs can affect it, sometimes substantially. In this section,

we provide robustness checks of the previous results using “easier to measure” firm outcomes which are positively

correlated with productivity. Firms’ domestic market share is an alternative measure used in several papers

(e.g. Blonigen et al. 2014) as higher productivity induces cost advantages and, hence, a larger share of sales
  26 To save space we do not report detailed first stage regressions results for the other firms’ outcomes (available upon request).

However specification (6) does not change across firms’ outcomes and first stage might slightly change only because of missing
observations.




                                                                21
and revenues for a firm in the domestic market. Specifically, we calculate domestic revenue for each firm (as

total turnover minus exported value) and divide it by the total domestic revenue of all French firms. We report

results of these estimations in Panel A (the upper part) of table 8. Results are consistent with those obtained

using TFP estimations: a ten-percent-of-employment increase in immigrants in the department corresponds to

a 2.8 percentage point increase in domestic market share when we estimate the effects using 2SLS controlling

for the most demanding set of fixed effects. When considering the possibility of heterogeneous effects, according

to initial size and productivity, most of the impact of immigrants accrues to initially smaller and less productive

firms. The impact on market share is a 6.7 percentage point increase for firms with no immigrants in 1996

and it is about 8 percentage points for firms with low productivity or small size (below median) in 1996. The

impact on firms above the median of productivity and size is not significant (see columns (5) and (6) in table

8 Panel A). As further robustness checks, reported in the online Appendix table A3, we use three other proxies

for firm productivity as dependent variable: (i) value added per worker (see table A3 columns 1 and 2), (ii)

TFP calculated following the Levinsohn and Petrin (2003) approach (see table A3 columns 3 and 4), and (iii)

revenues per worker (see table A3 columns 5 and 6). Albeit with some differences, all three checks confirm a

positive and significant average effect of immigrants and stronger effects on firms with initial productivity below

the median.

   In section 2 and within the framework of decomposition (5) we highlighted the possibility that immigration

flows affect the entry/exit dynamics of firms. Indeed, a possible consequence of increased productivity and

larger market share for a firm is the increased probability of surviving in the market. The exit of a firm from the

market is rather easy to record and, while a rather ”coarse” variable, it is precisely measured. So, if an increased

supply of immigrants benefits firms in the form of higher productivity, this could also reduce their probability of

exiting the market. We test this channel in Panel B of table 8 where the dependent variable is a dummy equal to

one if the firm becomes inactive (conditional on being active for at least two years) and remains such for at least

two years. While we do not know from our dataset the reason why a firm ceased its activities, we know that the

database includes all firms in France and, hence, disappearance from the dataset implies cessation of activities.

The result for this outcome is similar (with opposite sign) to those on productivity. However, the heterogeneity

in this effect between smaller, less productive firms and larger firms is not as large as the heterogeneity in the

productivity effects. Using the 2SLS estimates of column (3), we find a ten-percent-of-employment increase

in immigrant workers in a department corresponds to a 6.7 percentage point reduction in the exit probability

for the average firm. This effect is somewhat magnified for firms with employment level below the median in

1996 (see column 6), but the additional effect is small and the probability of exiting decreases only by 7.0-7.1

percentage points (rather than by 6.3). Firms that were relatively small and unproductive in 1996 experienced

a stronger boost to their productivity growth as a consequence of a larger immigrant share. Their probability



                                                        22
of exiting the market also decreased when the inflow of immigrants was larger.27

    The fact that exit and entry can be affected by immigration suggests that selection of firms may drive some

of the productivity effect estimated previously. To check that this is not the case, we perform two checks. First

take the sub-period 2000-2005 and use the 2000 as starting year selecting only firms already existing in 2000.

Second, we estimate equation 6 on a balanced panel with firms existing over the entire period 1996-2005 (no

entry/exit). Results for both robustness checks (reported in the online Appendix table A6) confirm our baseline

estimation results. The productivity effects are similar on the whole sample or on the balanced panel revealing

no bias produced by selective attrition.


5.3.1    Growth in Physical Capital

The significant increase in productivity at the firm level, identified in the previous section is likely to drive

other changes in firms’ outcomes. As a large part of the immigrant inflow experienced by these French firms

was of highly skilled workers, their hiring may have promoted complementarity with physical capital, boosting

investment and the adoption of new technologies (e.g. Krusell et al 2000). If this was the case, then we should

also observe growth in the firm’s physical capital stock associated with larger inflows of immigrants. On the

other hand, if immigration was an unexpected shift in the supply of labor accompanied by slow and costly

capital adjustment then firms might have experienced a decrease in the capital/labor ratio in the short run and

small change in capital stock. Moreover, firms may adopt different production techniques in response to larger

availability of skilled immigrants, and those can be more capital intensive. Lewis (2011) finds that in areas

of large low-skilled immigration, firms experience slower growth in their capital-labor ratios. It is interesting,

therefore, to see whether, in our case, the impact on TFP is accompanied by a similar impact on firm physical

capital intensity.

    Panel A of table 9 (the upper part of it) shows the estimates of specifications similar to those in the

previous tables, when the dependent variable is the logarithm of capital value, calculated as the total value of

the capital stock of the firm (deflated by its price index). The coefficients tell us whether larger immigration

shares in the department stimulate higher net investment in the firm. Column (1) shows the OLS estimates

with the more limited set of fixed effects and column (2) includes firm fixed effects as controls. Notice the

importance of firm fixed effects to obtain in this case a significant effect of immigration on capital stock. Then

in column (3) we show the positive and significant effect on the capital of the average firm using 2SLS: a

ten-percent-of-employment increase of immigrants in the department increases the capital stock in the average

firm by 8 percent. The elasticity is larger (in percentage terms) than for productivity. When firms hire more
   27 We also estimated the effect of migration on the entry rate of firms across departments. This effect cannot be analyzed with a

firm-level regression but we, rather, used a department-level regression. The results suggests that migration can affect positively
the entry rate of firms. However the coefficient is very imprecisely estimated and not statistically significant.




                                                                23
immigrants, they significantly increase their capital investment and their capital stock. Columns (4) - (6)

confirm a significant effect of immigration on capital investment which is stronger for those firms with initially

no immigrants, low productivity, or small size (below the median) in the initial year of 1996. The elasticity

of response for smaller/less productive firms to department immigration is about three times greater than the

response of other firms.

   Measures of the value of the capital stock of firms can be imprecise and include all types of physical capital

investments. As a robustness check, reported in Panel B of table 9, we use a coarser, but easier to collect,

measure of firms’ capital stock. Namely, we consider the number of plants that the firm operates. This number

is often one and sometimes grows to two or three. The results are significantly weaker than those for the total

stock of capital, as to be expected for a variable that changes irregularly and rarely. Overall, however, even

the impact on this outcome is in line with the findings described above. The average effect on the number of

firms’ plants is positive and is essentially driven by those firms starting in 1996 with 0 immigrants (compare

the estimates in columns 3 and 4). Overall, these results show that immigration positively affects the total

value of capital as well as the number of plants a firm operates. These findings are clearly complementary to

what Lewis (2011) finds for the United States. There, prevalently low skilled immigration was associated with

the adoption of unskilled-intensive technology and less mechanization. Here, prevalently skilled immigration

seems to be associated with increased capital intensity, higher TFP and increased opportunity for operating

new plants.


5.3.2   Growth in Exports

The productivity gains from immigration shown in the previous sections could affect the export performances

of firms in the manufacturing sector. A large body of empirical literature (beginning with Bernard and Jensen

1999) has emphasized that more productive firms are those serving international markets and exporting more.

Moreover, firms that export in more than one international market are the most productive one. The fact

that these firms are able to cover the fixed cost of entry in several foreign markets is an indicator of their high

level of productivity. At the same time, several papers have analyzed the connection between immigration and

exports at the national and regional level (see Felbermayr, Grossman and Kohler (2012) for a recent review),

emphasizing how immigrants may reduce the fixed cost of exporting. Few papers have also looked at the

firm-level connection between immigrants and exporting their products. Hiller (2013) and Hatzigeorgiou and

Lodefalk (2016) show this connection using Danish and Swedish firm-level data, respectively. Most studies

find that immigrants have a trade-creation effect on regions and firms and they interpret this as the result

of reducing fixed costs of trading with the country of origin of immigrants (e.g. Peri and Requena (2010)).

Immigrants play a key role in connecting firms to new export markets in the countries where they are from.

Firms hiring additional immigrants (from different countries) are more likely to enter additional export markets.

Our previous analysis has found a positive productivity effect and, hence, combining higher productivity with

lower trade costs we expect to also find a positive impact of immigrants on trade for our sample.

   Estimates of the (logarithm of the) total value of exports are reported in table 10 Panel A. They show that

the presence of immigrants in a department boosts the export sales of French firms (column 3). In particular,

a ten-percent-of-employment increase in immigrants in a department increases the export sales of the average

firm by 12.7 percent. This effect is, as those found above, mainly driven by firms with low initial productivity

and small size (see columns 5 and 6) who at the beginning of the period did not hire immigrants (column 4).

The effects on total exports are consistent with those on productivity.

   The effect on total exports can be decomposed into the extensive and intensive margins of trade. In a

standard trade model with heterogeneous firms, a reduction in the fixed cost of exporting, due to immigrant

workers, may favor small and less productive firms in particular. Immigration, by reducing the fixed cost of

exporting, helps less productive firms access additional markets and export more (Melitz (2003); Chaney (2008)

and Crozet and Koening (2010)). Positive immigration shocks are thus expected to positively affect the extensive

margin of firms depending on their initial productivity/size. We test this channel by estimating equation 6 on

the number of export markets in which firms sell, which can be considered one of the ”extensive margins” of

export. In table 10 Panel B we find a strong positive effect of immigrants on the number of foreign markets

(see column 3), which is entirely due to those firms with initially low productivity (column 5) and small size

(column 6). As an alternative measure for the extensive margin of trade in table A4 columns (1)-(2), we use

the number of exported varieties (computed as the number of HS-6 digit items exported by each firm) and also

find a positive immigrant supply shock has a positive effect on the number of exported varieties, especially for

firms with low initial productivity.

   Trade models with heterogeneous firms do not provide clear predictions on the effects of a reduction in

the fixed cost of export on the intensive margin of export (export per market). However, as shown above,

immigration has a strong positive effect on the productivity of firms that might reflect in an increase in the

intensive margin of export of firms. In table A3 columns (4)-(6), we estimate whether immigration also affects

the average exported value per destination and per variety of exported good. In line with previous results on

TFP (and domestic market share), we find an increase in immigrants in a department increases the average

export per destination (and variety), with a particularly strong effect for those firms with initially zero migrants

in production and for firms with low initial productivity.

5.3.3    Growth in Wages and Employment

The evidence presented so far suggests that increases in the supply of immigrants may have helped smaller

and less productive firms improve, invest, and increase their productivity and exports. But did these same

inflows hurt native workers?28 Higher productivity, higher investment in physical capital intensity and lower

exit probability should help existing workers in those firms, too. While it is possible that immigrant workers had

a competition effect on natives, they may have also helped existing workers through those productivity channels.

In a framework similar to that of the previous tables, we consider the logarithm of wages of native workers in

firms and the number of native workers employed in the firm (in log units) as two additional outcomes measured

at the firm level. We report the estimated coefficients in table 11, where we display in Panel A the wage effects

and in Panel B the employment effects. Wages are measured at the firm level and hence combine changes in

wages of individuals and potential changes in the composition of workers at the firm level so that selection can

take place. What are the channels through which immigrants can affect native wages and employment in the

firm? First, the estimated productivity improvement should produce positive wage effects for natives, however,

technology and capital may complement natives to a different extent than immigrants if their skills are different.

Moreover, a larger supply of immigrants can increase competition for some native workers in the local labor

market and may induce native workers to change firms. The results of table 11 Panel A reveal interesting

patterns. An increase in the immigrant share in the department seems to have a strong positive effect on the

average wage of natives on average. This is consistent with the productivity effect. A ten-percent-of-employment

increase in immigrants is associated with a 5% increase in native wages in the average firm (column 3 of table

11). However, the effect on native wages is not stronger in firms initially hiring fewer immigrants (columns 4)

and, although still positive, is reduced in firms with low initial productivity (+4.2% in column 5 adding the main

effect and interaction) or with small initial size (+3.7% in column 6). These results could be puzzling if one only

considers the productivity effect of immigrants across firms. However, one has to account also for a composition

effect. In particular if, in response to hiring immigrants, high skilled natives redirect their employment towards

firms that do not hire many of them, one can observe an increase in the average skills of natives in firms with

initially high productivity (and subsequent low hiring of immigrants). This would imply an increase in native

wages which could be larger in firms hiring fewer immigrants as natives’ composition became more skilled in

those firms. Table 12 shows that this is exactly the case. Using a framework similar to that of previous tables,

we show the estimated effect of migration on the share of natives white collar jobs (skilled jobs) relative to

the total employment of a firm.29 Consistently with our explanation, firms with initially low TFP experienced

only a small increase in the share of native in white collar jobs; however, firms with high initial productivity
  28 Recent studies on the labor market effect of immigration using Labor Force Survey data for France show average null (slightly

negative) impact of immigration on the wages and employment of native workers in the long run (Edo 2015; Edo and Toubal 2015).
  29 We use white collar jobs as a proxy for skilled workers since we have data on the occupation of workers but not on their

education.



                                                               26
experienced larger and significant increases in the share of native workers in white collar jobs.

   Interestingly, the mobility of highly skilled native workers towards firms that hire fewer immigrants (or none)

may be an important channel of positive spillovers in a municipality. Firms that do not hire immigrants may

experience part of the benefit via an increase in their skilled workforce. One can test the strength of this spillover

by analyzing the change in productivity in firms that hire no immigrants in a municipality that experiences

an increase in immigration. We show one way of assessing the pure externality effect (vis-a-vis the combined

complementarity-externality) in table A8 of the online Appendix. We report the effect of immigration at the

department level on two types of firms, both with 0 immigrants at the beginning of the period. The first type

hires immigrants over the period (switchers), the second type never hire immigrants. As expected, firms that

hire immigrants experience the highest TFP boost, value added increase and domestic share growth. However,

also firms without immigrants benefit from immigration in terms of TFP, suggesting the positive spillover effects.

   Table 11 shows also that initially smaller and less productive firms expand their employment of natives more

than other firms (Panel B of table 11) and given their change in skill composition this employment growth must

takes place mainly through inflow of less skilled. In columns (3) and (4) of Panel B, we find a null effect of

immigration on the employment of natives in the average firm. However, this hides a heterogeneous effect: a ten-

percent-of-employment increase in immigrants is associated with a 5% decrease in native employment in firms

with high initial productivity and to a 2.2% increase in native employment for firms with low initial productivity

(column 5). As allowed in decomposition (5) immigration might induce the reallocation and selection of workers

across existing firms and thus change the relative size and skill composition of firms. In column (6) we show

the same kind of evidence using initial size instead of productivity to differentiate firms. Firms with low initial

productivity and small size are those that experience the most pronounced productivity boost from immigration

and net job-creation, increasing both immigrant and native employment.

   The employment and wage data are available for a larger sample that includes all small firms (including

those with less than 20 workers) within the DADS dataset. Hence, in this case we can estimate a specification

for all firms including small ones (for which we do not have balance sheet data from EAE). Column (7) of table

11 reports the results for the extended sample that includes all small firms. In this case, the average wage effect

is similar to column (3), but the employment effect turns positive, consistent with the estimates of columns (5)

and (6) showing positive employment effects for initially small firms.


5.4    Department level regressions

All specifications estimated in the previous sections focus on firm-level outcomes. The results strongly suggest

productivity effects may be larger for initially less productive and smaller firms (table 6); these firms are also

more likely to increase in size (table 11) but have fewer skilled natives (table 12) in response to immigrants.



                                                         27
Hence, from an aggregate point of view, the effects of immigrants may be more conducive to productivity

(and size) convergence across firms than to net aggregate productivity growth. Another important effect can

be net firm creation in the area (first term of the decomposition), which could magnify employment effects

at the firm level. In this section, therefore, we analyze aggregate department-level outcomes to see which

firm-level heterogeneous effects survive the aggregation. Results from panel regressions in which the units are

”department-year” observations, in which we include year effects, are reported in table 13. All regressions use

2SLS estimation using the IV described above. Immigration has a positive, but not significant, effect on net firm

creation in a department (column 1). Column 2 also shows a positive and not significant effect of immigration

on total employment of natives in a department. The firm-level analysis suggested this effect may take place

with a reallocation of workers from larger (less affected) to smaller (more affected) firms.30 Then we estimate

the effect of immigration on the total exports of firms by given department-year. Consistently with firm level

estimation, immigration has a positive effect on exports.31

    On the productivity side at the department level,32 we find that immigration has a positive and significant

effect on the average domestic market share and on value added – see columns (6) and (7) – and a positive, but

not significant, effect on average TFP and aggregate capital stock. Coefficients on domestic market share and

per capital value added are bigger, but not far from those estimated at the firm level (and reported in tables

8 and A3). Finally, we estimate the effects of an increase in the supply of immigrants’ in a department on

the wage gap between immigrant and native workers (computed as the ratio between average immigrant over

native wage in each department). While improving productivity and opportunities may benefit all workers, the

increased supply of immigrants can hurt their own wage opportunities relative to natives. We do find evidence

of this effect in column (8).



6     Conclusion

Using French firm-level data, we are among the very few who have studied the effect of immigration on a set

of firm-specific outcomes related to productivity. In particular – also new in the literature – we study how

firms differ in responding to exogenous immigrant supply changes due to immigration depending on their initial

productivity and size. A significant empirical regularity emerges from the analysis: firms in departments that

experienced a large inflow of immigrants had productivity gains, faster investment and export growth, lower exit

probability and larger employment growth than comparable firms in departments receiving lower immigration
  30 As a further robustness check for the local labor market impact of migration, we replicate our estimations using French Labor

Force Survey at the region-year level. Results are reported in the online Appendix table A9. Consistently with results reported in
table 13, we find null effect of immigration on both native workers and wage in the region.
  31 The point estimate cannot directly be compared with firm-level estimation because of a scale effect from aggregation.
  32 To avoid compositional effects in aggregation, we computed a within-department weighted average using the inverse of firm size

and productivity in 1996 as weights.




                                                                28
inflows. Using an instrument that proxies the supply-driven inflow of immigrants by distributing new inflows

proportionally to the location of historical immigrant groups, and including a very rich set of fixed effects

to control for firm and region heterogeneity, our analysis confirms these effects are consistent with a causal

interpretation. We also find that firms with low initial productivity and small size are those that increase

their employment of immigrants more and experience the largest productivity growth and strongest capital and

export growth in response to the local increase in immigrant supply.

    This has promoted some convergence in size and productivity level across firms in France, as high immigration

departments have experienced higher productivity growth of initially less productive firms. We speculate this

may be due to the fact that smaller, less productive firms were more ready to hire immigrants in order to cut

costs and/or adopt new technologies, improve specialization, and invest in capital and methods that complement

the skills of immigrants. There is also suggestive evidence that the positive productivity effect may spill over

to firm not hiring immigrants, partly through an increase of the highly skilled natives who work in those firms.

The possibility that immigrants, by helping firms (grow and survive), also help native workers stay employed

and productive in thriving firms, may be at the basis of the result that competition from immigrants does not

seem to hurt the labor market opportunities of natives (see Lewis and Peri 2015 for a review). This paper offers

a new angle to understand that effect on labor market.

  controls as we do not have such information when the firm is not observed in DADS (we squared the dataset to compute the exit dummy). Standard
  errors are clustered at the department level. *, **, *** indicate significance at the 10, 5 and 1% confidence level.
