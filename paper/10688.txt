                                       ABSTRACT
We use survey data that have been linked to medical records data and city-level drug prices to

estimate the demand for illicit drugs among pregnant women. The prevalence of prenatal drug use

based on post partum interviews was much lower than that based on evidence in the mothers' and

babies' medical records. We found that a $10 increase in the retail price of a gram of pure cocaine

decreases illicit drug use by 12 to 15%. The estimated price effects for heroin are lower than for

cocaine and are less robust across alternative model specifications. This study provides the first

estimates of the effects of drug prices on prenatal drug use and yields important information about

the potential of drug enforcement as a tool for improving birth outcomes.

I. Introduction


       Pregnant women can invest in the health of their unborn children through the use of

prenatal inputs such as nutrition and prenatal care, and by avoiding unhealthy behaviors, such as

smoking cigarettes and using drugs. Economists have been modeling the demand for prenatal

care as an input into the production of infant health for about 20 years (for example, see Corman,

Joyce and Grossman, 1987). Several studies have modeled the demand for cigarettes by pregnant

women (see, for example, Evans and Ringel, 1999) and have estimated the price elasticity to be

about -0.50. From this result, they have concluded that higher taxes on tobacco have some

potential to improve birth outcomes.

       Less is known about the demand for illicit drugs among pregnant women. The lack of

knowledge stems from a lack of data. Due to the illegal nature of drug transactions and stigma

related to usage, pregnant women are especially likely to underreport drug usage in surveys. In

this paper, we use survey from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing study that have been

linked to medical records data and city-level drug prices to estimate the demand for illegal drugs

among pregnant women. Our results provide the first estimates of the absolute and relative

effects (compared to other factors) of drug prices on prenatal drug use and yield important

information about the potential of drug enforcement as a tool for improving birth outcomes.




                                                                                                  2
II. Background

       We know of no study that has estimated the demand for illicit drugs among pregnant

women, although there are two sets of studies in the economics literature that are related to this

topic. One set focuses on the demand for tobacco by pregnant women. The other examines the

demand for illicit drugs in the population and estimates price elasticities or policy effects. Our

study bridges these two literatures by estimating the demand for illicit drugs among pregnant

women and calculating elasticities of participation with respect to drug prices.

       Studies of the demand for tobacco products by pregnant women have been motivated by

the fact that smoking is a behavior known to be harmful to both the mother and the developing

fetus. Although much less is known about the effects of prenatal use of illicit drugs such as

cocaine during pregnancy, there is reason to believe that such substances also have detrimental

effects on the fetus. The medical literature on this topic is extensive but not conclusive; the most

recent study we have found (Singer et al. 2004) indicates that prenatal cocaine exposure can

increase the risk of certain cognitive impairments of offspring, particularly those raised in

cognitively nonstimulating environments. One of the few studies by economists (Kaestner, Joyce

and Wehbeh, 1996) found that illicit drug use during pregnancy reduces birth weight by 5 to 10

percent. Overall, the evidence, though limited, squares with the common sense notion that illicit

drug use during pregnancy is harmful to the fetus.

       We first discuss the literature on the demand for illicit drugs and then go over the relevant

literature on smoking during pregnancy. In a recent comprehensive literature review, Grossman,

Chaloupka, and Shim (2002) reported that most studies examining the demand for illicit drugs

are based on two surveys: the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA) and the

national Monitoring the Future survey. Both of these data sets contain self-reported measures of




                                                                                                     3
drug use (versus objective measures) and it is therefore possible that misreporting is correlated

with the intensity of drug use (i.e., the lightest users may be the most or the least likely to report

having used drugs). According to Grossman, Chaloupka, and Shim, the existing literature reveals

that the demand for cocaine among teens and young adults is more price elastic than that among

older adults.

       Grossman and Chaloupka (1998) estimated the demand for cocaine using Monitoring the

Future data within a "rational addiction" framework. They focused on cocaine because it was the

second most frequently reported drug (after marijuana) in their data set and because good

estimates of price are available. In their rational addiction specification, which controlled for past

and future participation, they found that the short-run participation elasticity among youths in

grades 8 through 12 was about -1.0.

       Saffer and Chaloupka (1999a) used the NHSDA to estimate participation elasticities of

demand for heroin, cocaine, and marijuana. They found that annual participation elasticities

varied between -0.30 and -0.60 for cocaine and between -0.60 and -0.90 for heroin. Because the

NHSDA sample represents the overall population and Monitoring the Future is a youth sample, it

is not surprising to find lower participation elasticities in the NHSDA.

       In another study using the NHSDA, Saffer and Chaloupka (1999b) estimated cocaine

elasticities for different demographic groups and found that they were higher for women and

youth than for the overall sample. Given these patterns, we would expect that urban unmarried

women (a broad characterization of the sample we use in the current paper) would have high

cocaine participation elasticities. Finally, Saffer, Chaloupka, and Dave (2001) found, in both

structural and reduced-form models, that illicit drug use varies inversely with state expenditures




                                                                                                         4
for drug control. This result indicates that it may be important to control for state policies when

examining variations in the demand for illicit drugs.

       The current study examines prenatal usage of illicit drugs within a cohort of urban,

mostly unmarried women who have just given birth. Our sample is not representative of the

population of pregnant women, for three reasons: (1) Non-marital births are overrepresented, (2)

births were sampled exclusively in large cities, and (3) there may be sample selection bias, since

drug usage may affect both the probability of becoming pregnant and the decision whether or not

to abort. For all of these reasons, our sample of new mothers is likely to over-represent prenatal

drug abusers.

       Mensch and Kandel (1992), examining data from the National Longitudinal Survey of

Youth (NLSY), found that unmarried teens who use drugs other than marijuana are almost four

times as likely to become pregnant as those who did not; although they are also more likely to

have abortions, their pregnancies are more than twice as likely to result in live births. In contrast,

Grossman, Kaestner and Markowitz (2002), using more recent data from the NLSY, did not find

conclusive evidence that alcohol and marijuana use by teens leads to increased risky sexual

behavior. They concluded that omitted characteristics, such as tastes for risky behavior, likely

explain the association between drug use and teenage pregnancy. Taken together, this small

literature leaves us uncertain about the extent of selection bias in our sample of urban, mostly

non-marital births.

       Though not necessarily representative of all pregnant women, our sample of urban,

mostly unmarried mothers who have given birth represents an important group to study from a

public policy standpoint in that it is likely to include chronic or heavy users and consists of the

very users that impose some of the heaviest costs on infants and society.




                                                                                                      5
       Cigarette smoking among pregnant women has received a great deal of attention in the

public health arena. Economists have examined the role that cigarette prices play in determining

the demand for this risky behavior. A recent paper by Colman, Grossman and Joyce (2003)

provided an excellent review of recent literature on the demand for cigarette smoking by

pregnant women. They cite studies by Evans and Ringel (1999), Ringel and Evans (2001),

Gruber and Köszegi (2001), and Ebrahim et al. (2000), among others. Based on vital statistics

data, these studies revealed participation elasticities ranging from about -0.2 to -0.7. Colman,

Grossman and Joyce (2003) addressed the issue of quit rates during pregnancy, and explored the

possibility that pregnant women may be more sensitive to price changes than non-pregnant

women. Using Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) data, they found high

sensitivities of pregnant and pre-pregnant women to increases in cigarette prices—elasticities

that were closer to -1.0 than those found in studies measuring price elasticities in the broader

(mostly non-pregnant) population. They provided convincing evidence that women who are

pregnant are more sensitive to price changes than non-pregnant women because of the added

total costs (in terms of the health of the unborn child) of smoking.

       Overall, the literature indicates that both drug users and pregnant women who smoke are

fairly sensitive to variations in price. We know of no other study that has examined variations in

drug prices as a factor in affecting drug use among pregnant women. The main reason for the

dearth of research on this topic is the lack of accurate data on prenatal drug use. We combine

high quality data on prenatal drug use obtained from both medical records and maternal

interviews with city-level data on drug prices to conduct the first ever study of the price

responsiveness of prenatal drug use.




                                                                                                   6
III. Data

        We use data from a recent national birth cohort survey that has been linked to medical

records of mother respondents and their babies. The Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing

(FFCWB) survey follows a cohort of new parents and their children in 20 U.S. cities (in 15

states). The study was designed to provide information about the conditions and capabilities of

new (mostly unwed) parents; the nature, determinants, and trajectories of their relationships; and

the long-term consequences for parents and children of welfare reform and other policies. The

survey data are rich in sociodemographic characteristics of both mothers and fathers, as well as

parents’ relationships and living arrangements.

        The FFCWB study randomly sampled births in 75 hospitals between 1998 and 2000. By

design, approximately three quarters of the mothers interviewed were unmarried. Face-to-face

interviews were conducted with 4898 mothers while they were still in the hospital after giving

birth. The data, when weighted, are representative of births in U.S. cities with over 200,000

people.1 Additional data have been collected from the hospital medical records (from the birth)

for a sub-sample of 1867 births in 10 cities (in 7 states). The medical record data contain

information on prenatal drug use from laboratory tests of the mother or baby and from notes by

physicians or social workers (more detail is given below, under “Measures”).

        In this paper, we use data on the 1748 births that have medical records data as well as

complete data on all analysis variables.

IV. Measures

A. Prenatal drug use

         Prenatal drug use is notoriously underreported. The illegal nature of drug use and the fear

of child protective services involvement are likely reasons for this. Kaestner, Joyce and Wehbeh

(1996) modeled the measurement error in self-reported drug use by combining data on self-

reports with "actual use" based on urine tests. They found that only 17% of women who tested

positive for illicit drug use at the time their children were born reported that they had used drugs.



         Arendt et al (1999) compared the sensitivity of different sources of data on prenatal

cocaine use for 323 births: medical records, urine screens, meconium analyses, and postpartum

interviews. They assumed no false positives from any source. Surprisingly, the clinical measures

(urine and meconium screens, together) revealed fewer cases of cocaine use than medical records

in conjunction with post-partum interviews. They concluded that a combination of medical

records analysis and post-partum interview is the best way to ascertain prenatal cocaine use.

         Although the Fragile Families interview was far less detailed on the issue of illicit drug

use than the one used by Arendt et al., we adopted the strategy of combining responses to a post-

partum survey with a detailed review of the mothers’ and babies’ medical records. During the

mother’s interview in the hospital after giving birth, she was asked whether she had used any

illicit drugs during her pregnancy, but not about the use of specific types of drugs.2 In the

medical records of the mother and baby, there were a number of places where prenatal drug use

could have been mentioned.


2
 The exact question asked was, " During your pregnancy, about how often did you use drugs such as marijuana,
crack cocaine, or heroin-- nearly every day, several times a week, several times a month, less than once a month, or
never." When coding prenatal drug use based on the interview responses, those answering anything but "never"
were considered prenatal drug users.


                                                                                                                       8
         The medical records contained information about the mother’s drug use during pregnancy

from laboratory test results on the mother or baby and in notes by physicians, nurses, or social

workers. Forty four percent of the 1748 mothers in our sample had results from urine toxin

screens in their charts3; of these 99 (13%) tested positive for cocaine, heroin, marijuana, other

drugs (including amphetamines, methadone and barbiturates/benzioazepines) or unspecified

drugs, or a combination of drugs.

         Another 91 cases of prenatal drug use were picked up from notes in various places in the

mothers’ and babies’ charts. Overall, 190 (10.9%) of the mothers in our sample had some

indication of prenatal drug use recorded in their own or their babies’ charts; of these, 17 percent

used cocaine, 4 percent used heroin, 47 percent used marijuana, 4 percent used other drugs

(including amphetamines, methadone and barbiturates/benzioazepines) or unspecified drugs, and

28 percent used a combination of drugs.

         We constructed three measures of prenatal drug use: whether the mother indicated in the

interview that she had used illicit drugs at all during the pregnancy (5.7%), whether there was

any indication of prenatal drug use in the mother’s or baby’s medical record (10.9%), and

whether there was indication of prenatal drug use from the interview or medical records (11.5%).

The percentages based on medical records are high and in the range presented in a review of

sixteen studies by Howell, Heiser, and Harrington (1999). They also are consistent with the rates

found in a recent survey that asked individuals whether they were pregnant, and if they were,

whether they had used any illicit drug in the past year (about 14%) or in the past month (about

5%) (SAMHSA 2000)4.


3
  Unlike the Arendt et al. study, urine screens were not collected as a part of the FFCWB data study. Rather, the
screens were conducted during the normal course of medical care.

           Table 1 shows the levels of agreement between the two sources of reports. Of the 100

mothers who reported having used drugs in the interview, 89% had evidence of prenatal drug use

in the medical records. Of the 190 mothers with evidence of prenatal drug use in the medical

records, less than 47% reported in the interview that they had used drugs. It is thus clear that the

interviews missed a large number of cases of actual drug use. Because it is unlikely that mothers

would report that they had used drugs during pregnancy when they actually had not and because

the medical record evidence of drug use also is unlikely to be incorrect, we base most of our

analyses on the measure of whether the mother reported in the interview that she used drugs or

there was evidence in the medical records that she had done so (11.5% of sample). We refer to

this measure as the “either/or” measure.

B. Drug Prices

           Data on cocaine and heroin prices for the ten metropolitan areas in this study were

computed from purchases made by undercover drug enforcement agents. The System to Retrieve

Information from Drug Evidence (STRIDE), maintained by the Drug Enforcement Agency

(DEA), records the total cost, amount, and potency of these drug purchases.5 Since these data

are based on actual transactions, they directly reflect street level prices. These prices are

expected to be relatively accurate because any unreasonable price offered by a DEA agent may

raise suspicion on the dealer’s part and endanger the agent. However, because the transactions

are of varying quantity and quality, the cost of each drug must be standardized.6

           Standardized prices of one pure gram of cocaine and heroin in a given metropolitan area

for a given year are derived in the following manner:

           (1)     Log Costijt = π0 + π1 log Potencyijt + π2 log Amountijt + π3j ∑ MSAj


5
    Data on marijuana prices are too limited to include in this analysis.
6
    See Dave (2004) and Saffer and Chaloupka (1999a) for further discussion of STRIDE.


                                                                                                  10
                                    + π4t Yeart + π5jt ∑ MSAj * Yeart + υijt

The subscripts denote the ith transaction in the jth metropolitan area (MSA) for year t. Cost refers

to the total cost of the purchase, amount is the total gram weight of the purchase, and potency is

the percent of the total amount that represents pure drug. MSA and year refer to dichotomous

indicators of each, and MSA*Year refers to indicators of the interaction between the two.

Because we are interested in the retail price of heroin, we include only buys of 40 grams or less.

The price of one pure gram of the drug in MSA j for year t is then imputed as:

        (2)      exp ( π0 + π3j + π4t + π5jt ) .

        In order to maximize the sample size for estimation, prices that are missing in any given

metropolitan area for any given year were imputed by the mean of the prices for all other

available metropolitan areas in that particular state.7 The strong addictive properties of cocaine

and heroin imply an intertemporal reinforcement effect wherein current consumption is

positively affected by past consumption.8 Thus, current drug use will be affected by past drug

prices in addition to the current price. In order to maximize the variation in drug prices and

minimize collinearity in our small sample, a three-year average of the cocaine and heroin price

was used in the analysis, based on the year of birth and the two preceding years.9 This measure

allowed for both contemporaneous and lagged effects of prices on prenatal drug use.10

        One of the advantages of this study is that the drug prices are computed and merged at

the city level. Many prior studies on the demand for illicit drugs used state-average prices despite


7
  Results were not sensitive to this imputation.
8
  See Chaloupka et al. (2000) and Dave (2004).
9
  The births took place over a three-year period, from 1998 to 2000. Because we employed three-year averages, the
drug prices span 1996-1998 for the women interviewed in 1998, and 1998-2000 for the women interviewed in 2000.
In order to ensure that our results are not affected by changes in drug price over time, we examined trends from
1996 to 2000. For both cocaine and heroin, we found no clear trends in real prices per pure gram over this period. As
data from more cities and years become available, we will be able to distinguish between short- and long-run price
effects.
10
   Using two-year average drug prices did not materially change the results.


                                                                                                                 11
the fact that drug prices seem to vary widely from city to city. Granted, there may be substantial

intra-city variation in drug prices at any given time, but the measurement error is likely to be

much smaller using city-level than state-level prices. Studies have also shown that the drug price

measures from STRIDE are strongly correlated with the cost of supplying drugs to the retail

market. Kuziemko and Levitt (2001) found that STRIDE cocaine prices from 1986 through 1996

are positively related to state-level indicators of the certainty of punishment, measured by the per

capita number of drug arrests, and the severity of punishment, measured by the fraction of drug

arrests resulting in imprisonment. Basov, Jacobson, and Miron (2001) argued that due to the

illicit, secretive nature of the drug trade, both production and sales are labor intensive compared

to legal markets. Most of these jobs are also likely to be filled by low-skilled employees, youths,

or others with fewer outside opportunities. Their study showed that cocaine and heroin prices

from STRIDE are positively related to the state-specific relative unskilled wage in a time series

of states from 1974 to 1999. The results from these two studies confirm that DEA drug prices do

indeed reflect costs of retailing including expected penalties associated with this activity and

labor costs.

C. Control variables

       One of the advantages of the FFCWB data is that they include a rich set of characteristics

of both the mother and the father. Table 2 shows the means of the variables used in our analyses.

We include a basic set of covariates that are typically available in birth certificate data—maternal

age, education, race/ethnicity, nativity, marital status, and previous births. We also include

insurance information (whether the birth was covered by Medicaid), whether the mother lived

with both parents at age 15, whether she attended religious services regularly, whether she was




                                                                                                   12
married at the time of conception (instead of at the time of the birth),11 how long she knew the

father before conception, the father’s age, and the father's education.

         In order to control for city-specific factors that may affect both city-level drug prices and

drug use, we include characteristics of the mother’s city of residence (unemployment rate and

median yearly family income) in certain models. In other models, we include state fixed effects

to control for state-level policies, such as the funding of drug treatment programs or the strictness

of drug enforcement, which may affect prenatal drug use.12

         Our analyses focus on the effects of retail drug prices on drug use during pregnancy. As

shown in Table 2, the mean retail price of one pure gram of cocaine is about $90 with a standard

deviation of $22, and the mean price of one pure gram of heroin is about $214 with a standard

deviation of $66. These prices are deflated by the national CPI and reported in constant 2000

dollars (in $10 denomination). Both price series move together with a simple correlation of 0.63

(not shown in Table).

         As is clear from Table 2, the mothers in the sample are predominantly minority,

unmarried (as indicated earlier, this was by design), and poor or near-poor (two-thirds of births

were covered by Medicaid or another government program). The third and fourth columns show

the characteristics of the sample by whether or not the mothers used drugs during pregnancy

(based on the either/or measure). Although both users and non-users were about the same mean

age, 25 years old, they differed with regard to race/ethnicity, poverty (as indicated by Medicaid

receipt), marital status, and whether the mother was an immigrant. Over one-quarter (26%) of the


11
   This variable is based on marriage dates, birth dates, and the baby’s gestational age.
12
   Because our sample includes data from 10 cities in only 7 states, we face certain limitations. First, we could not
investigate the effects of state policy variations. Instead, in certain models, we included state fixed effects to hold
constant the entire state policy regime. Second, because of limited variation in both the number of states and in the
city-level drug prices, particularly for heroin prices, there may be collinearity between state fixed effects and drug
prices. For this reason, we estimate models both with and without state fixed effects. Finally, there was not enough
city variation within states to include both state fixed effects and city-level variables in the same models.


                                                                                                                      13
non-users were married at the time of the birth, compared to only 8% of the drug users. There

was a larger mean age difference between the mother and the father among the drug users than

the non-users. Users were less likely than non-users to attend religious services regularly and to

have lived with both parents at age 15. Drug users were more likely than non-users to live in

cities with high unemployment rates and low incomes. The non-users were more likely than the

drug users to be having their first birth. Importantly, the mean city-level drug prices of both

cocaine and heroin were higher for the non-drug users than for the drug users. In order to control

for confounding influences of other factors on this association (between drug prices and prenatal

drug use), we turn to multivariate models.



V. Multivariate Analysis

        We estimate the use of drugs during pregnancy based on maternal characteristics,

paternal measures, either city-level economic characteristics or state fixed effects, and three-year

averages of cocaine or heroin prices in the metropolitan area where the baby was born.13 As is

typically done in studies of the demand for drugs, we assume that drug prices are exogenous to

the women in our sample.14

        In Tables 3a (with cocaine prices) and 3b (with heroin prices), we present estimates from

probit models in which the dependent variable is equal to one if the mother used drugs according

to the either/or measure. Each column corresponds to a different model specification. We present

the probit coefficient, the standard error (in parentheses), and the marginal effect of a one-unit

change in that variable on the probability that the mother used drugs during the pregnancy [in

 Because of the high degree of correlation between the two price measures, models were not run with both
measures included.




                                                                                                           14
square brackets]. For example, in column (1) of Table 3a, the probit coefficient of the mother

being a high school graduate (as opposed to having less than a high school education, the

reference category), is -.241 and the marginal effect of -0.033, which means that being a high

school graduate reduces the probability that the mother used drugs during pregnancy by 3.3

percentage points compared to having less than a high school education, all else equal.

         In both Tables 3a and 3b, Model 1 includes a basic set of covariates that are typically

found in birth records, plus the real average retail cocaine (heroin) price per pure gram

(expressed in $10 denominations for the base year of 2000). Model 2 includes the same set of

basic covariates plus state fixed effects. Model 3 includes the same set of basic covariates as in

Model 1, plus city-level median yearly family income rather than state fixed effects.15 Model 4

includes additional or more refined measures of maternal characteristics—whether the birth was

covered by Medicaid, whether the mother lived with both parents when she was 15 years of age,

whether she was married at the time of conception rather than at the birth, whether she knew the

father for at least one year before the baby was conceived, whether the father had at least a high

school education, the age difference between the father and the mother, and whether the mother

attended religious services on a regular basis—as well as cocaine (heroin) prices and state fixed

effects. Finally, Model 5 includes all of the covariates in Model 4 plus city-level median yearly

family income rather than state fixed effects.




14
   One reason researchers make this assumption is that cocaine and heroin are basically agricultural goods that cost
little to produce. The supply price is then a function of the supply of workers willing to risk penalties to engage in
the production and sale of the retail product, and the expected penalties imposed by local governments.
15
   In another specification not shown, we substituted city-level unemployment for city-level income. Results were
similar to the ones presented here. Data limitations did not allow us to include state- and multiple city-level variables
in the same equations.


                                                                                                                     15
         Both low education and poverty (proxied by Medicaid) increased the likelihood that

mothers used drugs during pregnancy.16 Hispanic women were less likely to use drugs than non-

Hispanic white or non-Hispanic black women, all else equal. Having had previous births did not

seem to impact prenatal drug usage in our sample, but being married to the baby’s father at the

time of the birth was negatively associated with drug use during pregnancy. Mothers born

outside the United States were less likely to use drugs than native-born mothers, and the more

the father’s age exceeds the mother’s, the more likely the mother used drugs. Overall, the results

for the maternal and paternal characteristics are consistent with our prior expectations (based on

the past studies of the determinants of drug use and prenatal smoking). As a group, the state

fixed effects are significant predictors of prenatal drug use, suggesting that policies may affect

maternal behavior. These results hold whether we use cocaine or heroin prices in our models.

         From Table 3a, we find that cocaine prices per pure gram have consistent and significant

effects on mothers' use of drugs during pregnancy. The marginal effects vary between -.014 and

-.017, which means that a $10 increase in the price of a gram of pure cocaine decreases illicit

drug use by 12 to 15%.17 From Table 3b, we find that heroin prices also have a significant effect

on illicit drug use in models that do not include state fixed effects18, with a $10 increase in price

decreasing prenatal drug use by 4 to 5%.19 We take advantage of having different sources of data

on mothers’ drug use to examine how much of a difference the choice of measure makes. Tables

4a and 4b show “Model 5”estimates using three different measures of prenatal drug use: That

based only on the interview (columns 1 and 2), that based only on the medical records (columns


16
   It is possible that drug usage causes women to have income low enough to qualify for means-tested programs such
as Medicaid. If this were true, then we are measuring causality in the wrong direction. This is also possible with
some of our other variables such as marital status, age difference, and other variables. In our sensitivity analyses,
discussed below, we address such possible biases for covariates other than drug prices.
17
   We divide the marginal effects by .115, the proportion of the sample that used drugs during pregnancy.
18
   As discussed earlier, it appears that there is collinearity between the state fixed effects and heroin prices.

   The estimates pertain to models 1, 3, and 5.


                                                                                                                  16
3 and 4), and that based on the either/or measure (columns 5 and 6). The last two columns are

identical to Model 5 in each of Tables 3a and 3b. We would expect the marginal effects in

column (2) to be lower than those in column (6), since less than half of the women who used

drugs (according to the either/or measure) responded positively to the interview question. Indeed,

for either cocaine or heroin, the marginal effect of a $10 increase in price on the proportion of

pregnant women using drugs was about three times greater when using data from medical

records or interviews as opposed to using the interview data alone. Additionally, the statistical

significance was greater when using the either/or measure. The differences in effect size indicate

that relying solely on self-reported drug use would lead one to underestimate the responsiveness

of prenatal drug use to variations in price.20 The differences in statistical significance suggest

that analyses based on self-reported drug usage are prone to Type II errors (incorrectly

“accepting” the null hypothesis of no price effect).

         Table 5 indicates the ranges of the demand elasticities implied by the results of Models 1

though 5, using each of the three drug use measures: maternal interview, medical reports, and the

either/or measure. The elasticities are based on mean values of drug usage and drug prices. For

cocaine prices, elasticities range between -.77 and -1.37. Though higher than those from studies

cited earlier, these elasticities are credible in light of past research indicating that women and

youth have higher participation elasticities than other groups and that pregnant women are more

responsive to drug prices than non-pregnant women. Heroin price elasticities vary more than

cocaine prices across specifications with and without state fixed effects. However, the higher

estimates of heroin price elasticity are close to the price elasticities of cocaine.

20
  The rate of drug usage based either/or measure is about twice as high as that based on the interviews alone and the
coefficients of drug prices are about three times as large. Thus, relying on the interviews alone would underestimate
the price responsiveness of prenatal drug usage due to both the underreporting of drug usage and the greater price




                                                                                                                  17
        We examined several alternative specifications to test the robustness of our results. First,

we took into consideration that our measure of drug use is somewhat imprecise in that we

combined all illicit drugs together. In our sample, as in the SAMHSA survey discussed earlier,

many women used marijuana, a less powerful and addictive drug than cocaine and most others.

In addition, a few of the women in our survey used methadone, which may not be illegal. As a

sensitivity test, we ran models excluding women who we know used only methadone or

marijuana. The results (not shown) were highly consistent with those in Tables 3a and 3b and

elasticities were very similar to those in Table 5. Additionally, since many of the covariates other

than drug prices may be endogenous (as discussed earlier), we ran additional models that

included only age, race, education, and drug prices (plus state fixed effects or city income

level)—variables are unlikely to be influenced by drug usage or unobserved individual-level

characteristics. Results of the effect of drug prices on drug usage in these models are similar to

those found in Tables 3a and 3b. The consistency of the price effects across alternative

specifications suggests that they do not reflect unobserved factors. Finally, we ran models that

also consider two prenatal behaviors other than drug use—smoking cigarettes at all during the

pregnancy (from the survey) and first-trimester initiation of prenatal care (from the medical

record). These variables may reflect a taste (or distaste) for risky behaviors, but are endogenous

in that they could be "caused" by drug use or correlated with risk factors that are unobserved. To

the extent that these behaviors are exogenous to drug usage, they may proxy the mother's taste

for risky behaviors during the pregnancy. Holding these other risky behaviors constant, the

effects of drug prices on drug usage were within the range of those presented in Tables 3a

through 4b.

VI. Conclusion

       We found that the demand for illicit drugs among pregnant women is quite responsive to

drug prices. This is an important finding because impacting prices is one of the key methods by

which the public sector can affect the demand for illicit, unhealthy substances and is potentially

one of the key weapons in the war on drugs. As we expected based on the literature reviewed

earlier, the participation elasticities with respect to price for our sample are much higher than

those that have been found for the general population, for three reasons: (1) Our sample is

exclusively urban and over-represents unmarried, young, minority women. For this group, the

monetary price of drugs represents a larger portion of the full price of drugs (since their

opportunity cost of time is lower). Thus, a given change in the monetary price represents a large

change in the full price, yielding a larger consumption response and a larger elasticity. (2)

Pregnant women are likely more rational/forward looking than non-pregnant women. Thus, they

may have a lower reservation price for using drugs, since they are also taking into account the

future consequences on their babies of their current behavior. With a lower reservation price, a

given increase in drug prices will cause more pregnant women to quit than non-pregnant women,

yielding a higher elasticity. (3) We used an objective measure of drug use that likely captured

casual (more elastic) drug use not picked up in the interviews. The fact that measures of prenatal

drug use based on medical records yield higher participation elasticities than those based on self

reports from maternal interviews suggests that results based on self-reported drug use should be

interpreted with caution.
