                                              ABSTRACT

This paper investigates the relationship between the Japanese firms’ exposure to the exchange rate
risk and risk management, such as choice of invoicing currency, and financial and operational hedge.
The firm’s exposure to the exchange rate risk is estimated by co-movements of the stock prices and
exchange rates, following Dominguez (1998) and others. Data on risk management measures—financial
and operational hedging, the choice of invoice currency and the price revision strategy (pass-through)—were
collected from a questionnaire survey covering all Tokyo Stock Exchange listed firms in 2009. Results
show the followings: First, firms with greater dependency on sales in foreign markets have greater
foreign exchange exposure. Second, the higher the US dollar invoicing share, the greater is the foreign
exchange exposure. But, risk is reduced by both financial and operational hedging. Third, yen invoicing
reduces foreign exchange exposure. These findings indicate that Japanese firms use the combination
of risk management tools to mitigate the degree of the exchange rate risk.

1. Introduction

     A period of strong yen squeeze profits of Japanese exporters either by lower sales with
higher prices, in case that yen appreciation is passed through to the retail prices in the
destination market, or by a decline in the profit margin, in case that it is not passed through, in
the destination market. Between 2008 and 2012, the yen appreciated vis-à-vis the US dollar by
more than 30 percent. Since the yen was floated in 1973, Japanese firms have continuously
concerned and struggled with the yen appreciation, and this time was no exception.
     Various ways to manage foreign exchange risk have been developed by the Japanese
exporters over the time. Even though some production bases have been moved abroad,
significant production capacity remains in Japan. Those productions in Japan are still exposed to
the exchange rate risk—a long-term yen appreciation trend and short-term volatility.
     Japanese firms usually use both financial and operational hedges to manage their currency
exposure. Financial hedges are conducted mainly with the use of currency derivatives, while
operational hedges are devised in the firm's international transactions between the head office
and foreign subsidiaries. With the development of financial hedge techniques, such as forward
transactions, currency swaps, and currency options, firms can hedge their currency exposure
against foreign exchange risks. However, these transactions, which determines the yen receipt
with certainty if fully hedged, can be used only for the horizon of several months, and with
some costs. Financial hedge cannot be effective in the long-run. In response to the
unprecedented level of strong yen in the mid-1990s, Japanese exporting firms have accelerated
moving and expanding production bases overseas. The firms have also increased the proportion
of imported components from overseas and taken other counter measures to mitigate the
damage from the stronger yen.
     It is well-known that Japan is an outlier in the pattern of invoicing currencies. According to
"stylized facts" of the choice of invoice currency, which were developed in the 1970s following
the seminal work of Grassman (1973), trades between two economically advanced countries
tend to be invoiced in the exporter's currency, and trade between economically advanced and
developing countries is generally invoiced in the advanced country’s currency. However,
Japan’s currency invoicing pattern differs from these stylized facts1. According to the Ministry
of Finance data, Japanese exporters have a strong tendency to choose the importer’s currency
for their exports to advanced countries such as the US and EU. For exports to Asia, the US
dollar, which is the currency of the third country, is commonly used. This is one of the reasons
why currency risk management is a serious problem among the Japanese firms. If their exports

representative exporters.

                                                                                                          2
were invoiced in the yen, their business performance would not have been affected as much as it
has actually been during the strong yen periods. Besides invoicing, firms can change export
prices, even if the invoicing currency is in the yen in the medium-term (in the next export
contract period). How often the firms adjust the export prices in response to the exchange rate
(i.e., pass-through), is a variable that the firms choose to decide. If firms are so competitive that
they can raise their product prices to offset losses from yen appreciation, then the exchange rate
fluctuations would not cause any severe impact on their profit performance. Accordingly, the
medium-term effectiveness of exchange risk management depends on the choice of invoicing
currency and the degree of pass-through, both of which depends on competitiveness of products.
     Then, how can the effectiveness of Japanese firms' exchange rate risk management be
measured? One possible way is to measure each firm's exchange rate exposure, and to
investigate the relationship between the exchange rate exposure and the exchange rate risk
management. We follow previous studies (such as Dominguez (1998) and Doukas (2003)) that
have derived exchange rate exposure by estimating the sensitivity of firms’ cash flows to the
fluctuations in the exchange rate. The value of a firm is the present value of its future cash flow
stream and the current exchange rate variation will affect the cash flows in the future. To date,
many empirical studies have used stock returns as a proxy for the firm value, and have obtained
exchange rate exposure from a regression of stock returns on an exchange rate change.
Although the issue of how to measure firms’ exposure to the exchange rate fluctuations has been
investigated by many researchers in the field of corporate finance, few existing studies have
specifically undertaken the firm level analysis of the exchange rate exposure and exchange rate
risk management including the choice of invoice currency and pass-through policy.
     In order to obtain information on how export firms are coping with the exchange rate
fluctuation, an ad hoc questionnaire survey was designed and conducted with the cooperation of
the Research Institute of Economy, Trade, and Industry (RIETI). Questionnaires were sent in
September 2009 to 920 Japanese manufacturing firms. They were selected among those listed
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange with a criterion that they reported foreign sales in the
consolidated financial statements in fiscal year 2008 and 2009. Our sample firms are those that
responded to the RIETI Survey 2009. The number of our samples is 227, spreading across 15
industries: Food, Textile, Chemicals, Medicinal Chemicals, Coal and Oil Products, Rubber
Products, Glass and Stone Products, Iron and Steel, Non-Metal Products, Metal Products,
General Machinery, Electrical Machinery, Transport Equipment, Precision Instruments and
Other products. The response rate was 25% (=227/920). The questionnaire survey (hereafter,
the 2009 RIETI survey) provided us with new information on Japanese firm's use of financial
and operational hedging, price revision in response to the exchange rate changes, and choice of
invoicing currency. The survey results are aggregated by industry and by the firm size, using


                                                                                                   3
annual financial reports of sample firms. See Appendix 1 for the basic information of responded
firms.
    Our analysis shows how Japanese firms combine three different tools of exchange rate risk
management, such as operational and financial hedging, and exchange rate pass-through under
their own choice of invoicing currency, to reduce their exchange rate exposure. Given a growing
regional production network of Japanese firms, our findings based on the questionnaire study
will present important implications for future exchange rate policies to support more effective
exchange rate risk management.
    The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews earlier literature of
firms' foreign exchange risk management and presents a discussion of the relationship between
the variety of exchange rate risk management and invoicing currency choice conducted by
Japanese firms. Section 3 reviews the methodology of firm exchange rate exposure and presents
our estimation results. Section 4 conducts empirical analyses to find the relation between
exchange rate risk management and the exchange rate exposure. Finally section 5 concludes this
paper.


2. Exchange Rate Risk Management of Japanese Firms

2-1. Variety of Exchange Rate Risk Management


    Numerous empirical studies have examined the question of how firms accommodate or
mitigate foreign exchange risk. Usually, firms use two means to hedge exchange rate risk. One
is a financial hedge through financial market instruments such as exchange rate derivatives or
foreign currency debt. The other is an operational hedge through operational organization of the
exporting firm. To manage long-term exchange rate risks effectively, firms should build
operational hedging strategies in addition to widely used financial hedging strategies. Most
studies specifically examine currency hedging2. These studies analyze the relation between
operational hedging and financial hedging and underscore the effectiveness of both strategies by
conducting empirical analysis based on firms' stock return. For example, Pantzalis, Simkins, and
Laux (2001), using a sample of 220 US multinational firms, and find that operational and
financial hedges are complementary risk management strategies. Hommel (2003) shows that
operational hedging creates flexibility, a strategic complement to financial hedging. Allayannis,
Ihrig and Weston (2003) also investigate both financial and operational exchange-rate risk


2
  For example, Carter, Pantzalis, and Simkins (2001) investigate the impact of firmwide risk
management practices for US multinational corporations and find that currency risk can be reduced
effectively through transactions in the forward exchange market.

                                                                                               4
management strategies of multinational firms and confirm that operational hedging strategies
benefit shareholders only when used in combination with financial hedging strategies. Kim,
Mathur and Nam (2006) investigate how operational hedging is related to financial hedging.
They confirm that although operational and financial hedging strategies are complementary,
firms using operational hedging are less dependent on the use of financial derivatives3.
    The relationship between invoicing currency and hedging is rarely investigated. The
exception was a study by Döhring (2008), which was the first reported survey study of both the
choice of invoicing currency and financial/operational hedging. Results show that invoicing
choice is a substitute for derivative hedging such as exchange rate forward in eliminating
transaction risk and also that firms are expected to opt for either of them depending on the
relative cost of the strategy. Conducting a survey of actual hedging strategies and techniques of
large corporations from a euro-area perspective, Döhring (2008) concludes that whether a
domestic currency invoicing and hedging are substitutes or complements depends crucially on
the size and geographical orientation of the exporting firm and on the structure of the
destination market.4
    As for recent country-specific studies, Chiand and Lin (2007) examine financial and
operational hedge strategies of foreign exchange exposures using multiple-horizon data of
Taiwan non-financial firms during 1998–2005. They report that the use of operational hedging
strategies does not help reduce foreign exchange exposure for Taiwan firms. Pramborg (2005)
compares the hedging practices between Swedish and Korean nonfinancial firms and shows that
Korean firms used much smaller financial derivatives than Swedish firms with more
dependence on foreign debt than derivatives. Both studies describe the difficulties of exchange
rate risk management in underdeveloped foreign exchange markets such as those of Taiwan and
Korea. Regarding research using data for Japan, Jayasinghe and Tsui (2008) examine the
exchange rate exposure of sectoral indexes in Japanese industries and report evidence of
exposed returns and its asymmetric conditional volatility of exchange rate exposure using a
bivariate GJR-GARCH model. Although Japanese exporting firms tend to face large volatility
of the yen/US dollar exchange rate, surprisingly few studies conduct firm level analysis of
hedging and exchange rate risk management with the choice of invoicing currency.


2-2. Japanese Firms' Feature of Currency Invoicing and Pass Through

  They use a sample of 424 firm observations from the COMPUSTAT Geographic Segment files for
1998.

  Regarding the relation between pass-through and hedging, Bartram, Brown and Minton (2010)
shows empirically that firms pass-through some porting of currency changes to customers and use
both operational and financial hedges for the rest of the foreign exchange exposure.

                                                                                               5
     According to the "stylized facts" related to the choice of invoice currency, which is based
on the seminal work of Grassman (1973), trade between two economically advanced countries
tends to be invoiced in the exporter's currency. Trade between economically advanced and
developing countries is generally invoiced in the advanced country’s currency. However,
Japan’s currency invoicing pattern evidently contradicts the stylized facts. First, Japanese
exporters have a strong tendency to choose the importer’s currency for their exports to other
advanced countries such as the United States and EU. Second, US dollar invoicing is prevalent
in Japan’s exports to Asia.
     Many determinants of currency invoicing have been suggested in the literature. The authors
typically use data of the share of currency invoicing at a country level, and correlate them with
suspected macroeconomic factors. A micro-analysis at the firm level is needed to test the
relevance of the factors. Only a few exploited the firm level data. Goldberg and Tille (2009) used
highly detailed Canadian import data at a customs level with rich information on the source country,
invoice currency, value of transactions, etc. The other is a study by Friberg and Wilander (2008),
who conduct a questionnaire survey analysis with Swedish exporting firms for empirical tests on
determinants of currency invoicing, which is a useful approach to obtain detailed data at a firm level.
     Another exception is Ito et al. (2010b) who conducted an interview survey of leading
Japanese exporters to overcome a data constraint5. As the interview survey recovers firm-level
information related to exchange rate risk management, the destination breakdown with respect
to the choice of invoice currency became possible. Also, one question was to reveal whether
trades are intra-firm transactions or arms-length transactions—a clear advantage over macro
data. Ito et al. (2010, 2012) claimed to have found evidence of a wider set of invoice currency
determinants for the Japanese exporters: (1) Intra-firm trade, inter-firm trade, or trade via a
trading company; (2) transaction cost of the currency; (3) the intensity of competition in the
export destination markets and the degree of product differentiation; and (4) the structure of
production and distribution network, in which, for example, goods are produced in Japanese
exporters’ subsidiaries in Asia and shipped to the United States as the final destination.
     Intra-firm trade means, for example, the head office in Japan sells automobiles to foreign
subsidiaries in the US and European countries. It was found that invoicing in the importer’s
currency is prevalent for Japanese intra-firm exports to advanced countries. Since the exports
are destined for local subsidiaries that face severe competition in the local markets, Japanese
parent firms have a strong tendency to take an exchange rate risk by invoicing in the importer’s
currency. In fact, it is a rational decision of headquarter to assume all currency risk for its


5
  Ito et al. (2010b) interviewed treasurers of 23 Japanese companies from four major export
industries (automobile, electrical machinery, general machinery, and electronic components) over
the one-year period of autumn 2007 – autumn 2008.

                                                                                                      6
exports to foreign subsidiaries in different currency areas, because headquarter is better
equipped with managing multi-currency risk and with scale economies. Especially if the local
subsidiaries, say in Asia, assembles cars and they sell to the US markets, then their choice of US
dollar invoicing is rational as a part of their strategy of global exchange rate risk management.
    Some Japanese firms that export highly differentiated products or which have a dominant
share in global markets tend to choose yen invoicing. In addition, small firms, which have no
treasury department because of budget constraints, usually ask a general trading company to
manage their foreign exchange business. In this case, they also tend to use yen invoicing in their
transactions with a trading company; and the trading company, which do both imports and
exports, take over exchange rate risks. Accordingly, Japanese firms' choice of invoice currency
is rather complicated, but should be considered along with other risk management tools.
    As in Bartram, Brown and Minton (2010), we assume that Japanese firms have four options
in managing exchange rate risk: (1) choice of invoice currency, (2) pricing (pass-through) policy,
(3) operational hedging, and (4) financial hedging. Figure 1 shows our conceptual diagram of
exchange rate risk management, based on which we constructed questions in the 2009 RIETI
survey. We are able to clarify the notable characteristics of Japanese firms’ exchange rate risk
management based on the survey. Compared with the related studies above, the novelty of this
paper is that it describes detailed empirical analysis of the exchange rate risk management of
Japanese firms using the four different tools: invoicing currency choice, pricing (pass through)
strategy, operational hedging and financial hedging.


2-4. Effectiveness of the Japanese Firms' Exchange Rate Risk Management


Choice of invoicing currency
    As shown in Ito et al. (2010), Japanese firms that export highly differentiated products
and/or have a dominant share in global markets tend to choose yen invoicing. If their exports are
invoiced in the yen instead of the US dollar, their business performance would not be affected
by a stronger yen at least for a short-time horizon. However, most firms do not have products
that are sufficiently competitive to insist on the yen invoicing to the foreign buyers. In general,
firms that cannot make exports totally yen invoiced rationally choose risk-mitigating measures
depending on many factors. Factors such as firm size, products, trading partners, trading
countries, and financial characteristics are suspected to influence the counter-measures to
exchange rate risk.


With an operational hedge ("marry and netting")
    In the wake of a sharp yen appreciation in 1995, Japanese exporting firms have accelerated


                                                                                                    7
transfer and expansion of production facilities overseas and increased the proportion of
imported components from overseas. An increase in import components are considered to an
example of "marry and netting", or part of the so-called “operational hedging.” For firms with
higher US dollar invoicing share, "marry and netting" presumably works effectively to reduce
currency exposure. However, not all firms can use this technique. Firms that produce goods
made using Japanese materials only and export them abroad cannot do marry or netting because
they have no payable foreign currency. In the RIETI 2009 questionnaire, firms are asked
whether they engage in “marry and netting” or more broadly, operational hedging.


Degree of financial hedge (hedging ratio of forward contract)
    For firms that have little imported components, another instrument to hedge is financial
hedge. It is expected that the higher the US dollar invoicing share is, the greater is the financial
hedge usage to reduce the exchange rate exposure. In the RIETI 2009 survey, firms were asked
whether they engage in financial hedge, and what type of financial instruments they used. More
than 70% of firms are found to use some kind of hedging instrument through the foreign
exchange market. Among them, more than 90% of firms use "forward contracts". However, no
specific hedging ratio of "Forward contract" exists by industry or firm size. It seems that the
hedging ratio depends on each firm's ability and willingness of the foreign exchange risk
management.


Exchange rate pass through
    Even when Japanese firms invoice their exports in the US dollar and suffer shrinking profit
margins from yen appreciation, Japanese firms may be able to recover profit margin by raising
the dollar-denominated export prices. This cannot be done too often, but a quarterly revision of
export prices seem to be commonly done. When new models and makes are marketed, prices
can easily reflect new exchange rate levels. Whether firms can make their price revisions in
response to foreign exchange fluctuations (i.e., foreign exchange “pass through” occurs) and
how frequently they do so determine the resilience of exporting firms against the exchange rate
fluctuations. If products are sufficiently competitive to revise their prices to maintain their
constant earnings in terms of the Japanese yen, then foreign exchange fluctuations can cause no
long-term impact on their profit performance. Since the RIETI 2009 survey was conducted in
the timing of having experienced a sharp yen appreciation, a question on the price revision in
recent months reveals the firms’ response to yen appreciation. An expected result is that firms
with yen invoicing tended not to change export prices, while firms with dollar invoicing tended
to have made price revisions.



                                                                                                  8
3. Estimating Japanese Firms' Exchange Rate Exposure

     Many researchers empirically have investigated the exchange rate exposure of firms. Most
of them measure the exposure as the sensitivity of firm’s value to exchange rate fluctuations.
Because the value of the firm is the discounted present value of its future cash flow streams,
expectations of business environments including the exchange rate changes are regarded to
influence the present firm value. Many empirical studies have used stock returns as a proxy for
the change in the value of the firm, and we follow the tradition. The exchange rate exposure is
measured as the coefficient of the exchange rate changes in the regression of stock price returns.
     Traditionally, most Japanese firms have adopted various exchange rate risk management
tools because of their high share of US dollar invoicing and a trend of yen appreciation. Several
previous studies have specifically examined Japanese firms. Dominguez (1998) examined the
exchange rate exposure of the Japanese main industries during the period of 1984–1995 and
found that many Japanese companies are exposed to yen–dollar exchange rate movements.
Their results imply that they do not fully hedge against exchange rate risk. He and Ng (1998)
investigated a sample of 171 Japanese multinational firms’ stock price returns for the period of
January 1979 – December 1993 and found that the exchange rate exposure increases with the
firm’s export ratio and decreases with the level of hedging activity. 6 Doukas et al. (2003)
examined the exchange rate exposure for 1,079 firms traded on the Tokyo stock exchange
during the period of 1975–1995 and confirmed that the exchange rate exposure is found to be
positively associated with the degree of the firm’s foreign business activities and that it is
inversely related to its size and debt-to-asset ratio.
     Among the models of previous studies, the simplest model is that of Adler and Dumas
(1984), who define the exchange rate exposure as the change in the market value of the firm
resulting from a unit change in the exchange rate. According to them, the exchange rate
exposure of the firm is obtainable from the coefficient on the exchange rate variable as follows.

               Ri ,t   0,i  1,i  st   i ,t
                                                                                             (1)
where Ri,t is the stock return for firm i, ∆st is the percentage change in an exchange rate variable,
defined as the home currency price of foreign currency, and β1,i is the elasticity of firm value to
the exchange rate change. This elasticity indicates the firm’s average exchange rate exposure
over the estimation period, in home currency units, as a percentage of the firm’s market value.
     To control for other macroeconomic factors on realized returns, most empirical studies
include a return to a market portfolio in the regression model. For example, Dominguez and

6
  In addition, they confirmed that keiretsu multinational corporations are more exposed to
exchange-rate risk than non-keiretsu firms are.

                                                                                                   9
Tesar (2006) and many other related studies estimate controlling for macroeconomic factors
using market portfolio as follows.

               Ri ,t   0,i   1,i  st   2,i  Rm,t   i ,t
                                                                                                (2)
where Rm,t is the return on the market portfolio and γ1,i is the elasticity of firm value to the
exchange rate change adjusted by the firm’s market portfolio.
     Although most studies choose a regression model (2) to estimate Japanese firms' exchange
rate exposure, with the Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX) being a market portfolio, two
problems exist in model (2). First, because TOPIX is correlated strongly with the dollar/yen rate,
the two-factor regression model has a multicollinearity problem. Second, Bodnar and Wang
(2003) warned that the market portfolio variable strongly influences the results, and that it
sometimes put a downward bias on the coefficient and lowers the significance level7.
     In the paper, we estimate the sampled firms' exchange rate exposure using two different
models above on a monthly basis. Following Bodnar and Wang (2003), we refer to β1,i as the
total exchange rate exposure and γ1,i as the residual exchange rate exposure. For the exchange
rate measure, we alternatively use the nominal exchange rate (Japanese yen per US$, or
USD/JPY in the currency pair code name) and nominal effective exchange rate (NEER)
published by BIS. Since an increase in the number of USD/JPY is yen depreciation, while an
increase in the number of NEER (defined by BIS) is yen appreciation, we define the percentage
change of BIS with an opposite sign. Hence, in both cases, an expected sign of β and γ are
positive. For a market portfolio, we alternatively use TOPIX and MSCI Japan Index.8,9 where
the latter may be better than the former, as the TOPIX is correlated strongly with the nominal
exchange rate of the Japanese yen per US$ (USD/JPY), causing the downward bias of the key
coefficient.
      The sample period for regressions is from January 2005 to December 2009. All but 2 of
the estimated coefficients have expected signs and two coefficients with the wrong sign are
statistically insignificant for both the USD/JPY regression and the NEER regression.10.

7
  Bodnar and Wang (2003) demonstrate that different constructions of a market portfolio have
different exposures to exchange rates because of a significant size effects in exchange rate exposures.
They propose the use of cap-based portfolios as controls for market factors.
8
  The MSCI Japan Index is a free-float adjusted market capitalization weighted index that is designed to
track the equity market performance of Japanese securities listed on Tokyo Stock Exchange, Osaka Stock
Exchange, JASDAQ and Nagoya Stock Exchange. The MSCI Japan Index (Price Index) is calculated in
JPY on a real time basis.
9
  Following the suggestion of Dominguez and Tesar (2006), we try to use an international index (MSCI
World Price Index) by calculating the return in terms of the Japanese yen as a control variable. The
estimated results are almost equal to those of the MSCI Japan Index.
10
   For these analyses, we use all estimated coefficients, either significant or not significant.
Although some previous studies have devoted attention to statistical significance. We might lose the
case of small exchange rate exposure from our sample. For a robustness check, we conduct the same

                                                                                                      10
     Figure 2 shows the estimated total exchange rate exposure using the yen/dollar exchange
rate and NEER by BIS. On average, their size is larger than 100% except for "Food" and
"Medicinal Chemicals". Among the fifteen industries, the total exchange rate exposure of
"Transport Equipment" is the highest and above 200%. This result indicates that the exchange
rate risk of "Transport Equipment" industries is larger than other industries and their stock
return is affected more than twice of exchange rate change. Except for "Coal and Oil Products",
the exchange rate exposures estimated by NEER are higher than those of the yen/dollar
exchange rate. This result suggests that most Japanese industries face not only the fluctuation
risk of the yen/dollar exchange rate, but also other trade countries’ exchange rates.


     Figure 3 presents the estimated residual exchange rate exposures using the yen/dollar
exchange rate and NEER. All are less than 100% and are smaller than the total exchange rate
exposure. Similar to the previous case, the residual exchange rate exposure of "Transport
Equipment" is the highest among 15 industries. The second is "Precision Instruments", and
"Electric Machinery" and "General Machinery" are the next except for "Other Products". These
results are consistent with the fact that such Japanese representative manufacturing industries
are facing severe competition with other countries.
     Contrary to the findings of previous figure, results of the size of two residual exchange rate
exposures differ by industry. The residual exchange rate exposures estimated by NEER are
larger than those of yen/dollar exchange rate in "Food", "Medicinal Chemicals", "Iron and
Steel", "Metal Products", "General Machinery", "Electric Machinery", "Transport Equipment",
"Precision Instruments" and "Other Products". It is particularly interesting that the residual
exchange rate exposures estimated by yen/dollar exchange rate are greater than those of NEER
in more basic material industries such as "Coal and Oil Products", "Glass and Stone" and "Non
Metal Products". The estimated results controlled by TOPIX are mostly similar to those by the
MSCI Japan index.


4. Determinants of firms' foreign exchange exposure

     In this section, we investigate the relationship between the estimated exchange rate
exposure and exchange rate risk management of Japanese firms based on the questionnaire
survey. As we presented in the section 2, the RIETI Survey 2009 covers rich information related
not only to the firms' foreign exchange rate risk management but also to the firms' choice of
invoicing currency and price revision (pass-through) strategy. The survey results are classified
by industry and by the firm size, using annual financial reports of sample firms, through which

analysis using statistically significant coefficients only. We confirm that we obtained similar results.

                                                                                                      11
new evidence of Japanese firm's exchange rate risk management, such as the usage of financial
and operational hedging and price revision, are presented.
    Our hypotheses with respect to firms’ exchange rate risk management are as follows:
    1.    Large share of foreign sales to total sales increases the exchange rate exposure.
    2.    High share of US$ invoicing increases the exchange rate exposure.
    3.    Financial and operational hedges reduce the exchange rate exposure.
    4.    Financial and operational hedges can be effective in reducing exchange rate exposure,
          especially for a firm that chooses mainly US$ invoicing.
    5.    High share of yen invoicing decreases the exchange rate exposure.
    6.    Frequent price revision to make pass through decreases exchange rate exposure.
          Hypotheses 1 and 2 are examined in many previous studies. For example, Shapiro
(1975), Levi (1983), and Jorion (1990) confirmed that the firm’s currency exposure should be
positively related to the ratio of foreign sales to total sales and the use of foreign currency
hedging lessen a firm's foreign exchange rate exposure. Hypothesis 3 is also tested in many
previous studies. For example, Bartram, Brown and Minton (2010) demonstrate that financial
hedging with foreign currency-denominated debt appears to have a larger effect on exposure
than the use of foreign exchange derivatives. Our contribution and novelty are in Hypotheses 4
and 5, which examine the effectiveness of financial and operational hedge with the choice of
invoicing currency.
    As a dependent variable, we use the estimated exchange rate exposures of four kinds in
section 3 as follows:
    •    βTotal,JPY/USDi, βTotal,NEERi : Firm i’s total exchange rate exposure obtained using nominal
         exchange rate of yen/dollar and NEER, respectively;
    •    βResidual,JPY/USDi, βResidual,NEERi : Firm i’s residual exchange rate exposure obtained by
         TOPIX/MSCI Japan Index and nominal exchange rate of yen/dollar and NEER,
         respectively
    As the basic explanatory variables in the right-hand-side, we first include a “size” of firm i,
measured by the log of total consolidated sales, and “share of foreign sales,” measured by total
foreign sales of firms i divided by total consolidated sales. Additionally, we use each firm's
share of US dollar invoicing, i.e., the firm's answer in the RIETI 2009 Survey and four dummy
variables: A dummy variable for using marry/netting (Dummy of OH) takes 1 if a firm uses
marry/netting and 0 if not. A dummy variable for using forward transaction (Dummy of FH)
takes 1 if a firm uses forward transaction and 0 if not. A dummy variable for executing price
revision in 2008 (Dummy of PT) takes 1 if a firm revised the price attributable to the sudden
appreciation of the Japanese yen and 0 if not. As another invoicing share variable, we also use a
“dummy of USD Main Invoicing (yen Main Invoicing),” which takes 1 if the share of USD


                                                                                                  12
(yen) invoicing is larger than yen (USD) invoicing.11 First, we examine the determinants of
exchange rate exposure including the share of US dollar invoicing in the following regression
model.


     βTotal, JPY/USDi   = α0 + α1Log of Total Consolidated Salesi + α2Share of Foreign Salesi
                                    + α3 Share of US Invoicingi
                                    + α4 Dummy of OHi + α5 Dummy of FHi +α6 Dummy of PTi
                                    + α7 Share of US Invoicingi • Dummy of OHi
                                    + α8 Share of US Invoicingi • Dummy of FHi
                                    + γi Industry dummyj    (j=1, • • •,15)                         (3)


     βResiduall, JPY/USDi   = α0 + α1Log of Total Consolidated Salesi + α2Share of Foreign Salesi
                                    + α3 Share of US Invoicingi
                                    + α4 Dummy of OHi + α5 Dummy of FHi +α6 Dummy of PTi
                                    + α7 Share of US Invoicingi • Dummy of OHi
                                    + α8 Share of US Invoicingi • Dummy of FHi
                                    + γi Industry dummyj    (j=1, • • •,15)                         (4)


        The estimated results are presented in Table 1. As expected, the coefficients of the share of
foreign sales are positive and statistically significant in all cases. The large share of foreign sales
to total sales increases the exchange rate exposure. The coefficients of share of USD invoicing
and “mainly-USD-invoicing” in the regression are positive and statistically significant in several
cases, suggesting that once US-invoicing (or not yen-invoicing) is chosen, it is very difficult to
completely offset the exchange rate exposure by other mitigating measures, such as operational
and financial hedge. Contrary to our hypothesis 3, the coefficients of operational hedge and
financial hedge are not negative. Some of the coefficients of financial hedging are positive and
statistically significant. In these cases, the cross-term coefficients of financial hedge and USD
invoicing (or USD main invoicing) are negative and statistically significant in most cases. These
results suggest that firms with a high US$ invoicing share can reduce their exchange rate
exposure using financial hedging. It is particularly interesting that the cross-term coefficients of
operational hedge and mainly-USD-invoicing are negative and statistically significant in the
exchange rate exposure obtained by the yen/dollar exchange rate. The implication is that the
exchange rate exposure obtained by the yen/dollar exchange rate can be reduced by a combined
strategy of USD main invoicing and “marry and netting.” Unfortunately, the coefficients of pass
through are not significant.

11
     Descriptive statistics of all variables are presented in the Appendix 2.

                                                                                                          13
     Second, we examine the determinants of exchange rate exposure including the share of yen
invoicing in the following regression model.
  βTotal, JPY/USDi      = α0 + α1Log of Total Consolidated Salesi + α2Share of Foreign Salesi
                          + α3 Share of Yen Invoicingi
                                   + α4 Dummy of OHi + α5 Dummy of FHi +α6 Dummy of PTi
                                   + γi Industry dummyj    (j=1, • • •,14)                        (5)


  βResidual, JPY/USDi     = α0 + α1Log of Total Consolidated Salesi + α2Share of Foreign Salesi
                          + α3 Share of Yen Invoicingi
                                   + α4 Dummy of OHi + α5 Dummy of FHi +α6 Dummy of PTi
                                   + γi Industry dummyj    (j=1, • • •,14)                        (6)


For an invoicing variable, we also use “Dummy of Yen Main Invoicing” in which the share of
yen invoicing is larger than that of USD invoicing.
     Estimated results are presented in Table 2. As expected, the coefficients of both “share of
yen invoicing” and “mainly-yen-invoicing” are negative and significant in most cases. It is
confirmed that the high share of yen invoicing decreases the exchange rate exposure.
     In sum, Japanese firm's exchange rate exposure is found to be positively related to the
share of foreign sales to total sales. As expected, firms with higher ratios of US dollar invoicing
have higher degrees of exchange rate exposure as measured in the stock market. It is possible to
mitigate the exchange rate exposure of the yen/dollar exchange rate by engaging in operational
hedging and that of the NEER by financial hedging. This result is consistent with the conclusion
of Ito et al. (2011). Furthermore, firms with yen invoicing have lower exchange rate exposure
measured in the stock market. Price revision (pass-through) theoretically reduces a firm’s total
exchange rate exposure, but it is not found to be statistically significant in the regression.


5. Conclusion
     This paper analyzed relationship between the Japanese firms' exchange rate risk
management based on the 2009 RIETI survey and the exchange rate risk exposures that is
estimated as the sensitivity of stock price movements to the exchange rate movement. Empirical
results confirm the following characteristics. First, large Japanese manufacturing industries have
a significant exposure to the exchange rate risk. Second, firms with greater dependence on
foreign sales have a larger foreign exchange exposure. Third, the higher the US dollar invoicing
ratio, the greater the foreign exchange exposure, but risk is reduced by financial and operational
hedging. Fourth, yen invoicing reduces the foreign exchange exposure. Theoretically, in the


                                                                                                        14
medium run, the firms with large currency risk revise the export prices to partially counter
losses from yen appreciation. However, this was not confirmed by the data.
    Most of results obtained are consistent of conventional wisdom. However, it is a novel
finding that those firms employing currency hedge and choosing yen invoicing are judged by
the market to have reduced currency exposures. It is also found that Japanese firms do use
operational and financial hedging strategies.
    This is the first detailed investigation of the exchange rate risk management policy of
Japanese firms, which was made possible by the newly conducted survey. These findings
suggest important implications and tools for Japanese firms' exchange rate risk managers to
build more efficient risk management schemes.
    The questionnaire method has well-known limitations as well as benefits. Supplementary
sources such as firms' financial reports are used to strengthen the analysis. For example, the
listed firms’ exchange rate exposure is estimated from their financial statements, and it is
compared against their exposure and risk management from the survey. It is left for a future
analysis whether we can obtain the same results if we add other control variable, such as foreign
debt ratio, R&D investment, volatility of (foreign) sales, and number of foreign subsidiary and
production base. We use only "marry and netting" as a proxy of operational hedges. However,
firms have more tools in the menu under operational hedges.
