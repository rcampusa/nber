This paper decomposes the participation process of a prototypical program into eligibility,
awareness, application, acceptance and enrollment. With this decomposition, we determine the
sources of unequal participation for different groups, and demonstrate that variables often have very

different effects at different stages in the participation process. Our analysis shows that personal
choices substantially affect participation and that awareness of program eligibility is a major source

of variation in participation.

1. Introduction

This paper presents a framework for studying participation in social programs that

decomposes the participation process into multiple stages: eligibility, awareness,

application, acceptance and enrollment, allowing for distinct determinants at each stage.

We apply our framework to analyze unique data gathered as part of an evaluation of a

prototypical voluntary social program.

       Understanding the process of participation in social programs is interesting for at

least three reasons. First, it allows analysts to determine the sources of inequality in the

receipt of government services. Our framework allows us to go beyond simple

comparisons of the mean participation rates of different groups to learn at what stage in

the process, if any, differences in participation rates occur. Overall differences in

participation may have very different equity implications, and very different implications

for changes in policy, depending on whether they result from differences in eligibility for

the program, awareness of the program, application to the program, acceptance into the

program, or enrollment in the program.

       Second, patterns of program participation can reveal useful information about

program operation. In programs governed by performance management systems, which

now includes most major U.S. social programs, participation patterns may reveal the

effects of the incentives embodied in those performance standards systems. Here the

decomposition of the participation process into particular stages aids in disentangling the

effects of choices made by program staff and choices made by potential participants.

       Third, information regarding the participation process has important implications

for program evaluation strategies. For example, the propensity score matching methods




                                              2
developed and applied in Heckman, Ichimura and Todd (1997,1998) and Heckman,

Ichimura, Smith and Todd (1998) build directly on estimates of the probability of

participation conditional on observable characteristics. Other econometric evaluation

methods, such as instrumental variables, also require an understanding of the

participation process. Knowledge of how the determinants of participation vary by the

stage of the participation process can inform choices about where in the process to draw a

comparison group, about what variables to collect in a survey, and about what

identification strategy to adopt. Heckman and Robb (1985), Heckman, LaLonde and

Smith (1999), and Heckman and Navarro-Lozano (2003) describe the role of the program

participation decision in econometric evaluations in detail.

        We apply our framework to analyze participation in the Job Training Partnership

Act (JTPA), a prototypical voluntary social program. Participation in JTPA depends on

the choices of both potential participants and government bureaucrats. It is not an

entitlement program. In contrast, the existing literature on program participation focuses

on entitlement programs such as Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and

its successor Temporary Aid to Needy Families (TANF), Food Stamps, or

Unemployment Insurance.1 Persons eligible for such programs are legally entitled to

their benefits, so that participation depends primarily on the decisions of potential

participants, although there is clearly room for bureaucratic discretion in interpreting

eligibility rules (see, e.g., Parsons, 1991).

Ebmer (1996) and Jacobsen, LaLonde and Sullivan (2002).



                                                  3
       Our empirical analysis is deliberately descriptive. We seek to establish empirical

regularities about the participation process for a prototypical social program using the

rich information available on the JTPA program. These regularities suggest interesting

behavioral relationships governing the process of program participation. As such, they

demonstrate the value of our framework and suggest its applicability for the study of

other programs.

       We document that the JTPA eligibility rules had a substantial effect on the access

of particular groups to program services. We also find wide variation in participation

rates conditional on eligibility across groups defined by race, age, education, fluency in

English, marital status, participation in government transfer programs, recent labor force

status and family income. On the surface, this evidence supports the conclusions of a U.S.

General Accounting Office (1991) report that charged the JTPA program with failing to

distribute its services equitably across groups within the eligible population. Similar

distributional concerns have been raised in regard to other government programs.

       By decomposing the program participation process into stages, we determine the

sources of unequal participation for different groups. For example, for persons with low

levels of schooling, the favorable effect of the JTPA eligibility rules on the probability of

participation was undone by low rates of program awareness and of application and

acceptance into the program. On the other hand, for persons with a relatively high level

of schooling, a low rate of eligibility was partially offset by a relatively high probability

of program awareness. In addition, we find that informational barriers such as low levels

of schooling and lack of fluency in English act to discourage participation conditional on

eligibility, but that these barriers do not fully account for the low participation rate of




                                               4
Hispanics noted by Gonzales and Romero (1989) and Sandell and Rupp (1988). Our

evidence suggests that personal choices have a major influence in determining who

participates in government programs. More generally, our analysis demonstrates that

program eligibility is a necessary but by no means sufficient condition for participation.

Many groups of special interest to policymakers, such as high school dropouts and

welfare recipients, have high rates of eligibility but low probabilities of program

participation conditional on eligibility.

       Caseworkers in the JTPA program faced the incentives created by the JTPA

performance standards systems, which rewarded local JTPA training sites for the labor

market performance of their enrollees. Anderson, Burkhauser and Raymond (1993),

among others, argue that performance standards led JTPA staff to screen out hard-to-

serve applicants who may have difficulty obtaining work even after completing a training

program. We find evidence consistent with cream skimming by JTPA staff, particularly

at the stage of program enrollment. However, in some cases what appears initially to be

cream skimming by JTPA staff turns out instead to reflect differences across groups in

program awareness. This finding casts doubt on the value of the evidence from the

literature that estimates the nature and extent of cream skimming by comparing the

characteristics of program eligibles and program participants.

       Finally, in regard to program evaluation, we expand on the analysis in Heckman

and Smith (1999) and document the important role of labor force status dynamics,

especially recent transitions to unemployment, in driving participation in JTPA among

the eligible. This factor operates most strongly at the stage of application and acceptance

into the program among eligible persons who are aware of JTPA. This evidence has




                                             5
important implications for the types of data that should be collected in non-experimental

evaluations of employment and training programs.

       This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents our framework. Section 3

describes the JTPA program in detail and shows that it is very similar to other public

employment and training programs in the U.S. and abroad, including its successor, the

Workforce Investment Act (WIA), in terms of administrative structure, population

served, and types of services offered. It resembles in broad outline a large class of

voluntary programs aimed at the disadvantaged. Thus lessons drawn in this paper apply

more widely. Section 4 describes our data.

       Sections 5, 6, 7 and 8 examine in detail four stages in the participation process:

eligibility, program awareness, application and acceptance into the program and formal

enrollment. In Section 9, we decompose the overall program participation process in

order to examine how factors such as race, education, labor force status, participation in

transfer programs and family income operate through eligibility, awareness, acceptance

and enrollment to determine the overall probability of participation in JTPA. The final

section summarizes our findings and draws conclusions about the usefulness of our

framework for studying program participation.



2. A Framework for Analyzing Participation in Social Programs

For a person to participate in a voluntary social program, he or she must be eligible for it,

must be aware of it, must apply for it, must be accepted into it and must be formally

enrolled in it. Figure 1 depicts the process of selection into a program. Different factors

govern each stage of the program participation process. Eligibility criteria are determined




                                              6
by legislators and interpreted by bureaucrats. Program awareness depends on outreach

efforts by program operators, on the extent to which a person is generally informed about

the availability of social programs, on the economic situation of prospective applicants

who might benefit from a program, and on access to networks of friends and neighbors

who have heard about or participated in a program.

        The decision to apply to a program is made by the prospective participant and

depends in part on the expected benefits and perceived opportunity costs of participation.

Acceptance into a program depends on bureaucratic preferences over applicant types,

which in many programs are determined in part by formal performance standards

systems. Acceptance also depends on the willingness of the applicant to pursue the

application process to its conclusion and on further changes in opportunity costs, such as

sudden illnesses or the arrival of job offers, during the application process.

        Formal enrollment depends on both bureaucratic and personal preferences. For

example, the JTPA performance standards system counted only the employment and

wages of enrollees in a specified period following termination from the program. As a

result, local JTPA bureaucrats had an incentive to gain additional information about the

potential employability of persons accepted into the program and to use it to guide their

enrollment decisions. At the same time, the passage of time between acceptance and

enrollment leads to changes in opportunity costs that may cause accepted applicants to

decline enrollment even if it is offered.

        To describe the participation process, consider the following conditional

probabilities for a person with characteristics x: (1) the probability of eligibility; (2) the

probability of program awareness given eligibility; (3) the probability of application




                                               7
given eligibility and awareness; (4) the probability of acceptance given application; and

(5) the probability of formal enrollment conditional on acceptance into a program. In

formal terms, we have



(1a)    Pr(el = 1| x) ,

(1b)    Pr(aw = 1| el = 1, x) ,

(1c)    Pr(ap = 1| aw = 1, el = 1, x)

(1c)    Pr(ac = 1| ap = 1, aw = 1, el = 1, x) ,

(1d)    Pr(en = 1| ac = 1, ap = 1, aw = 1, el = 1, x) ,



where el = 1 if a person is eligible for a program and zero otherwise, aw = 1 if a person is

aware of a program and zero otherwise, ap = 1 if a person applies to a program and zero

otherwise, ac = 1 if a person applies to and is accepted into a program and zero

otherwise, and en = 1 if a person is formally enrolled in a program and zero otherwise.

       As persons only participate in the program if they are eligible el = 1 , are aware

aw = 1 , apply ap = 1 , are accepted ac = 1 , and formally enroll en = 1 , we can decompose

the probability of participation given X = x , Pr( par = 1| x) , into the five components on

the right-hand side of the following equation:




(2)     Pr( par = 1| x) =

        Pr(en = 1| ac = 1, ap = 1, aw = 1, el = 1, x) Pr(ac = 1| ap = 1, aw = 1, el = 1, x)




                                                   8
        Pr(ap = 1| aw = 1, el = 1, x) Pr(aw = 1| el = 1, x) Pr(el = 1| x) ,



where par = 1 if a person participates in a program and zero otherwise. By estimating

each of the five component probabilities, we can determine the effect of each variable in

x on the overall probability of participation and can determine where and how it

influences program participation. A variable that has no effect on the overall probability

of participation may have strong, but offsetting, effects on the component probabilities.

       In the sections that follow, we apply this framework to analyze participation in the

JTPA program. Data limitations force us to combine application and acceptance into a

single step. We equate acceptance into the program with reaching the stage of random

assignment during the experimental evaluation of JTPA. Only eligible applicants who

completed the aptitude and achievement tests required at most JTPA training sites and

who received a written JTPA service plan were subject to random assignment. These

conditions required a substantial commitment by JTPA training centers to continued

interaction with the applicant, but fall short of formal enrollment into JTPA.

       Section 9 presents two sets of decompositions based on (2). The first set includes

all four stages: eligibility, awareness, application and acceptance, and enrollment. In the

second set, we decompose Pr(ac = 1| el = 1, x) , the probability of application and

acceptance conditional on eligibility, into separate stages of awareness given eligibility

and acceptance given awareness. Focusing solely on these two stages allows us to

examine the effects of explanatory variables not included in the full decomposition due to

data limitations.

3. The JTPA Program

The Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) was the primary U.S. federal employment and

training program for the disadvantaged until replaced by the programs financed under the

Workforce Investment Act (WIA) of 1998. JTPA provided classroom training in

occupational skills, remedial education, job search assistance, work experience and on-

the-job training at private firms for approximately one million persons each year.

There were two primary avenues to eligibility for JTPA. The first and most important

avenue was economic disadvantage, which occurred if one of two criteria were met: (1)

low family income in the six months prior to application to the program; or (2) being in a

family receiving cash public assistance such as Aid to Families with Dependent Children

(AFDC) and general assistance or Food Stamps.2 According to the U.S. Department of

Labor (1993a), in Program Year 19913 around 93 percent of JTPA participants qualified

because they were economically disadvantaged. A second avenue to eligibility was an

“audit window'' that allowed up to 10 percent of participants at each JTPA training center

to be non-economically disadvantaged persons with other barriers to employment such as

limited ability in English. Due to the subjective nature of these barriers, and the resulting

difficulty in determining who is affected by them, we only examine persons who are

eligible by virtue of being economically disadvantaged. Devine and Heckman (1996)

   The act also specifies additional eligibility criteria for several small groups. In the Survey of Income and
Program Participation (SIPP) data used in our analysis, we are not able to accurately measure foster child
status, disability or homelessness on a monthly basis, and so are unable to implement the special eligibility
rules applicable to these groups in selecting our sample of eligibles. However, these groups represent a
very small portion of the overall eligible population, and many of those eligible under the special
provisions will also be eligible under the basic family income and program participation criteria described
in the text.

discuss the eligibility rules for JTPA and their implications for the composition of the

eligible population.4

         There are three important features of the criteria that determined eligibility for

JTPA through economic disadvantage. First, eligibility depended on family income

rather than on individual income. Second, only family income in the past six months was

relevant. Third, current receipt of welfare benefits by any family member made a person

eligible for the program. The short window for income eligibility allowed highly skilled

and normally highly paid workers to become eligible for JTPA after being out of work

only a few months.

         There are some differences between the eligibility criteria and services offered in

JTPA compared to its predecessors CETA (Comprehensive Employment and Training

Act) and MDTA (Manpower Development and Training Act), and its successor, the WIA

program. Barnow (1993) suggests that these differences are modest in regard to CETA

and MDTA. U.S. Department of Labor (1998) and O’Shea and King (2001) document

the details of the WIA program. All four programs focus on displaced workers, persons

with low income and transfer program participants, and all four offered roughly the same

set of services, with the earlier programs focused somewhat more on substantive training,

either in a classroom or on the job, and the later programs focused somewhat more on

“work first” strategies such as job search assistance. MDTA and CETA also offered

public service employment, which was not offered in JTPA and is not offered under


4
 Two other details regarding JTPA eligibility deserve note. First, the implementation of the rules varied
somewhat across localities, as states and training centers had some discretion over exactly what did and did
not constitute family income and what did and did not constitute a family for the purposes of the program.
Devine and Heckman (1996) show that such differences are too small to affect the patterns discussed here.
Second, the eligibility rules described here are those in place at the time our data were collected. Some
small changes in rules took place after that time; see Devine and Heckman (1996) or U.S. Department of
Labor (1993b).


                                                    11
WIA. Overall, the broad similarity in eligibility rules and services offered suggests that

our analysis applies to all of these programs and to future programs patterned after them.

Moreover, the U.S. JTPA program is also quite similar in terms of target groups,

administration, and services offered to programs provided to unemployed workers in

Canada and to the New Deal for Young People, New Deal for 25 Plus and New Deal for

Lone Parent programs in the United Kingdom.5



4. Data

The primary source of our data is the National JTPA Study (NJS), an experimental

evaluation of the JTPA program conducted from 1987 to 1989.6 In the course of this

evaluation, persons accepted into JTPA at a non-random sample of sixteen JTPA training

centers were randomly assigned into either a control group excluded from JTPA (for 18

months) or a treatment group given access to JTPA services. In order to learn more about

the JTPA-eligible population, and to facilitate the development of better non-

experimental evaluation methods, data were collected on JTPA-eligible non-participants

(ENPs) at four of the sixteen centers. These centers are Corpus Christi, Texas, Fort

Wayne, Indiana, Jersey City, New Jersey and Providence, Rhode Island.

        Detailed information on demographic characteristics, labor market histories,

transfer program participation and family composition and income was collected on the

ENPs and on experimental control group members at the same four sites. We use this

information for our analyses of awareness of JTPA and of application and acceptance

into JTPA. For the experimental treatment group, we have only limited information

collected shortly before random assignment. We use these data to study enrollment into

JTPA at the four sites. Appendix A describes the National JTPA Study data in detail.

       The National JTPA Study did not collect data on persons ineligible for JTPA. In

order to analyze the determinants of eligibility we use a national sample drawn from the

1986 Panel of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). The SIPP is well

suited to this purpose because it contains sufficient information to precisely determine

JTPA eligibility. We treat the SIPP panel as a series of repeated cross-sections, and create

a data set consisting of person-months. The SIPP sample is described in detail in

Appendix B.



5. The Determinants of Eligibility for the JTPA Program

This section examines the determinants of eligibility for JTPA. Table 1 defines the

explanatory variables used in this paper. Tables 2a and 2b present the results of logit

analyses of the determinants of eligibility. Table 2a presents results for adult (age 22 and

above) men and women, and Table 2b presents the results for male and female out-of-

school youth (ages 16 to 21). We focus on these four demographic groups for three

reasons. First, they are the groups employed in the experimental impact reports and in

our other work utilizing these data. Second, because of concerns around family

responsibilities and education, we would expect men and women, and youth and adults,

to behave differently. Third, we have no data on in-school youth, as this group was

excluded from the experimental analysis.




                                            13
         The first column for each demographic group in Tables 2a and 2b displays

estimated coefficients and associated standard errors (in parentheses) from logit models

of the probability of eligibility derived from the SIPP data. The second column displays

estimates of the mean derivative of the probability of eligibility with respect to each

characteristic (in square brackets) along with p-values from tests of the null hypotheses

that each population coefficient equals zero.7 The notes to each table document the

within-sample predictive performance of each model. As discussed in Appendix C, these

estimates adjust for the dependence induced by the use of person-month observations,

with each respondent allowed to contribute multiple months.

         A number of interesting findings emerge from this analysis. First, even after

controlling for family income and productivity characteristics, race and ethnicity are very

important determinants of the probability of eligibility. For example, for adult females,

the average difference in the probability of eligibility for blacks and Hispanics relative to

whites exceeds 0.12, holding resource variables constant.

         Being married has a large negative estimated effect on the eligibility probabilities

for all groups except adult males. The eligibility status of adult males is driven primarily

by their own income, while for adult females and for youth, eligibility status depends in

large part on the earnings of other family members. For all demographic groups except

adult males, the presence of an own child age less than six living in the home

substantially increases the probability of eligibility for JTPA. Children raise the income

cutoff for eligibility by increasing the household size but do not add to the family income.

In addition, years of schooling have an important impact on eligibility for all groups.

7
 We present mean derivatives and not derivatives evaluated at the mean of the X. That is, we calculate the
derivative (or finite difference for binary variables) for each observation and report the (weighted) sample
mean.


                                                    14
       Not surprisingly, the probability of eligibility decreases monotonically with

family income for all four demographic groups. The magnitude of the estimated average

derivatives is very large for family income categories corresponding to incomes above

$6000. For adult males, raising family income from less than $3000 to between $9000

and $12,000 produces an average decrease in the probability of JTPA eligibility of 0.268.

For male and female youth, the estimated average derivatives are larger still, reflecting

the differential importance of family resources in determining eligibility for these groups.

       The small set of characteristics included in the specifications reported in Table 2

do well at predicting within-sample eligibility status. For all four groups, over 70 percent

of the eligibles and almost 90 percent of the non-eligibles are correctly predicted when

we use the overall eligibility rate within each group to define the cutoff for predicting

eligibility. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the eligibility rules for JTPA

produced substantial group differences in access to subsidized government training.



6. The Determinants of Awareness of the JTPA Program

This section investigates the determinants of awareness of the JTPA program using data

on the controls and eligible non-participants at four JTPA sites. The concept of program

awareness is an elusive but important one. Differential access to information about the

program can affect awareness and thereby influence participation. Language barriers are

an obvious case in point. However, awareness also depends on the incentives a person

has to participate in the program. In some cases the desire to participate may influence

awareness rather than awareness independently influencing participation.

        As we lack evidence on individual information-gathering activities, we are unable

to determine the extent to which information costs, and therefore program awareness,

play a causal role in determining program participation choices. However, the evidence

presented in this section indicates that awareness of JTPA among those eligible for it is

by no means universal, and that program awareness appears to be related to the likelihood

of participation in the program, to education, and to language skills. We also present

evidence that a sizeable fraction of persons who are eligible for the program do not

believe that they are eligible for it. Taken together, this evidence suggests that barriers to

information are an important determinant of program participation.

        Each member of the ENP sample was asked whether or not he or she had heard of

the JTPA program. In keeping with the decentralized nature of the JTPA program, local

training sites often select operating names other than JTPA. To overcome this problem,

ENPs were asked about their awareness of JTPA under several different names, including

the program’s primary name in their locality. Persons who indicated that they were

aware of the JTPA program were then asked whether or not they believed themselves to

be presently eligible for it. Persons participating in the program are assumed to be aware

of it and of their own eligibility for it.

        Table 3 presents rates of awareness and self-reported eligibility for eligible non-

participants in each major demographic group. The first column presents the fraction of

the ENPs who have heard of JTPA. These fractions are surprisingly low. For all four

groups, the awareness rate is below 50 percent. The rate is higher for youth than for

adults, which may indirectly reflect requirements that sites expended 40 percent of their

training resources on youth, who constitute well less than 40 percent of the eligible




                                              16
population (a similar requirement, reduced to 30 percent, holds for the WIA program).

The second column gives the fraction of those persons aware of the program who think

that they are eligible for it. Note that all of the ENPs are determined to be eligible at the

time of their screening interviews and that nearly all are still eligible at the time the

question was asked in the baseline interview. Conditional on awareness, only 36 percent

of adult males, 46 percent of adult females and around 55 percent of youth realize that

they qualify for JTPA services. Taking the product of these two probabilities yields the

unconditional probability of awareness and self-reported eligibility appearing in the third

column. Barely 12 percent of adult male eligibles can identify both the program and their

own eligibility for it. Even among youth, only about 25 percent of eligibles are both

aware of the program and of their own eligibility for it. These figures suggest that there

are substantial costs associated with finding out about social programs such as JTPA and

about the rules governing access to their services, and that information costs play an

important role in producing demographic differentials in program participation.

         The results from a logit analysis of the determinants of awareness of the

JTPA program appear in Tables 4a and 4b. These tables have the same basic structure as

Tables 2a and 2b. For all four demographic groups, black eligibles are relatively more

likely than white eligibles to know about JTPA. Adult Hispanic eligibles are relatively

less likely than whites to know about JTPA, with the difference being statistically

significant in both cases. The negative and statistically significant coefficient estimates

for Hispanic adult eligibles arise even after controlling for facility with the English

language and for level of education.8 It has often been noted (see, e.g., Tienda and


8
 The English language ability variable should be interpreted with caution as it arises from different
underlying measures in the ENP and control group samples. For the ENPs, lack of English ability is


                                                    17
Jensen, 1988) that Hispanics participate less in government programs compared to non-

Hispanics with the same basic economic characteristics. Language skills and educational

deficits play a role in explaining this phenomenon but more than just language deficits

are involved. If Hispanics are less likely to utilize public services, or if they participate in

networks with fewer public service recipients, then they are less likely to be aware of

JTPA and of other programs.

        Consistent with the standard human capital model (see, e.g., Becker 1964), older

adults have statistically significantly lower probabilities of awareness of the program than

persons age 22 to 29. This may reflect the reduced demand for skill enhancement

programs with age documented in Leigh (1995). The pattern with respect to education is

hump-shaped. Persons with the lowest levels of schooling have lower conditional

probabilities of awareness than those who have completed high school. This evidence

supports the notion of substantial information processing costs among those with very

low levels of schooling. A lower likelihood of participating in JTPA, and hence a lower

value to information about the program, accounts for the evidence that the most educated

persons are less aware of the program.

        Among adults, divorced, widowed or separated eligibles have a higher probability

of awareness than do those who are single. The difference is both statistically and

substantively significant for adult males. For three of the four groups, living in a family

that receives Food Stamps has a positive effect on the probability of being aware of

JTPA, while living in a family that receives AFDC has a positive effect only for adult

males and for female youth. The estimated effect of living in a family receiving Food

measured by the language in which the respondent chose to complete the baseline survey, while for the
controls it is obtained from a question on language preference administered around the time of random
assignment.


                                                   18
Stamps is large, with mean numerical derivatives of 0.164 and 0.133, and it is statistically

significant for both adult males and females. As nearly all of the adult female AFDC

recipients also receive Food Stamps, the negative (essentially zero) coefficient on the

AFDC variable indicates the additional effect of receiving both AFDC and Food Stamps,

rather than just Food Stamps. Interpreted in this way, the absence of any AFDC effect

becomes less surprising. The strong effects observed for Food Stamp receipt are

consistent with the practice in that program of providing recipients with information

about training opportunities.

       Unemployed eligibles have a higher probability of program awareness for all four

demographic groups. This difference between the unemployed and the employed is

statistically significant for both male and female adults. In contrast, eligible individuals

who are out of the labor force have lower probabilities of awareness than employed

eligibles for all four demographic groups. These results are consistent with the relative

value of information about JTPA for the two groups.

       While the concept of program awareness is a conceptually problematic one, the

evidence presented here indicates that learning about the JTPA program and its eligibility

requirements is not costless, and that the likelihood of becoming aware of the program

varies in predictable ways. In particular, we find that differences in information costs, in

information processing and language skills, and in the expected value of information

about the JTPA program, which is itself a function of the probability of participation in

the program and its expected benefit, can account for the patterns we observe in the data.



7. The Determinants of Application and Acceptance into JTPA




                                              19
This section presents a logit analysis of the determinants of application and acceptance

into the JTPA program conditional on awareness of the program using data on controls

and ENPs from the National JTPA Study. We combine the application and acceptance

stages here because we lack the data to examine them separately. Combining these two

stages in the program participation process means that the patterns we observe reflect the

joint influence of individual decisions to apply and to persist through the (sometimes

lengthy) application process and of JTPA staff decisions to accept or encourage some

applicants while rejecting or discouraging others.

           Tables 5a and 5b report estimates of logit models of application and acceptance

into the JTPA program as a function of observed characteristics for the four demographic

groups. Coefficient estimates and estimated standard errors take account of the choice-

based nature of the sample. The training site indicators included in the model have no

behavioral interpretation, as the relative numbers of ENPs and controls at each site is an

artifact of the study design. The notes to Tables 5a and 5b summarize the within-sample

predictive success of the models. Appendix C provides additional details regarding the

methods used to obtain the reported results.

           The most dramatic result in Tables 5a and 5b is the powerful effect of recent labor

force status dynamics on application and acceptance into JTPA.9 For both adult males

and adult females, all of the labor force status pattern indicators have coefficients

statistically different from zero, though many of the coefficients cannot be statistically

distinguished from one another. In general, persons entering unemployment either from

outside the labor force or from employment are the most likely to enter the JTPA

program. For adult men, individuals who recently became unemployed, either by leaving
9
    Heckman and Smith (1999) discuss the importance of these variables at greater length.


                                                     20
employment or by reentering the labor force, have higher application and acceptance

probabilities than the long term (over six months) unemployed. This difference does not

appear for women.

       Older adults have a lower conditional probability of application and acceptance,

consistent with conventional arguments that the return to training declines with age. The

effect of years of completed schooling on acceptance into the program shows a hill-

shaped pattern for adults, with individuals with less than 10 or more than 15 years of

schooling having differentially low estimated application and acceptance probabilities.

This pattern reveals that it is more than just low rates of awareness that cause those with

less than a high school education to have low rates of participation in JTPA conditional

on eligibility. For youth, the probability of application and acceptance increases

monotonically in years of schooling.

       Relative to single, never married persons, currently married persons have a

statistically significantly lower probability of application and acceptance for three of the

four demographic groups. Among adult men, but not the other three demographic

groups, divorced, widowed and separated persons also have lower probabilities of

application and acceptance into JTPA.

       The effect of living in a family receiving AFDC is negative for all four groups,

and statistically significant for three. In contrast, family Food Stamp receipt has a

positive influence in all cases. Interpreting the AFDC coefficient as the marginal effect

of family AFDC receipt in addition to Food Stamps, it appears that among aware

eligibles, AFDC recipients have much lower probabilities of application and/or

acceptance into JTPA than do those receiving only Food Stamps. As the effect of young




                                             21
children in the home is being controlled for, this difference does not result from young

children acting as a barrier to work or training outside the home.

       The effects of family income differ across groups. High levels of family income

reduce the probability of application and acceptance among adult males, have little effect

for adult females, and raise the probability of participation for both youth groups. The

availability of income from other family members to provide support during training

appears to encourage youth to apply to JTPA.

       Absent from the specifications reported here are measures of the state of the local

economy at the four sites during the time that the ENP and control samples were

collected. In work not reported in detail here, we estimate models including both county-

level monthly unemployment rates averaged over the counties constituting each of the

sites, and interactions between these unemployment rates and the site indicators.

Surprisingly, given the strong effects of individual unemployment found here, these

variables never attain statistical significance and never have a noticeable impact on the

proportion of correct predictions. One reason for this is that the number of ENPs whose

month of measured eligibility occurs in a given calendar month depends not only on the

size of the eligible population in that month, but also on the administrative schedule of

the consulting firm conducting the surveys. A second reason is that the flow into the

program, as measured by the number of persons randomly assigned in each calendar

month, depends on other factors beyond the local economy, including the academic

schedule of the community colleges that provide much of the JTPA training at these sites.

       In Appendix D, we report estimates of the determinants of application and

acceptance into JTPA conditional on eligibility rather than on awareness. In general, the




                                            22
main findings are the same in the two analyses. In particular, the labor force status

transition variables dominate both sets of results. The differences between the two are

consistent with the patterns in the two conditional analyses, so that factors whose main

impact is on awareness are statistically significant when we condition on eligibility but

are not when we condition on both eligibility and awareness.

        Our analysis of application and acceptance into JTPA conditional on eligibility

reveals the fundamental importance of labor force status dynamics in determining who

applies and is accepted into the program conditional on program awareness. A number of

other factors including age, schooling, marital status and family income play important

supporting roles.



8. The Determinants of Enrollment in JTPA

Formal enrollment constitutes the final stage in the JTPA participation process. In this

section we examine the determinants of the transition from acceptance into the program,

defined here as reaching random assignment, to formal enrollment.10 A key difference

between acceptance and enrollment is that only the outcomes of persons formally

enrolled in JTPA influenced the rewards (or punishments) that a site received under the

JTPA performance standards system. Training centers in JTPA had considerable

discretion regarding whether (and when) to enroll persons accepted into the program.

The performance standards system provided an incentive for training centers to delay

enrollment until accepted applicants provided evidence that they were likely to obtain a


10
   Heckman, Smith and Taber (1998) discuss non-enrollment within the experimental treatment group and
its implications for the evaluation of JTPA. See also the general discussions of treatment group dropout
and control group substitution in Heckman, Hohmann, Smith and Khoo (2000) and Heckman, LaLonde and
Smith (1999).


                                                  23
job or to otherwise count favorably toward center performance. In practice, this often

meant that individuals receiving job search assistance were not enrolled until they found

a job and that persons assigned to receive subsidized on-the-job training at private firms

were not enrolled until a firm willing to provide them with such training had been

located. For persons assigned to receive classroom training, training centers would often

wait until trainees successfully attended class before enrolling them in the program.

Thus, we expect that the incentives provided by the performance standards system should

result in higher probabilities of enrollment for persons with characteristics associated

with employability, such as higher levels of schooling or recent employment experience.

       Another factor influencing enrollment decisions for persons recommended for

classroom training is their ability to maintain themselves during the time they are

enrolled in training. Classroom training typically lasts longer than employment-related

services such as job search assistance. At the same time, unlike earlier programs such as

CETA, JTPA provided no stipends to trainees except in unusual circumstances. Thus, the

willingness of a person to pursue classroom training may depend on the availability of a

stable income from outside sources. Two important sources of income are transfer

programs such as AFDC and family income. Given that persons with limited access to

outside income may not take classroom training that is offered, and that enrollment

usually does not occur until a person begins attending classes, we would expect AFDC

and family income to have positive effects on the probability of enrollment, particularly

for adult women and female youth, who are relatively more likely to receive classroom

training (see, e.g., Kemple, Doolittle and Wallace, 1993).




                                             24
       At the same time, the lag between acceptance into the program and enrollment in

it may lead to changes in the opportunity costs of participation. Accepted applicants may

receive job offers that dominate the training offered by JTPA, or they may experience

illness or family problems that make it impossible for them to enroll. Thus, the patterns

we observe represent the combined influence of bureaucratic decisions regarding

enrollment and of individual decisions to continue in or drop out of the program in

response to changes in opportunity costs.

       Tables 6a and 6b present the results of logit analyses of enrollment for the four

demographic groups. The notes to the tables discuss the within-sample predictive

performance of the model, which is quite good. We find that the four training centers

have very different overall enrollment rates, even controlling for the observable

characteristics of their accepted applicants. For all four demographic groups, accepted

applicants at the Fort Wayne and Jersey City centers have enrollment probabilities

substantially lower than similar persons at Corpus Christi, which is the omitted training

center in our analysis. These differences reflect in part the differing mix of services

offered at the various sites. Corpus Christi offered mainly classroom training. This form

of service leads to a higher enrollment rate than other JTPA services (see Kemple,

Doolittle and Wallace, 1993). In contrast, Fort Wayne and, to a lesser extent, Jersey City,

primarily offered on-the-job training and job search assistance. Centers offering these

services will have lower enrollment rates among accepted applicants because those who

fail to locate a job or for whom no firm is willing to provide on-the-job training often do

not ever get enrolled in the program.




                                             25
       Conditional on acceptance into JTPA, older adults are less likely to enroll than

younger adults. This finding is consistent with the lower expected returns to training for

older persons, which would make them relatively more likely to drop out of the program

in response to a given outside opportunity. Family participation in the Food Stamp

program has a negative effect for three of the four demographic groups, with the effect

both large and statistically significant for adult females. To the extent that Food Stamp

recipients are less likely to find employment than other accepted applicants, this is

consistent with creaming induced by the operation of JTPA performance standards. Also

consistent with these incentives is our finding that for women and male youth, having no

employment experience strongly reduces the probability of enrollment.

       Finally, we estimate a large positive effect of family income on the enrollment

probability for adults. Family income may allow an accepted applicant to undertake

training even in the absence of a stipend. Thus, even though higher family income lowers

eligibility it raises the probability of enrollment among accepted applicants.

       Taken together, our findings on the determinants of enrollment, particularly the

effects of recent employment and participation in a transfer program, provide support for

the hypothesis that bureaucrats attempt to maximize the employability of those persons

selected for enrollment in the JTPA program from among the accepted applicants.




9. Decomposing the Process of Selection into JTPA




                                             26
In order to determine at what stage – enrollment (en), awareness (aw), acceptance (ac) or

eligibility (el) – and in which direction particular observable characteristics operate to

determine participation in the program, we use the chain rule to decompose the

probability of participation in the following way:



∂ Pr(en = 1| x)
                =                                                                                          (3)
      ∂x

 ∂ Pr(en = 1| ac = 1, aw = 1, el = 1, x) 
                 ∂x                        Pr(ac = 1| aw = 1, el = 1, x) Pr(aw = 1| el = 1, x) Pr(el = 1| x)
                                         ∂ Pr(ac = 1| aw = 1, el = 1, x) 
+ Pr(en = 1| ac = 1, aw = 1, el = 1, x)                                   Pr(aw = 1| el = 1, x) Pr(el = 1| x)
                                                       ∂x
                                                                       ∂ Pr(aw = 1| el = 1, x) 
+ Pr(en = 1| ac = 1, aw = 1, el = 1, x) Pr(ac = 1| aw = 1, el = 1, x)                            Pr(el = 1| x)
                                                                                 ∂x
                                                                                              ∂ Pr(el = 1| x) 
+ Pr(en = 1| ac = 1, aw = 1, el = 1, x) Pr(ac = 1| aw = 1, el = 1, x) Pr(aw = 1| el = 1, x)                     .
                                                                                                     ∂x


This equation decomposes the effect of a change in x on the probability of participation in

the program into its effect on each constituent probability weighted by the remaining

probabilities. In each term, the component in square brackets is the effect of a change in

x on one of the conditional probabilities leading to participation in the program.11 For

dichotomous variables, we replace derivatives with finite changes.

        Using (3), we can assess through which channels, if any, variation in x operates to

affect the probability of participation in JTPA. In this section, we present results for two

different decompositions. The two decompositions differ in terms of the number of steps

included, the set of variables included, and the data used to perform the decomposition.

These criteria are interrelated because the probability estimates are derived from different

11
  These relationships can be expressed more concisely using logarithmic derivatives. We do not use that
approach here because logarithmic derivatives are more difficult to interpret.


                                                     27
data sets and not all of the data sets contain all of the variables used to estimate the

conditional probabilities discussed in the preceding sections. Reducing the number of

stages enables us to estimate the effects of more characteristics. In addition, for certain

variables some of the stages in (3) are effectively eliminated. For example, belonging to

a family that receives AFDC or Food Stamps makes the probability of eligibility equal to

one. It is only informative to examine the effects of AFDC and Food Stamp receipt on

the remaining components of the decomposition.

           The first decompositions we present appear in Tables 7a to 7d. The format of

each table corresponds directly to equation (3). The estimates of the probability of

eligibility are based on the SIPP data. The estimates for the conditional probabilities of

awareness, of application and acceptance, and of enrollment all draw on data from the

four sites in the National JTPA Study, with the first two constructed using the ENP and

control data and the last obtained from the experimental treatment group. As in the

earlier tables, the reported derivatives consist of sample averages of individual

derivatives (or finite differences). They are not the derivatives evaluated at the sample

means of the characteristics.12

           The first column in the table presents the overall effect of a change in the

indicated characteristic x on the probability of enrollment; this is the term on the left-hand

side of (3). These values are expressed in terms of the expected change in the probability

of participation resulting from the indicated change in characteristics, multiplied by 100

for ease of presentation. To put the terms in context, note that the unconditional

probability of participation is around 0.03, so that an overall effect of -0.867, which is the

effect for adult males of switching from a family income of $0-$3,000 to one over
12
     Appendix C contains a detailed discussion of the simulations.


                                                      28
$15,000, translates into a change in the probability of -0.00867, or a reduction of nearly

one-third relative to the unconditional probability.

       The second, fourth, sixth and eighth columns of the first panel present the four

chain rule terms that compose the overall effect. Thus, for the decomposition in Tables

7a to 7d, the weighted eligibility term is given by the first term on the right-hand side of

(3), the weighted acceptance term by the second term in (3), the weighted awareness term

by the third term in (3), and the weighted enrollment term by the fourth term in (3). The

third, fifth, seventh and ninth columns present the percentage of the overall effect

attributable to each of the four components. Thus, the third column indicates the

percentage of the overall effect that results from the effect of the indicated change in x on

the conditional probability of eligibility, which is given by the ratio of the weighted

eligibility term to the overall effect multiplied by 100. The second panel of each table

presents the unweighted effect of the indicated change in x on each of the conditional

probabilities. This unweighted effect is just the average partial derivative (or finite

difference) of the probability with respect to the characteristic.

       The results for race and ethnicity are especially striking. Blacks consistently have

an overall probability of participation higher than that of whites. For three of the four

demographic groups, this higher overall probability decomposes into higher conditional

probabilities of eligibility and awareness, but lower conditional probabilities of

acceptance and enrollment. Decomposing the overall effect in this way makes it clear

where blacks fall out of the participation process, and suggests that policy measures

designed to increase their participation should focus on application, acceptance and

enrollment, rather than on changes in eligibility rules or on outreach efforts to increase




                                              29
awareness. This evidence indicates that the concerns expressed in the GAO report

discussed in the introduction to this paper regarding minority participation may be

relevant. Administrative discretion may have played a role in reducing black participation

in JTPA, and may continue to do so under WIA.

       A different pattern emerges for the categorical age variables. For adults, older

persons nearly always have lower conditional probabilities at every stage in the

participation process relative to persons age 22-29. The same is true of youth, where a

modest overall negative effect for 19-21 year olds relative to 16-18 year olds is mirrored

at each stage in the process except for the application and acceptance stage for male

youth and the eligibility and enrollment stages for female youth.

       Overall, being married rather than being single decreases the probability of

participation in JTPA for all four demographic groups. The dominant factor lowering

enrollment among married persons is a strong negative effect of marriage on the

conditional probability of application and acceptance. For adult males, this negative term

outweighs a positive effect of marriage on the conditional probabilities of eligibility,

awareness and enrollment. The probability of participation for divorced, widowed or

separated persons exceeds that for single persons in three of the four groups. For adult

males, positive effects of having once been married on eligibility, awareness and

enrollment dominate the negative acceptance term, while all but the eligibility term are

positive for adult females.

       For adults, the relationship between the overall probability of participation into

JTPA and years of completed schooling is roughly hill-shaped, with its peak occurring at

10-11 years of completed schooling for men and 13-15 years for women. The




                                             30
decompositions reveal that the overall relationship results from combining a negative

relationship between years of schooling and eligibility, and generally hill-shaped

relationships between schooling and awareness, application and acceptance, and

enrollment. For youth, the overall relationship between participation and years of

completing school peaks at 10-11 years for males and at less than 10 years for females.

       For three of the four demographic groups, the overall effect of having an own

child under six years of age in the home breaks down into a positive component due to

increased conditional probabilities of eligibility and enrollment, and negative components

due to decreased probabilities of awareness and acceptance. The overall effect is

negative for men and positive for women.

       The overall probability of participation in JTPA decreases monotonically in

family income for adult males and male and female youth, and peaks in the $3000-$9000

category for adult females. The strong negative relationship between family income and

the probability of eligibility described in section four dominates the overall effect in

almost every case. The exception is the peak for adult females, which results from the

influence of a similarly peaked pattern in the relationship between family income and the

conditional probabilities of awareness and of application and acceptance for that group.

       Tables 8a to 8d present a second set of decompositions. In these tables, we

decompose the probability of application and acceptance conditional on eligibility into

components due to awareness and due to application and acceptance given awareness.

Omitting the stages of eligibility and enrollment allows us to simulate using the same

ENP and control data from the National JTPA Study that we use to estimate the

conditional probabilities of awareness and of application and acceptance. Omitting the




                                             31
enrollment stage allows us to include variables representing recent labor force status

transitions, which are not available in the treatment group data we use to estimate the

probability of enrollment. Otherwise, the format of the tables and the construction of the

individual terms parallels that for the decompositions already discussed.

       The basic patterns for those variables, such as age and schooling, included in the

earlier decompositions remain essentially the same, so we do not dwell on them here. Of

great interest are the decompositions of the overall effects of family receipt of AFDC and

Food Stamps on the application and acceptance probabilities. The overall effect of

AFDC receipt is negative for all four groups. For both groups of adults, the overall effect

decomposes into a small effect due to awareness, combined with a large negative effect

of living in a family receiving AFDC on the probability of application and acceptance

conditional on awareness. For male youth, living in a family receiving AFDC has

negative effects of roughly equal size on awareness and on application and acceptance

given awareness, while for female youth positive awareness and negative application and

acceptance effects roughly cancel to yield a small overall effect.

       All four demographic groups show a positive impact of living in a family

receiving Food Stamps on the probability of application and acceptance. For all the

groups except female youth, this effect decomposes into roughly equal positive effects of

Food Stamp receipt on the probabilities of awareness and of application and acceptance

conditional on awareness. For female youth, the contribution of the awareness term is

negligible, leaving the impact of living in a family receiving Food Stamps on application

and acceptance to dominate the overall effect. Interpreting the estimated effect of family

receipt of AFDC as the additional effect of AFDC receipt given that the family receives




                                            32
Food Stamps, we find that AFDC provides additional information about JTPA but acts to

discourage application and acceptance.

       Finally, examination of the decompositions for the variables representing the two

most recent labor force statuses at the time of random assignment or eligibility screening

shows that in all cases it is the effect of these statuses on the probability of application

and acceptance conditional on awareness that accounts for their large positive effects on

the unconditional probability of application and acceptance. The estimated effects of

labor force transitions on awareness are small and are of mixed sign, with negative

estimated effects usually associated with transitions out of the labor force.

       These decompositions offer unique insights regarding the effects of characteristics

such as race, age, education, program participation, labor force status and family income

on the various stages of the process by which individuals select and are selected into the

JTPA program. For many characteristics, such as race and ethnicity, the same

characteristic has competing effects at different stages of the process. Other

characteristics, such as age among adults, operate in the same direction on the conditional

probabilities of program eligibility, awareness, application and acceptance, and formal

enrollment. Sorting out the effects of particular characteristics at each step enriches our

understanding of the overall participation process.



10. Summary and Conclusions

       In this paper, we develop a framework for studying the determinants of

participation in social programs. Our framework decomposes participation into a series

of stages: eligibility, awareness, application, acceptance and enrollment. Compared to




                                              33
simple comparisons of the characteristics of program eligibles and program participants,

our framework allows a deeper examination of issues related to the equity of the

distribution of program benefits, to the effects of administrative choices under the

influence of administrative performance standards systems, and to the optimal design of

non-experimental evaluations of program impacts.

         Several major empirical lessons emerge from this study. Although they arise

from data on JTPA, the similarity between JTPA and many other programs in the U.S.

and elsewhere that we document in Section 3 suggests they likely apply more broadly.

First, there is evidence of cream skimming in the program that is consistent with the

incentives embodied in the JTPA performance standards system. Among applicants

accepted into the program, blacks, persons with less than a high school education,

persons from poorer families and those without recent employment experience are less

likely to be enrolled than are persons in other racial and ethnic groups, persons with a

high school education, persons from richer families and persons with recent employment

experience. While these patterns are consistent with cream skimming, our analysis does

not reveal the separate influences of self-selection and selection by program staff.13

          Second, there is strong evidence that informational barriers play a major role in

determining differences in program participation rates, but these barriers do not fully

account for the differentially low participation rate of Hispanics identified by Gonzales

and Romero (1989) and Sandell and Rupp (1988). We have already discussed the role of

13
  In other work (Heckman, Smith and Taber, 1996), we use data from a single site in the National JTPA
Study to look solely at the transition from application to enrollment, the stage of the participation process
over which case workers presumably have the greatest control. We find evidence that caseworkers select
the applicants likely to do the worst, rather than the best, in the absence of the program. This suggests that
caseworker preferences for serving the most disadvantaged may overcome the incentives provided by the
performance standards system in some contexts. However, the findings in Heckman, Smith and Taber
(1996) could also result from more employable applicants leaving the program for employment prior to
enrolling.


                                                     34
education in improving awareness of the program. Controlling for other factors, persons

who are not fluent in English are less likely to be aware of the program. However,

differences in educational levels and in language ability are not the sole reason why

Hispanics are less likely to participate in the program than other groups. After taking

account of these differences, Hispanics were less likely to participate in JTPA.

       Third, labor force status dynamics, in particular recent unemployment histories,

played an important role in determining who applied and was accepted into JTPA from

among the population of eligible persons aware of the program. Eligible persons aware

of JTPA who were unemployed at the time they were deciding whether or not to

participate in the program, particularly those unemployed persons who had recently lost a

job or re-entered the labor force, have relatively high probabilities of application and

acceptance into JTPA. In contrast, persons in the midst of a stable employment spell or a

stable spell out of the labor force were quite unlikely to apply and be accepted into JTPA.

The JTPA program was in part a form of job search for the unemployed, and so attracted

persons who were actively seeking work.

       This finding indicates the importance of collecting information on detailed labor

force status transitions at the monthly level in non-experimental evaluations of

employment and training programs. Conditioning on earnings is not enough, as the set of

individuals with zero earnings includes individuals who are unemployed and individuals

who are out of the labor force, two groups that have very different patterns of program

participation and labor market outcomes.

       Finally, we demonstrate that changes in eligibility rules will have only a weak

effect on the participation of many groups. While the JTPA eligibility rules effectively




                                             35
denied access to program services to many groups, such as those with high family

incomes, they were powerless to induce particular groups within the eligible population

to participate. Put simply, you can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make it drink. For

example, individuals with low levels of schooling have very high rates of eligibility but

relatively low rates of participation conditional on eligibility. Even more striking is the

case of AFDC recipients, who were automatically eligible for JTPA but who had a low

participation probability relative to other groups within the eligible population. Getting

these groups to participate in employment and training programs such as JTPA and WIA

requires more than just making them eligible for program services.

       Our framework yields substantial insights regarding program equity, the effects of

administrative performance management systems, and the design of non-experimental

program evaluations. The evidence we present reveals the complex nature of the

program participation process, with some variables having conflicting effects on

participation at different stages in the process, and others operating in the same direction

at every stage. These insights are achieved by decomposing the participation process. our

analysis indicates the potential value of collecting the data required to perform similar

decompositions for other programs.

Table 1
Definitions of Variables

Site Indicators
Ft. Wayne, Jersey City and Providence indicate the site of residence. Corpus Christi is the omitted site.

Race and Ethnicity
Black, Hispanic and other race/ethnicity indicate race or ethnicity. Whites are the omitted group.

Age
Age categories indicate age at the time of eligibility determination or of the participation decision. The omitted
category is 16-18 years for youth and 22-29 years for adults.

Highest Grade Completed
Schooling categories indicate the highest grade of formal schooling completed. The omitted category is exactly
twelve years.

Low English Ability
This variable indicates low ability in English. For the ENPs, this means that the person completed the baseline
interview in a language other than English. For the controls, it means that the person indicated a language other
than English in response to a survey question on language preference.

Marital Histories
These categories indicate the respondent’s marital status history. The omitted category is single, never married.
In Table 8, the divorced, widowed and separated category is broken up into two categories, one for persons who
were last married from 1-24 months ago and one for persons who were last married more than 24 months ago.

Presence of Young Children
Children less than six indicates an own child less than six years old in the household.

Current AFDC Receipt
This variable indicates that the respondent was receiving benefits under the Aid to Families with Dependent
Children program, either as a case head or as part of someone else’s case.

Current Food Stamp (FS) Receipt
This variable indicates that the respondent was in a household receiving food stamps.

Current Labor Force Status
These variables indicate whether the respondent was employed, unemployed (not working but looking for work)
or out of the labor force (not employed and not looking for work). The omitted category is currently employed.

Labor Force Status Transitions
These categories in Tables 5 and 8 indicate the two most recent labor force statuses in the seven months up to
and including the month of the participation decision. The second status in each pattern indicates the labor force
status at the time of the participation decision. The first status indicates the status of the most recent prior spell
during the preceding six months. Thus, the pattern “employed - > unemployed” indicates someone who was
unemployed at the time of the participation decision but whose most recent prior labor force status within the
preceding six months was employed. Persons in the same labor force status for all seven months have repeated
patterns of the form “OLF - > OLF”. The omitted pattern is “employed - > employed”, indicating persistent
employment. In some cases, the “employed - > OLF” and “unemployed - > OLF” categories are collapsed due
to small sample sizes.

Time Since Most Recent Employment
These categories indicate the number of months since the person was last employed. The omitted category is
currently employed.

Family Income in the Last Year
These categories indicate total family earnings in the past year. The omitted category is less than $3000. For
some tables, the original six categories are combined into four due to small sample sizes.

Notes: Omitted categories in the logit are Corpus Christi, white, age 22-29, highest grade equals 12, never married, no young children,
not currently receiving AFDC, not currently receiving food stamps, currently employed, and family income less than $3,000. Using
the sample proportion aware of JTPA as the cutoff, the within-sample prediction rates for adult males are 63.29 percent for aware
eligibles and 62.95 percent for unaware eligibles. The corresponding rates for adult females are 69.44 percent for aware eligibles and
61.82 percent for unaware eligibles.

Notes: Omitted categories in the logit are Corpus Christi, white, age 16-18, highest grade equals 12, never married, no young children,
not currently receiving AFDC, not currently receiving food stamps, currently employed, and family income less than $3,000. Using
the sample proportion aware of JTPA as the cutoff, the within-sample prediction rates for male youth are 72.31 percent for aware
eligibles and 64.86 percent for unaware eligibles. The corresponding rates for female youth are 67.43 percent for aware eligibles and
53.64 percent for unaware eligibles.

Source: Authors’ calculations using National JTPA Study data.
Notes: Estimates reflect weighting to account for choice-based sampling. Omitted categories in the logit are Corpus Christi, white, age 22-29, highest grade equals 12,
never married, no young children, not currently receiving AFDC, not currently receiving Food Stamps, “Employed -> Employed”, and family income less than $3,000.
The categories “Employed -> OLF” and “Unemployed -> OLF” are combined due to small sample sizes. Using the population proportion of persons accepted into
JTPA (assumed to be three percent overall) to determine the cutoff, the within sample prediction rates for adult males are 81.06 for controls (applied and accepted into
JTPA) and 81.38 for ENPs (did not apply or not accepted into JTPA). The corresponding rates for adult females are 65.94 for controls and 71.43 for ENPs.

Notes: Estimates reflect weighting to account for choice-based sampling. Omitted categories in the logit are Corpus Christi, white, age 16-18, highest grade equals 12,
never married, no young children, not currently receiving AFDC, not currently receiving Food Stamps, “Employed -> Employed”, and family income less than $3,000.
The categories “Employed -> OLF” and “Unemployed -> OLF” are combined due to small sample sizes. Using the population proportion of persons accepted into
JTPA (assumed to be three percent overall) as the cutoff, the within sample prediction rates for male youth are 68.66 for controls (applied and accepted into JTPA) and
76.47 for ENPs (did not apply or not accepted into JTPA). The corresponding rates for female youth are 67.91 for controls and 69.57 for ENPs.

Notes: Estimation includes observations with imputed covariates due to relative high levels of item non-response. Omitted categories in the logit are
Corpus Christi, white, normal English ability, age 16-18, highest grade equals 12, never married, no young children, not currently receiving AFDC,
not currently receiving Food Stamps, currently employed, and family income less than $3,000. Using the sample proportion of accepted applicants
enrolled into JTPA as the cutoff, the within-sample prediction rates for male youth are 60.20 percent for enrollees and 65.08 percent for non-
enrollees. The corresponding rates for female youth are 57.51 percent for enrollees and 68.75 percent for non-enrollees.

A. Eligible Non-Participant (ENP) Sample

The ENP sample is based on a sample of dwelling units drawn from the areas served by

the Corpus Christ, Texas, Fort Wayne, Indiana, Jersey City, New Jersey and Providence,

Rhode Island JTPA training centers. The sampling frame excluded low poverty areas

containing up to, but not more than, five percent of those in each site with incomes at or

below 125 percent of the poverty level in 1980. In the remaining areas around each

center, each dwelling unit had an equal probability of selection for the initial screener

interviews. These interviews gathered information sufficient to determine the eligibility

status of each person in the surveyed household. The initial screening interviews were

conducted from January 1988 to December 1989, and had an overall response rate at the

four sites of 90 percent. See Smith (1994) for a detailed description of the ENP sampling

frame.

         Attempts were made to administer the Full Baseline Survey (FBS) to all of the

JTPA-eligible persons identified on the screeners at each site who were (1) eligible for

JTPA via economic disadvantage; (2) 16 to 54 years of age; (3) not in junior high or high

school; and (4) not permanently disabled. Persons over age 54 were known in advance to

have a low participation rate in JTPA and so were excluded in order to focus the available

resources on groups more likely to participate in the program. Youth in junior high or

high school were excluded in order to match a similar exclusion in the experimental

evaluation. The FBS interviews were completed between June 1988 and December 1989,

with a quarter of the completed interviews occurring five or more months after the initial
screening. The overall response rate of potential ENPs to the FBS was 78 percent,

yielding a sample of 3004 ENPs at the four sites.1

        Following their inclusion in the ENP sample, roughly three percent (104) of the

ENPs were later randomly assigned as part of the experimental component of the

National JTPA Study. As a result, a small number of respondents appear in both the

experimental and ENP samples analyzed in this paper. Because of their small number, we

do not omit these persons from either group.

        All ENPs with valid values for the relevant variables were used to construct the

rates shown in Table 3, to estimate the awareness logits presented in Table 4, to estimate

the acceptance logits reported in Table 5 and in Appendix D, to estimate the awareness

and acceptance logits underlying the decompositions in Tables 7 and 8, and to construct

the decompositions presented in Table 8.



B. Experimental Control Group Sample

The control group sample consists of persons randomly assigned to the experimental

control group at four of the sixteen JTPA training centers taking part in the experimental

evaluation component of the National JTPA Study. Control group members were not

allowed to receive any JTPA services in the 18 months after random assignment. At the

Corpus Christi and Fort Wayne centers, random assignment began in December 1987 and

concluded in January 1989, while in Jersey City and Providence it ran from November

The final sample sizes have Corpus Christi with 1060 ENPs and 489 controls, Ft. Wayne with 529 ENPs

controls.
1987 to September 1989. During these periods, a total of 2717 persons were assigned to

the control group at the four centers.

       All controls with valid values for the relevant variables were used to estimate the

awareness logits presented in Table 4, to estimate the acceptance logits presented in

Table 5 and in Appendix D, and to estimate the awareness and acceptance logits

underlying the decompositions presented in Tables 7 and 8.



C. Experimental Treatment Group Sample

The treatment group sample consists of persons randomly assigned to the experimental

treatment group at the same four sites in the National JTPA Study at which the control

and ENP samples were drawn. Treatment group members were allowed to (but often did

not) receive JTPA services in the 18 months after random assignment. A total of 5914

persons were randomly assigned to the experimental treatment group at the four sites.

Enrollment information is based on data collected from site administrative records by

MDRC. All treatment group members with valid values for the relevant variables were

used to estimate the enrollment logits presented in Table 6 and underlying the

decompositions presented in Table 7.



D. Imputations

Missing values due to item non-response were imputed for the ENPs and controls for

variables used in the awareness and acceptance logits. Missing values of dichotomous

variables, such as the presence of an own child less than six years of age in the

household, were replaced with the predicted probabilities estimated in a logit equation.
Missing values of indicator variables corresponding to particular values of categorical

variables with more than two categories, such as the five indicators for the categories of

the highest grade completed variable, were replaced by the predicted probabilities

obtained from a multinomial logit model with the categorical variable as the dependent

variable.

       In all cases, the estimating equations used to produce the imputations included the

following: (1) indicators for race/ethnicity, (2) indicators for age categories, (3) indicators

for receipt of a high school diploma or a GED, (4) site indicators and (5) interactions

between control status and all of these variables. These variables were chosen because

they had no (or very few) missing values in the sample. Imputed values were constructed

separately for each of the four demographic target groups. A similar imputation

procedure was followed for the experimental treatment group for values of variables used

in estimating the enrollment equations missing due to item non-response. A sensitivity

analysis comparing the results generated using the imputed values to results obtained

through listwise deletion of observations with missing values and through the inclusion of

missing value indicators shows the reported results to be robust to the method used to

handle item non-response.
Appendix B: SIPP Sample of JTPA Eligibles

The national sample that we use to estimate the determinants of JTPA eligibility is drawn

from the 1986 Panel of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). The

SIPP is a continuing longitudinal self-weighting survey of the non-institutional

population of the United States with a focus on current income and participation in social

programs. A new panel is introduced every year with each panel followed for about 2.5

years. Respondents are divided into four rotation groups with a different group

interviewed in each calendar month. In the 1986 SIPP Panel used here, three of the

rotation groups are interviewed seven times, and one is interviewed six times. At least

one rotation group is represented from October 1985 to March 1988. The calendar dates

in which all four of the rotation groups are represented are January 1986 to December

1987. This period is immediately prior to the period during which the ENP and

experimental control and treatment group samples from the National JTPA Study were

determined eligible for JTPA. The reference period for each SIPP interview is the four

calendar months preceding the interview month. Devine and Heckman (1996) show that

attrition from the SIPP panel has little effect on substantive results regarding JTPA

eligibility.

        Establishing the JTPA eligibility status of respondents in the SIPP requires

operational definitions of families and of family income. A person’s family members

include all other SIPP respondents who were living with the person and related by blood,

marriage, or adoption. A person’s family could be comprised of different people in each

month. A person is eligible via participation in a cash welfare program in a given month

if anyone in the person’s current family receives AFDC payments, general assistance, or
other cash welfare in that month. A person is eligible via participation in the food stamp

program in a given month if anyone in the person’s current family receives food stamps

in that month. A person is eligible by virtue of low family income if the sum of family

income in the previous six months is less than the higher of the poverty income guideline

or the BLS lower living standard income level applicable to the month of eligibility

determination and to the respondent’s geographic location and family size. Family

income in the previous six months is defined as the sum of the income in each month of

all of the people who were in the person’s family in that month.2

        Family income need not be the same for two people who are currently in the same

family because they may have been in different families during the six months prior to

eligibility determination. The definition of eligibility used here corresponds to Definition

B in Devine and Heckman (1996) and captures only eligibility via economic

disadvantage.

        Note that in the SIPP data we are not able to accurately measure foster child

status, disability or homelessness on a monthly basis, and so we are unable to implement

the special eligibility rules applicable to these groups in selecting our sample of eligibles.

However, these groups represent only a very small fraction of the eligible population, and

many of those eligible under the special provisions will also be identified as eligible

using the basic family income and program participation criteria that apply to all

individuals.

        We established the eligibility status of each sample member in each month after

the seventh month of the panel for which data were available. Eligibility cannot be

JTPA eligibility.
established with certainty for all sample members during the first six months of the panel

because the requisite six months of prior data on family income are not available. To

match the ENP sample, we exclude persons outside the 16 to 54 age range along with

persons enrolled in junior high or high school. All persons with valid values for the

relevant variables were used to estimate the eligibility logits presented in Table 2 and

those underlying the decompositions presented in Table 7. The same sample was used to

construct the decompositions displayed in Table 7.
Appendix C: Construction of the Reported Results

A. Logit Estimates

The logit estimates of the determinants of eligibility presented in Table 2 are obtained

using the SIPP sample. As we use the SIPP in person-month form, dependence may exist

between person-month observations corresponding to the same person. We estimate logit

equations allowing for semi-parametric heterogeneity to take account of this potential

dependence.

       The logit estimates of awareness of JTPA presented in Table 4, the logit estimates

of acceptance presented in Table 5 and in Appendix D, and the logit estimates of

awareness and of application and acceptance into JTPA conditional on awareness

underlying the decompositions in Table 7 and Table 8 are based on weighted logit

equations, with estimated standard errors adjusted to take account of choice based

sampling as in Amemiya (1985). The choice-based sampling in this case results from the

over-representation of the controls relative to their proportion of the eligible population.

Weights are derived from the assumption that controls represent three percent of the

eligible population, from the sample proportions of ENPs who indicate awareness of the

program, and from the assumption that all controls are aware of JTPA.

       The logit estimates of the determinants of enrollment presented in Table 6 are

obtained from ordinary unweighted logit equations. For all of the logit estimates we

present, the numerical derivatives are based on finite differences averaged over the

sample, not on derivatives at the sample mean.
B. Decompositions

The decompositions presented in Tables 7 and 8 are based on estimates of the conditional

probabilities of JTPA eligibility, awareness, acceptance and enrollment obtained as

described above. To construct the values shown in Table 7, each term in equation (3) was

calculated for each person-month observation in the SIPP sample. The values reported in

Table 7 are the sample average for each term or combination of terms. The values in

Table 8 were constructed in the same manner, but using the ENP sample rather than the

SIPP sample. In both tables, derivatives are approximated using finite differences.
Appendix D: Determinants of Application and Acceptance Conditional on Eligibility

In this appendix, we present the results of a logit analysis of the determinants of

application and acceptance into JTPA conditional on eligibility. The estimates appear in

Tables D1a and D1b. These results complement the estimates of the determinants of

application and acceptance conditional on awareness presented in Table 5 in the main

text.

Source: Authors’ calculations using National JTPA Study data.
Notes: Dependent variable is control status. The sample includes all ENPs and controls (not just those aware of JTPA) and is weighted to account for choice-based
sampling. Omitted categories in the logit are Corpus Christi, white, age 22-29, highest grade equals 12, never married, no young children, not currently receiving
AFDC, not currently receiving Food Stamps, “Employed -> Employed”, and family income less than $3,000. Using the population proportion of JTPA participants
(controls), which we assume to be three percent, as the cutoff value, the within-sample prediction rates for adult males are 84.20 for non-participants (ENPs) and 82.89
for participants (controls). The corresponding rates for adult females are 75.72 for non-participants and 69.62 for participants.

Source: Authors’ calculations using National JTPA Study data.
Notes: Dependent variable is control status. The sample includes all ENPs and controls (not just those aware of JTPA) and is weighted to account for choice-based
sampling. Omitted categories in the logit are Corpus Christi, white, age 16-18, highest grade equals 12, never married, no young children, not currently receiving
AFDC, not currently receiving Food Stamps, “Employed -> Employed”, and family income less than $3,000. Using the population proportion of JTPA participants
(controls), which we assume to be three percent, as the cutoff value, the within-sample prediction rates for male youth are 69.27 for non-participants (ENPs) and 66.10
for participants (controls). The corresponding rates for adult females are 73.58 for non-participants and 67.16 for participants.
