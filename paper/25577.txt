                                               ABSTRACT

Over the last half century, U.S. wage growth stagnated, wage inequality rose, and the labor-force participation
rate of prime-age men steadily declined. In this article, we examine these labor market trends, focusing
on outcomes for males without a college education. Though wages and participation have fallen in
tandem for this population, we argue that the canonical neo-classical framework, which postulates
a labor demand curve shifting inward across a stable labor supply curve, does not reasonably explain
the data. Alternatives we discuss include adjustment frictions associated with labor demand shocks
and effects of the changing marriage market—that is, the fact that fewer less-educated men are forming
their own stable families—on male labor supply incentives.

Our observations lead us to be skeptical of attempts to attribute the secular decline in male labor-force
participation to a series of separately-acting causal factors. We argue that the correct interpretation
probably involves complicated feedback between falling labor demand and other factors which have
disproportionately affected men without a college education.

        During the last 50 years, labor market outcomes for men without a college education in

the United States worsened considerably. Between 1973 and 2015, real hourly earnings for the

typical 25-54-year-old man with only a high school degree declined by 18.2 percent,1 while real

hourly earnings for college-educated men increased substantially. Over the same period, labor-

force participation by men without a college education plummeted. In the late 1960s, nearly all

25-54-year-old men with only a high school degree participated in the labor force; by 2015, such

men participated at a rate of 85.3 percent.

        In this article, we examine secular change in the U.S. labor market since the 1960s. We

have two distinct but related objectives. First, we assemble an overview of developments in the

wage structure, focusing on the dramatic rise in the college wage premium. Second, we examine

possible explanations for the decline in labor-force participation among less-educated men. We

begin this part with a review of literature connecting declining labor market activity with

declining wages in this population. While such a connection indicates a reduction in labor

demand, we point out that the canonical neoclassical framework, which emphasizes a labor

demand curve shifting inward across a stable labor supply curve, does not reasonably account for

this development. This is because wages have not declined consistently over the sample period

while labor-force participation has. Moreover, the uncompensated elasticity of labor supply

necessary to align wage changes with participation changes, during periods when both were

declining, is implausibly large.

        We then examine two oft-discussed developments outside of the labor market: rising

access to Social Security disability insurance (DI), and the growing share of less-educated men

with a prison record. Rising DI program participation can account for a non-trivial share of

 Hourly earnings declined from $21.40 to $17.50. Throughout this article we adjust reported wages to 2017 prices
using the Personal Consumption Expenditure deflator.

                                                                                                                   2
declining labor-force participation among men aged 45-54, but appears largely irrelevant to

declining participation in the 25-44-year-old group. Additionally, we document that most non-

participating men support themselves primarily on the income of other family members, with a

distinct minority depending primarily on their own disability benefits. The literature has not

progressed far enough to admit a reasonable quantification of the impact of rising exposure to

prison on the labor-force participation rate, but recent estimates suggest that sizable effects are

possible. We flag this as an important area for further research.

       The existing literature, in our view, has not satisfactorily explained the decline in less-

educated male labor-force participation. This leads us to develop a new explanation. As others

have documented, family structure in the United States has changed dramatically since the

1960s, featuring a tremendous decline in the share of less-educated men forming and maintaining

stable marriages. We additionally show an increase in the share of less-educated men living with

their parents or other relatives. Providing for a new family plausibly incentivizes a man to

engage in labor market activity: a reduction in the prospects of forming and maintaining a stable

family, then, removes an important labor supply incentive. At the same time, the possibility of

drawing income support from existing relatives creates a feasible labor-force exit. We suspect

that changing family structure not only shifts male labor supply incentives independently of

labor market conditions, but also moderates the effect of a male labor demand shock on labor-

force participation. Since male earning potential is an important determinant of new marriage

formation, a persistent labor demand shock which reduces male earning potential exerts an

impact on male labor-force participation which operates through the marriage market.

       Much prior research has addressed U.S. labor market trends over the last half century,

including several recent reviews on male employment (Moffitt 2012; CEA 2016; Abraham and



                                                                                                      3
Kearney 2018). Our aim is not to exhaustively review the literature, but rather to point out

where we think consensus has developed and where we think important questions remain

unanswered. In the synthesis that emerges, the phenomenon of declining prime-age male labor-

force participation is not coherently explained by a series of separately-acting causal factors. A

more reasonable interpretation, we argue, involves complex feedbacks between labor demand,

family structure, and other factors which have disproportionately affected less-educated men.



The U.S. Wage Structure since 1970

        Prime-age men of all education levels experienced robust wage growth in the mid-1960s

and early 1970s, as shown in Figure 1, which plots trends in geometric average hourly earnings

by education group.2 This growth ceased after 1973, with hourly earnings for all but those with

advanced degrees falling for the next 20 years. After rising again for a decade starting around

1994, hourly earnings stagnated for the next decade (again, apart from those with advanced

degrees). Over the last few years, hourly earnings have begun to grow again for men of all

education levels. It is too early to tell whether this growth is a blip in the long-run trend or the

beginning of a sustained increase. Nonetheless, for groups without a college degree, real hourly

earnings were substantially lower in 2015 than they were in 1973.3




2
  We use the March supplement to the Current Population Survey throughout this paper unless otherwise specified.
Following the standard definition, we consider prime-age men to be between the ages of 25 and 54. Within each
education group we implement a reweighting method to hold constant the age distribution across time. We compute
geometric averages by applying the exponential function to the average of log hourly earnings. An online appendix,
available at <>, includes details regarding data processing as well as additional figures and tables.
3
  The hourly earnings numbers we report represent geometric average hourly earnings for those working in the
reference year. Conceptually, we might prefer the typical wage that a man might expect (including those not
working). Using techniques developed by Juhn, Murphy and Topel (1991) we imputed wages for those who did not
work throughout the entire reference year. Including these imputations in our calculation of wages mildly affects
the trends but does not substantially alter the broad patterns across time. See Appendix Figure A1.

                                                                                                                 4
       Substantial changes in wage dispersion are also apparent. During the 1970s, wages of

college graduates fell relative to those of high school graduates; after 1980, the college wage

premium increased dramatically. For example, in 1980, the average college graduate earned

1.26 times as much per hour as the average high school graduate. By 2015, this differential had

widened to 1.68. The wage differential for advanced degree holders relative to high school

graduates grew more sharply, from 1.41 to 2.17. Note that we are using the geometric average,

which is less sensitive than the arithmetic average to outlier earners: if hourly earnings are log-

normally distributed, the geometric average is the median of the distribution. Moreover, we have

removed outlier earners from our calculations (see Appendix for details). Even with these

adjustments to the data, we still measure a large secular increase in male wage dispersion.

       A breakdown of the full sample into different demographic groups reveals similar

patterns (Appendix Figure A2). For example, whites and blacks of all ages and education levels

experienced strong wage growth in the mid-1960s and early 1970s. Thereafter, whites and

blacks of all ages experienced substantial wage decline—especially the high school dropout

populations. This was followed by robust growth for all demographic groups from 1994-2002

and then modest decline throughout the 21st century. Since the early 1990s, cumulative wage

growth appears to be higher for high school dropouts than for high school graduates or those

with some college education. One modest exception to these overall patterns is that secular wage

fluctuations appear relatively muted for the 45-54 age group. Card and Lemieux (2001) have

shown how these patterns are consistent with cohort-specific changes in relative supply, though




                                                                                                      5
an alternative explanation is that older workers are more insulated from labor market change than

younger workers.4

        When analyzing secular change in labor market outcomes by education group, an

important question is whether the underlying skill composition of education groups has remained

constant over time. This may be especially relevant for the less-educated groups of interest. For

example, in the late 1960s, nearly 40 percent of prime-age men had not completed high school;

by the 2010s, this share had plummeted to around 10 percent. The share of prime-age men with

only a high school degree has remained relatively constant over time as high school completion

rates but also college participation rates have risen. It is plausible that at least a portion of

observed secular declines in wages and employment among less-educated men stem from this

population becoming increasingly negatively selected on labor market skills.

        To assess this possibility, we compiled data from the National Longitudinal Surveys of

Youth (NLSY) containing well-validated measures of cognitive and non-cognitive skills.

Results and further discussion comparing the 1959-65 birth cohorts (drawn from the NLSY79) to

the 1980-84 birth cohorts (drawn from the NLSY97) appear in the online appendix. Perhaps

surprisingly, we document little evidence that average skill levels in the high-school-dropout and

high-school-graduate populations declined between the two cohorts. Our observations are

relatively consistent with the work of Altonji, Bharadwaj and Lange (2012) documenting

population improvements in various skill levels between the NLSY79 and 97 cohorts.

Explaining Wage Dispersion




4
 While the focus of this paper is on men, it is worth mentioning that wages for women have followed similar trends
(Autor 2014), though with more overall wage growth since the late 1970s, commensurate with the narrowing of the
gender wage gap (Blau and Kahn 2017).


                                                                                                                 6
       Labor economists have drawn on the neoclassical supply-demand framework to interpret

secular changes in wage dispersion. For example, the relative size of the college-educated

workforce grew rapidly during the 1970s, inducing the relative wages of college graduates to fall

(Freeman 1975). Since then, the relative supply of college-educated workers grew at a slower

rate and their relative wages rose dramatically. These developments are consistent with an

outward shift in relative demand for college-educated workers (Katz and Murphy 1992; Murphy

and Welch 1992; Bound and Johnson 1992; for a longer-term perspective, Goldin and Katz

2008). Autor, Katz and Kearney (2008) attributed secular growth in the college wage premium

over the 1970s-early 2000s to an outward shift in relative demand which proceeded at a constant

pace until the early 1990s and then slowed somewhat.

       Since 1990, a voluminous literature has analyzed potential causes of shifts in relative

demand. Some initially observed that rising trade with countries with abundant supplies of less-

skilled workers should put downward pressure on the relative wages of less-skilled U.S. workers

(for example, Murphy and Welch 1991). Economists during the 1990s produced a range of

empirical estimates of this effect, generally finding that the magnitudes were not nearly large

enough to explain the entire observed decline in relative wages. According to the 1997 survey of

William Cline, “a reasonable estimate…would be that the international influences [have]

contributed about 20 percent of the rising wage inequality in the U.S.” Even this modest

estimate was high relative to other contemporary surveys (for example, the 1995 “Symposium on

Inequality and Trade” issue of this journal).

       Over the last 25 years, the North American Free Trade Agreement was implemented,

China joined the World Trade Organization, and the volume of trade between high and middle-

income countries increased dramatically. Nonetheless, more recent studies reached the same



                                                                                                   7
basic conclusion, with Katz (2008) suggesting that rising trade accounted for less than 20 percent

of the increase in the college wage premium between 1980 and 2006 (see also Krugman 2008;

Bivens 2007). More recently, Autor, Dorn and Hanson (2013) leveraged commuting-zone-level

variation to estimate that rising import competition from China could explain roughly 25 percent

of the decline in U.S. manufacturing employment between 1990 and 2007. Their estimates

indicate large effects of trade on highly-exposed communities but are consistent with modest

overall effects of trade on relative wages.

        What explains the other 80 percent of the growth in dispersion in the U.S. wage

structure? During the 1990s, a consensus arose that skill-biased technological change was a

primary driver. Bound and Johnson (1992) and Katz and Murphy (1992) showed that labor

reallocation across sectors could account for relatively little of the shift in the utilization of

skilled labor during the 1980s. Most of the change occurred within narrowly defined sectors,

suggesting a broad-based shift in demand for skilled labor unrelated to trade forces.5 Berman,

Bound and Grilliches (1994) and Autor, Katz and Krueger (1998) reported similar findings,

while also showing that skill upgrading was most rapid within industries which invested most in

computer technologies.

        The “skill-based” framework succeeds in explaining the dramatic growth in wage

dispersion of the 1980s. However, since the 1990s, wages of high school dropouts relative to

high school graduates and those with some college have not continued to decline—if anything

they have increased. Accordingly, Autor, Levy and Murnane (2002, 2003) envisioned a

framework in which the production process involves several types of tasks: for example, manual,


5
 Feenstra and Hanson (1996; 1999) argued that the outsourcing of intermediate products implied that the framework
used by the above authors would underestimate the role played by trade. While this point is well-taken, even after
accounting for outsourcing, Feenstra and Hanson’s estimates suggested that skill-biased technological change was
substantially more important than trade in explaining the rise in the relative demand for college-educated labor.

                                                                                                                8
routine, and abstract. Computers substitute for labor in routine tasks but complement labor in

abstract tasks, resulting in increased relative demand for labor with high cognitive skill. Autor,

Katz and Kearney (2006, 2008) have also hypothesized that computers do not impact low-skill

manual tasks: thus, this “task-based” framework can account for the post-1990s polarization of

relative wage growth.6 The task-based framework has become an enormously influential in

terms of understanding which jobs are vulnerable to displacement (Acemoglu and Autor, 2011).

Research following Autor, Levy and Murnane (2002, 2003) has found that routine tasks are

likeliest to be moved offshore or automated (e.g. Frey and Osborne 2017) and, in general, that

skill-biased technological change is fundamentally altering the nature of work (Levy and

Murnane 2004; Acemoglu and Restrepo 2018).

         Other factors may also have contributed to the growth in wage dispersion since 1980.

Some have focused on institutional factors. For example, DiNardo, Fortin and Lemieux (1996)

estimated that the decline in unionization of workers contributed close to 20 percent of the rise in

the college wage premium over the 1980s, although these estimates ignore general equilibrium

effects of de-unionization. While such effects in theory could cut in either direction, recent work

has found positive spillover effects of unions on the wages of comparable nonunion workers

(Fortin, Lemieux and Lloyd 2018). DiNardo, Fortin and Lemieux (1996) also estimated that the

falling real minimum wage modestly increased the college wage premium for young men but had

negligible effects for more experienced men. Subsequent research has confirmed small effects of

changes in the minimum wage on the wages of low-wage workers (Lee 1999; Autor, Manning




6
  Holzer (2010) has argued that the polarization claim is oversold: while middle-skill jobs have been disappearing in
some sectors, they have been stable or growing in others. A different explanation emphasizes feedback effects of
the skill-based framework operating through the product market. For example, an increase in relative demand for
skilled labor may raise skilled households’ demand for service-oriented products which are intensive in unskilled
labor (Mazzolari and Ragusa, 2013; Murphy, 2016).

                                                                                                                    9
and Smith 2016). Other work has discussed the impact of the deregulation of various industries

(Hirsch 1988; Rose 1987; in this journal, Fortin and Lemieux 1997).

       Another factor that has received considerable attention is the assimilation of massive

inflows of women and immigrant men into the U.S. labor market. As illustrated in Appendix

Table A1, women and immigrant men of all education statuses and age levels have increasingly

entered the U.S. labor market since 1960. However, the entry of women has been skill-biased.

For example, among 35-44-year-olds, the female share of the college-educated workforce more

than doubled, from 25 percent in 1960 to 51 percent in 2016. On the other hand, the female

share of the high school graduate workforce increased only slightly, from 38 percent in 1960 to

41 percent in 2016. It is therefore unlikely that the entry of women into the workforce has

increased the college wage premium: if anything, such a development should have exerted

downward pressure.

       The effect of immigration on the male wage distribution is more complicated to evaluate.

Inspection of Table A1 reveals that the increase in competition from immigrant men has been

modest and relatively uniform across education statuses—except for high school dropouts, where

the share immigrant men increased from roughly 5 to roughly 40 percent between 1960 and

2016. The impact of this influx on native (and immigrant) labor market opportunities remains a

hotly debated topic (see Card 2009; Borjas 2016; in this journal, Peri 2016). While it might

seem that the large inflow of workers with less than a high school education would significantly

depress high school dropouts’ relative wages, there are several reasons to suspect smaller effects.

First, if dropouts and high school graduates are close to perfect substitutes (as Card 2009

argued), the negative impact of this inflow will be diffused across all those with no more than a

high school education. Second, if immigrants tend to specialize in certain occupations, this may



                                                                                                 10
increase opportunities for workers in other occupations due to production complementarities

(Peri and Sparber 2009). Third, the endogenous responses of natives to an influx of immigrants

is likely to dilute the economic effects of immigration (for a fuller discussion of each of these

issues, see Peri 2016). It does seem likely, however, that immigrants depress relative wages

locally in occupations into which they cluster (Cortes 2008; Burstein et al. 2017).

Secular Stagnation

       If average wages for prime-age men had been trending upward strongly, then greater

wage dispersion could have been accompanied by higher wages for all, even the less-educated.

But instead, greater wage dispersion happened against a backdrop of stagnant average wage

growth. As reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, labor productivity grew at a brisk pace of

2.8 percent per year between 1948 and 1972. Thereafter, between 1973 and 2016, productivity

growth averaged only 1.4 percent per year (apart from a temporary boom from 1995 to 2004).

Thus, even if real hourly earnings had kept pace with productivity, there would have been a

slowdown in average wage growth. But additionally, in the last 20 years, labor’s share in

national income has steadily dropped (Appendix Figure A3; for explanations of this

phenomenon, see Elsby et al. 2013, Karabarbounis and Neiman 2014, Autor et al. 2017), leading

real hourly earnings to grow even more slowly than labor productivity. In the face of stagnant

overall wage growth created by these two developments, greater wage dispersion has translated

into a modest reduction in wages paid to less-skilled men.



The Secular Decline in Male Labor-Force Participation

       As reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there has been a near-continuous decrease

in the labor-force participation rate of prime-age American men, from 97.2 percent in 1960 to


                                                                                                    11
88.2 percent in 2015: a cumulative decline of 9 percentage points. Considering that the

population of prime-age men in 2015 was around 61.4 million, the secular decline in

participation implies a cumulative loss of 5.53 million men from the prime-age workforce.7

         In Figure 2 we plot the 1965-2016 evolution of the labor-force participation rate by

education status, using data from the March supplement to the Current Population Survey based

on individuals’ reported labor-force statuses in the survey week. The solid series include all

prime-age men, while the dashed series exclude foreign-born immigrants. (The CPS does not

record birthplace until 1994.) This exclusion lowers measured participation for high school

graduates and dramatically affects the downward trend for those without a high school diploma,

reflecting increasing representation of immigrants in this segment of the population combined

with their higher participation rates (Borjas 2017). The hourly earnings series presented earlier

in Figure 1 are not nearly as sensitive to the exclusion of immigrants.

         As in the case of earnings, we observe a dramatic rise in labor-force participation

dispersion across education levels. In 1965, the difference in the participation rate between

advanced degree holders and high school dropouts was 3.2 percentage points; by 2015, this

difference had widened to 17.6 percentage points. Within the U.S.-born population, the

difference in the participation rate between advanced degree holders and high school dropouts

was a tremendous 31.5 percentage points in 2015. Clearly, most of the secular decline in prime-

age male labor-force participation can be attributed to those without a college degree; we focus

on this group for the remainder of the paper.



7
 Although we focus here on the labor-force participation rate, the literature has sometimes focused on the
employment-to-population ratio. This statistic has also exhibited a long-run decline, but the pattern is far more
cyclical (at shorter as well as slightly longer-run frequencies). Business cycle dynamics are not a focus of this
paper, although it should be acknowledged that the participation rate exhibits mild cyclicality as well. This was
particularly evident in the early 2000s boom (Charles, Hurst and Notowidigo 2016), Great Recession, and
subsequent recovery. At the long-run frequency of interest, cyclicality does not affect the participation rate.

                                                                                                                    12
       Appendix Figure A4 breaks the full sample up into demographic sub-groups by race, age

and education, and confirms that the same overall pattern of decline in prime-age male labor-

force participation holds true within each sub-group. However, within each education status,

blacks experienced larger declines than whites at all age levels. This is especially true among

high school dropouts, where black participation rates tumbled by 30-40 percentage points. We

also note some heterogeneity in participation trends by age: while all age groups have withdrawn

from the labor force consistently over the sample period, the rate of withdrawal for young

workers aged 25-34 relative to older workers increased slightly after the mid-1990s. (This is

apart from high school dropouts aged 45-54, who have experienced alarmingly high rates of

withdrawal from the labor-force.)

Is Non-Participation Temporary or Permanent?

       Does the measured labor-force participation rate reflect brief periods of non-participation

experienced by a sizable share of the population, or perpetual non-participation experienced by a

small share of the population? An account of how non-participation is distributed in the

population provides information about the appropriate theoretical framework for examining

change. For example, the canonical neoclassical labor supply framework conceives of the

amount of time spent working, given an hourly wage rate, as an optimal tradeoff between income

and substitution effects (Deaton and Muellbauer, 1980). This framework cannot readily shed

light on the decision not to spend any time working, which represents a corner solution.

However, if most men who are not participating at a given point in time will participate in the

future, then the standard framework remains a useful tool to analyze (changes in) male

participation behavior.




                                                                                                  13
       Using retrospective reports of labor-force status from the March Current Population

Survey, Juhn, Murphy and Topel (1991, 2002) argued that the rise in male joblessness since the

1960s was almost entirely the result of a growing number of men withdrawing permanently from

the workforce. Using contemporaneous reports of labor-force status, Coglianese (2018) recently

challenged this contention, showing that retrospective reports result in an undercount of brief

non-participation spells. We continue to examine this issue by leveraging two longitudinal

sources of labor-force participation data. The data come from a U.S. Census Bureau data

product which links Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) respondents to their

earnings information from the Social Security Administration (SSA). Details are provided in the

online appendix.

       Using the SIPP data, we define participation as working at least one week in the given

survey month, and report in the top panel of Table 1 participation transition probabilities for

currently non-participating sub-groups of men with high school education or less. We consider

two such groups: men who experienced a transition from participation to non-participation

within the first 12 sample months, and men who began the sample period as non-participants.

We observe substantial short-run spells of non-participation. Among white high school

graduates who experienced a transition to non-participation, 51 percent had returned to the labor

force after 3 months, and 77 percent had returned to the labor force after 12 months. Among

white high school graduates who began the sample period as non-participants, 25 percent were in

the labor force after 3 months and 49 percent were in the labor force after 12 months. While

there are mild education and racial gradients to these estimates, we note striking consistency

across demographic groups.




                                                                                                  14
         Using earnings histories from the SSA, which exist on a consistently-coded basis for the

years 1978-2011, we are also able to construct participation transition rates over a longer-run

horizon. These are shown in the second panel of Table 1. Following Coglianese (2018), we

define yearly participation as a situation in which total administrative earnings for the year

exceed the threshold of one-half of the federal minimum wage times 40 hours per week times 13

weeks. We construct two similar groups of non-participants: men who experienced a transition

to yearly non-participation within the first 15 years observed, and men who were non-

participants in the first year observed. (Because the definition of participation differs in these

short- and long-run analyses, the 12-month hazards reported in the top panel of Table 1 differ

from the 1-year hazards reported in the bottom panel.) Among white high school graduates who

experienced a transition to full-year non-participation, 66 percent had achieved annual

participation 2 years later, and 83 percent had achieved annual participation 5 years later.

Among white school graduates who entered the sample as full-year non-participants, 54 percent

achieved annual participation after 2 years, and 76 percent achieved annual participation after 5

years.

         These findings indicate substantial churn into and out of the labor force at long-run as

well as short-run frequencies.

How do Jobless Men Survive?

         Another important aspect of labor market non-participation is an account of how non-

participating men obtain resources. Table 2 records annual household income statistics for

prime-age men with low labor-force attachment. (We define low labor-force attachment as no

more than 13 weeks of employment during the reference year.) The March supplement to the

Current Population Survey does not fully distinguish among relevant sources of income until



                                                                                                     15
1992; thus, we consider all years from 1992 to 2017. For each education status, the top panel

reports average levels of annual income, rounded to the nearest hundred and broken down by

income source. This illustrates how much income the average man has access to and where it

comes from. The bottom panel records the frequency with which each source of income

accounts for the largest share of total household income, thereby illustrating heterogeneity in

income receipt. The online appendix contains additional information on data processing and

discusses some additional tabulations.

       Low-participating men earn very little income: average earnings across all demographic

groups are at or below $1,300—an extremely low amount to live on for an entire year (top

panels). Accordingly, only 2-3 percent of the time does the man’s own earnings account for the

largest share of total household income (bottom panels). Among 45-54-year old men, own

disability-related benefits are relatively important, amounting to around $7,300 for whites and

$5,300 for blacks. Own disability benefits constitute the largest share of total household income

in 25-30 percent of these cases. While this number is not small, it still represents a distinct

minority; and for younger groups, own disability benefits are relatively unimportant. Across all

demographic groups, income from other household members appears to be the dominant income

source. This is especially true among 25-34-year-old men, where cohabitants’ income accounts

for 82-86 percent of total household income on average, and some source of cohabitants’ income

accounts for the largest share of household income 70-75 percent of the time. Even among 45-

54-year men, some source of cohabitants’ income accounts for the largest share of household

income in the majority of cases.

       In tabulations not shown, we found that around 40 percent of white high school dropouts,

30 percent of white high school graduates, 53 percent of black high school dropouts and 44



                                                                                                  16
percent of black high school graduates lived in households with total income below the federal

poverty line. Much smaller shares, however—5-7 percent of whites and 7-10 percent of

blacks—lived in extreme poverty (last row of the table). We define extreme poverty as a

situation in which household members subsist on less than $4 per day at 2017 prices,

implementing a square-root equivalence scale to adjust for household size. For example, the

extreme poverty threshold for a 4-person household is $4 per day times 365 days times sqrt(4) =

$2,920. Even smaller shares of men—around 3 percent across all groups—lived above the

extreme poverty line but depended primarily on food stamps assistance (third-to-last row of the

table). Thus, while living standards may not be high for these men, the income of other

household members plays an effective role in keeping most of them out of extreme poverty.

       It is important to reiterate that the above numbers are based on survey data. There is

ample reason to believe that the reported earned income figures are underestimates, because

episodic sources of income tend to be underreported (Mathiowetz, Bound and Brown 2002) or

even unreported (Edin and Lein 1997; Meyer and Sullivan 2003, in this journal 2012; Bollinger

et al. forthcoming). Recent work using administrative data has demonstrated that survey data

understates the incomes of low-income men and overstates incidence of extreme poverty (Meyer

and Mittag 2015; Meyer et al. 2018). However, this work tends to confirm the notion that men

with a weak attachment to the workforce largely persist on the incomes of other household

members.



Explaining the Decline

       Less-educated men have experienced downward trends in wages, employment and

participation since the early 1970s. Therefore, in attempting to explain the latter trends, a


                                                                                                 17
reasonable starting point is to ask if changes in the returns to labor market activity can account

for the observed decline in labor market activity.

        This interpretation of the data gained currency with the work of Juhn, Murphy and Topel

(1991, 2002; see also Juhn 1992). Focusing on the period of the late 1960s thru late 1980s, these

authors estimated labor supply curves from repeated cross-sectional and cross-regional data. In

both cases, for less-skilled men, they found strong associations between declines in wages and

declines in labor market activity, implying an uncompensated labor supply elasticity of around

0.4 for the lowest skilled group.8 They interpreted their findings as reflecting labor demand

shifts against a stable and upward-sloping supply curve.

        We are uncomfortable with this interpretation for two reasons. The first is that it belies

the conventional wisdom that the (uncompensated) labor supply curve for men is inelastic. This

conventional wisdom comes from the fact that tremendous wage increases in the US, Canada, the

UK and Germany between 1900 and 1970 have all been associated with small declines in the

labor force participation of prime-age men (for international evidence, see Pencavel 1986; for US

evidence, see Ruggles 2015). This notion makes economic sense: if leisure is a superior good,

we would expect leisure’s share in total household consumption to rise as wages rise. Second,

although wages and participation for less-educated men trended downward in tandem throughout

the 1970s and 80s, participation continued to decline after 1995, when wages were

comparatively stable (recall Figure 1).

        More recent work has also attributed secular decline in less-educated male wages and

employment to declining labor demand (Autor 2011; Moffitt 2012; CEA 2016). For example,


8
  Interpreting this estimate as an uncompensated (Marshallian) labor supply elasticity, rather than as an inter-
temporal (Frisch) elasticity, implies assuming that workers anticipated the wage changes they experienced to be
permanent rather than temporary. Given the apparent protracted nature of local labor demand shocks in low- and
medium-skill male sectors (to be discussed below), this assumption seems appropriate.

                                                                                                                   18
Abraham and Kearney (2018) write: “Our review of the evidence leads us to conclude that labor

demand factors are the primary drivers of the secular decline in employment over the 1999 to

2016 period.” The growth of support for this connection has come from recent studies of local

labor demand shocks. As mentioned earlier, Autor, Dorn and Hanson (2013) found that

commuting zones with rising exposure to manufactured imports from China saw substantive

declines in manufacturing employment and wages. Similarly, Charles, Hurst and Schwartz

(2018) estimated that a 10 percent decline in manufacturing employment since 2000 led to an 18

percent decline in wages, a 7.9 percent decline in hours worked and a 4.6 percentage point

decline in employment of less-educated men. These estimates imply an uncompensated labor

supply elasticity of above 0.4.

       It is important reconcile such estimates with the conventional wisdom of a small, or zero,

uncompensated elasticity of labor supply. One possible reconciliation recognizes that the labor

demand shocks in our period of study not only involve wage cuts, but also job losses, including

mass layoffs or the closing of establishments. Displaced male workers take some time to return

to the workforce (Jacobson, LaLonde and Sullivan 1993; Autor et al. 2014), in part because

current local job losses are often associated with subsequent local job losses. For example, Dix-

Carneiro and Kovak (2017) found that initial shocks (albeit in Brazil, not the United States)

played out over an extended period partly because of the slow adjustment of capital to the initial

shocks. In general, several researchers have documented the slowness of local economies to

recover from economic shocks (Bartik 1991; Yagan 2017; Austin, Glaeser and Summers

forthcoming).

       After losing work, individuals may not easily transition into new jobs. For instance,

Foote and Ryan (2015) showed that medium-skill displaced male workers tend to face few



                                                                                                19
attractive alternatives within their skill class and sector. Jaimovich and Siu (2015) captured this

phenomenon in the context of a search model, in which those losing their jobs in declining

sectors of the economy must consider whether to search for new work in the declining sector or

invest in new skills. Such a framework can capture business cycle patterns but also secular shifts

of the Beveridge curve. A parallel literature has illustrated a reluctance of workers to migrate to

better labor markets (Kennan and Walker 2011; Dao, Furceri and Loungani 2017; Zabek 2018),

underscoring the potential importance of migration as well as search frictions.

       These dimensions of individual and local labor market adjustment following shocks

strike us as key factors underlying the strong secular relationship between wages and

participation seen in the 1970s, 1980s, and since 2002. Such adjustment frictions are also

consistent with the fact that many spells of non-participation are not permanent (recall Table

1)—though it may take some time, most displaced individuals do return to the workforce. A

labor supply framework which takes these factors seriously may help resolve the apparent

inconsistency between the male labor supply behavior revealed by the historical record and that

of the more recent period.

The Expansion of Disability Insurance

       A parallel explanation for the large increase in less-educated male joblessness, despite a

comparatively small decrease in their wages, rests on factors operating outside of the labor

market. An oft-examined factor is the dramatic increase in the availability and generosity of

income maintenance programs targeted at people with disabilities. The largest such program is

the Social Security Disability Insurance program (DI), of which we provide a brief history in the

appendix. The DI rolls expanded considerably between the 1960s and early 1990s and have

grown more slowly since. (For discussion in this journal, see Liebman 2015. Appendix Figure



                                                                                                  20
A4 graphs trends in the population share of men receiving DI benefits by age group.)

       To assess the extent to which DI expansions have impacted the male labor-force

participation rate, Bound (1989) proposed the “rejected-applicant” method, which involves

comparing participation behavior of those receiving DI benefits to those who applied for benefits

but failed to pass the medical screening necessary to be granted benefits. In a sophisticated

application of this method, Maestas, Mullen and Strand (2013) used random variation in

stringency across DI case examiners to estimate that prime-age men on the margin of DI receipt

have a labor-force participation rate of 40 percentage points higher than marginal beneficiaries.

       Two issues arise when using this estimate to draw broader inferences about how the

Social Security Disability Insurance program has impacted prime-age male labor-force

participation. First, if the marginal beneficiary is healthier than the average beneficiary, then the

marginal beneficiary’s work propensity may be more sensitive to benefit receipt than that of the

average beneficiary. Second, estimates based on the rejected-applicant method are conditional

on having applied for benefits. Since non-participation is necessary for eligibility, application

for DI benefits itself may reduce participation. It may also affect rejected applicants’ subsequent

participation behavior (Bound, 1989; Parsons, 1991; Bound 1991): rejected applicants may

reapply, time spent out of work may affect rejected applicants’ job prospects, and the act of

applying may permanently affect individuals’ identities.

       Bound, Lindner and Waidmann (2014) attempted to circumvent these issues by arguing

that the participation rate of individuals who report having a health-related work limitation but

who never applied for DI benefits should be a conservative upper bound on the participation rate

of both rejected and accepted applicants. Using SIPP-SSA data, they reported an employment

rate differential between prime-age men with work limitations who never applied for DI benefits



                                                                                                    21
and those who were awarded benefits of roughly 50 percentage points. The reported

employment differential between rejected applicants and those awarded benefits was roughly 30

percentage points.

        Pulling these considerations together, let us conservatively assume that the participation

disincentive induced by applying for benefits outweighs the fact that the marginal beneficiary

may be healthier than the average beneficiary. Under this assumption, Maestas et al.’s (2013)

estimate of 0.40 times the DI participation rate lower-bounds the effect of the availability of DI

benefits on the labor-force non-participation rate. On the other hand, under the assumption that

the rejected applicant pool is the same size as the beneficiary pool (a slight exaggeration relative

to what Bound, Lindner and Waidmann 2014 report), Bound, Lindner and Waidmann’s (2014)

logic yields an upper bound of 0.50 + 0.30 = 0.80 times the DI participation rate.

        Table 3 uses March Current Population Survey data to compare prime-age male DI and

labor-force participation rates, by age and education, between 1975-84 and 2008-2017.9

(Decadal averages are used to reduce sampling error.) The last row of the table implements the

bounding exercise just described, reporting a conservative upper bound estimate of the

contribution of increased DI program participation to the concomitant rise in non-participation.

Increased DI participation explains virtually none of the rise in non-participation among high

school dropouts and little of the rise in non-participation among high school graduates below age

45. On the other hand, it could explain up to 25 percent of the rise in non-participation among

45-54-year-old high school graduates. In tabulations not shown, we found similar results for the

“some college” group.



9
  Published data on the number of individuals receiving DI benefits do not report breakdowns by education.
However, March CPS survey responses about income receipt seem to closely track published administrative
statistics on DI receipt.

                                                                                                             22
       In addition to the roughness of this bounding exercise, we note that the growth in DI

participation may be endogenous to falling labor demand. Previous work has demonstrated that

adverse local labor demand shocks expand the DI rolls (Black, Daniel and Sanders 2002; Autor

and Duggan 2003; Charles, Li and Stephens 2017). Rising DI participation may thus underlie

some of the adjustment behavior noted above: rather than search for new work, displaced

workers in relatively poor health may simply apply for DI.

Mass Incarceration

       The size of the U.S. prison population rose dramatically between 1970 and 2000, from

roughly 0.1 percent to 0.5 percent of the total resident population (Raphael and Stoll, 2013). We

have been studying the civilian, non-institutionalized male population in this paper—those

incarcerated are excluded. However, as incarceration rates have grown, so has the previously-

incarcerated share of the currently-non-institutionalized population. Bucknor and Barber (2016)

estimated that in 2014, between 6.0 and 7.7 percent of all prime-age men had previously been

incarcerated. For black men, the rates were between 19.4 and 21.9 percent; for high school

dropout men, the rates were between 26.6 and 30.1 percent. Bucknor and Barber (2016) do not

report cross-tabulations by education and race, but their figures suggest that potentially a

substantial fraction of black male dropouts have prior prison records.

        Survey data show that men with criminal records are less likely to be employed than

observationally similar individuals without records. Employers report a reluctance to hire men

with criminal convictions, while audit studies have found that those with criminal records are

less likely to be called back for interviews (Holzer, Raphael and Stoll 2006a, 2006b; Pager 2003,

2007; Pager, Western and Bonikowski 2009). The most credible estimates of the effect of prior

incarceration on employment leverage random assignment of defendants to courtrooms, judges



                                                                                                 23
and prosecutors. Taking this design to data from Harris Country, Texas, Mueller-Smith (2015)

found that each additional year behind bars reduced post-release employment propensity by 3.6

percentage points. For felony defendants with stable pre-charge earnings, incarceration for one

or more years reduced employment propensity by much larger amounts. Moreover, Mueller-

Smith found prior incarceration to increase subsequent criminal activity. Harding et al. (2018)

recently found comparable results using data from Michigan.

        These estimates strongly support the notion that incarcerating men is likely to have

significant effects on their future labor market outcomes (see also Raphael 2014). That said,

there is no straightforward way to make inferences from such estimates about the impact of mass

incarceration on non-institutionalized male labor-force participation. First, the estimates vary

considerably across different sub-populations. Second, the statistical design delivers causal

effects for the marginal, not the average, man incarcerated. Third, the estimates do not capture

spillover effects of mass incarceration on local labor markets and communities.10 Thus, while

we do not feel comfortable using available information to even crudely estimate the effect of

mass incarceration on the decline in male labor-force participation since the early 1990s, it seems

likely that such effects exist and could be of sizable magnitude, especially among populations

who have experienced particularly large exposure to prison (high school dropouts and blacks

without any college education). We flag this as an important area for further research.



Feedback from the Marriage Market to Male Labor Supply


10
  On spillover effects, two points are in order. First, recent research has found evidence of employer statistical
discrimination on expected prior criminal history (Doleac and Hansen 2016; Agan and Starr, 2018). These findings
suggest that, due to low-skill employers’ hiring responses, rising incarceration may impact the labor market
prospects of those who were not previously incarcerated but have similar observable characteristics to those who
were. Second, men with outstanding warrants may be reticent to seek formal employment, as described in the
ethnographic work of Goffman (2014) and supported in statistical analysis by Brayne (2014).

                                                                                                                24
        The above discussions frame a puzzle. On its own, falling labor demand does not

sufficiently explain the secular decline in less-educated male labor-force participation—at least,

not without allowing for substantial adjustment frictions in the long run as well as the short run.

Rising access to disability insurance is at most a partial explanation for the 45-54-year-old group

and matters quite little for younger men and for high school dropouts. Rising exposure to prison

may be a significant factor for dropouts and for blacks without college education, but labor-force

participation for these groups began declining decades before prison populations skyrocketed.

Certainly no single explanation can sufficiently explain the decline; and even in combination, the

explanations appear insufficient.

        We suspect that there is another factor at play. We claim that the prospect of forming and

providing for a new family constitutes an important male labor supply incentive; and thus, that

developments within the marriage market can influence male labor-force participation. A

decline in the formation of stable families produces a situation in which fewer men are actively

involved in family provision or can expect to be involved in the future. This removes a labor

supply incentive; and the possibility of drawing support from one’s existing family, as shown

earlier in Table 2, creates a feasible labor-force exit.

The Retreat from Marriage and Onset of Parental Cohabitation

        American family structure has undergone dramatic change since the 1960s, featuring a

reduction in the incidence of stable two-parent households that has been concentrated in the non-

college-educated population (Cherlin 2014; in this journal, Lundberg, Pollak and Stearns 2016).

We summarize these changes in Table 4. Across all demographic groups without college

education, the share of men currently married fell dramatically between 1970 and 2015.

Currently-marrieds now make up a distinct minority of the black population without college



                                                                                                  25
degree. As of 2015, only white high school graduates above age 35 were married a majority of

the time, but even these groups experienced a 30-percentage-point drop in currently-married

rates since 1970.11 Similar changes have occurred for the some-college population.

        Over the same period, the share of men living with at least one parent has risen in equally

dramatic fashion. While parental co-residence was a rare event in 1970, by 2015, over one-

quarter of whites and 40 percent of blacks aged 25-34 lived with a parent. Older groups

experienced a smaller but still substantial rise in parental co-residence, especially considering the

extremely low base rates. For example, white high school graduates aged 35-44 experienced a

greater-than-threefold increase in the rate of parental co-residence, from 4 percent in 1970 to 13

percent in 2015. In tabulations not shown, we documented similar increases (though starting

from higher base rates) in the shares of men cohabiting with parents or other adult relatives.

        In this journal, Stevenson and Wolfers (2007) emphasized the contribution of a variety of

important developments to the secular decline in marriage, including greater access to

contraception, liberalization of family law, changes in home production technology which have

reduced gains from task specialization within the household, and changes to how prospective

partners match (for example, the rise of online dating). Falling stigmatism of out-of-wedlock

childbearing and single motherhood are also likely relevant (Akerlof, Yellen and Katz 1996).

        Others have argued that male earning potential is central to stable marriage formation.

Becker (1981) popularized the “specialization-and-exchange” theory of marriage, which predicts

that gains from marriage are an increasing function of the gender wage gap. Other work has


11
   Some of the measured decline in marriage has been offset by a rise in cohabitation with an unmarried partner.
However, for the less-educated, cohabitation is often a transient and unstable situation. Copen, Daniels and Mosher
(2013) report a median duration of cohabitations for less-educated individuals of 22-24 months, based on 2006-2010
data from the National Survey of Family Growth. Ishizuka (2018) reports similar findings in SIPP data, and also
finds that cohabitations are less likely to transition into marriages for less-educated individuals. Since our
underlying concept of interest is stable family formation, the focus on marriage seems warranted for this population
of men.

                                                                                                                 26
suggested the influence of “male breadwinner norms:” even after accounting for specialization

incentives, the marriage rate appears to decline when a local labor market shock makes men less

likely to out-earn women (Bertrand, Kamenica and Pan 2015). A different paradigm contends

that marriage occurs when the level of resources exceeds a standard associated with successful

family pursuits (Easterlin 1966, 1987). Ruggles (2015) argued for the importance of declining

less-educated male earnings prospects relative to those of their fathers. A variant marriage

threshold is the typical living standard within a peer reference group (Gibson-Davis, Edin and

McLanahan 2005; Watson and McLanahan 2011; Ishizuka 2018). In this view, rising income

inequality harms the marriage prospects of below-median individuals.

Marriage as a Social Institution for Male Employment

       Previous work has associated marriage with a decline in irresponsible male behavior

(Akerlof, 1998), such as crime (Edlund et al., 2013) and excessive drug and alcohol use (Duncan,

Wilkerson and England, 2006). In the words of Lundberg, Pollak and Stearns (in this journal,

2016): “If social and economic changes have reduced the value of marriage to noncollege

graduates, these changes may also be responsible for a further causal…effect on men’s

behavior.”

       Male participation in the labor force may also be a socially responsible activity that, like

the avoidance of pathological behaviors, is intertwined with stable marriage. To the extent that

the gains from marriage depend on male earnings, married men face an additional incentive to

find and maintain a job. Indeed, the securing of gainful employment may even be stipulated by

men’s (explicit or implicit) marital contracts with their wives. This mechanism has dynamic

implications: with the expectation that they will one day marry and provide for a family, single

men are incentivized to invest in their future productivity by working today. Doing so also



                                                                                                   27
improves their positions in the marriage market, raising their probabilities of matching with high-

quality spouses. As marriage rates, and attendant marital expectations decrease, so do these

labor supply incentives.

       We offer an informal assessment of this marriage market mechanism of labor supply in

Table 5. We divide the population of interest into three mutually exclusive statuses: men living

with at least one parent, unmarried men not living with a parent, and married men not living with

a parent. We compute the decline in observed labor-force participation attributable to changes in

population shares between these statuses versus changes in labor-force participation rates within

each status during the period from 1970-2015. Our proposed mechanism emphasizes the

contribution of shifts between statuses (as married men work more than unmarried men and

marriage rates have declined); and declining labor-force participation within unmarried statuses

(as expectations of stable family formation have declined among those currently unmarried).

The latter process should be especially relevant for younger groups, where future marital

expectations have plausibly changed the most.

       As reported in the last column of Table 5, the decline in labor-force participation among

those currently married accounts for a minority of the total observed decline in all demographic

groups. This is especially true among blacks: the within-married component accounts for less

than one-third of the total decline across all black sub-groups. We also observe the predicted age

gradient: for groups of men aged 25-34, the within-married component accounts for only about

one-quarter of the total change. Moreover, the 25-34 age groups have experienced almost as

large a decline in labor-force participation as the older groups.

       This mechanism offers an interpretation of the puzzle of the recent and disproportionate

decline in labor-force participation among young males, identified by Aguiar et al. (2017). In



                                                                                                   28
Appendix Table A4 we repeated the above decomposition for the population of men with 0-10

years of potential experience and not enrolled in school, considering changes from 1997-2015.

For this group, observed declines in labor-force participation are largely explained by the

between-status component and the within-living-with-parents component. Today’s less-educated

labor market entrants face increasingly small probabilities of forming their own stable families.

Thus, while Aguiar et al. (2017) attribute their disproportionate withdrawal from the labor force

to the rising value of leisure (stemming from innovations in video gaming technology), we

suggest that a marriage-market-based fall in the value of work could be an alternative

explanation.

Implications for the Relationship between Labor Demand and Labor Supply

       The marriage market mechanism we propose adds complexity to the relationship between

male labor demand and labor supply. To the extent that male earning potential positively

influences marriage, a decline in male labor demand results in fewer males forming and heading

their own stable families. Thus, a male labor demand shock produces—through the marriage

market—an indirect effect on male labor supply incentives and resultant labor-force

participation.

       The recent findings of Autor, Dorn and Hanson (2018) indicate that this indirect channel

may be important. These authors found that rising local exposure to import competition from

China led to local declines in the marriage rate and in the share of children living with their

fathers. Thus, the large employment effects of local labor demand shocks may embed family-

related effects in addition to the other adjustment frictions we have discussed. Family processes

may also interact with these other adjustment frictions, for example by making men more

dependent on their adult relatives and less amenable to finding a new occupation or labor market



                                                                                                  29
in which to seek employment. In addition, others have argued that mass incarceration has

disrupted family formation (for example, Charles and Luoh 2010; Schneider, Harknett and

Stimpson 2018). These relationships further complicate the separate quantification of the

various forces driving the decline in male labor-force participation.




Conclusion

       During the last 50 years, the earnings of prime-age men in the United States have

stagnated and dispersed across the education distribution. At the same time, the labor-force

participation rates of men without a college education have steadily declined. While wage and

participation trends are often linked for this population, we have argued that this connection

cannot solely be the result of an inward labor demand shift across a stable and elastic labor

supply curve. The uncompensated labor supply elasticities implied by the twin declines of

wages and participation during the 1970s, 1980s and 2000s appear too large to be plausible.

Moreover, labor-force participation continued to decrease in the 1990s while wages were rising.

While the increasing availability of disability benefits and the increase in the fraction of the

population with prior incarceration exposure may help explain some of the participation decline,

we doubt either factor can explain the bulk of the decline.

       We have argued that more plausible explanations for the observed patterns involve

feedbacks from male labor demand shocks, which often involve substantial job displacement, to

worker adjustment frictions and to family structure. Marriage rates, and corresponding male

labor supply incentives, have also fallen for reasons other than changing labor demand. We have

moreover noted interactions between labor demand and disability benefit take-up, and between

mass incarceration and family structure. These factors have all converged to reduce the


                                                                                                   30
feasibility and desirability of stable employment, leading affected men, who may not often be

eligible for disability or other benefits, to participate sporadically in the labor market and depend

primarily on family members for income support. In sum, our observations lead us to be

skeptical of attempts to attribute the secular decline in male labor-force participation to a series

of separately-acting causal factors. We prefer an interpretation in which falling labor demand

combined with other interconnected factors have led to substantially lower participation rates

among men with less than a college education.

Real Hourly Earnings by Education Status, Men Aged 25-54, 1965-2016
(2017 dollars)




Source: Authors’ calculations based on the March Supplement to the Current Population Survey. Annual wage and
salary income is adjusted for top-coding and converted to 2017 dollars using the Personal Consumption
Expenditures deflator. Hourly earnings are computed by dividing annual earnings by total hours worked (the
product of weeks worked and usual hours worked per week). Before the 1976 survey, weeks worked and usual
hours worked per week are imputed using demographic information in conjunction with information on bracketed
weeks worked and hours worked last week. Within each education status, a re-weighting procedure is employed to
hold the age distribution constant across each year. See the online Appendix for further details. Geometric average
hourly wages are computed as the exponential of the average of log hourly wages. Graph presents 3-year centered
moving averages.

Source: Authors’ calculations based on 1984-2008 SIPP panels (top panel) and SIPP panels linked to SSA earnings
records (bottom panel). Sample consists of men with 0-30 years of potential experience and not enrolled in school
at the beginning of the SIPP panel window. The top panel reports the share of men who transitioned out of non-
participation by the given month—1, 3, 6, or 12 months after the initial experience of non-participation. 2 groups of
men are considered: those who experienced a transition to non-participation within the first 12 panel months, and
those who were non-participants at the start of the panel window. The bottom panel considers the SSA earnings
records of all SIPP panel respondents, over the subset of years 1978-2011 when the respondents had between 0 and
30 years of potential experience. It reports the share of men who transitioned out of non-participation by the given
year—1, 2, 5, or 10 years after the initial experience of non-participation. Yearly participation is defined as having
total administrative earnings for the year above a minimum threshold. 2 groups of men are considered: those who
experienced a transition to non-participation within the first 15 years of observation, and those who were non-
participants in the first year of observation. See main text and online Appendix for further details.

Source: Authors’ calculations based on the March Supplement to the Current Population Survey. Sample consists of
all households in which at least one prime-age man with “low labor-force attachment” resided, defined as a man
who worked no more than 13 weeks in the reference year. Households with imputed sources of income are
excluded. Disability-related benefits are not fully identifiable until 1988; food stamps benefits are not identifiable
until 1992; as a result, we consider the years 1992-2017. The top sub-panels record average levels of the man’s
household’s yearly income in 2017 dollars, rounded to the nearest hundred and broken down by income source. The
bottom sub-panels record the frequency with which each source of earnings accounts for the largest share of total
household income. Extremely poor households which subsist on less than $4 per day (with a square-root
equivalence scale to adjust for household size), are classified as having no maximal source of income. See main text
and Appendix for further detail.
