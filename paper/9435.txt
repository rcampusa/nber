                                            ABSTRACT

       This paper develops a new instrumental-variable (IV) approach to estimate the effects of
different exchange rate regimes on bilateral outcomes. The basic idea is that the characteristics of
the exchange rate regime between two countries (exchange rate variability, fixed or float,
autonomous or common currencies) are partially related to the independent decisions of these
countries to peg —explicitly or de facto— to a third currency, notably that of a main anchor. Our
approach is to use this component of the exchange rate regime as an IV in regressions of bilateral
outcomes. We illustrate the methodology with one specific application: the economic e.ects of
currency unions. The likelihood that two countries independently adopt the currency of the same
anchor country is used as an instrument for whether they share or not a common currency. Three
findings stand out. First, sharing a common currency enhances trade supporting previous work by
Rose [2000]. Second, a common currency increases price co-movements; this finding is consistent
with the observation that a large part of the variation in real exchange rates is caused by fluctuations
in nominal exchange rates. Finally, a common currency decreases the co-movement of shocks to real
GDP. This is consistent with the view that currency unions lead to greater specialization.

I       Introduction

A vast empirical literature in international finance investigates the eﬀects of exchange rate

regimes on diﬀerent economic outcomes. For example, several studies have analyzed the

eﬀect of exchange rate variability on bilateral trade, foreign direct investment and relative

prices. Other studies have focused on the diﬀerential eﬀects of pegged-versus-fixed exchange

rates (including stricter forms of fixed-exchange rate regimes, such us currency boards or

currency unions). The underlying assumption in most studies is that exchange rate regimes

are randomly assigned and, hence, exogenous to the outcome variable under study. Standard

endogeneity problems, however, can hide the true eﬀect of exchange rate regimes in simple

OLS estimates. For example, the choice of exchange rate regimes might reflect omitted

characteristics that can also influence the economic outcome. Similarly, the adoption of a

certain regime might come with other (unmeasured) policies that also aﬀect the outcome.

    The first contribution of this paper is to develop an instrumental-variable (IV) approach

to address the endogeneity problem present in the estimation of the eﬀects of exchange

rate regimes on economic variables, such as bilateral capital flows, trade volumes, and co-

movement of business cycles. As an illustration, consider two countries that exhibit a low

extent of exchange rate variability between them. There are several reasons for this low

variability. Some reasons might be related to the deliberate decision of facilitating trade

between the two countries, leading to a bias in OLS estimates of the eﬀect of exchange rate

variability on the volume of bilateral trade.1 Another reason, however, might be related to
    1
     Typically, two countries that want to foster trade between themselves will also be more likely to under-
take other steps, such as reduction of bilateral tariﬀ and non-tariﬀ barriers. To the extent that these steps
cannot be measured in the data, an OLS estimation will attribute all the credit to the low variability.




                                                     2
the independent decisions of these two countries to keep a close parity with a third country’s

currency. In this case, the level of exchange rate variability between the two countries will

be exogenous to their bilateral trade. The methodology proposed in this study exploits

this triangular relationship with third countries to identify the economic eﬀect of diﬀerent

exchange rate regimes or features of exchange rates regimes (e.g. variability) on bilateral

outcomes. In particular, following this example, the methodology isolates the motive for low

(or high) variability that relates to the objective of pegging to a third currency and uses this

motivation as an IV for the extent of variability.

   While the methodology developed in this paper can be applied to the analysis of diﬀerent

exchange rate arrangements, we illustrate it here with one specific application: the eﬀect of

currency unions on bilateral trade and on the extent of co-movement of output shocks and

price shocks.

   Assessing the economic eﬀects of currency unions is imperative, given the recent devel-

opments in international monetary arrangements. Twelve Western European countries have

recently instituted the euro as their common currency. Sweden, Denmark and Britain have

opted out, but they might join in the near future. Several Eastern European countries are

debating the unilateral adoption of the euro as legal tender. Ecuador fully dollarized its

economy; El Salvador and Guatemala legalized the use of the U.S. dollar, and other govern-

ments in South and Central America are giving serious consideration to dollarization. Six

West African states have agreed to create a new common currency by the year 2003, and

eleven members of the Southern African Development Community are debating whether to

adopt the U.S. dollar or to create an independent monetary union possibly anchored to the



                                               3
South African rand.2 Finally, six oil-producing countries have expressed their intention to

form a currency union by 2010.3

    A number of recent papers estimate the eﬀect of currency unions on bilateral trade.

Most notably, Rose [2000] and Frankel and Rose [2002] report that bilateral trade between

two countries that use the same currency is, controlling for other eﬀects, over two-hundred-

percent larger than bilateral trade between countries that use diﬀerent currencies. The

underlying assumption in these studies is that currency unions are randomly assigned. As

suggested before, unmeasured characteristics might create spurious links between currency-

union status and bilateral trade. For example, compatibility in legal systems, greater cultural

links, better infrastructure for bilateral transportation and tied bilateral transfers may in-

crease the propensity to share a common currency as well as encourage trade between two

countries. Similarly, countries willing to share a common currency may also take additional

(unmeasured) policies to foster integration and facilitate trade. These omitted character-

istics could lead to a positive bias in simple OLS estimates. Other omitted variables may

cause a downward bias in OLS estimates. As an example, higher levels of monopoly distor-

tion in a country’s economy mean higher markups, which tend to deter trade. At the same

time, high levels of monopoly distortion may lead to higher inflation rates under discretion

and therefore increase the need to join a currency union as a commitment device to reduce

inflation.4 In this paper we revisit previous estimates of the currency-union eﬀect on trade

      The group of West African countries includes Ghana, Nigeria, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Gambia, and
Guinea. Initial participants in the Southern African currency union will be South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho,
Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe. Zambia is expected also
to confirm its membership. Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Seychelles, also members of the
Southern African Development Community, will not join the monetary union.

using the new instrument to address the endogeneity problem.

   Trade is not the only interesting outcome of currency unions. Monetary unions might

also alter the extent of synchronization of shocks and the patterns of co-movement among

participants. This consideration is relevant for determining the suitability of the adoption of

a foreign currency or participation into currency unions: countries evaluating the decision to

join or not should take into account the eﬀect that diﬀerent currency arrangements have on

the patterns of co-movement. By adopting a foreign currency or forming a currency union,

countries lose the independence to tailor monetary policy to local needs. If currency unions

lead to higher synchronization of shocks, this change will generate greater consensus over the

direction of monetary policy and reduce the cost of giving up monetary-policy independence.

The opposite will be true if currency unions induce less synchronization. Hence, this paper

also investigates the eﬀects of currency unions on the patterns of co-movement of prices and

real GDP shocks.

   In order to construct the IV, we first estimate the probability that a given country adopts

the currency of a main anchor country. The estimation of the relationship “client-anchor,”

in the terminology used by Alesina and Barro [2002], is interesting in its own right, as it

elucidates part of the reason why countries adopt a foreign currency or join currency unions.

The IV is then obtained by computing the joint probability that two countries, independently,

adopt the same currency. The underlying assumption in the analysis is that there exist factors

driving the decision to adopt a third country’s currency that are independent of the bilateral

links between two potential clients. In other words, the basic idea is to isolate the motive

that relates to third countries’ currencies and use this motivation as an IV for whether two



                                              5
countries do or do not share a common currency.

   The main results of this study are the following. First, regarding the motivation to adopt

a foreign anchor’s currency, the probability of adoption increases when i) the client speaks

the same language as the anchor, ii) the client is geographically closer to the anchor, iii) the

client was a former or current colony of the anchor, iv) the client is poorer in terms of GDP

per capita, v) the client is smaller in terms of population size, and vi) the anchor is richer

in terms of per capita GDP.

   Second, the IV estimates of the impact of currency unions on bilateral trade indicate a

significant positive eﬀect, supporting previous findings by Rose [2000] and co-authors. In

other words, endogeneity bias is not responsible for the large eﬀects previously documented.

   Third, while OLS estimates indicate that currency unions do not aﬀect the extent of co-

movement of output shocks, the IV estimates suggest that currency unions may decrease the

co-movement of output shocks. This finding is consistent with the view that currency unions

enhance sectoral specialization, and shocks tend to aﬀect sectors asymmetrically. The bias

in OLS is the result of reverse causality: countries with higher co-movement are more likely

to form currency unions. Finally, the co-movement of price shocks increases with currency

unions, which supports the observation that a large part of the fluctuations in real exchange

rates is due to fluctuations in nominal exchange rates.

   The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the endogeneity problem in previous

empirical analyses of currency unions. It then discusses how the IV approach can be applied

to study the economic eﬀects of diﬀerent exchange rate arrangements. Section 3 studies the

motivation to link the currency to a main anchor. Section 4 revisits the currency union eﬀect



                                               6
on trade. Section 5 estimates the eﬀects of currency unions on the extent of co-movement of

prices and outputs. Section 6 summarizes and concludes.




II          Endogeneity bias and a new IV approach

A         Endogeneity

The empirical work on the eﬀects of currency unions (or indeed, other exchange rate arrange-

ments) on trade has been framed within the standard “gravity equation” model. The model

states that bilateral trade between a pair of countries increases with the sizes of the coun-

tries and decreases with their distance, broadly construed to include all factors that create

“trade resistance.” The gravity equation is then augmented with a dummy variable indicat-

ing whether or not the countries share the same currency. In his seminal paper in the area,

Rose [2000] reports that bilateral trade between countries that use the same currency is over

two-hundred percent larger than bilateral trade between countries with diﬀerent currencies.

Subsequent papers, including Frankel and Rose [2002], Rose and van Wincoop [2001], and

Glick and Rose [2002], have expanded the analysis and generally confirmed the large enhance-

ment eﬀect of currency unions on trade. Alesina, Barro, and Tenreyro [2002] summarize and

discuss these findings.

     The implicit assumption in the various empirical studies is that currency unions (or, more

generally, exchange rate arrangements) are randomly formed among countries.5 Standard

endogeneity problems, however, can confound the estimates. For example, countries that

would naturally trade more might share characteristics that tend to make them more prone
     5
         For an exception, see Persson [2001].


                                                 7
to form a currency union. In addition, countries that decide to join a currency union might

also be more likely to foster integration through other means, for example, by encouraging

the harmonization of standards to enhance competition and trade and by reducing regulatory

barriers. These unmeasured characteristics—to the extent that they aﬀect or are correlated

with the propensity to share a common currency and the volume of bilateral trade—will bias

OLS estimates of the currency union eﬀect. The use of country-pair fixed eﬀects employed

in some studies may not eliminate the bias, because a shift at some point in time in trade

volumes may be related to a change in the propensity to use a common currency.



B       A new approach

Two countries may be motivated to share a common currency for several reasons. In order

to eliminate the endogeneity bias discussed in the previous section, one needs to isolate the

part of the motivation that is exogenous to the bilateral link between the two countries.

As an example, consider two countries that use a common currency, say Senegal and Togo,

both of which belong to the CFA franc zone. Part of the reason why they share a common

currency is that both countries want to keep the French franc (now the euro) as a nominal

anchor.6 However, other considerations not related to France but to the objective of pro-

moting political and economic integration between Senegal and Togo may have influenced

the decision to share a common currency. These other considerations are likely to bias OLS

estimates of the eﬀects of currency unions on trade. Hence, separating out the relation with

the anchor provides an instrument to estimate the eﬀect of sharing a common currency on
    6
     The CFA franc has been tied, except for one devaluation, to the French franc, and the French Treasury
has guaranteed the convertibility of CFA francs into French francs.

bilateral trade.

   Alesina and Barro [2002] provide a formal model for the anchor-client relationship in the

context of the currency-union decision. The model shows that countries with lack of internal

discipline for monetary policy (as revealed by a history of high and variable inflation) stand

to gain more from giving up their currencies, provided that the anchor country is able to

commit to sound monetary policy. This commitment is best protected when the anchor

is large and the client small (otherwise, the anchor may find it advantageous to relinquish

its commitment. In addition, the model shows that, under reasonable assumptions, client

countries benefit more from adopting the currency of an anchor with which they would

naturally trade more, that is, an anchor with which trading costs —other than the ones

associated with the use of diﬀerent currencies— are small. The model also predicts that small

countries benefit more from giving up their currency, and the benefit increases with the size

of the anchor. These features of the relation between clients and anchors are used to guide

the instrumentation.

   In order to construct the instrument, we use a probit analysis for all country pairings from

1960 to 1997 with six potential anchors that fit the theoretical characterization of Alesina

and Barro [2002], given the countries’ sizes (GDPs) and records of low and stable inflation.

The group of anchors includes Australia, France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom,

and the United States. The probit regressions include various measures of distance between

clients and anchors (to proxy for trading costs) and the sizes of potential clients and anchors.

   Consider a potential client country, denoted by i, which is evaluating the possibility of

adopting the currency of one of the six anchors, denoted by k (k = 1, 2, ..., 6). The probit



                                               9
regression determines the estimated probability p(i, k, t) that client i adopts the currency

of anchor k at time t. If the clients adopt an anchor currency independently, then the joint

probability that countries i and j use the currency of a common anchor k at time t is given

by:

                                                 J k (i, j, t) = p(i, k, t) ∗ p(j, k, t).


The probability J k (i, j, t) will be high if both countries are “close enough” to the potential

anchor k. The joint probability that, at time t, countries i and j use the same foreign

currency (among the six candidates considered in this analysis)7 is given by the sum of the

joint probabilities over the support of potential anchors:8


                                                    X
                                                    6                        X
                                                                             6
                                                            k
                               J(i, j, t) =               J (i, j, t) =            p(i, k, t) ∗ p(j, k, t).
                                                    k=1                      k=1



The variable J(i, j, t) can be used as an instrument for the currency-union dummy in the

regressions for bilateral trade and co-movements. The underlying assumption for the validity

of the instrument is that the bilateral trade between countries i and j depends on gravity

variables for countries i and j, but not on gravity variables involving third countries, notably

the potential anchors. Gravity variables involving third countries aﬀect the likelihood that

the clients i and j share a common currency and thereby influence bilateral trade and co-
    7
      This approach neglects the possibility that country i chooses the infeasible outcome of linking simul-
taneously with more than one of the anchors k. We could modify the analysis to rule out these outcomes.
However, the results would not be aﬀected, because the probability of choosing two anchors simultaneously
is negligible, given that each individual probability is itself small.
    8
      For a pair of anchors, say, k1 and k2 , the probability is
                                         6
                                         X                                               6
                                                                                         X                         6
                                                                                                                   X
J(k1 , k2 , t) = p(k1 , k2 , t) ∗ [1 −         p(k1 , ks , t)] + p(k1 , k2 , t) ∗ [1 −         p(k2 , ks , t)] +         [p(k1 , ks , t) ∗ p(k2 , ks , t)]
                                         s=3                                             s=3                       s=3




                                                                        10
movements between i and j through that channel. The assumption requires that these

variables not influence the bilateral trade or the extent of co-movement between i and j

through other channels.

    As mentioned in the introduction, the endogeneity problem is pervasive in the literature

studying the economic eﬀects of exchange rate arrangements. Although this study focuses

on the economic eﬀects of currency unions, the methodology can also be applied to the study

of diﬀerent exchange rate arrangements. For example, consider the problem of estimating

the eﬀect of nominal-exchange rate variability on bilateral trade (or any other bilateral

outcome for which exchange rates cannot be considered exogenous). One could, in principle,

isolate the part of the exchange-rate variability that relates to the independent decision to

peg (explicitly or de facto) to a low-inflation currency to overcome the lack of discipline in

monetary policy.9 In this context, one could instrument the extent of variability between

two countries using the likelihood that two countries independently target the exchange rate

of a common nominal anchor.




III      Determinants of currency unions: The anchor-client

         relationship

The results of the probit regressions are in Table 2. The sample consists of all country pairs

that include the six candidate anchors: Australia, France, Germany, Japan, U.K., and U.S.

The data come from Glick and Rose [2002], except for real GDP per capita and population,
   9
      The form of the peg—and, hence, the dividing line for whether a country is a fixer or a floater—can vary.
Crawling pegs, fixed exchange rates with bands of diﬀerent widths, currency boards, and currency unions
are illustrations of the range of options.


                                                      11
which come from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators. The equations are for

annual data, include year eﬀects, and allow for clustering over time for country pairs. The

dependent variable is based on countries sharing a common currency.10 The independent

variables, as mentioned before, are motivated by the model of currency-union decision for-

mulated by Alesina and Barro [2002]. We include various measures of distance that are

typically included in the gravity equation literature, and diﬀerent measures of size for both

the anchor and the client. Summary statistics for the data used in the probit equation are

presented in Table 1, Panel B.

    The first two columns in Table 2 show the estimated coeﬃcients and their corresponding

(clustered) standard errors. The third column shows the marginal eﬀects evaluated at the

mean values of all variables. Since in this sample only 3.4 percent of the pairs share a

common currency, evaluating the eﬀects at the mean is almost equivalent to evaluating at

the mean of the sub-sample of pairs that do not share a common currency. In other words,

the “mean” country in this sample is far from considering the adoption of a foreign currency.

Given that the marginal eﬀects are highly nonlinear, we also computed the marginal eﬀects

at the mean of the subsample of pairs sharing a common currency. The relevant eﬀects for

the marginal country, that is, the country that is indiﬀerent about adopting the currency of

a potential anchor, must lie somewhere in between.

    Table 2 shows that the probability that a country uses the currency of one of the main
  10
     We depart from the definition of currency unions in Glick and Rose [2002] by treating the CFA countries
as in a currency union with France. The main reason to do so is because France has guaranteed free
convertibility of the CFA franc into French francs (and now into euros), and the CFA franc has been tied
to the French franc, except for one devaluation in 1994. The French franc and currently the euro can and
do circulate in the CFA zone. Likewise, we treat the countries in the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union as
in a monetary union with the United Kingdom before 1976 and with the United States after that. In both
periods, they mantained a strict peg with the British pound and the American dollar, respectively.




                                                    12
anchors at a given point in time increases when i) the client speaks the same language as

the anchor, ii) the client is geographically closer to the anchor, iii) the client was a former

or current colony of the anchor, iv) the client is poorer in terms of GDP per capita, v) the

client is smaller in terms of population size, and vi) the anchor is richer — among the six

anchors considered— in terms of per capita GDP. Notice that the existence of regional trade

agreements tends to decrease the propensity to form currency unions.11 Other geographical

characteristics, such as access to land or being an island, do not seem relevant for adopting

a foreign currency, once the other control variables are included.




IV       Trade

Table 3 shows the regressions of bilateral trade on the currency-union dummy and the various

gravity characteristics. The regressions use annual data from 1960 to 1997 for all pairs of

countries for which data are available. The dependent variable is the logarithm of bilateral

trade.12 The variables included as controls are standard in the gravity equation literature;

they comprise various measures of distance and size.13 The systems include year eﬀects and

       One interpretation of the negative relation can be the following. Well-functioning economies are less
likely to use import tariﬀs and seignioriage as sources of fiscal revenue. Hence, these economies will be more
likely to sign free trade agreements. At the same time, a smaller need for seignioriage revenues reduces
the need for commitment (because the inflationary bias stemming from the incentives to monetize budget
deficit is smaller). A lower inflationary bias decreases the value of currency unions as commitment devices
to temper inflation. This may explain why, in the data, countries that do not need currency unions as
an external commitment are also more likely to sign regional trade agreements. Including the EMU might
change this historical pattern, as countries in the EMU have previously signed free-trade agreements and
most likely, the search for commitment was not the main motivation for the union.
    12
       The logarithmic specification leaves out observations for which trade is zero. While this omission should
not, in principle, bias the coeﬃcients in any particular direction, it suggests that the standard specification
used in the literature is not entirely appropriate. For comparability, we stick to the framework used in the
literature. The results, however, are similar if we include the zeroes and estimate the gravity equation using
ln(trade + c) as the dependent variable, for small values of c.

       Information on bilateral trade, distance, contiguity, access to water, language, colonial relationships,
regional trade agreements and currency unions comes, as before, from Glick and Rose [2002]. Data on real
per capita GDP and population come from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators. As already

allow the error terms to be correlated over time for a given country pair. Summary statistics

for the data are presented in Table 1, Panel A. The second and fourth columns include

country-fixed eﬀects, which control for remoteness and other country-specific factors that

inhibit trade, as in Rose and van Wincoop [2001].

    Most of the gravity variables have the expected signs: geographical proximity, common

border, access to land, common language, common colonial history, and size all increase

the volume of trade between two countries. When country-fixed eﬀects are included, how-

ever, free trade agreements and population do not significantly aﬀect trade, and the island

dummies have a negative, rather than positive, eﬀect on trade.

    In the OLS system, the estimated coeﬃcient on the currency-union dummy is 0.67 without

country-fixed eﬀects, and 0.96 with country-fixed eﬀects. These results are consistent with

Rose [2000], despite the diﬀerent definition of currency union used in this study.14 In the

instrumental-variable specification, the estimated eﬀect of currency unions on bilateral trade

becomes even larger: the coeﬃcient on the dummy variable is 0.95 without country-fixed

eﬀects and 1.9 with country-fixed eﬀects.15 Hence, the results indicate that endogeneity is not

the reason for the large eﬀects documented by Rose [2000] and co-authors. If anything, OLS

underestimates the impact on bilateral trade.16 Barro and Tenreyro [2000] oﬀer a possible

explanation for the negative bias. Economies with higher degrees of monopoly distortion and
explained, the currency union dummy is modified to reflect the link between the CFA franc to the French
franc and the link of the Eastern Caribbean dollar to the British pound before 1976 and the American dollar
thereafter.
    14
       The estimated eﬀect of the currency-union dummy is larger when using Rose’s stricter definition. The
estimated coeﬃcient on the currency-union dummy using Rose’s definition is 0.99, without fixed eﬀects and
1.14 with fixed eﬀects.
    15
       The corresponding values, using Rose’s definition of currency union, are 1.57 without country-fixed
eﬀects and 3.30 with country-fixed eﬀects.
    16
       The p-values from a Durbin-Wu-Hausman test, reported at the bottom of Table 4, indicate that endo-
geneity of the currency union variable has detrimental eﬀects on simple OLS estimates, and the IV technique
is required.


                                                    14
therefore higher markups feature lower trade (lower than would be predicted by the standard

gravity equation). At the same time, these economies are more likely to join currency unions

to eliminate the inflationary bias stemming from the high distortion.

    The trade eﬀects are extremely large and one should exercise caution before generalizing

the results. In this sample, most of the countries in currency unions are small and poor

clients for which the enhancement eﬀect on trade can be substantial (especially if they start

at low levels of trade). Moreover, the logarithmic specification dictated by the theory gives

a larger weight to observations with small bilateral trade volumes. Therefore, as Rose [2000]

warns, the results cannot be directly extrapolated to more developed countries.




V      Synchronization of shocks

Currency unions might alter the extent of synchronization of shocks. Since this synchro-

nization influences the suitability of currency adoption, a country deciding whether or not

to join a union should consider the eﬀect of the union on the patterns of co-movement.17 A

positive response of co-movements to currency unions will lead to a higher level of consensus

over the direction of monetary policy and will thereby reduce the cost of relinquishing an

independent currency. A negative response of co-movements will have the opposite eﬀect,

generating a larger loss associated with the lack of monetary policy independence.

    In this section, we investigate the eﬀect of currency unions on the extent of co-movements

of real GDP and prices. As suggested before, the response of co-movements to currency

unions can be positive or negative. On the one hand, sharing a common currency eliminates
  17
     See also Frankel and Rose [1998] for a discussion of the endogeneity of the optimum currency area
criteria. They remark that the criteria for optimality of currency unions should be considered ex post.


                                                  15
the fluctuations in relative prices driven by nominal exchange rate variation and, hence, can

lead to higher price co-movement. In addition, the common monetary shocks will induce

higher co-movement in consumption behavior and production decisions. On the other hand,

by lowering transaction costs and eliminating exchange rate uncertainty, currency unions

might lead to greater specialization. Specialization can take place within a given sector (for

example, diﬀerent countries producing diﬀerent models of cars) or between sectors (for ex-

ample, one country produces cars and the other produces agricultural goods). To the extent

that shocks are sector-specific and common to all countries, the second type of specialization

will lead to less co-movement of shocks.18

    The standard omitted-variable problem can also arise in the estimation of the eﬀect of

currency unions on the extent of co-movement of shocks. As already mentioned, currency

unions are generally accompanied by parallel eﬀorts to promote integration. For example, two

countries adopting a common currency will tend also to lower tariﬀ and non-tariﬀ barriers,

which are poorly measured in the data. These lower regulatory barriers might increase

the co-movement of shocks between two countries and, hence, simple OLS estimates will

attribute too much credit to the use of a common currency.

    To compute bilateral co-movement of price and output, we follow Alesina, Barro and

Tenreyro [2002]. Relative prices are measured using the real exchange rate calculated from

GDP deflators. The measure used is the purchasing power parity (PPP) for GDP divided by

the U.S. dollar exchange rate.19 This measure indicates the price level in country i relative

ability of the European Monetary Union.

    19
       Pi = P P P
                Ex.rate   measures how many units of U.S. output can be purchased with one unit of country
i’s output, that is, it measures the relative price of country i’s output with respect to that of the United
States. By definition, this price is always one when i is the United States.



                                                    16
to that in the United States, Pi,t /PU S,t . The relative price between countries i and j is then

computed by dividing the value for country i by that for country j.
                                                                     n        ot=1997
                                                                         Pi,t
   For every pair of countries, (i, j), we use the annual time series ln Pj,t         to compute
                                                                                   t=1960

the second-order auto-regression:


                             Pit                Pi,t−1           Pi,t−2
                       ln        = b0 + b1 · ln        + b2 · ln        + εtij .
                             Pjt                Pj,t−1           Pj,t−2


The estimated residual, ε̂tij , measures the part of the relative price that could not be pre-

dicted from the two prior values of relative prices. The extent of co-movement is then

measured as the negative of the root-mean-squared error:

                                             v
                                             u
                                             u        1 X 2
                                                            T
                                     CPij ≡ −t               ε̂ .
                                                    T − 3 t=1 tij


Similarly, the extent of co-movement of output comes from the estimated residuals from the

second-order auto-regression on annual data for relative per capita GDP:


                             Yit                Yi,t−1           Yi,t−2
                        ln       = c0 + c1 · ln        + c2 · ln        + utij .
                             Yjt                Yj,t−1           Yj,t−2


The estimated residuals, ûtij , measure the unpredictable movements in relative per capita

output. The measure of the extent of co-movement is analogous to the one used for prices:

                                              v
                                              u
                                              u      1 X
                                                            T
                                     V Yij ≡ −t              ûtij .
                                                   T − 3 t=1


   This measure of co-movement is more relevant from the perspective of monetary pol-


                                                   17
icy than a correlation of output movements. Consider two countries i and j whose output

movements are highly correlated but where the countries exhibit substantially diﬀerent vari-

abilities of output. Suppose that country i is the one with the lower variability. In this

case, the correlation of output movements will be high, but the monetary policy response

desired by country i will be insuﬃcient for country j. In other words, a high correlation

is not suﬃcient to ensure that the desired monetary policies are similar.. The measure of

co-movement used in this paper captures more adequately the criterion for suitability.

   Data on PPPs for the GDPs come from the Penn World Tables and are complemented

with the World Bank’s World Development Indicators when the first source is missing. Data

on real per capita GDP come from the World Development Indicators.

   Table 4 shows the eﬀect of currency unions on the co-movements of prices. We include all

the controls typically incorporated in gravity regressions, that is, various measures of distance

and size. The logic for including the same controls is that the forces that determine trade

will also aﬀect the extent of price-arbitrage between countries. There are, however, some

diﬀerences in the way that these forces can influence the outcomes. For example, countries

that are close in terms of the gravity variables may be motivated to specialize in diﬀerent

products. In this case, nearby countries will be subject to diﬀerent sectoral shocks and will

likely exhibit lower co-movements of prices. In any event, it seems prudent to control for the

gravity variables.

   In the co-movement equations, the sample consists of one observation (estimated for the

period 1960-1997) on each country pair, for pairs that have at least twenty observations.

The regressors, as well as the instrumental variables, are the averages over the period.20 The
  20
       For GDP per capita and population, we use the value in 1985 as opposed to the average, because the


                                                    18
first two columns report the estimates generated by OLS, and the last two columns show the

IV estimates. As before, the second and fourth columns include country-fixed eﬀects.

    The regressions show that price co-movement rises with regional trade agreements and

falls with geographical distance. Sharing a border does not aﬀect the co-movement, once

distance is taken into account. Speaking the same language and sharing the same colonizer

have positive, but small eﬀects on co-movement. In the IV specification, these eﬀects become

negligible. An ex-colony and its colonizer tend to exhibit less co-movement of prices, possibly

because colonies tended to specialize in products that were scarce in the colonizer’s land.

Price co-movement also rises with the various measures of country size, except for population.

However, the country fixed eﬀects capture most of the size eﬀects—hence, these size eﬀects

become statistically insignificant.

    Table 4 shows that sharing a common currency significantly increases price co-movement,

with an estimated OLS coeﬃcient of 0.062 when country-fixed eﬀects are excluded, and 0.045

when fixed eﬀects are included. These estimates are large relative to the mean of the co-

movement variable (the negative of the root mean squared error of the AR process described

before) of -0.16. The instrumental-variable regression indicates even more substantial eﬀects

than the ones generated by OLS. The estimates are 0.15 without country-fixed eﬀects and

0.07 with fixed eﬀects.

    The p-values from a Durbin-Wu-Hausman test are reported at the bottom of Table 4.

The null hypothesis that an OLS estimator of the model would yield consistent estimates is

rejected. In other words, endogeneity of the currency-union variable has detrimental eﬀects
averages are missing for some countries. Using diﬀerent years for GDP or population does not alter the main
results.

on simple OLS estimates, and the IV technique is required. As mentioned before, the positive

eﬀect of currency unions on the co-movement of price shocks is most likely associated with the

decrease in nominal exchange rate volatility stemming from the use of a common currency.

   The co-movement of output shocks is studied in Table 5. One diﬀerence from the results

on price co-movements is that the inclusion of fixed eﬀects makes a diﬀerence in the estimated

coeﬃcients of most “distance” variables. For instance, although free-trade agreements and

geographical proximity seem to increase the co-movement of outputs (columns 1 and 3)

when country fixed eﬀects are excluded, the eﬀects become statistically insignificant when

the fixed eﬀects are added. In contrast, although sharing a border does not aﬀect output

co-movements in the specification without fixed eﬀects, sharing a border does increase the co-

movement when fixed eﬀects are included. Henceforth, we comment on the results with fixed

eﬀects, as they provide more adequate controls for remoteness and multilateral resistance.

   Speaking the same language and sharing the same colonizer increase the co-movement of

output, but the ex-colony-colonizer variable does not aﬀect the extent of co-movement. Size,

measured by GDP per capita and geographical area, tends to increase the co-movement.

However, a rise in the population of the larger country decreases co-movement.

   In the OLS estimation, the eﬀect of currency unions on output co-movement is insignifi-

cant. However, in the instrumental-variable estimation, when fixed eﬀects are included, the

currency union eﬀect becomes negative and significant at the ten percent level. The Durbin-

Wu-Hausman test also prefers the IV estimator over the OLS when country fixed eﬀects are

included (the p-value is 5 percent).21
  21
     When fixed eﬀects are excluded, however, the Durbin-Wu-Hausman test does not reject the hypothesis
of exogeneity.




                                                  20
   The negative eﬀect of currency unions on the extent of co-movement of outputs could

reflect a positive eﬀect of currency unions on sectoral specialization, which can then lead to a

decrease in the extent of co-movement, as Krugman (1993) suggested. The eﬀect—in absolute

values—is not as substantial as the one found for price co-movement: the estimated coeﬃcient

is -0.003, whereas the mean of this variable (the negative of the root-mean-squared error

described above) is -0.06. This eﬀect, however, might be diﬀerent for developed countries

forming a currency union if, for example, developed countries tend to specialize in the same

industries (e.g., diﬀerent industrialized countries produce diﬀerent types of cars). In this

case, countries will tend to be exposed to similar sectoral shocks and integration will lead to

higher co-movement.22




VI      Conclusion

This paper proposes a new instrumental variable to study the eﬀects of diﬀerent exchange rate

arrangements on economic outcomes. We apply the methodology to investigate the impact of

currency unions on bilateral trade and the extent of co-movements of prices and outputs. The

instrument relies on the idea that one reason why two countries share a common currency is

the attractiveness of a third country’s currency as an anchor. The validity of the instrument

requires that the motivation to adopt an external anchor’s currency is exogenous to the

bilateral link between two potential client-countries. The paper shows that the probability

that a client adopts the currency of a main anchor increases when the client is geographically

close, speaks the same language, and shares a colonial relationship with the anchor. It also
  22

OECD countries.


                                                 21
increases when the client is smaller and poorer and when the anchor is richer. The likelihood

that two countries share a common currency is calculated from the probability that each

of them, independently, uses the currency of a third country. This likelihood serves as an

instrument for the common currency dummy in the estimation of the economic eﬀects of

monetary unions.

   The IV approach is used to revisit the eﬀect of currency unions on trade and to investigate

the eﬀect of currency unions on the extent of co-movement of prices and outputs. Three

main findings follow. First, currency unions significantly increase bilateral trade, a result

consistent with previous findings by Rose [2000] and co-authors. This finding suggests that

the large trade eﬀect found previously for currency unions is not due to endogeneity bias.

Second, currency unions significantly increase the extent of price co-movement. This response

most likely reflects the elimination of nominal exchange rate volatility. Third, the IV results

suggest that currency unions might decrease the extent of co-movement of output, possibly

as a consequence of higher sectoral specialization. Simple OLS estimation, however, fails to

reveal this negative relationship.

Note: The sample consists of country-pairs that include the six candidate anchors: Australia, France, Germany,
Japan, UK, and US. The equations are for annual data, include year effects, and allow for clustering over time for
country pairs. Clustered standard errors are shown in the second column. The definition of currency union treats
the CFA franc countries as linked to France and treats the ECCA countries as linked to the US since 1976 and to
the UK before 1976. The mean of the currency-union dummy for this sample is 0.034. The third column shows the
marginal effect, evaluated at the sample mean, of each explanatory variable on the estimated probability of a
currency union. The fourth column shows the marginal effects evaluated at the mean of the subsample of countries
in currency unions. For dummy variables, the effect refers to a shift from zero to one.* significant at 10%; **
significant at 5%; *** significant at 1%.

Note: The equations use annual data from 1960 to 1997, include year effects, and allow for clustering of the error terms over time
for country pairs. The dependent variable is ln(trade). The definition of currency union treats the CFA franc countries as linked to
France and the ECCA countries as linked to the UK before 1976 and to the US after 1976. Country effects refer to each member of
the pair (not to a country pair). The IV is described in the text. * Significant at 10%; ** significant at 5%; *** significant at 1%.
