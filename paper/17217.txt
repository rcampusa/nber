                                            ABSTRACT

We track US imports of advanced technology wind and solar power-generation equipment from a
panel of countries during 1989-2010, and examine the determining factors including sector-specific
US FDI outflow, country size, and domestic wind and solar power generation. Differentiating between
the core high-tech and the balance of system equipment, we find US imports of the both categories
have grown at significantly higher rate from the relatively poorer countries, particularly China and
India. US FDI is found to play a significant positive role in the exports of high-tech equipment from
both rich and poor countries, especially for the balance of system equipment. For the core wind and
solar equipment, we find domestic renewable power generation played a significant positive role, and
the effect is more pronounced for the rich countries as well as China compared to other poor countries.

      1.   Introduction

      World demand for electricity is rising, especially in the developing world. If fossil fuel fired

power plants that rely on coal or natural gas continue to grow in nations such as China and India,

then global greenhouse gas emissions will accelerate and the damage caused by climate change will

be even worse. To slowdown potentially catastrophic impacts of climate change will require

increasing reliance on (renewable) wind and solar power to generate electricity. Today, there is an

ongoing debate about the economic feasibility of these nascent technologies. Optimists foresee

large learning by doing effects as average cost declines with cumulative experience (Duke and

Kammen 1999). Pessimists point to the large subsidies these industries receive and argue that

purely based on power generated per dollar invested that the returns are quite low (Lesser 2010).

      Global international trade is likely to play an important role in accelerating innovation and cost

reduction in green technology. We examine exports of advanced technology renewable energy

equipment based on a panel of developed and developing countries during the years 1989 to 2010, a

period marked by liberalization and rising FDI in developing countries, particularly China and

India.2 Inward foreign direct investment brings clean technology when multinational firms set up

equipment production or build energy systems. We choose the US import market, since the US

ranks among the leading nations in terms of both cutting-edge technologies in the field as well as

trade and size of the domestic market; thus, products entering the market require quality-

conformity. We find that developing countries have eroded the developed countries’ shares in the

US import market during the last two decades. For instance China now commands almost half the

US import market of solar modules by value, while India’s share in wind turbines and blades is

more than 10%.

      There is a certain irony that trade with developing countries is accelerating the development of

the “green economy”. The trade and environment literature has studied the conditions such that


2
    China and India implemented major economic reforms in 1991-92.
poor nations would be pollution havens for rich countries as dirty factories could escape tight

regulation in rich countries by re-locating to poorer nations (Copeland and Taylor 2003, 2004).

This literature emphasizes that the location of dirty economic activity will be determined by both

factor endowments and regulatory intensity.

         In the case of “green energy” trade, the poorer South is emerging as a key provider of cheap

equipment for renewable-power generation to the rich North for its production and consumption of

clean energy. If clean energy prices decline then they are more likely to induce a composition shift

as nations choose to substitute them for fossil fuel generated electricity (i.e coal and natural gas).

Such a composition shift could significantly reduce national greenhouse gas emissions associated

with power generation.

         The leading sources of renewable energy technology in the world today, especially in wind

and solar technology, are the industrialized countries of Germany, Japan, United States and

Denmark – where cutting-edge technology is rapidly evolving as evident in their vigorous patenting

activity.3 Among the different renewable energy forms, wind and solar have been the fastest

growing power-generation technologies in the last twenty years, with the largest grid-connected

installed capacities in countries like the US, China, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain and India in wind

and solar photovoltaic (REN21 2010). The growth of the renewable power-generation sector has

taken place with policy support in all the countries, and with foreign technology-dependence in the

emerging economies. Technology transfer is seen as an efficient means to mitigate global warming,

whereby developing countries which are yet to indigenously develop such technology can leap-frog

onto a cleaner growth path.

    In examining US imports of wind and solar power generation equipment, we distinguish

between imports from relatively rich and poor countries, and then compare the trend growth of

China and India against the benchmark of these country groups. We test whether sector-specific US

3
 Overall solar and wind power and hydrogen and fuel cell technologies have witnessed the most substantial increases in
patent applications, both in terms of numbers and shares in total alternative energy filings at the European Patent Office
and through the Patent Cooperative Treaty (WIPO, 2009).
FDI and home market size (size of the economy and size of renewable electricity) can explain the

observed time trends. We find that US sector-specific FDI has been a significant determinant of

export growth from rich and poor countries, especially for balance of system high-tech power-

generation equipment, while domestic renewable power generation played a significant role in the

export of core high-tech wind and solar equipment.

    Our paper contributes to the growing literature on international technology transfer related to

climate change mitigation from the developed to the developing countries (Popp et al 2009, Driesen

and Popp 2010).4 Here we consider growing wind-solar power equipment exports to the US as an

indicator of clean technology diffusion following inward FDI from the US and domestic wind-solar

power generation.

    The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives the theoretical and analytical

background; as well as a brief description of the US imports of wind and solar high-tech power

generation equipment during the last two decades; Section 3 outlines the hypotheses and the basic

regression specification; Section 4 summarizes the series of regression results; and Section 5

concludes.



    2.   Theoretical Background

    The trade literature predicts that with technology transfer, developing countries will emerge as

exporters of the older products while the North moves into further higher technology through

continuous innovation - leading to the product cycle pattern of trade. Vernon had observed that the

product cycle is evident for industries like chemicals, electronics, machinery, and transportation




4
 Much of the focus has been on Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects where technology diffusion has
occurred without policy prescriptions, being driven instead by firms seeking to lower production costs (Popp 2011).
Inter-country CDM comparisons show that strong economic growth and domestic technological capabilities have been
important for countries like China and India, while involvement of foreign partners have been more important for
countries like Brazil and Mexico (Dechezleprete et al 2009).
equipment sectors, where he noted innovations were prominent (Vernon 1979: 258). 5 Indeed, most

of the high-technology renewable equipment that we examine here are in the electronics and

machinery sectors.

    North-South trade in high-technology products can be explained using product cycle models

(Vernon 1966, Krugman 1979, Flam and Helpman 1987, Grossman and Helpman 1989), where the

developing South emerges as the exporter of older technology products and the North moves into

further higher quality exports driven by their innovation. North-North trade in high-technology

products, on the other hand, is driven by particular technological differences (Posner 1961), product

differentiation, economies of scale and home market effect (Krugman 1980).

    Recent trade empirics have focussed on the phenomenal surge of sophisticated imports in

OECD countries from the South, especially countries like China and India. Disaggregated analyses

find that within the same product classification at 10-digit US HTS, US imports from developing

countries exhibit lower prices (hence lower quality) compared to those from developed countries

(Schott 2004, 2008), indicating that the North continues to export higher quality vertically-

differentiated products compared to the South. This suggests that based on intrinsic quality

difference of the final products, the imports from developed versus developing countries within the

US market are imperfect substitutes (if at all).

    The lower quality notwithstanding, competition from Chinese imports has stimulated further

innovation and patent activity among Western European firms in a bid to survive and increase

profits (Bloom et al 2011). Their work gives evidence of technological up-gradation in industries

of Western Europe most affected by Chinese imports (at 6 digit HS) - through innovation and

patenting among surviving firms in the industrialized countries. The result is robust even after

controlling for product-switching and outsourcing by the OECD firms, which suggests that

technological quality of imports from an emerging country like China does pose a credible threat to

5
  Indeed FDI tends to be greater in technically progressive industries, and multinational firms are concentrated in
industries with higher share of R&D to sales (Saggi 2002).
existing high-technology industries pushing them to innovate further, and affirms the essence of the

product-cycle theory.6

    International investment is the key channel of technology transfer to the developing South in the

product-cycle theory (Vernon 1966). Extensions of the product-cycle trade model with sector-

specific capital mobility show that the range of higher quality exports from the South increase with

FDI (Falvey 1981, Grossman and Helpman 1989).7 Inward FDI in developing countries introduces

new industries in these countries, and promotes exports to the home countries of multinational

affiliates with the advantage of market networks (Lipsey 2004, 2000, Liu et al 2001).8

    Another channel of technology transfer for developing countries can be the import of goods,

especially intermediate goods that embody high technology.9 The increasing sophistication of

exports of developing countries is a reflection of the underlying sophisticated imported components

before assembly and re-exports (Krugman 2008). Indeed as Hummels et al (2001) demonstrated,

processing trade has grown in world trade in general, and developing countries play a significant

role in the production chain spanning several countries (termed vertical specialization). Here too

FDI has played an important role since multinationals are largely involved in processing trade, and

outsource to developing countries to benefit from lower labour costs. For example, foreign invested

firms dominate in China’s high-technology exports (Xing 2011), and foreign-content in exports is



6
  The product cycle hypothesis assumes that the stimulus to innovation is typically provided by some threat or promise
in the market, and firms being “acutely myopic” are stimulated by conditions in the closest market, namely the home
market (Vernon 1979).
7
  Models differ in terms of whether R&D is exogenous or endogenous. Foreign direct investment in developing
countries lead to productivity gains following technology diffusion, where the rate of diffusion depends on features of
the backward economy including relative capital stock, education level of the labour force, and terms of licensing
arrangements (Findlay 1978: 5). The extent of benefits from FDI eventually depend on the host country facilitating
factors of domestic physical and knowledge capital, as well as policy regime . The efficacy of inward FDI (as well as its
volume) will be higher in a developing country with export-promotion policy regime compared to a country with
import-substitution, ceteris paribus (Bhagwati 1978).
8
  The literature indicates that the export growth effect of FDI in the host country can hold not only when FDI is
efficiency-seeking (re-location of production due to cost advantage in the host country), but even when FDI is market-
seeking (i.e. production to serve host country market) - since domestic firms of the host country benefit from market
network linkage of the foreign affiliates.
9
  To the extent non-codified knowledge may be more readily transferred through greater personal contact, FDI and
interaction with multinationals raise the probability of international R&D spillovers. See Keller (2004) for an excellent
review on international technology diffusion.
higher from foreign invested firms (Koopman et al 2008).10 Higher imports of intermediate

products also help in product innovation for domestic firms as established in the case of India

(Goldberg et al 2010).

     In developed countries too, FDI plays an important role in technology diffusion. FDI among

European countries was found to be significant effect on technical progress, export and economic

growth (Barrell and Pain, 1997). Alfaro et al (2009) showed that large part of FDI among

developed countries is efficiency-seeking “vertical” in nature, and multinationals are relocating

high-skill intra-industry production to other developed countries.



     2.1 US Imports of Wind and Solar Power Generation Equipment

     For our analysis of US imports of wind and solar power generation equipment, we identify a

total of 27 products at 10-digit HTS codes based on energy equipment mapping of the USITC and

ICTSD (see Table A1 at the end for details of concordance with renewable energy components). 11

The selected equipment in our analysis is a subset the list of environmental goods being negotiated

under the Doha Round of the current WTO negotiations.12 We classify five of these products as

core high-technology equipment and 22 products as balance of system equipment. Among our core

high-technology equipment, wind turbine is final product, while blade and hub are components of

wind turbines, and solar photovoltaic cells are components of solar modules. The balance of

system equipment also includes high-technology components (like anemometer, clutch, gearbox,

rectifier, etc.). All the equipment are components of the overall power generation system.




10
   With government policy facilitating outsourcing and processing trade in China.
11
   Harmonized commodity description and coding system for tariff or HTS is maintained by the World Customs
Organization and used world-wide for classifying traded commodities. While codes up to 6-digits are set
internationally, individual countries are allowed to assign additional 2 or 4 digits for additional subcategories.
12
   In the Doha negotiations, the environmental goods are specified at 6 digit-HS 2002 codes. The equipment analyzed
in our paper correspond to thirteen of these products under negotiation namely 730820, 841290, 848340, 848360,
850161, 850162, 850163, 850164, 850231, 850300, 850440, 854140, and 902680 (Annex IIA of WTO (2011). Since
our 27 products are at a more disaggregated level of 10-digit US HS codes, several disaggregated products often
correspond to a single 6-digit good.
    In selecting the products we will study, we exclude other components such as glass, lead-acid

batteries, wires, switches, etc, since at the 10-digit HTS classification it is difficult to delineate the

high-quality products which would be utilized in the wind/ solar power generation system. More

importantly, it allows us to minimize the inclusion of multiple-use balance of system equipment that

are imported for purposes other than renewable electricity generation; and also preclude products

where innovation is not high. The total value of US import (from the rest of the world) of the

selected wind and solar equipment increased from US$0.8 billion in 1989 to US$9.4billion in 2010

(constant 2000$), with a higher growth in the core high-tech equipment (see Table 1).

    Our choice of 24 countries covers a diverse range of developed and emerging countries

exporting the subset of products covered here. These countries together accounted for more than

90% of US imports by value in each of the twenty-seven 10-digit HTS products for most of the

years during the period considered. The country shares in the US import of the core high-tech

products in 1989 versus 2010 are depicted in Table 2.

    The share of China in US imports of core wind and solar energy equipment, including solar

panels/module, and blades have steadily increased, while Japan, Germany, United Kingdom have

experienced a substantial erosion in their shares in the US market. India, on the other hand,

experienced a more significant growth in wind turbines. While there has been drastic loss of market

share in the US among the erstwhile leading nations like Denmark, Germany, Japan, United

Kingdom, they continue to maintain dominant shares (and in the case of wind-turbines there is a

remarkable reversal of Denmark’s trend beginning 2008) – reflecting the lead in innovating and

high-value products from these countries.



2.2 US FDI outflow in the selected manufacturing sectors, 1988-2009
        The US remains a leading source of outward-FDI in the world (UNCTAD 2010), and for

emerging countries like China and India as well.13 Since we are interested in tracking the

significance of US FDI in the US import of the green energy equipment, we track the investment

outflows in four manufacturing sectors.14

        The annual sector-specific US FDI outflows across countries provide insights on how the

pattern of investment has changed in the last two decades. For a cross-country time-series analysis,

the data on sector-specific US FDI is available only at the 3-digit NAICS (and SIC 2-digit prior to

1999) from US Bureau of Economic Analysis.15 Thus our analysis here pertains to horizontal FDI,

and does not distinguish the portion of vertical FDI within these industries (that would be evident at

higher disaggregation of 4-digit SIC). The equipment imports associated with wind and solar

power generation come from four manufacturing sectors: primary and fabricated metal (NAICS 331

and 332), machine manufacturing (NAICS 333), electrical equipment (NAICS 335), and computer

and electronic products (NAICS 334).16

        Considering the US FDI outflows in these four sectors, the largest recipients continue to be

the countries like Canada, Germany, and United Kingdom throughout the period of analysis. While

Japan and Italy were among the high recipients in the initial years, they have receded in their ranks.

Among the relatively poorer nations Brazil, Malaysia, Mexico, Singapore, Taiwan are among the

high recipients of FDI in these manufacturing sectors. While both China and India were among the

low recipients among the twenty-four countries considered, the US FDI flows to China have

increased steadily. China now is among the top recipients of US FDI in these four sectors


13
   Although for China, countries like Hong Kong and Taiwan appear to be the major FDI sources much of this is based
on “round-tripping” for tax, financial and other institutional advantages. Similarly for India, Mauritius has long been
documented as the largest source of FDI, even though it is due to the routing based on incentive to evade taxes.
14
   Of course US imports of high-technology power equipment from a country are also affected by FDI inflow into the
latter from a third country. However, the time-series data on FDI-inflows, classified by the four manufacturing sectors
used here, is not available for all countries.
15
   However, some of the US FDI data by country and industry level are withheld to avoid disclosure of data of certain
companies, thus leading to missing data for those years.
16
   US BEA reports the sector of computer and electronic products separately beginning 1999. For the period 1988-1998,
FDI is reported together with the sector of electrical equipment. Thus for continuity in our sector-wise analysis, we
consider the FDI in electrical equipment also to be the FDI for electronic products for the years 1988 through 1998.
(especially since 2007). The figure below shows that actual US FDI outflows (in constant US$) in

the four manufacturing sectors to China and India as well as the highest recipient countries in our

panel.

                                                A sector-wise distribution and pattern of US FDI abroad in the twenty-four countries during

1988-2009, indicates that, on the whole, US FDI outflow in the computer and electronic products

witnessed the highest annual growth followed by metal and fabricated metal.17 This pattern is true

in both rich and poor countries. The only difference, however, is that US FDI outflow in machine

manufacturing to the rich countries show a negative trend, but has been growing in the poor

countries.




17
   The decline in electrical sector occurs due to re-classification of computer and electronic products as a separate sector
beginning 1999.
      3.1 Model Specification

      In order to estimate our trade regressions, we have merged together several different data sets.

The US import data is taken from Robert Feenstra’s trade database (1989-2006), and supplemented

with data from the USITC online database for years 2007 through 2010. The US FDI data is taken

from US Bureau of Economic Analysis. Price indices for deflation of import data and FDI are

taken from US Bureau of Labour Statistics. Country-specific data on GDP and electricity from

wind-solar-biomass-geothermal are from the IMF and World Bank database (see the Data appendix

for details).

      With products defined at the 10-digit US HTS code, our regression covers the components of

wind- and solar-based power generation systems (but some like the wind-powered generator or

solar photovoltaic panel and module are final products that are connected to other balance of system

equipment). Our basic pooled regression model with country fixed-effects is given by the equation

(1) below.


log                                                  .                 .                    .

                        /          ;       1, … 24                                  /                    1


Where,

Importijtus = US import of product i from country j in year t, t=1989 to 2010;

Dummyc = dummy for core high-tech product

Dummym = dummy for manufacturing sector m in which product i is manufactured, whether

primary/ fabricated metal; machine manufacturing; electrical equipment; electronic products (at 3-

digit NAICS)

Category= category of the products or equipment: core and balance of system

Group = group classification of country j, whether relatively poor or rich.
FDImj, = US foreign direct investment in manufacturing sector m (which produces equipment i) in

country j,

GDP= gross domestic product in constant US dollars, used as the proxy for economic size

RenewElecj = renewable electricity production (from wind, solar, geothermal & biomass) in country

j.

        Since we want to compare the export growth rates of China and India against the benchmark

of the two groups of country, we have dummies for China and India in trend interactions. We also

have a dummy for the product category (core vs balance of system equipment) and a dummy for the

industrial sector to which the product belongs (fabricated metal, machinery, electrical or electronic

equipment). The determining variables appear with a lag of one year, to allow for the time to

translate its impact through capital formation, production and finally export. Thus, each of the

variables, namely US FDI in specific manufacturing sector (to which the export product belongs),

total domestic output (GDP), and domestic renewable power generation appear with a time lag.

Our country-fixed effects controls for other country-specific determinants of high-technology

export growth like skilled labour force and government policy, which have not been included.

     In our regressions, we control for country group-level, category of product (core high-tech

equipment and balance of system equipment) and cluster by country and year. The US FDI is

matched with the industrial classification (at 2 digit SIC / 3 digit NAICS) of the product being

exported to the US (10 digit HTS code) to better reflect industry-specific impact in the host country.

To control for the countries, we classify our panel of 24 countries into two groups of rich and poor,

using the median real GDP per capita of the panel of countries in 1989 as the dividing line.18



     3.2 Hypotheses


18
  The rich countries include Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Netherlands,
Sweden, Switzerland, and United Kingdom. The second group of countries below the median income (we call
relatively poor countries) includes Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Philippines,
Singapore, Spain, Taiwan, and Thailand.
    By estimating equation (1), we test three main hypotheses;

    H1:       Sector-specific US FDI elasticity of high-tech power generation equipment exports is
              positive.
    H2:       Larger home market size leads to higher high-tech power-generation equipment exports.
    H3:       Home market effect in terms of wind-solar power is positive for the core high-
              technology renewable power generation equipment.


    Following the FDI-trade literature, we expect US FDI to be an important determinant of exports

of technology- and skill-intensive goods for both developed and developing countries. Empirics

have shown that FDI flows serve as an important channel of technology diffusion, export and

economic growth in the host countries (Barrel and Pain 1997, Blomstrom and Kokko 1997,

Borensztein et al 1998). More recently, Buckley et al (2007 and 2002) found that higher FDI in

China increased the development of new manufactures, and enhanced export intensities of domestic

firms as well as foreign affiliates.19 Today FDI (in the industrial sector) is considered to be the

largest source of private, climate-mitigation relevant financial flows from developed to developing

countries (OECD 2009). Our hypothesis H1 provides a test of the export performance of

developing countries in technologically sophisticated equipment to the US as an outcome of

technology up-gradation largely as a result of sector-specific US FDI growth to these countries

through the last two decades, against the benchmark of richer industrialized countries. 20

    Large countries tend to be large net exporters of goods in monopolistic competitive market set-

up (Krugman 1980), and there this home market effect is stronger in industries with more

differentiated products and high transport cost (Hanson and Xiang 2004). The hypothesis H2 here

tests whether countries with larger income are able to export larger amounts of the high-tech

manufactured equipment to the US (after controlling for country fixed effects, and inward-FDI).



19
   The mechanism of technology diffusion work through backward and/or forward linkages of the operations of foreign
affiliates in the host country, and becomes evident in plant-level productivity growth and FDI literature (Saggi 2002,
Keller 2004).
20
   We expect that sector-specific FDI from third countries would positively affect home-country exports to the US. The
omission of sector-specific FDI inflows from third countries, would give an upward bias to the estimated elasticity
coefficient of US FDI.
        The period of our analysis also marks the take-off period in the long-term diffusion of wind

turbine and solar cell technologies21. During the last two decades, the global solar and wind

industry grew rapidly. The highest installed capacity of renewable energy, in particular of wind

power and solar PV, is the region of European Union followed by the US and Japan, due to the

strong government policy initiatives (in 2005 the EU accounted for 74% of the global wind power

production, WIPO 2009: 28). A growing market for grid-tied wind and solar PV has also emerged

in China and India (REN 2010). In China, domestic manufacturing of wind turbines and

components has matured through the years and some are optimistic enough to claim that wind

power can become competitive with coal-generated power by 2015-2020 (Yu et al 2009).22 Under

H3, we test the significance of the growth of wind- and solar- electricity in the home countries (and

the underlying policy promotion for renewable energy) in the export of such power-generating

equipment to the US.



     4. Empirical Results

     Table 3 presents the regression results. As the data on the explanatory variables is incomplete

(due to Taiwan and Singapore) for our entire panel of countries (and years), we run our regressions

(and test the hypotheses) in a staggered manner as we include additional explanatory variables that

are not available for all countries. 23 Regressions 1 through 4 cover all 24 countries, while

regressions 5-6 cover 22 countries.

     Based on the results reported in columns (1-4), we find that the time trend growth in core high-

tech equipment exports from the rich countries is substantially higher (10.26% per year) than that in

21
   According to Jacobson and Lauber (2006) the take-off period of such tech-diffusion began in the 1990s.
22
   At the same time that China is ramping up its renewable power generation, 81% of China’s power is generated using
coal. China is sharply increasing its imports of coal and this has raised international coal prices. An unintended
consequence of this is to nudge other nations to substitute away from coal to cleaner fuels (Wolak and Morse 2010).
Today, wind provides only a small share of China’s total electricity. For details see
http://www.esi.nus.edu.sg/portal/Portals/0/18032011/China_He_Gang.pdf.
23
   Taiwan and Singapore are not included in regressions 5-6. Taiwan gets dropped since data on renewable electricity
generation is missing, while Singapore gets dropped since the computed renewable power generation from wind/solar is
zero. Since both Taiwan and Singapore are in the category of poor, our benchmark with poor countries changes in these
regressions compared to the benchmark of poor country results reported in columns 1-4.
the balance of system equipment (5.56% per year). The poor countries experienced a higher trend

growth rate than the rich countries in both categories of equipment (14.58% and 9.88% per year in

core and balance of system equipment, respectively). Thus, rich and poor nations enjoyed a faster

trend growth in the core high-tech renewable power generation equipment than the non-core high-

tech equipment (Column 1).

      Controlling for the US FDI in specific manufacturing sector and home market size (real GDP),

we find that the trend growth rates reduce substantially for both groups of countries and product

categories. In the rich countries, trend growth rates dropped to 3.2% and 7.38% per year in the

balance of system and core high-tech equipment respectively (representing declines of 42% and

29% respectively). Similarly, for the poor countries the trend growth rates dropped to 5.26% per

year and 12.64% per year in balance of system and core high-tech equipment, respectively

(reductions of about 47% and 13.3%, respectively). The sector-specific US FDI inflows and GDP

are found to be highly significant with elasticity of export at 0.379 and 0.802 respectively (Column

2).

      In regressions 3 of Table 3, we separate out the trend growth rates of China and India. We find

that the rest of the poor countries now show lower trend growth rates for both balance of system as

well as core high-tech equipment of 7.39% and 12.03% per year, respectively (in Column 3

compared to Column 1). However, the trend growth in exports from the poor countries continues to

be significantly higher than that of the rich countries (column 3). Both China and India experienced

substantially higher trend growth rates than the rich and poor countries; however, there is

asymmetry in their growth dynamics. 24 China exhibits a much higher trend growth than India in

the balance of system equipment (24.75% compared to 16.66% per year), while India exhibits a

higher trend growth than China in the core balance of system equipment (34.79% compared to

29.39% per year). Controlling for FDI and real GDP (regression column 4), we again find that the

24
  The significantly higher trend growth of US imports in high-tech wind and solar power equipment from the poor
countries (and particularly China and India) compared to rich developed countries holds true even when we measure
imports relative to the total imports from these countries. These results are available on request.
trend growth rates decline significantly for all countries and for both categories of equipment.

Moreover, the drop in the trend growth is relatively larger in the balance of system equipment than

in the core high-tech equipment (comparing column 4 with column 3). In particular, the trend

growth rates of Chinese exports reduced from 24.75% to15.83% per year in the balance of system

equipment and from 25.39% to 20.06% per year in the core high-tech equipment. For India, the

trend growth rates dropped from 16.66% to 10.27% per year in the balance of system equipment

and from 34.79% per year to 28.68% in the core high tech equipment.

     The results from regressions 1-4 suggest that the US FDI has been an important determinant of

imports of the balance of system equipment from both rich and poor countries, but more so for the

emerging economies of China and India. The sector specific US FDI seems to explain the trend

growth of exports in the balance of system equipment much more relative to that of the core high-

tech equipment for all countries, including China and India.25

     Controlling for US FDI, GDP and the wind-solar electricity generation (regression column 6),

we find that the trend growth in core high-tech equipment declines significantly from 9.95% per

year to 4.8% per year for the rich countries and to a lesser extent for the poor countries from

13.03% to 11.24% per year comparing columns 5 and 6. In the balance of system equipment, the

trend growth rate of both the rich and the poor countries decline by about 20-21% after controlling

for the three variables. For China, the trend growth declines substantially in both categories of

equipment reducing from 24.76% per year to 14.58% per year for the balance of system equipment

and from 28.59% per year to 13.94% per year for the core high-tech equipment. For India,

however, after controlling for the three factors, the decline in trend growth rate is more pronounced

in the balance of system equipment from 17.56% per year to 7.35% per year, and relatively less so

in the core high-tech equipment from 34.78% per year to 25.24% per year.


25
  The trend growth rates estimation covering 22 countries for which we have complete data on FDI, GDP, and
renewable power (regression 5) show the same pattern as before (regression 3) across rich and poor nations as well as
China and India.
         The results from regression 5-6 indicate that for the rich countries as well as China, the trend

growth in core high-tech products is halved after controlling, however, for India and other poor

countries; the effect is not as pronounced for the core high-tech equipment exports.

       From the above sets of regressions in Tables 3, three clear consistent results emerge

concerning our hypotheses H1, H2 and H3:

       H1: Sector-specific US FDI is a significant factor in export growth of both rich and poor

       countries, but relatively more in the balance of system compared to the core equipment.

       H2: Home market size has a positive effect on exports of high-tech power-generation

       equipment (although not always individually significant, it is jointly significant together with

       other control variables).

       H3: Domestic wind-solar power sector has been a significant factor in the export of the core

       high-technology equipment to the US (more pronounced in rich countries and China).



       We recognize that US FDI is unlikely to be randomly assigned across nation/year/industries

and could be correlated with the error term in equation (1).26 Foreign investors will invest their

scarce resources in those projects that yield a high risk adjusted rate of return. Recall that we lag

US FDI one year in the regressions. While we do not believe that exports in year t cause US FDI in

year t-1 to grow, there could be omitted third factors causing both. If foreign investors believe that

a developing nation’s government will become actively involved in subsidizing green tech in the

following year, then they may start to increase their FDI. Such complementarities between

government policy and private capital are likely to help the industry to grow. In this case, our OLS

estimates are likely to overstate the causal effects of US FDI because the coefficient on US FDI will

partially reflect the unobserved increased effort by the exporting nation’s government to promote

green tech.27 In the absence of identifying a credible instrumental variable for US FDI by

nation/year/industry category, we are cautious about giving our correlation estimates a causal

interpretation.28 Future research should seek to study the likely synergies between export nation’s

renewables promotion policies and attracting FDI inflows.

     It is relevant to note that the growth and maturity of the renewable energy industry in the

developed countries (and more recent growth in developing countries) has been driven by

government support policies. A study using patent applications as a proxy measure for

technological innovations in a cross-section of OECD countries, established that public policies

have indeed been significant in inducing innovations in renewable energy during the period 1978-

2003 (Johnstone et al 2010). Thus, the inclusion of domestic renewable power generation as an

explanatory variable in regression 6 to some extent controls for the effective renewable support

policies enacted by the national governments.



     5. Conclusion

     The import of core-high tech wind and solar power generation equipment has grown faster than

other high technology equipment in the US during the past two decades. The growth of imports

from poorer countries have outpaced (though from far lower base) that from rich countries. China

and India, in particular, have experienced phenomenally high export growth, with China exhibiting

much higher trend growth in the balance of system equipment than India, and the latter exhibiting

higher trend growth in the core high-tech equipment than China. Although richer countries like

Germany, Japan, Denmark, Canada, continue to be major exporters of these high-tech equipment

into the US, their import market shares (by value) have been eroded considerably.
27
   Moreover as we had observed earlier in section 2, high-tech exports from developing poor countries can also be
driven by intermediate product imports (in the vertical global supply chain) facilitated by government policy towards
processing trade, as well-documented for China and India (Koopman et al 2008, Goldberg et al 2010).
28
   We have also estimated equation (1) and included nation/year fixed effects. In these regression results, that are
available on request, we estimate a FDI elasticity of .46. By including nation/year fixed effects, the FDI coefficient is
identified by within nation/year variation in FDI by the four FDI industry categories. This finding indicates that the
FDI results cannot simply be a proxy for government macro energy policy because the nation/year fixed effects control
for this.
     We find that sector-specific US FDI and country size are important correlates of exports to the

US of the high-tech balance of system equipment from both rich and poor countries. However,

these cannot explain much of the rapid growth in the core equipment exports to the US. For the

core high-tech wind-solar equipment, we find that the home market effect in terms of wind-solar

power generation played significant positive role for the rich nations as well as China. For the other

poorer countries, including India, the home market effect of wind-solar power generation is also

significant but not as pronounced.

     Our analysis provides a stark comparison between countries, and the significance of overall

macro trends in the export of renewable power generation equipment to the US. The rapid growth

of exports from the emerging countries in the high-tech equipment and their share displacement of

the rich industrialized countries in the US import market suggest that technology adoption in the

relatively poor countries has been notably high over the last two decades. The unit of our analysis

being the country-industry, we cannot distinguish whether multinational affiliates or domestic firms

were the source of exports from the different countries; nor the extent of imported input embodied

in the exports.29 However, given the overall nature of the products in our sample, from our results

we can conclude that developing countries are rapidly emerging as the “green havens” producing

technologically advanced renewable energy equipment.

     Greater international trade and participation of Asian economies in renewable power equipment

production has likely played a significant role in reducing the cost of such equipment. For example,

the average solar PV module price has reduced from $4.66/W (per Watt) in 2004 to $2.01/W in

2010, is expected to further drop to $1.49/W by 2015.30 Access to cheap imports from China has

offered U.S consumers a great increase in consumer surplus (Weinstein and Broda 2008). In the



29
   Since intermediate inputs often fall within other product classification (like imports of silicon wafers used in solar
cell manufacturing), country net import at the 10-digit HTS would not accurately reflect the embodied imported inputs.
The value-added on imported inputs are best reflected at the plant-level export analysis.

case of renewables equipment, declines in these products’ prices offer externality benefits. The role

of international trade in mitigating environmental externalities merits future research.

       While our study highlighted important role of FDI in the high-technology climate-mitigation

industry for the developing countries, alternative means of technology access is increasingly evident

within the industry. For instance, the firms from developing countries like China and India have

engaged in acquisition of component-specialist firms in a bid to access technology, apart from

licensing technology or entering into joint-ventures: the Indian wind turbine manufacturer Suzlon

acquired Hansen Transmissions of Belgium (gearbox specialist) in 2006-07, and purchased RE

Power of Germany (wind turbine manufacturer) in 2009, while the Chinese wind turbine

manufacturer Goldwind acquired Vensys Energy of Germany (specialist in gearless wind turbines)

in 2008.31 Future research with firm-level data could attempt to explore this alternative channel of

technology diffusion and its role in the growth of trade in the renewable energy industry.

The omitted category is the balance of system equipment in relatively rich countries (i.e. countries with greater
than median GDP per capita in constant US$). Core high technology products include – blades, hub, wind
turbines, solar modules and solar cells. Balance of system products include – towers, speed changers, gears,
clutches, generators, rectifiers, inverters and anemometers

Data Appendix


Data source: We have built the data from four sources. The data on US imports is taken
from Robert Feenstra’s trade database (1989-2006), supplemented with data directly from the
USITC online database for years 2007 through 2010. The FDI data is taken from US Bureau
of Economic Analysis. Country-specific data on GDP, and electricity from renewable
sources, are from the World Bank database. Price indices have been taken for deflation of
import data taken from US Bureau of Labour Statistics.

Commodity trade data: We use general imports (i.e. imports as they come off the dock in the
US) reported in US$, and convert these to constant US 2000$ using the US Import Price
Index for all commodities except petroleum (year 2000=100). The 10-digit HTS
classification has been revised several times over the time-period of our analysis, and some of
our high-tech core products have different codes over time. To address this, we have used the
concordance of old obsolete HTS codes with new HTS codes from Pierce and Schott (2009).
For example, code 8502300000 for “other generator sets” included wind-powered generators
until 1995, but since 1996 a new code of 8502310000 was adopted exclusively for “wind-
powered generators”. The details of the obsolete codes for each of the 27 products are listed
in Table A1 at the end.

US FDI data: USBEA data by country by industry (by SIC classification for 1988-98 and by
NAICS classification 1999-2009) for the 22 year period 1988-2009. The data in million US
dollars is converted to constant US 2000$ million using the Export Price Index.

Country-specific factors (World Bank database and IMF):
GDP per capita and GDP: The gross domestic product per capita and GDP (both at constant
2000 US $) are taken from the World Bank database. However, since the data for Taiwan is
not available in the World Bank database, we have used the IMF database in for the current
US dollar values of these variables. Using Taiwan’s GDP deflator (IMF database) we
compute the constant US$ values of annual GDP and GDP per capita (base year 2000).

RenewElec: We calculate the annual electricity production from wind, solar, geothermal, and
biomass sources of each country as the residual of the total electricity production less
electricity generated from coal, hydro, oil, and natural gas.

Our final data panel is unbalanced with missing data on sector-specific US FDI, as well as
electricity from renewable sources. According to the US BEA, some of the US FDI data by
country and industry level are withheld to avoid disclosure of data of certain companies. For
Taiwan we do not have data on renewable energy, while for Singapore electricity generated
from wind/ solar/ biomass/ geothermal is zero.
