     US.   Inflation, Labor's Share, and The Natural Rate of Unemployment


                                  ABSTRACT

     The Phillips curve was init ally formulated as a relationship between the

rate of       change and unemployment, yet what matters for stabilization

policy is the rate of inflation, not the rate of wage change.        This paper

provides new estimates of Phillips curves for both prices and wages extending

over the full 1954-87 period and several sub-periods.

     The most striking result in the paper is that wage changes do not

contribute statistically to the explanation of inflation.       Deviations   in the

growth of labor cost from the path of inflation cause changes in labor's

income share, and changes in the profit share in the opposite direction, but

do not feed back to the inflation rate.   Additional   findings are that the U.

S. natural unemployment   is still 6 percent, with no decline in the 1980a in

response to the reversal of the demographic shifts that had raised the natural

rate in the 1960s and l970s.   The U. S. inflation process is stable, with no

evidence of structural shifts over the 1954-87 period.     But the wage process

is not stable: low rates of wage change in 1981-87 cannot be accurately

predicted by wage equations estimated through 1980.     Rather than representing

a "new regime," wage behavior in the l980s is the outcome of a longer-term

process.   The l980s have witnessed a substantial decline in labor's income

share that partly reverses the even larger increase in labor's share that

occurred between 1965 and 1978.

                             I. Introduction
     The Phillips Curve' relationship between U. S. wage and price changes on
the one hand, and the unemployment rate on the other hand, was a central topic
of academic interest in the 1960s nd early l970s, but drifted into the
background in the past decade as the "new—classical" research agenda took center
stage. Now, in the late [980s, the concerns of policyrnakers around the world
require that academics reexamine the behavior of U. S. wage and price behavior,
on which the fate of the worldwide economic recovery may hinge. The link
between U. S. wage and price behavior and worldwide prosperity is direct: any
sustained acceleration of U. S. inflation will lead to restrictive monetary policy
and higher U. S. interest rates which, given the openness of world capital
markets,      spread abroad and lead to the possibility of a worldwide recession.
           will

     Like several of the moat. appealing topics in economics, the intrinsic
interest in U. S. inflation behavior as a research topic is enriched by paradox.
One such paradox juxtaposes recent evidence that the empirical Phillips curve
has remained stable against the central role played by instability of the Phillips
curve in the original statement of the Lucas critique (Robert E. Lucas, 1976) and
in the attack leveled by the developers of the new-classical economics against
Keynesian economics (Lucas and Thomas J. Sargent, 1978>. A second paradox
emerges from the role of the empirical Phillips curve, in its natural—rate
reincarnation, as the tool by which the natural rate of unemployment is
estimated. For some time a consensus has formed around an estimate for the
U. S.   natural rate of unemployment of roughly   6   percent.' This implies the
twist that some Keynesian economists who take Phillips curve evidence seriously
are cast in the stick—in—the—mud role of arguing currently against further
                                                           U.   S. Inflation, Page   2



economic expansion on the ground that in late 1987    the actual   U.   S

unemployment     rate had declined sufficiently to reached the estimated natural rate
of roughiy   percent. Switching hats, many conservatives, particularly the pro—
             6

growth supply—siders who want full steam ahead at all times, have stolen the
traditional Keynesian expansionist pulpit by arguing against monetary restraint.
      A third paradox is that the Phillips curve was initially formulated as a

relationship between the rate of         change and unemployment, yet what
matters for stabilization policy is the rate of inflation, not the rate of wage
change. The "wage equation," the traditional centerpiece of the aggregate supply
sector of large—scale econometric models, may be redundant, misleading, or
irrelevant. If, on the one hand, price changes precisely mimic wage changes,
then the wage equation is redundant, since all that is needed to guide
stabilization policy is a Phillips curve expressed as a relation between inflation
and unemployment, with ho role for wages. If, on the other hand, there are
systematic differences between the inflation rate and the growth rate of wages
adjusted for productivity change, then changes in wage growth may be misleading
as an indicator of inflation behavior, and wage equations may yield inaccurate
estimates of the natural rate of unemployment.    A  further possibility is that
these systematic differences exist yet wage changes do not make a statistically
significant contribution to the explanation of inflation behavior, implying that
wage equations are    irrelevant to the central research task of estimating the
natural rate, i.e., the scope for economic expansion.
    This paper provides quantitative results that address each of these three
paradoxes, in the form of new estimates of Phillips curves for both prices and
wages extending over the full 1954—87 period and several sub—periods. The first

paradox is addre8sed through a reexamination of the stability of the Phillips
curve, a topic of equal interest to those (e.g., William Feliner, 1979) who
believed that tight money in the early 1980s should have exerted a 'credibility
effect" that shifted the Phillip curve, and to those (e.g., George Perry, 1980)
whose analysis of wage behavior is based on "norm shifts."     The second paradox
is addressed through new empirical estimates of the natural rate of
unemployment which focus on the possible role of demographic shifts in reducing
the   U.          rate in the 1980s. The third paradox is addressed in a re-
           S. natural
examination of equations explaining wage changes as contrasted to those

explaining price changes. Do past wage changes contribute statistically to the
explanation of inflation? Is there any support for the traditional structural
interpretation of wage equations as representing labor—market behavior and of
price equations as reflecting the "mark-up" pricing decisions of business firms?
This new look at wage equations has a practical as well as a methodological
side: does the continued slow pace of U. S. wage growth (only 2.9 percent in
the year ending September, 1987) augur well for the the U. S. inflation outlook?
      The most  striking result in the paper is that wage changes do not
contribute statistically to the explanation of inflation, with the profound
implication that the aggregate supply process in the U. S. is characterized by a
dichotomy: inflation depends on past inflation, not past wage changes.
Deviations in the growth of labor cost from the path of inflation cause changes
in labor's income share, and changes in the profit share in the opposite
direction, but do not feed back to the inflation rate. The age—old structure of
Keynesian macroeconomic models which combines   structural Phillips—type wage
equations with markup—type price equations is rejected. The Phillips curve wage
                                                                        U. S.   inflation, Page   4



equation matters only for the distribution of income, and                the markup pricing
hypothesis is dead.
        Additional findings       are that the   U, S. natural unemployment is still      6

percent, with no decline in the 1980s            in response to the reversal of the
demographic shifts that had raised the naturai rate in the 1960s and                   1970s,     The
U.   5, inflation process   is stable, with no evidence of structural shifts over the
1954—87       period. But the wage process is not stable: low rates of wage change in
1981-87       cannot be accurately predicted by wage equations estimated through
1980.  Rather than representing a "new regime," wage behavior io the 1980s is
the outcome of a longer-term process. The l980s have witnessed a substantial
decline in labor's income share that partly reverses the oven larger increase in
labor's share that occurred between 1965 and 1978, Our econometric evidence
does not explain this cycle in labor's share, but it does imply that the behavior
of labor's share has lived a "life of its own," without feedback to the inflation
rate.

                           II.    Issues in the Specification
                      of Equations for Price and Wage Change


pf)jon of the Wage                 and Price   Eqpjons
        A   general specification of an equation for the rate of price change (p,) is:

        (1)       a(l4pt         b(L)wt + c(L)Xt   +   d(L)zt + et,

where lower—case letters designate first differences of logarithms, upper—case
letters designate logarithms of levels, wt is the growth rate of a wage index, Xt
is an index of excess demand (normalized so that                Xt    0 indicates the absence of
                                                                         U. S. Inflation, Page 5


excess demand), zt is a vector of other relevant variables, and et is a serially
uncorrelated error term. The vector zi includes supply shift' or 'supply shock"
variables that can alter the rate of inflation at a given level of excess demand,
e.g., changes in the relative price of energy, and all components of zt are
expressed as first differences L d normalized so that a zero value of any element
of zi indicates an absence of upward or downward pressure on the inflation rate
(hence energy prices enter as changes in the relative price of energy, not
changes in the absolute price of energy). Except for its distinction between
growth rates and log levels, which is required for the estimation of the "natural
rate' of the excess demand term Xt, (1) is a general form that can encompass
equations in non—structural VAR models or, with restrictions, can be made to
resemble traditional "structural" price and wage equations.
     The coefficients a(L), b(L), c(l4, and d(L) are polynomials in the lag
operator    and a(L) is normalized so that its first element equals unity.2 With
            L,

this normalization, the term a(L)pt can be rewritten as:

     (2a)             a(L)pt = pi       +   a'(L)pt-i, and, similarly,

     (2b)             b(L)wt          bowt + b'(L)wt-i.


Substituting (2a) and          (Zb)   into   (1), we   have a somewhat more transparent version
of the price equation:

     (3)         pe       —a'(L)pt--t + bowt + b'(L)wt-i + c(L)Xt + d(L)zt + et.


Here we see that the price equation includes not just lagged values of price and
wage change but also the current value of wage change.
     What about the wage equation? The price equation written in the form of
                                                                             U.   S. Inflation, Page 6


(3) has the startling implication that there is pq such   as a gpgrate     pg
gqppton, Equation (3) is a price equation and a wage equation at the same
time, as can be seen when (3) ie renormalized as follows:


     (4)      w,       —ll/bo)[b'(L)wt-i        pt   —
                                                         a'(Lipt-i + c(L)Xt       +   d(L)zt   +   at].

Thus, without further restrictions, the "price equation" 13) and the "woge
equation" (4) are alternative "rotations" of the same equation.
     Two main      approaches are available to identtfy separate wage and price
equations. First, different sets of        Xt   and      zt   variables could be assumed to enter
the price and wage equations. However, this is implausible a pq(ori, since any
variable relevant as a determinant of price change may also be relevant for
participants in the wage—setting process, and vice—versa for prices. Excluding
components of Xt or zt from one equation but not from the other would
represent an example of what Christopher                 Sims (1980)       denounced as "incredible"
exclusion restrictions.
     An  alternative approach is to restrict the contemporaneous coefficient on
wt in the price equation or on Pt in the wage equation, since it is highly likely
that there is a contemporaneous correlation between wt and the error term at in
(3) or between Pt and at in (4). The contemporaneous coefficient could be
restricted to a particular positive fraction, e.g. 0.3 as in Olivier Blanchard
(1986), or to zero in one of  the two equations (e.g., the wage equation in my
previous papers, e.g., 1985).3 In the estimated equations in this paper, the price
and wage equations are placed on an equal footing by excluding the
contemporaneous wage or price term from both equations, i.e.,

     (5)     Pt        a(L)pt-i + b(L)(w—S),-t            +   c(L)Xt   +   dP(L)zt +   et,     and
                                                                               U.   S. Inflation, Page      7



        (6)   (w-$)t        b'(L)(w—8)t_i +         a'(L)pi-i   +   c(L)Xi   +   d4(L)zt   +    e't,

while   an identical set of Xi and zi variables is entered into each.4 The wage
change variablea    (wt)   in (3) arid (4) have been replaced in (5) and                        (6)    by wage
change minus the change in Ii. or's average product (w—6)t, that is, the change
in unit labor cost, since two very different rates of wage change would be
consistent with the same inflation rate if offset by a difference in productivity
growth of the same amount.



                                is an interesting relationship between inflation
       Hiding inside equation (5)
and changes in labor's income share, In the notation of (5) and (6), the change
in labor's share (St) is defined as:

        (7)    St         wi   —   $t   —
                                            pi.

The effects of changes in labor's share in the inflation equation are more
transparent if (5) is rewritten in the following form, adding and
subtracting the contribution of lagged inflation, a(L)pt-i. Then we have:

       (8)     Pt        (a(L)+b(L)1pt-i          + bP(L)(w—6—p)t-i    +   c(L)Xt    + dP(L)zt + et,


which, from (7), implies       that lagged changes in labor's share are a determinant
of the rate of inflation:

       (9)    pt        [aP(L)+bP(L)]pt-i + bP(L)ASt-i          +   c(L)Xt +     d(L)zt +      et.


A   equation for the change in unit labor cost, written in parallel form to (8), is:

       (10)    (w-e)t          [a(L)+b(L)J(w—e)t-a         —   a(L)(w—O—p)t-i
                                                                U.   S. Inflation, Page   8




                                +   c(L)Xt +   dW(L)zt + ew,,


      The   effect of a change in labor's share depends on the sum of coefficients
(tb) in (8).    If that sum is zero, then wage changes are irrelevant for
inflation, meaning that the counterpart of any increase in labor's income share is
a profit squeeze rather than upward pressure on the inflation rate. If that sum
is a positive fraction between zero and unity, then an increase in labor's income
share beoomes another form of suppiy shock, ia, the as and z terms enter
symmetrically. In short, with a positive sum of bi coefficients, a change in
labor's share becomes a source of "cost push that is on an equal footing with
any other type of adverse supply shock, e.g., an increase in the relative price of
energy or any other variable that causes a positive realization of the z, vector.
However,    if the sum of the   coefficients is insignificantly different from zero,
this would imply a dichothmj between the time-series processes determining the
inflation rate and labor's share. Wage behavior would be irrelevant in
determining the inflation rate and the natural rats of unemployment, and the
wage equation would be of interest only for its description of changes in the
distribution of income.



     A simplified   version of equation (8) illustrates alternative definitions of the
natural rate of unemployment. We include only a single coefficient on lagged
inflation and restrict its sum of coefficients (n+e) to equal unity; include only a
single lagged labor's share term      and single supply shock term (zt); ignore
                                       (AS,)

the error term; and enter the excess demand term as a constant and the current
unemployment    rate (Ut):
                                                                           U. S. Inflation, Page 9




       (11)        Pt   —
                            pt-i          —   'iUi + ASt   +   5zt.


We augment the usual definit'n of the natural rate of unemployment (UZi) as
the rate consistent with steady nflation (pe pt-i), by specifying in addition
that the coefficients of changes in labor's share and of supply shocks are set to
zero   (   + 5     0), implying:


       (12)       U,           Vt/V1.



This procedure yields a single constant estimate of the no—shock' natural
unemployment rate for the full sample period. An alternative concept, the
 shock" natural rate (Utt), is obtained by taking the estimated                       and   i
coefficients     rather than setting these coefficients to zero:

       (13)       U5t          [Ye +    ASt + iiztl/Vi.

The "shock" natural rate concept states that inflation can be maintained constant
in the face of a positive contribution of the change in labor's share or of the z
vector only if policyrnakers maintain the unemployment rate equal to the quantity
on the right—hand side of (13). In Gramlich's language (1979), they must
"extinguish" the inflationary effects of the share increase or supply shock.



       The "no—shock" natural unemployment                 rate in    (12) must   be central to the
conduct of stabilization policy, as it indicates whether the current state of
demand is consistent with steady, accelerating, or decelerating inflation. In
                                                            U, S.       Inflation, Page 10


actual estimation (8) is used, with a constant term and both current and lagged
values of the unemployment rate replacing c(L)Xt. To correspond to the
 definition in   (ii) and    the sum of coefficients on the lagged price and wage
                            (12),
variables in (8) is restricted to sum to unity [(Ea,+Ebl}. The b(L)AS, and
dP(L)ze terms are included in the estimation, so that the estimated no—shock
natural rate holds constant the influence of changes in labor's share and of
supply shocks in the sample period. If these terms were erroneously omitted
from the equation, and their true net contribution during the sample period was

positive, the estimated no—shock natural rate would have an upward bias. The
estimated natural rate that emerges from this procedure is simply the coefficient
on the constant term in the equation divided by the sum of the coefficients on
the unemployment rate variable (Eci).
     If a single constant term is included in the equation, then as in (12) the
estimated natural rate is forced to be a constant for the entire sample period,
At least two methods are available to allow for changes in the natural rate. The
first is simply to enter several constant terms. A second method, used in my
own previous research (Gordon, 1982) and by Jeffrey Perloff and Michael Wachter
                 natural unemployment rate to change in response to shifts in
(1979), allows the
the demographic composition of the labor force, This method replaces the
official unemployment rate (lit) by an alternative weighted" unemployment rate
(UWt) developed by Perry (1970), which weights different demographic groups by

annual earnings. Because adult males receive a larger weight than females or
teenagers,   Ut rises less between the   1950s   and 1970s than   Ut.    The use of a
single constant term yields a constant estimated natural rate U5, and the
corresponding "demographically-adjusted" natural rate for the official
                                                              U.   S. Inflation, Page   11



unemployment concept      is   tJ   1J +           where the difference in
                                            (!J — UW,),

parentheses (filtered to eliminate its cyclical component) rises between the 1950s
and 1970s, leading to an increasing value of the natural rate concept tJDt.

                           to Econoetric Estiaation


      This   section sets out the main decisions that are made in converting the
general specification of (8) and    (10)   into the equations for price—change and
wage—change that     are estimated below. Further details on data sources and lag
lengths are provided in the notes to Table 3.
     I. Basic format. All equations express every variable other than the
excess demand variable X") as the first difference of log8. The wage variable
(W)   is the index of nonfarm private average hourly earnings adjusted for fringe

variable (P) is the fixed—weight GNP deflator.

labor cost, and labor's share are allowed to extend over 24 quarters. These long
lag distributions reflect the net effect of all factors that cause      inti
                                                                         in the
adjustment of wages and prices, including expectation adjustment, staggered
long—term wage and price contracts, and lags in communicating price changes

from one industry to another through supplier—customer relationships. In
previous work I have tested the significance of lags 13—24, and they enter
significantly in price—change equations like (8).
      3. Be                      . In pastresearchI have developed a natural
unemployment rate series through 1980 that is equivalent to the demographically—
adjusted U0t concept described above. After 1980 the series is arbitrarily

research on demographic shifts in the 1980s, This hybrid patched—together seriee
is labelled here as UQ*t and has as its "dual" a series on "natural real UN?"
which is a piecewise linear exponential trend set equal to actual real GNP in
selected "benchmark quarters!! when the actual unemployment rate is close to
U62t,     Either the difference      or the log ratio of actual to natural real

UN? can be used as a proxy for the excess demand term (LI in the theoretical

price equation, and either should give closely similar results in light of the tight
"Okun's Law" relation that connects the unemployment difference and the log
output ratio,
         Because most of my       recent research on both U. S. and   OECD   inflation has
used the log output ratio, the basic empirical results in this paper use this
concept as a proxy for Xt in (8) and (10). The accuracy of this excess demand
proxy is assessed both by entering intercept shift terms to test the maintained
hypothesis that the intercept in these equations is zero, and by measuring the
1981-87 forecasting error of these equations when the sample period is
terminated in 1980. Subsequently the significance of the intercept shift terms,
and the 1981—87 forecasting error, is reported for alternative equations that
enter directly, in place of the log output ratio, one of three unemployment
concepts; (I) the difference Ut Ut, (2) the official unemployment rate (Ut)

is labeled standard productivity; the ratio of the wage rate to standard
productivity is standard unit labor cost. A fruitful specification of the change
in standard productivity, which I have used since 1971, is a weighted average of
the actual growth rate of prod"ctivity                  (OAt)   and of a productivity growth trend
        as follows:

       (14)        et        AAt +      (1—A)$*t
                        —
                            Ott   + A(eAt   —   eAt).


This  specification replaces the single productivity variable in the general
specification of (8) and (10) ($t), with a productivity growth trend (eAt) and an
additional variable, the productivity deviation," that is, the deviation of actual
productivity growth from the growth trend (OAt — eAt).
    5. Relative Food and Ener Prices. Here, as in previous research,                            I
measure the relative price of food               and    energy by the difference between the
rates of change of the national accounts deflators for personal consumption
expenditures and for personal consumption net of expenditures on food and
energy. This variable assumes a value of zero when the relative prices of food
and energy are both constant.
       6.     Relative Foreigp Prices. As in Gordon (1985), this paper takes as                 its
measure of imported inflation the change in the price of nonfood, nonfuel
imports relative to the           GNP   deflator. In previous research this variable yielded
more stable coefficients than the effective exchange rate.
       7.                                         this point the basic inflation
                                                                   To
variable (p) has been proxied by the fixed—weight GNP deflator. Yet the
Consumer Price Index may also be relevant for wage and/or price behavior, for
                                                                   U.   S. Inflation, Page   14



instance     if consumer prices are relevant for labor supply behavior and/or are the
basis for    cost—of—living   escalators.
                                       in previous research (1982, 1985) this

term is measured as the difference in the growth rates of the Consumer Price
Index (CPI) and the fixed—weight GNP deflator.
        8.                                  The effective minimum wage (defined as       the
statutory nominal minimum wage divided by nominal average hourly earnings) is
included here, as my previous research.
     9, Tss_ p. The present paper includes the same three tax rates as my

most recent     study (1985) of   U. S.   quarterly data, the effective payroll, personal,
and indirect tax rates.       While   the latter two tax rates have generally been
insignificant in past studies, the payroll tax is an extremely important
determinant of our fringe—adjusted wage index, since the timing of jumps in total
compensation including fringe benefits            is largely dictated by the timing of
changes in the statutory payroll tax rate.
    10. Nixon Controls. The impact of the price controls imposed by the

Nixonadministratiom is assessed with a pair of dummy variables, specified to
show the cumulative displacement of the wage or price level by the controls and
the extent of its rebound after the controls ended, The definition of the two
dummy variables, listed in the notes to Table 3, is identical to that in Gordon
(1982, 1985) and Gordon—King (1982).
     11. Qp   ..itL                          Like Xt in the general specification,
our log output ratio is defined to be equal to zero when the economy is
operating with no excess demand or supply, i.e., at the natural rate of
unemployment.   Thus the basic specification suppresses the constant term. Shifts
in the constant term over the sample period are tested by alternative versions of
                                                          U. S. Inflation, Page 15


the basic equation t.hat include four dummy shift terms defined to be equal to
unity in, respectively, 1963—68, 1969—74, 1975—80, and 1981—87, and zero
otherwise.

     Figure   displays time series plots of the basic wage change and inflation

variables. Data are displayed as changes over four quarters rather than over one
quarter in order to smooth erratic movements and highlight lower—frequency
fluctuations (by way of contrast, all regression e8tunates are based on the 'raw"
data, that is, one—quarter changes). The time interval covered in the plots
extends from        to 1987:3. To allow for the 24—quarter lag distribution on
                   1948:1

prices and labor cost, the sample period of the regression estimates begins in
1954:2.
     The first feature evident in Figure 1 is the erratic nature of price and
wage fluctuations from 1948 to 1953, in contrast to the relatively smooth
behavior between 1954 and 1973. The close relationship between wage and price
changes over the 1954—73 period is particularly notable, with the wage change
index appearing to mimic the price change series plus a constant factor of about
three percent. After 1973 price changes exhibit much more volatility than wage
changes, and in addition the average excess of wage growth over price growth is
much smaller than before 1973. Wage changes are actually lower than the
inflation rate from     1983   toPart of the narrowing differerence between
                                    1987.

wage changes and inflation reflects the post-1973 slowdown in productivity
growth ($t).

     But in the 1980s wage changes have slowed even more than can be
accounted for by the productivity growth slowdown, and this has been reflected
in a shrinkage of labor's share, as shown in Figure 2.            Two indexes of   labor's
share are shown, calculated simply by cumulating the difference (w_8S_p)t and
expressing the cumulated inde on the basis 1954:2 100. The trend rate of
productivity growth (e3t) is used in preference to the actual growth rate (6At)
to eliminatethe influenceof cyclical fluctuations in productivity. Of the two
share indexes, that appearing as the lower index in Figure 2 is based on average
hourly earnings before adjustment for fringe benefits, and the upper index
includes the fringe—benefit adjustment. Thus the upper index is based on exactly
the same data as our regression equations.6
     The practical importance of the fringe benefit adjustment and of changes in
labor's share is dramatized in Figure 2. The fringe benefit adjustment cumulates
to 12 percentage points over the sample period. The fringe—adjusted share index,
after declining by   6   percentage points between   1954   and   1965,   exhibits a sharp
increase of fully 14 percentage points between 1965 and 1978, followed by a 7
point decline during 1978—87 almost back to the starting point. For the full
period   1965—87, these movements in   labor's share occur at an annual rate of one
percent, large enough for estimated wage—change equations to behave quite
differently, and to imply a different natural rate of unemployment,than
estimated price—change equations. The large movements in labor's share shown
in Figure 2 underscore the need to determine whether mainly inflation or profits
are affected. Or, as an alternative interpretation suggested above, we need to
determine whether the price and wage adjustment processes are dichotomized.

Tables

     Summary measures of       the central variables are ahown in Table            1   for
intervals extending between benchmark quarters.           Evident in this section is the
acceleration of changes in prices, wages, and labor cost between the beginning
and next—to--last period, and th ongoing deceleration of productivity growth.
The negative average value of the output ratio since 1974 parallels the positive
average value of the unemployment gap (U—U'3t) over the same period    Since
there was negtive excess demand on average after 1974, any acceleration of
inflation between 1973 and     1981   must, within the framework of our mode!, be
explained by adverse supply shifts, Also evident in Table               1   is the widening
difference between the official and Perry—weighted unemployment concepts from
the mid-1950s through the late 1970s, and the subsequent decline in that
difference (the decline continued through 1987:3, when the difference reached 1,7
percent, down from 2.7 percent in the       1974—79   interval.)
                                    the demand variables. Displayed for each
     Table 2 provides more details on
benchmark quarter are the actual and natural unemployment rate, and the
unemployment gap. While   the log output ratio is defined to be zero in each
benchmark quarter, this is not true of the unemployment gap, which generally
lags behind the log output ratio by one or two quarters. In the final quarter of
the sample period,         the unemployment gap reached zero, based on the
                     1987:3,

simple fact that the actual unemploymentrate equaled the assumed 6.0 percent
rate for the Ut natural rate concept. However, we consider it premature to
conclude that the output gap has reached zero, since the decline in the actual
unemployment  rate is so recent. For the period after 1979:3 natural output is
assumed to grow at a geometric trend rate chosen to minimize the simulation

                          IV. Regression Results

     Table 3 presents the basic regression results for the price and wage
equations correspondiog to (8) and (10), where the log output ratio is ueed as
the excess demand verieble. All equations in Table 3 are estimated over the full
sample period, 1954:2—1987:3. Six versionsare shown, the complete price and
wage equations in columns (1) and (4), respectively, and restricted versions in
the other columns that omit either lagged price change or lagged wage change as
indicated. In keeping with the view that any relevant variable could in principle
influence price PE wage behavior, we include in both the price and wage
equations all of the supply shift variables (z,),
     In the complete price equation (column 1), the sum of coefficients on
lagged inflation is almost exactly unity, indicating that theoretical presumption
of unity can be accepted. An equally important, and perhape more surprising
result, is that the sum of coefficients on the lagged labor's share variable
(w—$—p)  is insignificantly different from zero, with a 0.12 significance value on
the sum of coefficients and a 0.24 value on an exclusion test of this variable.
In parallel fashion, the labor's share variable in the basic labor cost equation in
column (4) is also insignificant, with a 0.32 significance value on an exclusion
test. The other columns in Table 3 report on alternative versions that have
lagged prices or labor cost excluded. The summary statistics indicate in columns
(2) and (3) that the fit of the price equation deteriorates much more if price is
excluded than if labor cost is excluded. Columns (6) and (6) indicate that the

     1.  Asterisks designate significance of sums of coefficients at the 5 percent
(*) and I percent (**) levels.  Plusses (.4—4-) indicate that the variable enters the
equation significantly at the 1 percent level, even thcugh the sum of coefficients is
not significant at the five percent level, reflecting a pattern of significant
positive coefficients followed by significant negative coefficients on lagged terms.

     2. The dependent variable in columns (I) through (3) is the quarterly change in
the fixed-weight GNP deflator.   The dependent variable in columns (4) through (6) is
the quarterly change in "trend unit labor coat, defined as the quarterly change in
the fringe-adjusted  LS  average hourly earnings index for the private economy
(adjusted for overtime end the interindustry employment mix) minus the quarterly
change in a productivity trend, defined as a piers-eisa linear trend of the level of
nonfarm private business output per hour between the benchmark quarters of 1954:2,
1964:3, 1972:1, 1978:4, and 1986:4,   The fringe adjusrmsnt consists of multiplying
ths Its  average hourly earnings index by the ratio in the National Income and Product
Accounts  of total rompsnsaton to total wages and salaries.   All rate-of-ohanga
variables  are expressedas annual rates, that is, as the quartarly ohangs in the
natural log rimos 400.
     3. The ooeffioienrs shown on tha first three lines are sums of coefiioisora on
six sets of lagged variables. The first is the avarage of lags 1-4, the second is
the average of lags 5-8, and so on through the sixth, variable, the overage value of
lags 21-24. This teohnique is used to conserve c:egrees of freedom and to -obtain a
smooth leg distribution without employing the polynominel distributed lag (Fob)
teohnique that has been used in previous papers (sod vhioh is now relatively
inconvenient to implement in the RATS regression program)
     4. Oesignating "0" as the current quarter, lag lengths for the other variables
ste chosen as follows:
            0-4:Output ratio, food-energy effect, all tax variables,           -
            0-I:Productivity deviation.
          1-4: All others.
These correspond to the lag lengths chosen in Gordon-King (1982) end Gordon (1985),
with two exceptions.  First, the tax variables enter with 0-4 rsthet then 1-4 to
reflect the important hump-shaped pattern of the coefficients on the payroll tax (see
comment on :4 notation above in note I). Second, the relative import price enters
with 1-4 rather than 0-3; the omission of the current term reflects the fact this
variable includes the dependent variable in its definition.

     5.  The Nixon controls "on" dummy variable, also taken from Gordon-King (1982)
and Gordon (19g5), is entered as 0.8 for the five quarters 1971:1 - 1972:3. The
"off" variable is equal to 0.4 in 1974:2 and 1975:1, and to 1.8 in 1974:3 end 1974:4,
The respective dummy variables sum to 4.0 rather than 1.0 because the dependent
variable in each equation is a quarterly change expressed as an annual rate.

fit of the     labor cost equation declines much more           if   labor cost is excluded than
if   price is excluded. These results, then, support the "dichotomy hypothesis"
that   wages do not matter            for price behavior and   vCce-vorse.

Tests   of Restrictions, Exclusions, and Stabjy

       Afull set of tests on the exclusion of the lagged price and labor cost
variables is presented in the top half of Table 4 for the full 1954—87 sample

period and alternative sub—sample periods. The tests are carried out for
equations in which price and labor cost change enter symmetrically (as in
equations      5   and    6   above), not with the transformation      in equations   (8) and (10)

that converts the labor cost or price variables into labor's share. The results
for either of the long sample periods (ending in 1987 or 1980) supports the

'dichotomy view that price changes do not depend on lagged wage changes,
while wage changes do not depend on lagged price changes. These results

supporting the "dichotomy" occur equally in alternative versions that replace the
output ratio with the various unemployment concepts discussed below in the text
accompenying Table 6. The results are much less clear—cut for the two halves of
the sample period divided in 1970—71, which is not surprising in light of the
extremely small oumber of degrees of freedom available in these shorter sub-
sample intervals.
     The bottom half   of Table  tests the same exciusion restrictions with a

richer specification, instead of restricting the lag distribution on the lagged
price and/or iabor cost variables to be constant over the full 1954—87 period, or
we allow   that lag distribution to be split into seperate 'early" and "late"
distributions (while the coefficients on all other variables remain constant over
the full sample period), an element in the specification of Gordon (1982, 1985).
The split in the lag distribution occurs in 1966:4 (as in my previous papers), and
the four columns in the bottom half of Table 4 show the results of the exclusion
test on all price and/or labor cost variables when the split is not applied at all,
is applied only to labor cost, is applied only to prices, and is applied to both.
The results confirm that labor cost does not matter in the price equation for
any arrangement of the split. However, the results are not so clear that lagged
prices do not belong in the wage equation. When the lagged price variables are
split, but the labor cost variables are not split, prices enter more significantly
than labor cost, while with both variables split the significance of prices and
labor cost winds up as a dead heat.

period,       The top half     displays significance values of       Chow   tests for structural
breaks in 1980:4 and 1970:4. The hypothesis of a structural break is rejected at
the     5   percent level in every case, although the margin is close for the complete
price equation. The bottom half             of Table    S   teats for the significance   of tha
split in the lag distribution on prices and labor cost, which now is allowed to
occur alternatively in         1966:4 and 1970:4.      The    results indicate that the split in
the lag distribution is extremely significant in the complete labor cost equation
and     in the labor cost equation that excludes lagged labor cost.                It is noteworthy
that that both of these equations include lagged inflation terms, which could be

interpreted at least in part as a proxy for the                expected rate    of inflation. I
interpret this result as at least partial support for Sargent's                 (1971) argument

that the elasticity of expected inflation to changes in actual inflation is sensitive
to the policy regime (or, more precisely, the time—series properties of the series
being forecast during the interval being               examined).    The result could also be

interpreted as indicating that the           fit of the     labor cost equations is improved
when the coefficients of the lagged inflation variables are allowed to twist after
1970    to help explain the increase in labor's share evident in Figure               2.s   The

split   does not appear        to   be important im the price equations,
                                                               supporting the view
that the split helps to explain changes in labor's share but is not en important
element in understanding the overall inflation process.


                V.     Estizating the Natural Rate of Unesploysent

        The log      output ratio series entered into all of the regression equations thus
far in the paper is constructed as the "dual" to a hybrid natural unemployment
rate series     (lJ°5t) used   in previoue research. For readers of this paper, then,
                                                            U. S. Inflation, Page 22



the natural rate series "drops from the sky," and an assessment of this series is
now overdue. Two techniques are used to provide this assessment. First,

equations   are rerun with   dummy intercept   shift terms for   1963—68, 1969—74, 1975—

80, and 1981—87, and the coefficients on these shift terms are examined for
significant values. A significant positive value would indicate that price and/or
labor cost change was fester than the equation can explain, implying an
underestimate of the natural unemployment rate, while a significant negative
value would imply the opposite. Since our hybrid natural rate series (U5t,)
assumes a 6.0 percent natural unemployment rate after 1980, the optimistic view
that the natural unemployment rate has fallen from 6.0 to perhaps 5.0 percent in
recent years would be supported by a significantly negative coefficient on the
intercept shift coefficient for 1981—87.
Coefficients on Intercept Shift Terms
    The rows of Table 6 are divided into four sections corresponding to the
equations displayed in Table 3, and are arranged in the same order but omit the
price and labor-cost equations that exclude the lagged dependent variable. Four
lines of results are displayed for eech of the four equations. The first, for the
log output ratio entered without an intercept, corresponds exactly to the
regression results displayed thus far in the paper. Three additional sets of
results are obtained by replacing the log output ratio with three alternative
unemployment variables, each entered with exactly the same lag length. The
second line in each section Ia based on the difference between the actual
unemployment rate and the hybrid natural rate concept (Ut U°tt), labelled the

unemployment   rate series, they should yield similar results. The third line in
each section is based on replacing the unemployment gap with the official
unemployment rate and an intercept term; this version forces the natural
unemployment rate (Ut) to be constant. The fourth is the Perry—weighted
unemployment rate, which yields   the demographically—adjusted natural rate series
(UDIt)   described above.
          first column in Table 6 compares the standard errors of estimate for
         The
the alternative equations. The fit of the output ratio version is always inferior
to any of the three unemployment variables, and generally more so in the labor
cost equations than in the labor—cost wage equations. The similar pattern of the
intercept shift coefficients in columns (2) through (5) for the output ratio and
unemployment gap suggests than the inferior fit of the output ratio equations
reflects short-term movements rather than long—run properties.
     Our discussion of the intercept shift coefficients begins with the top half
of Table   that refers to equations for price change. Two generalizations can be
               6

made about these coefficients. First, none of the coefficients on the output
ratio or unemployment gap is significant, whereas one shift coefficient for the
other two unemploymentconcepts is significant. In particular, in the first two
lines of the first set, for the "complete" price equation, the downward shift in
1969—74 is insignificant, while it is significant at the 5 percent level for the

other unemployment concepts. Second, the absolute value of the coefficients in
the first two lines of each set, for the output ratio and unemployment gap, tends
to be smaller than in the last two lines. This supports the view that either the
output ratio or its dual, the unemployment gap, provides a more stable indicator
of the effect of excess demand on price changes over 1954—87 than the other
                                                          U. S.   Inflation, Page 24


two concepts, the officialor Perry—weighted unemployment, rate.
     The intercept shift coefficients for the labor cost equations in the bottom
half of Table & are quite different than in the price equations, reflecting toe
marked shifts in labor's income share evident in Figure   2.   The pattern of signs
on these coefficients tends to be the opposite to the corresponding coefficients
in the price equations, indicating that these coefficients are attempting to
explain movements in labor's share that are not captured by the contribution ,f
the demand and supply variables in the equations.
     Column (6)  lists the joint significance level of the four intercept shift
terms. The significance level falls below 5 percent only in the first line in the
fourth section, for the output—ratio version of the labor cost equation that
excludes lagged inflation.

Dynamic Simulation  Errors, 1981-87
     The remaining columns of Table 6 provide summary statstice on dynamic
simulations for 1981—87 of equations estimated for 1954—80. All simulations are
dynamic in the sense that lagged price and labor cost terms are generated
endogenously. The three summary statistics are (1) the error in the last four
quarters of each 27—quarter simulation, providing a measure of the simulation's
"drift" in 1986—87; (2) the mean error (ME), indicating the overall bias of the
simulation, and (3) the simulation's root—mean—squared—error (RMSE), measuring
its overall accuracy. It is useful to distinguish between (1) and (2), since a
simulation could predict too much inflation in 1981-84 but too little inflation in
1985—87, yielding a very low error in column (2) but a large error in column (1).

     Examining  the results for the price equations in the top half of Table 6,
columne (7)—(9), three conclusions emerge. First, the first two lines for the
                                                       U. S. Inflation, Page 25



output ratio and unemployment gap have uniformly lower RMSE's than the second
two lines for the official and Perry-weighted unemployment rates. The ME data
in column (8) indicate that the latter two concepts yield positive errors (actual
inflation greater than predicted), indicating that their implied natural
unemployment rate estimates for the 1981—87 period are too low, i.e., neasure
too much  output slack.
      As might be expected in light of the post—1978 decline in labor's share

plotted in Figure 2, the equations for labor-cost change generate a different
pattern of errors than the equations for price change. Recall, however, that the
price equations are not on an equal footing with the labor cost equations, since
only the former are relevant for estimates of the natural rate of unemployment.
Corresponding to the post-1978 decline in labor's share is a consistent tendency
for the labor—cost equations to overpredict labor cost changes. In contrast, all
versions of the price equation excluding lagged labor cost janthredict inflation
after   1980.

     Further insight into these simulation results is provided in Figure 3, which
displays a four-quarter moving average of the actual path of inflation for 1981-
87 and compares it with a four—quarter moving average of the inflation rates

generated in two dynamic simulations. The first, labelled "complete equations,"
generates both lagged price and labor cost terms endogenously using the 1954—80
coefficients. The second, labelled "reduced form," omits the labor cost terms and
thus generates endogenously only the lagged inflation terms, Through 1985:2 the
two alternative simulated paths are extremely close but then diverge. From mid—
1985 to mid—1987 the complete equation overpredicts and the reduced—form

underpredicts. Intuitively, this occurs because the wage equation (which

which are omitted from the reduced form, more than overset the
underpredictionsof the reduced—form itself, In view of the substantial
movements in energy and import prices in 1986-87, which may well have had
different effects on aggregate inflation than before 1981, it is perhaps not too
surprising that the admirable 1981—85 forecasting record of the price equations
deteriorates as shown in Figure 3.

cImlitions
     Recallthat the log output ratio and the unemployment gap series are based
on the same hybrid concept of the natural rate of unemployment and thus have
the same policy implications. This leaves three natural rate series to be
compared, each of which is displayed in Table 7 for the same sub-sample
intervals as are used to define the intercept—shift variables, and in addition for
the last quarter of the sample period, 1987:3. Before the mid—1980s the hybrid
and weighted concepts are quite similar, rising from the   mid—1950s   to the   mid—

1970s, incontrast to the the official concept which remains constant. But the
hybrid and weighted concepts diverge in the mid—1980s, since the former remains
(by assumption) at 6.0 percent, while the former falls by 1987:3 to 5.4 percent.
Thus for policy decisions to be made in the late 1980s, the hybrid measure
indicates less slack in the economy, and less room for stimulative demand
policies, than   the other two measures.
     The summary data for the alternative price equations presented in the top
half of Table 6 provides some guidance for choosing among these three natural
rate concepts (recall that wage equations by themselves are not relevant for

estimation of the natural rate).   First, both the official and weighted concepts
yield at least one significant intercept shift coefficient in the 1954—87 price
equations of Table 8, indicating greater instability in the relationship between
price changes and these two natural rate concepts than is the case for the
hybrid concept. Second, and more important, using both the ME and EMSE
criteria, dynamic simulations for       are much more accurate using the
                                    1981—87

hybrid natural rate concept (and its dual, the log output ratio) than using the
official or Perry—weighted unemployment rate concepts. Both the latter two
concepts, with their estimated 5.4 percent natural unemployment rate for          mid—

1987, indicate too much slack in the economy and thus tend to generate

substantially larger ME and RMSE statistics in the 1981—87 simulations. While
the reverse pattern of simulation errors is evident in the labor cost equations,
with the hybrid measure generating larger errors, this has implications only for
labor's share, not for the natural rate of unemployment which is defined by the
criterion of constant inflation,
     Given its successful pest performance, it is interesting to examine the           -




predictions of the inflation equation for the future with the hybrid natural rate
concept.9   If we make the crucial assumption that all   supply—shift variables have
effects netting out to zero in the future, we can run dynamic simulations of the
price—change equation starting in 1987:4 for two different assumed paths of the
unemployment rate, The   first path calls for unemployment to remain at 6.0
percent forever, and the second for unemployment to decline to 5.0 percent by
1988:4 and to remain there forever, As shown in Figure 4, the 6 percent

unemployment path is consistent with steady inflation of 3.5 percent, almost
exactly the inflation rate for the four quarters ending in      1987:3,   A   steady

acceleration of inflation is implied by the 5 percent unemployment path,
amounting to 1.1 points of extra inflation after five years and 2.4 points after
ten years.
     Some may view   this modest acceleration of inflation as a small price to pay
for a reduction of unemployment by one percentage point, which would yield
roughly $100 billion per year in extra GNP at today's prices, or more than $1
trillion over the 1987—97 decade. But these proponents of demand stimulus are
obliged to indicate when, and how, the acceleration of inflation is to he stopped.
Those who would prefer a path of steady inflation can translate the 6 perceot
unemployment simulation of Figure 4 into a steady 5.9   percent growth rate of
nominal GNP, consisting of 3.5 percent inflation plus 2.4 percent for real GNP,
the latter being the growth rate of natural real GNP between 1979 and 1987.

                                VI,   CONCLUSION


     Traditionally wage equations of the Phillips curve variety are the central
element that explains inflation in large—scale Keynesian econometric models.
Price changes are specified as determined by a 'mark-up" price equation and
have little life of their own, mainly mimicking wage changes, Such a view of
the inflation process is rejected by this paper. A relatively unrestricted
equation for price change can be converted into a form in which wage changes
enter only in the form of changes in labor's share. When the labor's share
variable is statistically insignificant, as in almost all of the equations estimated
in this paper, wage behavior becomes irrelevant for inflation. Differences in      the
behavior of labor cost and inflation imply changes in labor's income share which
alter the profit share of income in the opposite direction,
                                                        U. S. Inflation, Page 29


       The paper 8180 concludes that price changes  are irrelevant for wage
changes, i.e., that both prices and labor costs live a life of their own. Here the
evidence is less clear than in the price equations; an alternative version that
allows the distribution of coefficients on lagged prices and wages to shift after
1967 indicates that either prices or wages provide an adequate explanation of
wage changes None of these equations, however, provide any substantive
explanation of the sharp increase in labor's income share during 1965—78 or its
subsequent decline. Thus the results are consistent with those who claim that
the 1980s has witnessed a "new regime" in wage formation; virtually all of our
estimated wage equations show a marked tendency to overpredict wage change
for 1981—87 on the basis of coefficients estimated for 1954—80. That is, from the
point of view of the equations, wage changes in 1981—87 have been too iow
        evidence is provided here on the causes of such a new regime in wage
       No

behavior in which labor's share has fallen, nor indeed on the causes of the old
regime in which labor's share rose from 1965 to 1978.   In fact, the new regime

may  just represent the unwinding of the old regime. It is notable that the
timing and extent of this change in labor's share parallels that which occurred
in most European countries at the same time, leading to skepticism that factors
unique to the ii. S., e.g., foreign competition, deregulation, and waning union
power, have caused the turnaround in labor's share. The parallel timing of the
U. S. and European rise and fall of labor's income share may also throw cold

water on those who have stressed unique aspects of European wage behavior as
an underlying cause of high European unemployment in the 1980s.
       However,the puzzle of an increasing and then decreasing income share of
labor is irrelevant for the central U. S. policy issue of estimating the natural
                                                         U.   S. Inflation, Page   30



rate of unemployment, the key measure the measures the amount of slack in the
economy available to be eliminated by stimulative policy measures. Since changes
in labor'scost (or labor's income share) do not contribute statistically to the
price—change equation, only that equation is required to estimate the natural
rate. The estimated price—change equations continue to confirm my "hybrid'
measure of the natural unemployment rate, which was originally constructed for
the 1954-80 period with an allowance for the influence of demographic shifts in
the labor force, but which has arbitrarily assumed a fixed natural unemployment
rate of 8.0 percent since 1980, This hybrid measure, and its 'dual" measure of
natural real      perform substantially better in simulation tests for 1981—87
               GNP,

than two alternative natural rate concepts, one estimates the natural rate at 5.4
percent for the entire postwar period, and the other which implies that the
natural rate has declined from 6.3 percent on average in 1975—80 to 5.4 percent
in mid—1987. Both the latter two concepts yield substantial underpredictiona of
the inflation rate in the        period, i.e., they imply more "slack" (i.e., excess
                            1981—87

supply) im the economy than has actually occurred. Thus, as of late 1987, there
is absolutely no basis to support the conclusion that the natural unemployment
rate has fallen below   6percent. The benign behavior of wage changes merely
reflects a decline in labor's share that has not been communicated to price
behavior.

     1.    The estimate of anatural rate of unemployment rising from 5.0 percent
in the    md—1950s to 6.0percent after the mid—1970s was first presented in
Gordon (1982, Appendix 8). This time series for the natural rate has emerged as
a consensus estimate through ts presentation in seve"al textbooks (hesidna
mine), articles in business magazines, and because the behav,or of inflation in
the 1984—83 period seemed roughly consistent with this et cal rete series.
     2. Up to this ooint, the rotation and normalization follow Biancherd
(1987), except for the dislir,rtion nere between demand and suppiy variables, and
except for our assumption that the error term :s seriatly uncorreiated.
      3. 1 have previously identifed the wage cod price equations by omitting
the current price variable in the wags equation, while allowing the coefficient on
cu"rent wages n the price equation i,) be freely estimated.
      4, Blanchard (1987) shows that mittiog the currant wage or price term
makes no difference to the estimates or goooness of fit in monthly data1 and we
have found in previous work that the same is true of quarterly data.
      5. Since my early work for the Brcokings Par.al in 1971 12, the sawpie
period for the price mark-up equation hasratealesys started in 1954:2 rather than
1954:1, because of an erratic jump n the        of price change in 1954:1 With
data revisions and the accumulation of 15 additional years of data, tb's jump is
no longer of any importance, but I maintain the 1954:2 starting data for
consistency with pest studies.
      6. These indexes do not yield precisely the same index of labor's share as
could be obtained directly from the national income and product accounts,
because (1) our cslculation is based on trend rather than actual productivity, an'
(2) our wage index refers to the nonagricultural private economy while our price
index refers to the total economy.
      7. The technique is that identical to that carried out in Gordon (1984). The
estimated growth rata of natural output is 2.37 percent per year between 1919:3
and 1987:3, substantially lower then the 2.75 percent rate estimated in (19841.
This difference entirely reflects data revisions and the accumulationof three
additional years of data, since there is no change in the estimation tachnique.
      8. The importance of the split on the inflation terms in the wage equation
also reconciles the results of this paper with those of Gordon (1982), which
supported a strong role for prices in the wage equation but displayed only
equations in which the lag distribution on prices was split in 1966:4.

     9. Here we use the inflation equation appearing in Table 3, column 3,
that excludes lagged labor cost but is reestimated to incorporate the restriction
that the lagged inflation coefficients sum to unity, Virtually identical results
are yielded by the   complete price equation in Table 3, column 1.
