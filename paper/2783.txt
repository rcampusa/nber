       IMPLICATIONS OF THE ILLINOIS REEMPLOYMENT BONUS EXPERIMENTS
              FOR THEORIES OF UNENPLOYNENT AND POLICY DESION


                                ABSTRACT




     Reemployment bonus experiments offer large lump sum payments to
unemployment insurance (UI) recipients who find a job quickly. Such
experiments are underway or have been recently completed in four states. This
paper analyzes the results from Illinois and discusses the implications of the
experiments for theories of unemployment and policy design. I examine the
hazard rate of exit from unemployment and find that it is significantly higher
for the experimental groups, but only during the period of bonus eligibility.
Both labor supply and search theories of unemployment are shown to suggest a
rise in the reemployment hazard just before the end of bonus eligibility and
to suggest larger effects of the fixed amount bonus for lower income groups.
Only weak support is found mr these hypotheses, which suggests limitotious of
the models of unemployment.  Some modifications of the models are suggested.
     The experiments demonstrate the effects of economic incentives on job
finding behavior but they do not show the desirability of a permanent
reemployment bonus program. Evidence from another sample suggests that as
many as half of those who received a reemployment bonus returned to their
previous employer, so that a bonus program that pays people returning to their
last employer would provide a strong encouragement to temporary layoffs. A
discussion of UI claim filing behavior suggests that a permanent program could
well increase the frequency or promptness of filing, thus reducing any
financial advantages of a bonus program.

     Reemployment bonus experiments ate a new type of social experiment

            to find cost effective   ways of ahortening unemployment spells.   These
designed

experiments    offer large lump sum payments to people who have filed for

unemployment    insurance (UI) if they find a job within a specified period oi

time.    The first experiments were conducted in Illinois, and three others are

underway or have been recently completedJ         This paper analyzes the results of

the Illinois experiments and discusses       their implications ior theories of


unemployment and policy design.

        In the Illinois experiments, randomly assigned UI recipients were

eligible icr a large monetary bonus       if they returned to work with either theIr

old employer or a new employer within 11 weeks.        The results of the

experiments were striking; the mean spell of UI receipt was significantly

reduced by the bonus ro employees.        Even after subtracting the cost of the

bonuses,    the stare UI office appears to have saved money by shortening

unemployment    spells.   Surprisingly,   the shorter spells of those eligible for

bonus payments do not appear to have come at the expense of lower quarterly

earnings after finding a job.        The strength of these results and the

possibility    that they may affect UI policy2 indicate that the experiments

merit a closer examination.      This paper mostly discusses the results of the


     1Furrher experiments are in progress or have been recently completed in
New Jersey, Pennsylvania, snd Washington.   The experiments in New Jersey and
Pennsylvania provide job finding services to some participants as well as
bonus payments. These services include job search sssistace, training,
relocation assistance and other services. Experiments which will provide
funds for self-employment are also planned.

     2The Department of Labor is currently funding these experiments. As
stated in U.S. Department of Labor (1988) '[t]he goal is to find innovative,
cost-effective ways to reduce structural unemployment, increase economic
activity, and speed up the return of unemployed workers to productive jchs.

Illinois experiments, although the experimental design and some of the tesulrs

of the other experiments are mentioned.

     The reemployment hazards for the control and experimental groupa are

analyzed using parametric end nonparametric techniques.       The reemployment

hazard rate for those eligible for the bonus is found to be significantly

higher than the hazard for the Control Group, and this pattern is evident only

during the period of eligibility for the reemployment bonus.      However,    the job

finding rate is not found to rise appreciably just before the end of the

period of bonus eligibility.      A rise would be predicted by most labor supply

and search theories of unemployment.

     The empirical findings of the paper have additional implications        for

theories of unemployment.       Low income individuals, which are predicted by

labor supply and search theories of unemployment to respond more to the fixed

bonus amount, do not reduce their unemployment spells by more than high income

individuals.    Contrsry to some sesrch models, reemployment earnings do not

fall for the experimental groups even though they find jobs more quickly.

     Difficulties with extrapolating      the experimental results to a permanent

reemployment bonus program ste emphasized      in the later parts of the paper.     In

a sample similar to the Illinois experiment sample, it is found that about

half of those that would qualify for a bonus returned to their previous

employer.   This suggests that a reemployment bonus program would subsidize

temporary   layoffs by firms.     Furthermore, the timing of the bonus offer can

lead to strong incentives for individuals to prolong unemployment or to file

for UI when it would not otherwise be worthwhile.       Either outcome would

greatly reduce the desirability of a bonus program.      Other difficulties    with a

bonus program such as displacement affects are also discussed.
      The next two sections set the stage for the remainder of the paper.

Section 2 summarizes the design of the Illinois experiments and their results,

while Section    3   describes theories of unemployment that give predictions about

the effects of a reemployment bonus.             The hazard rate of exit from the UI

rolls is examined nonparametricaily         and then parametrically with controls for

other variables      in Section   4.   Section    5   examines the effects of the


experiments on different      income groups.          To check the validity of the


experiments,     Section 6 considers the possibility that the results are spurious

Hawthorne or placebo effects.          Some implications of the experiments for 'abor

Section 8 discusses problems with extrapolating              the experimental results to a

permanent    reemployment bonus program.          Section 9 offers some closing comments

and   conclusions.



            2.   A Summary of the Illinois Experiments and Their Results



       The Illinois experiments were directed by Robert Spiegelman and Steven

1oodbury of the Upjohn Institute and a complete description of the experiments

and an excellent summary of the results can be found in Spiegelman and

                                                                  The Illinois experiments
Woodbury (1987) and Woodbury and Spiegelman (1987).

assigned those in the eligible population to one of three groups on the basis

of the last two digits of their Social Security number.               I will call the three

                                               and Employer Experiment.                The
groups the Control Group, Claimant Experiment,

Claimant Experiment gave a $500 bonus to individuals who found a job in less

than 11 weeks after filing for UI and who held that job for at least 4 months.

The Employer Experiment gave a $500 bonus to employers who hired an individual
                                            4

 less than Il weeks after the individual filed for UI and who employed tEa

 individual for at least 4 months afterwards.3

        The eligible population    that was randomly assignd to one of the three

groups ronsisted of those who satisfied three requirements.          First, they hed

to file a monetarily eligible initial claim       (i.e.   they h.: to satisfy base

period earnings requirements, and not file a transitional, additional or

reopened claim) for UI between July 29, 1984 and November 17, 1984.             Surh

people were eligible for 26 weeks of state regular benefits and up to 12

additional    weeks of Federal Supplemental Compensation benefits.4          Second, they

had to register with one of       22 Job Servire offices in   Northern and    Centrsl.

Illinois.     These 22 included about half of the offices in the area.          In

Illinois and many other states the unemployment       insurance offices and the

employment or job service offices are separate entities.         Two important groups

are exempted from the requirement of going to the Job Service as
                                                                 part of tha
search efforr required to receive UI.       Individuals who are members of unions

that allocate jobs through a hiring hall and individuals with a definite

recall date within 4 weeks are excluded from the Job Service requirement.

Third, they had to be between ages 20 and 54.       The 17,306 people satisfying

these three requirements were randomly assigned to one of three
                                                                groups.

        A fourth requirement (and apparently a reconfirmation      that the first and

third requirements above were satisfied) further reduced the sample to 12.101.

The final requirement was that claimants had to be
                                                   nonmonetarily         eligible


     3In both experiments, the individual had to be employed for at least 30
hours per week.

        4it was possible for a person to receive UI benefits ovet more than 38
weeks    in a benefit year if he or she received partial UI
                                                            during periods of
part time work.
                                             5

(i.e.    not have quit or been fired by their last employer,       and have satisfied

availabiliry    for work requirements)   ,   and the state UI office had to be able to

locate their records.     These screens left approximately       4000   people in each

of the three groups: the Control Croup, the Claimant Experiment and the

Employer Experiment.     The randomness of the assignment       of individuals to the

groups is supported by comparisons of the mean values of many attributes of

the groups reported in tioodbury and Spiegelman        (1987)

        Individuals who were assigned to either the Claimant Experiment or the

Employer Experiment were interviewed by a Job Service employee who explained

the bonus for which they were potentially eligible.           These individuals wete

further asked to sign an agreement to participate in the experiment.            84

percent of those assigned to the Claimant Experiment signed the agreement.

but only 65 percent of those in the Employer Experiment signed.

        The data source for the empirical work on the experiments is the Public-

Use Data File documented in Woodhury et al.         (1987).   This data set contains

demographic variables, quarterly earnings, measures of the amount and timing

of UI benefit receipt, and some demographic information.           However, only the

variables that were used in the American Economic Review paper by Woodbury and

Spiegelman (1987) are included.     Information on recall to previous jobs, and

industry or occupation are unavailable.

        Most of the analysis in the paper will center on the Claimant Experiment

in which the bonus was paid to UI recipients.         There are several reasons for

this emphasis.     The experiments in other states tend to follow the pattern of

the Claimant Experiment, so it seem likely that any permanent program would

take this form.     The Claimant Experiment is a less complicated treatment than

the Employer Experiment since the employer's cooperation ia less important.
                                           6

Thus, the Claimant Experiment      results are likely to he more pronounced which

makes their examination easier and less likely to be inconclusive because of

sampling error.

        Table 1 displays some of the major findings of the experiments.            These

findings were previously discussed      in Woodhury and Spiegelmen    (1987)   .   The

results indicate a strong effect of economic incentives on job finding

behavior.     The measures of unemployment are always weeks of UI benefIts

received.     The mean number of weeks of compensated unemployment      are lower fcc

both the Claimant Experiment and the Employer Experiment compared with the

Control Group.     Table 1 reports numbers for both the first spell of

unemployment end the benefit year (the 52 weeks following the clsim date)

Those assigned to the Clsimsnt Experiment bad 1.37 fewer weeks of unemployment

then the Control Group in the first spell end 1.15 fewer weeks in the benefit

year.     Both of these numbers are significantly different from zero in tests

with conventional sizes.      The differences between those in the Employer

Experiment end the Control Group are much smeller; .67 weeks         in the first

spell on average and .36 weeks      in the benefit year.   Only the first spelt

difference is significantly     different from zero at the .05 level.     One should

note that the means being compared are everages over the entire populstion

assigned to each of the three groups, not only those that agreed to

participate.     Therefore,   selection bias is not an issue in these comperisons.

        Line (3) of Table 1 indicates that the reductions    in weeks of compensated

unemployment corresponded to large reductions      in mean dollars of UI benefits

paid.    Even after accounting for the $500 bonuses paid which are reported in

line (5), both the Clsimsnt end Employer Experiments appear to have reduced

government expenditures.
        Even more surprisingly, rhe reduced length of unemployment does not

appear to have been achieved st the cost of lower earnings by UI recipienrs.

Tables 2 and       3   report a vsriety of earnings measures.        Lines (B) and (9) of

Table    2    indicate that the differences between the Control Croup and either of

the experimental groups in terms of mean quarterly earnings after the cod of

the first unemployment spell are not significantly different                from zero.   The

point estimates of the reemployment earnings measures are in fact higher for

the Claimant Experiment than the Control Croup.                The reemployment earnings

measures are calculated using only individuals whose spells concluded before

the relevant quarter.

        Because of the presence of several very large earnings observations,

median and trimmed mean esrnings are reported in Table               3.   The earnings

meosures      reported in lines (1) through (7) of Table 3 sre for rhe subsoripie              of

positive observations.              A significant fraction of individuals have no reported

post-UI earnings.         The different earnings measures give similar conclusions

even though the measures are estimated using different samples.5



                         3.   Theoretical Effects of the Bonus Offer




     This section describes labor supply and search theories of unemployment

and how they provide          sri   analytical   framework in which the bonus experiments

can be examined.         The short run effects of the experiments are discussed here:

it is assumed thst the experiments did not affect layoff or recall behavior of

of Illinois, then using all observations (including zeros) would bias upward

earnings (such as most of those in Table 3) would not be subject to this
source of bias.
firms or the propensity of individuals to file for Ut benefits.            This

assumption seems reasonable given that the experiments only lasted 17 weere

snd were not widely publicized, so that firms likely did not rake long terr

adjustments to the program.       The long run effects of adopting a permanent

reemployment bonus program are discussed towards the end of this paper.

     Labor supply theories such as Moffitt and Nicholson (1982) model

unemployment    in a static labor-leisure choice frarework.      An individual's

utility is an increasing function of income and unemployment, where

unemployment    is   valued because of its leisure component.    An individual can

become reemployed at any time and search behavior does not affect the

reemployment wage,       The maximization ia done subject to a budget constraint

that is altered by UI.       The period over which this constrained maximization

takes place is moderately      long, such as a year.

     The incentives of the Illinois bonus experimenta can be analyzed in this

framework.     Assume that any leisure during the period must be taken in the

first spell of unemployment.       The Claimant txperiment then raises by $bOO the

budget constraint of any person who chooses 11 weeks or less of unemployment.

Figure 1 displays the original and modified budget constraint created by the

bonus program.       The change in the budget constraint has different effects

depending on a person's location on the original budget constraint.            The

effect of the bonus on the combined population is uncertain.            If initially a

person was unemployed for 11 weeks or less, then the income effect will cause

them to lengthen their unemployment spell.

     On the other hand, if a person was originally unemployed for more than              ii

weeka, there is an incentive to reduce the unemployment spell to 11 or Lees

weeks.   Because of the discontinuity     in the budget set at   11.   weeka, many
                                         9

people will maximize their utility by receiving exactly 10 weeks of UI.6             One

muat argue informally, aa Moffit and Nicholoson do in their paper, that the

random nature of job finding leads people to cluster around this discontinuity

point.    This modification would lead to the prediction of a rising hazard just

before then end of bonus eligibility.7

        A different approach is provided by search theory.      Search theory

provides a reason other than the consumption of leisure for why an individual

might choose some unemployment.     This approach models the unemployed        as

sampling job offers until an acceptable one has been found.           This process

makes the time until the beginning of a job a random variable for a given

individual, snd simultaneously explains the determination           of the person's wage

rate.

        Using a aimplified version of the models described in Mortensen        (1986)

Mortensen    (1987) analyzes the effects of   a   reemployment bonus.     In his model,

individuals are wealth maximizing    and have a constant search intensity.           New

wage offers are assumed to arrive at a rate A0 per week when unemployed             and A1

when employed.     A wage offer w, is alwaya a random draw from a stationary

distribution of weekly wages with c.d.f. F(x).         Individuals are permanently


     6Levine (1988) simulates the effects of the bonus using four different
aeta of preferencea and finds that between one-quarter and one-half of the
sample is located at the discontinuity in the budget set. lila results might
be softened if incomplete participation were aaaumed and if preferences
conaistent with the initial diatribution of spell lengths were choaen.

       7An alternative way of examining the Illinoia experiments has been
suggested by David Card and is diacusaed in Levine (1988)     Aaaume that it is
                                                                .



costless   to reallocate unemployment during the year.  Then the Illinois
experiment should only change the behavior of those who wanted to work for
less than 17 weeks a year, since 17 weeks (approximately 4 montha) is required
to receive the bonua payment. Thus, in thia acenario the budget constraint is
raiaed by $500 if one chooses 35 or leas weeks of unemployment rather than 11
or less.

laid off from their joba at a rate            S   per week.   The unemployed receive a

weekly UI benefit b, and are eligible for a reemployment bonus

a job within the first T weeks of unemploymenr.

        Given the wealth maximization assumption, the optimal job acceptance

policy when unemployed sets a time dependent reservation wage

definition of the reservation wage then implies that at time t=0, when the

hazard rate of exit from unemployment                     is higher.         The hazard of exit from

unemployment           is just the product of the arrival rate of wage offers and the

probability of that offer being acceptable,                        i.   e.
                                                                             Ao.(lF(R)).     The only

force leading the value of unemployment to change over riae is the length of

time remaining in the eligibility period.                         Since it is unambiguously      herterto

have more weeks remaining than less, one finds that Vt >                             Vtl   implying    k
        and the hazard must be lower earlier in the bonus period than later.

Thus, the model implies that the hazard rises as an unemployment                             spell

progresses until one reaches the point where bonus eligibility ends.                                 Then,

the hazard drop discretely to a constant lower level.                             But, one cannot tell

without making additional assumptions, whether the new level of the hazard is

higher or lower than the hazard at the beginning of a spell.

        The operation of the Mortensen                  (1987) search model is clarified by the

expressions for maximal expected wealth in the different employment or

unemployment           states.        These expressions are




(3.3)                  = b +                                  +

where      =   l/(l+r)     is rhe weekly discount factor and r is the weekly interest

 rare.    These equations       indicate that expected wealth is the sum of income

received during the week and the present value of the expected end of veek

wealth.

        Most of the simulations performed by Mortensen using this model show e

sharp increase in the reemployment hazard just before the end of the               hons
eligibility period.           Thus, both the labor supply end search models predict

rise in the hazard just before II weeks.




               4.    Art   Analysis of the Hazard of Exit from Unemployment



     While Table       1    reported the effeors of the experiments on the mean length

of unemployment spells, this section anslyzes the effects of the experiments

on the entire distribution of spells.           Table 4 displays the distribution of

weeks of compensated unemployment in the first unemployment spell for the

Control Croup and the two experimentsl groups.              Table S displays the analogous

distributions       of weeks of compensated unemployment in the benefit year.8        tot

each of the three groups the size of the risk set and the number of
                                                                    spells

ending in esch week is reported.          The risk set is the set of individuals who

could potentially have their spells end in the next time intetvsl.              The number

                                                unemployment with 26 or 38
weeks is explained by the potentiel duration of benefits in Illinois
                                                                      during
this time period.  Regular UI benefits lasted 26 weeks, while Federal
Supplemental Compensation (FSC) was svailable during the early part of the
experiment and lasted up to 12 weeks. No new FSC cleims were accepted sftet

of spells ending divided by the risk set gives the empirical hazard which is

reported in Tsbles 6 snd 7.     The empirical hazsrd in week    C   is the tate at


which spells end in week t given thst they have lasted until week         t.


     The differences in the distribution of weeks of compensated unemplcvment

between the Control Croup and the experimental groups is most easily seen in

terms of rhe empirical hazard.       The Claimant Experiment hazard is shove

the Control Croup hazard especially up until and including 10 weeks.           The

difference between the Employer Experiment hazard and the Control Crcup hz:nrd

sppears to fall over time,    but no clear pattern is evident.      Cne can see Cheer

differences in Figures 2 and    3.    A pronounced even-odd effect where the hszard

is higher in odd weeks    is also apparent.     This pattern is likely explained by

the Illinois requirement that one send in a certification       form every two weeks

to receive benefits,     The certification form must list places where an

individual has looked for work, interviews, etc.       The fitst form covers the

2nd and 3rd weeks of benefits, the next form covets the 4th and 5th weeks of

benefits, and so on.     It appears that an appreciable number of people clsim an

additional week of UI thst they are nor entitled to, or do not bother to claim

the last week that they could receive.

     The differences between the experimental group hazards and the Control

Group hazard may be more easily seen in Figures 4 and 5.       These figures show

the hszsmd for two intervals.        The experimental group hazards are clearly

higher than the Control Group for weeks 0 to 10.       There is some indication nf

a higher relative hazard in the last few weeks an individual would be eligible

for the bonus payment in the Claimant Experiment.        Ten weeks of benefits would

correspond to eleven weeks after filing for benefits because of the waiting

week in Illinois.   Any tendency for the experimental group hazards        to he
                                                                        14

higher or lower than the tontrol Group hazarda is difficult                                            to aee between    Il

and 24 weeka.

        To teat the viaual impreaaiona given by Figurea 2 through 5,                                         1    perforred

several ecore teats of the null hypothesis                                          that the Control Group and

experimental hazards are the same.                                    These tests oompare one hazard to another

and have greatest power against the alternative that one hazard ia

proportionately                higher than the other.                        Tests for the both the Claimant

Experiment v. the Control Group and the Employer Experiaent v. the Control

Group were conducted.

        The teat statistics                             take the following form:

Theae teat statistics                      are discussed in Kalbileisch and Prentice (198C, pp.

102-3), except that here they are uaed to teat hypotheaea                                            about intervals of

the hazard rather than the entire hazard at once.                                          The teat is conattucted so

that if two hazards have different shapes, but neither hazard is on average

above the other, the test will not reject.    The test is very similar to the

Savage log-rank test, but is more appropriate for grouped data.

     The test statistics which are asymptotically distributed chi-square vith

one degree of freedom are reported in Table    8.   Separate tests are teported

for weeks 0-10 and weeks 11-24.    The tests indicate a sharp divergence in the

patterns of the hazards between the two intervals.     There is strong suppott

for differences between the Control Group hazard and the experimental group

hazards over the interval 0-10 weeks.    There is no support at all for a

difference over the 11-24 week interval.     I chose to end the comparisons at 24

weeks to avoid complicating   the comparison with the possible effects of

nearing the exhaustion of UI benefits.

     A difficulty with the nonparamerric hazard plots analyzed above, is that

they implicitly assume that the samples are homogeneous, i. e. that all

individuals in a given sample have the same hazard.      Random assignment means

that the distribution of heterogeneity   is the same for the three groups.       But,

it is possible that the experimental treatments interacted with differences

across individuals and caused the hazard plots to give an incorrect picture of

the true effects of the experiments on the time pattern of the hazards.       For


example, if the experimental treatments affected those with higher underlying

hazards proportionately   more, an effect of the experiments on individuals

after 11 weeks might be present, but might not be observable     in the empirical

hazard plots that do not control for such interactions.      Those with higher

hazards would be swept out of the distribution of remaining     individuals rots

quickly, thus leading one to think that the experiment had no effect after 11

weeks.
                                                        16

        This section describes hazard models which control for differencea across

individuals.        There are several addirional advantages                    to escimaring parametric

models.    Hazard models can provide estimates of the effect of an experiment on

the hazard or an interval of the hazard.                         By controlling for individual

attributes      the explained variance in the model oay be increased, thus

improving the precision of esrimared experimental effects.                           Lastly, the

interactions between individual attributes and experimental effects may

themselves be of interest.                Interactions between previous earnings and

experimental effects are examined in Section 5 using the hazard model

estimates.

        Hazard model estimates of several specifications are reported in Table                         9,


Time-varying        explanatory variables and censoring are easily incorporated in

the hazard model approach.                Formally the hazard, or exit rate from

unemployment,         1(t)   ,
                                  for   individual      i   at time t is assumed to take the

proportional hazards form.                Let       be the length of individual i's
                                                T

(4.1)           1(t) =       iim        prob(t÷h>T.t         I

                                                    h



                             A(t)exp(z.(t)'$),

where

           1(t)      is the baseline        hazard at time          t, which   is unknown,


           z.(t) is a vector of rime dependent explanatory variables for
                 individual i, and

           $   is   a vector of parameters which is unknown.

The estimation approach taken here minimizes functional                          form assumptions by

allowing    1(t)      to take any form, and by incorporating in z.(r) many

interactions between the covariares and time.                   The approach follows Prentice

and Gloeckler         (1978) , and is extensively analyzed in Meyer          (1988a) .     The

covariate coefficients $ and the baseline hazard parameters                   y(t)   are   estimated

        Table   9 reports specifications          estimated using the 8.138 people in the

Control Croup and the Claimant Experiment.                  The hazard examined is the rate at

which people end their first spell of UI receipt.                    Excluding the interactions

with time and experimental status, the explanatory variables are the log of

                                                   the log of the weekly UI

race and sex,          Ideally, one would like additional demographic variables,                  hut


they are not available on the public use tape.

        The key variables            to examine in Table   9   are Claimant Experiment     (CE)

CE.<llweeks,      and CE.week9orlO          (Spike).    The last two variables are

interactions between the Claimant Experiment dummy variable and intervals of

the hazard.       CE<l1weeks corresponds           to the interval during which       the Claimant


Experiment should be operative, and CE.week9orlO is intended to capture the

predicted rise in the hazard just before bonus eligibility ends.

        All five specifications            give similar conclusions.      The coefficient

estimate on CE.<llweeks is always positive and significant.                    It indicates that

the hazard is about 14 percent higher in the first ten weeks for the Claimant

Experiment than the Control Croup.                The point estimate of the CE.week9orlO

coefficient indicates that the Claimant Experiment hazard rises another                          8



percent relative to the Control Group in the last two weeks of bonus
                                                 18

eligibility, but the coefficient is nevet close to being significantly

diffetent    from zeto.           The Claimant Experiment coefficient is mote complicated

to interpret.     In specifications (1) and (3) one can see that the Claimant

Expetiment and Control Ctoup hazards ate indistinguishable aftet the bonus

eligibility petiod.              To assess the effect of the Claimant Experiment variable

in the other specifications one must account for the interaction terms.

Interaction terms also need to be taken into account for CE.<llweeka in

specification    (5)   .     When interaction    terma    are   included     the   total   eifects         of

the Claimant Experiment and CE.<llweeka are exttemely close to the estimates

in specification       (1)   .    The demographic variable coefficients have the expec:ed

signs, with younger workers, men and whites having higher hazards.                            The

previous earnings and UI benefit coefficients are very close (particularly

specifications    (3) through (5)) to those found in Meyer                   (1988b)

        In summary,    the Claimant Experiment is estimated                to raise    the hazard by

about 14 percent, but only during the first 10 weeks of unemployment.                                The

hazard is estimated to rise an additional 8 percent just before the end of

bonus   eligibility, but one cannot reject the hypothesis of a constant hazard.

There is little evidence of any interaction effects between the Claimant

Experiment and individual characteristics                as indicated by teats of individual

interaction term coefficients, and likelihood ratio teata of groups of

coefficients    that can be conducted with the log-likelihood values reported at

the bottom of Table 9.

   5.     Differences                    in Experimental Effects by Earnings and Benefit Levels




        One might expect that formal search or labor supply models of

unemployment would predict that those with lower earnings, or lower weekly l'I

benefit payments, would respond more to s bonus of a given dollar amount.                                             The

next few paragraphs describe theories that imply larger effects of the

experiment on low income groups.

        The effects of s reemployment bonus on different income groups csn be

predicted using the labor supply model of Aahenfelter (1980).                                          Suppose an

individual would choose to work                              h     weeks if not for the reemployment bonus.

where    h   C       h'   ,       and that the bonus requires at least                    h' weeks   of work.   For

now, ignore the effect of the bonus on those who work rore rhan h' weeks.

Accepting        the bonus will increase an individual's utility if the amount of

additional monetary compensation                              (besides the wage) required for rhis change

in weeks worked is less than the bonus amount.                                        The additional monetary

compensation can be written as




(5.1)            C(h'         ,   w, v)         R(h'   ,   w, v)    -   w•h'   -
                                                                                   E(w, v),



where R(h'       ,   w, v)           -
                                         w.h'    is the constrained excess expenditure                 function when

bonus eligibility requires h' weeks of work.                                        w is the wage rare, v is the

utility level at the unconstrained optimum, and v is the level of expenditures

at that optimum.                    All prices other than the wage rate have been suppressed.

        Equation (5.1) can be approximated using a second-order Taylor series

expansion around the unconstrained optimum                                     h.    This expansion gives the
                                                        20
                     10
approximation



                                            *2          *
(5.2)           C(h'   ,   w, v)   w(h' -h   )   /2eh



This equation implies that an individual will accept the bonua offet and

increase his leisure to h' if




(5.3)          w(h' h*)2/2eh        < $500.



Thia inequality            implies that for a given e and     h,   those with a low w are acre

likely to take the reemployment bonus, since the left-hand side of (5.3)                     is


more likely to be less than $500.                 This conclusion requires that differences

in the labor supply elasticity e across income gronps do not counterbalance

the differences            in w.   One should note that h     can be taken to be equal for

different income groups in the sample since the differences in mean weeks                    .of



unemployment are small.11

     A similar prediction of larger effects of the experiment on lower inccae

groups can be derived from Mortensen's (1987) search model.12                   One way to see

this is to assume that there is a scale parameter p                which   proportionately

shifts the distribution of wage offers and the weekly 01 benefit b.                    In other


        10See Ashenfelter          (1980,   pp. 552-553) for the derivation.     The

approximation proceeds by expanding the right-hand side of (6) around h                      to

obtain C(h'      ,   (BR/Bh-w)(h'-h ) ÷ l/2(a2R/3h)(h'-h)2, and then uses
                     w, v)

properties of the derivatives of the right-hand side of (6) with respect to
and h'.

             See Table 12 for the income group means.

        12
          The approach here follows Mortensen (1988)

words, b — 1ib' for some b' snd the c.d.f. of wage offers can he written

                        =    F(x,         Also   assume for now rhat the bonus amount
F(x,p), where F(x/p, 1)             p).

B=pB' for some B'.   Under these assumptions, the reservation wages and the

expected income functions are also shifted proportionately by          p.   This   result

can be seen by exsmining equation     (3.3)    through (3.5)   above, and it implies

that the hazard rate is the same for all income groups.           Now note that the

main empirical deviation from the shove assumptions        is that B is constant      iuc

all income groups.     b is proportional to high quarter earnings in Illincis

                                                                                    It
(except for the effect of dependents' allowances and the benefit cap).

seems reasonable to think of previous earnings as a proxy for the scale of the

wage offer distribution.    But B, the bonus payment, is a fixed dollar amount.

so that the effect of the bonus will be larger for lower income groups.              Thus.

both the labor supply and search models imply that the effects of the fixed

dollar amount bonus will be greatest for the low income groups.

     Evidence on whether this pattern is found in the experimental results is

shown in Table 10.     This table reports for a number of earnings level groups

the difference between the mean weeks of unemployment for the Control Croup

and those in the Claimant Experiment.         There is no evidence of a strong

tendency of those in lower earnings brackets to respond more to the fixed

dollar amount bonus.     The responses are remarkably similar for the different

groups except for the lowest bracket in Table 10.

                 tabulations are shown for benefit level groups in Table 11.             Cf
     Analogous

there is any effect, lower benefits should also increase the effect of the

bonus since lower benefit individuals would be giving up less in UI paxmen:s

if they took a job more quickly.      Again, there is nor a pattern in the table

in this direction.     That no effect of earnings is found is even more
                                           22

surprising when one scknowledges that earnings and benefits are correlated          arid


their efferrs should work in the same dirertion.

     Table 12 reports mean characteristics for different earnings level

groups.   The demographic variables      tend to differ across the groups as one

might predict.       However, the key variables which might be correlated with the

effects of the bonus such as aean spell length and frequency of satisfying          the

conditions for the bonus in the Control Croup, and the fraction agreeing to

participate    in the Claimant txperiaent do not differ appreciably across the

earnings groups.

     The lack of a relationship between previous eatnings and the effect cf

the bonus is also evident in the hacard model estimates reported in Tahie 9.

These estimates control for all other available individual characteristics.

The coefficients on BPE*CE and BPE*CEa<llweeks      have the expected signs, hut

are never close to being significantly different from zeta.         Thus,   the hacacd

model estimates do not provide any support fat different effects of the

Claimant Experiment an different earnings groups.        It may   be that this

hypothesis    is too subtle to detect in the data, despite having
                13
observations.




                       6.   The Possibility of Hswthorne Effects



     Since the shorter unemployment      spells and apparent cost savings of the

experiments are so striking, one might wonder if there could be a noneconomic


     13Another possible explanation for the lack of an earnings effect is the
presence of other social insurance programs which could raise marginal tax
rates for low earnings individuals. This issue cannot be tested ditectiy in
the data set, but it is not likely to be important if only 9 percent of those
on UI receive other cash benefits as suggested by Storey (1980)
                                        23

explanation for the experimental effecta.      Responses that come from the act cf

experimentation   itself rather than the treatment are sometimea called

Hawthorne effects.14    In the final report on the experiments Spiegelman and

Woodhury give two possible ways a Hawthorne effect might have appeared.          They

suggest that Job Service personnel could have more energetically tried to

place experimental   claimants.   I believe they adequately   respond to this

possibility by pointing out that the number of placements for the Control

Group and the experimental groups is the same.      Alternatively,   Hawthorne

effects could have occurred because firms and unemployed      individuals knew that

shortening unemployment   spells was the goal of the experiments and they wanted

to please the researchers.    Spiegelman and Woodbury respond that there is

already a requirement that those receiving UI search for a new job.

     The response to this second possibility seems less convincing, and an

additional possibility should he added.      Those assigned to the Claimant and

Employer Experiments had an interview with Job Service Personnel who explained

the experiments and asked individuals to sign an agreement      to participate.

Those assigned to the Control Group did not go through an analogous procedure.

Because of this extra attention,    individuals may have received the impression

that they were being observed and that their job search requirement would he

more strictly enforced or that they better not claim if they were really




     14The term Hawthorne effects comes from experiments conducted at the
Hawthorne plant of the Western Electric Company in Chicago between 1924 and
1933, The first of the experiments appeared to show that changes in the level
of illumination resulted in increases in worker productivity and job
satisfaction whether the lighting was increased or decreased.  For a critical
examination of these experiments see Franke and Kaul (1978).
                                           24

employed in some manner.15

        Despite my concern shout the possibility of Hawthorne effects,          I   think

that several aspects of the results indicate that Hawthorne effects aro rot a

serious problem.       The pattern of the hazards seen in Figures 4 and 5 and

Tables    6   and 7 show that the differences between the experimental hacards

(particularly the Claimant Experiment) and the Control Group are concentrated

in the first ten weeks when the incentive effects of the experiment ate most

relevant.       This does not fit with Hawthorne effects which should operate

throughout the entire spell.

        Furthermore, the effects of the Claimant Experiment are much larEer rhan

the effects of the Employer Experiment.         The difference   in mean weeks ci

unemployment between the Claimant Experiment and the Control Group was 1.37

weeks    in the first spell and 1.15 weeks in the benefit year compared to .68

and .36 weeks for the Employer Experiment compared with the Control Group.

The Claimant Experiment effects are two and three times as large as those of

the Employer Experiment.        Larger responses are expected because the Employer

Experiment was a much more complicated treatment that required the

participation      of both the employer and employee.    Potential employees had to

explain the details of the experiment to potential employers          for the

experiment      to work.   As previously mentioned, a much smaller fraction ci

individuals agreed to participate       in the Employer Experiment    than in the

Claimant Experiment.        In addition, only 43 percent of those assigned to tho

Employer Experiment "actively participated"        in the experiment while 83 percenr




     151f interviews with UI recipients could reduce the length of
unemployment, this would be an interesting result in its own right. This
point was emphasized to me by Martin Weitzman and has been made for Hawthorne
effects in general by Sommer (1968).
                                          25

of those sssigned to the Claimant expetiment       did,   according to a follow-up

survey described in the final report.16        Because those in the Employer

Experiment went through the same interview procedure, it seems safe to

conclude that most of the Claimant Experiment effects ate true effects tathec

than Hawthorne    effects.

     A furthet check that the experimental effects ate the tesult of the hocus

rather than the interviews with job Service personnel will come from the

Washington State Experiment.     This experiment has six experimental groups with

three different levels of the bonus and two different lengths of time by which

an individual must be reemploed.''       If one sees much latger effects for the

larger bonus amounts then these differences are the result of the bonuses

themselves and not Hawthotne effects.



                   7. Implicarions   for Theories of Unemployment




     This section examines the implication of the experiments for labor         suppi
theories and search theories of unemployment.       The results of the experiments

call into question the applicability of the standard labor-leisure model for

describing unemployment.     This model predicts a sharp rise in the hazard

around 10 weeks and larger effects for lower income groups.          Because of the

discontinuity    in the budget set at 10 weeks of UI receipt, this model predicts

a much higher reemployment hazard at and just before 10 weeks.         Thile   the

difference between the Claimanr Experiment hszsrd and that for the Control

        Labor supply models also suggest greater effects for lower income groups

as shown in Section 5.        This hypothesis is not supported by the data shown io

                                                                    The experirencol

                                                                      of

        Even though benefit yest differences ste smaller then first spell

        19Even after adjusting for the longer remaining period left on average in
 the benefit year for the experimental groups, one continues to find s tendency
 for more weeks of unemployment after the end of the first spell of
 unemployment.

leave more weeka of UI entitlement for future spells.              If one accounts   for

this problem by comparing those with first spells shorter than II weeks, one

finds that the Control Group and Claimant Experiment have the same number of

weeks of compensated unemployment after the first spell.              Cne should note chat

under the bonus experiments.        There is some evidence that thoae in the

Claimant Experiment are mote likely to keep a job once it has been located,

but there is no difference between the Employer Experiment and the Control
             20
Group.

        The experiments also have implications for search theories of

unemployment.       As discussed in Section      5,   a simple search model predicta

larger experimental effects for those with lower earnings, but this ia not

found in the data.        In standard search models, indi','iduala can find a job more

quickly by reducing theft reservation wage or increasing their search

intensity.        The results of the experiments suggest that changes in search

intensity hy individuals are more important than changes in reservation wages.

The earnings measures       in Tables   2   and 3 indicated that the reemployment wages

of those assigned to the Claimant Experiment did not fall relative             to those in


the Control Group even though they spent significantly less time finding a
        21
j oh.




     2074,79 percent of those in the Claimant Experiment who find a job within
11 weeks do not file for additional UI benefits within 120 days. The figute
for the control group is 73.03 percent.

     210ne might wonder if the sample is large enough to detect a drop in
earnings if it were present. This is a difficult question since it requires a
number of assumptions, but I will give a tentative answer.  First, auppoae an
individual only reduces his reservation wage by an amount that will not teduce
his total earnings over the expected lifetime of a new job. Individuals do
gain the $500 bonua amount if they satisfy the bonus requirements. The 1.37
week drop in weeks unemployed (from Table 1) then translates into a $411
                                          28

       Standard search models where an investmenr in search instantaneously

produces job offers also conflicr wirh some of rhe experimenral results.

Models like rhe one proposed by Mortensen      (1987) and described in Section 3

suggest a rapid rise in the reemploymenr hazard just before the 11th week of

unemployment.       As previously observed, rhis pattern ie nor evident io the

hazard.

      The evidence from the experiments seems to fit a search model where

choice of search intensity is important and where there is a distributed lag

in the time until the start of a new job after a given investment in search.

It   is plausible    that it would take time to arrange interviews, process

applications,   check references, and decide on who to employ, and then there

may be a delay until the job begins because of a need to schedule training,

for example.    Suppose there is a lag between an in'vstment in search and when

an individual begins a job.      Then if someone ever searches intensively, they

would do so at the beginning of their unemployment spell, since then the

investment would have a higher probability of producing a job starting before

the 11 week bonus payment cutoff.      Such a pattern of investment in seatch

could produce the hazard pattern seen in Figure 4.       The importance put on

search intensity in this model also fits with findings that people reject very




increase in earnings (assuming a $300 weekly wage) which could be balanced
against lower earninga over the life of the job. The mean life of a job can
be approximated by using the percentage of individuals who return to the UI
rolls over a four month period (26.97 %) calculated from the Control Croup.
Assuming a constant hazard of job breakup, a mean job length of 4.94 quarters
is implied. This figure is biased downward because the hazard probably
declines over time, but it is biased upward because most people change jobs
without receiving UI.  Dividing the $411 by 4.94 yields $83.2 which is 1.53
standard deviations of the difference between 1st quartet after end of first
spell earnings for the Control Croup and the Claimant Experiment. Thus, this
suggests that about 94% of the time one should see a fall in post-unemployment
earnings if it is present.

              8.   Implications of the Experiments for Policy Design




     This section describes in turn rhe possibilities of firm or worket

sttategic behavior    in response to a permanent bonus program, and the

possibility of displacement effects.     A key consideration in evaluating the

results of the experiments and their implications for policy is the potential

use of UI by firms to subsidize temporary layoffs of their employees.          Firms

seem attuned to the incentives created by UI systems as shown by work on the

effects of incomplete UI experience rating by Brechling     (1981), Topel (1983)

and others.   The experimental design attempted to exclude those likely tc be

recalled by their previous employer.     However evidence from a sample of Ut

                                                                 to have been
recipients in Missouri23 indicates that recalls are still likely

important in the Illinois sample.     To be eligible inc assignment to one of         the


three groups in the Illinois experiment, an individual had to register with

the state employment service2 (which is generally separate from the UI

office).   To receive a bonus an individual had    to find a jab   within    11 weeks.


In the Missouri data set almost half (48 percent) of those registering wirh

the employment service and finding a job within 11 weeks were recalled.           Some

characteristics    of this Missouti data set are reported in Table     11.   People


     22See U.S. Department of Labor (1975) for example. Blau (1987) provides
some evidence which seems to conflict with the conventional wisdom.

     23The recoded version of this data set is described in Katz and Meyer             (1983


     241n both Illinois and Missouri all Ut claimants are required to register
with the employment service unless they have a definite recall date or are
members of unions hiring through hiring halls.

who register with the Employment Service ate less likely to he recalled rhoo

others, hut those with the short spells needed to qualify for the bonus

payments are more likely to have been recalled.

     It     is likely that a similar    fraction of those receiving bonuses in

Illinois were recalled,25      It is also unlikely that firms' layoff and reoall

policies were changed by the Illinois expariments beoausa they lasted             aol'.' i


weeks and were not publicized.         However,   in the long run firma would adjust

their policies,    and a bonus system like that in the Illinois experiments 'aouid

be an anormous subsidy to temporary layoffs.            An employer or employee could

receive almost $1500 each year from rho state if rho system were adopted oo a

Washington Stare) but this provides some incentive ro break up valuable job

matches,     The elasticity of match breakups may be small if they are in fact

valuable.     If recalls are ineligible, oot only would it        eliminate   the subsidy

to temporary layoffs, but it might even further reduce the layoff frequency if

firma want to avoid having their employees join another firm.              In any case, if

recalls are excluded one might still see employees rotating between similar

firms.

     Another issue is raised by the high frequency of recalls in the analogous

Missouri sample.     If the Olaimant Experiment only affected half of those

assigned to the experiment because the rest were awaiting recall, then the


     25The New Jersey experiment sample had similar exclusions to Illinois and
yet 33 percent of the sample expected to be recalled. Actual recall among
those finding a job within eleven weeks was likely higher since spells coding
in recall are typically short.

     26The four month work requiriment after starting a job would limir one tO
just under three bonuses per year.
                                                  31

elasticities     of job finding behavior with respect to the bonus rust have been

almost twice as large for the remaining population.27               Finally, one shnuld

note that if recalls are excluded, a UI bonus experiment would only be

applicable to a small fractinn of the unemployed.               Only about one-third of the

unemployed receive UI, and only about one-third of this group is not
            28
recalled.

     The possibility of srrategio worker behavior would atise with the long-

run adoption of a reemployment bonus program.               It is diffioult, if not

impossible to choose a point in the unemplo;rsent spell when individuals becoce

eligible for a bonus that doer         '   .t   have important aide effects.   This problem

does not appear in the experii:      :.nts      because they are only temporary and the

problem affects experimentals and controls equally because of the

randomization.     Two   examples   froe differont atatea uill illustrate the
problem.
     The New Jersey experiment offered individuals large bonuses (initially

$1,600 on average) beginning about the seventh veek after filing for UI.                    This

bonus amount was about five weeks wages on average.               If the program were

instituted on a permanent basis in this form, it would cause people with

previously short spells to lengthen them to be eligible for this large bonus

payment.    Anyone who was planning to start a job after two weeks of UI,             could

increase his or her income (and leisure) by waiting another few weeks to be


     27A sizable fraction of those in the Olaimant Experiment did not actively
                                                                           One
participate in the experiment (maybe because it was a temporary program)                .



could make a similar argument about inflating elaaticires to account for
incomplete participatiod in the experimenra.

     28See Burtless (1983) and Blank and Oard (1981) for the evidence on the
insured unemployment rate, and Katz and Meyer (1981) icr the evidence on the
prevalence of recall among UI recipients.
                                        32

eligible for the bonus.

     The experiments in Illinois and Washington have taken the opposite

approsch of msking a person immediately eligible for the bonua aftet filing

for UI.     This choioe is likely to cause many people        to file for   UI who

otherwise would not bother.     For example, people who already have a new job

lined up may now decide it is worth filing for benefits.           deny people vait a

few weeks before filing, and many currently never do, so that many people

nould potentially adjust their behavior.         The mean rime between rhe boginning

of unemployment and filing for UI    is 4.3 weeks        in a sample of 380,000

unemployment    spells from eight atstea that I am currently examining.              Blank

and Card (1988) eatimate that 72 percent of those eligible for UI in the

Current Population Survey (CPS) during 1980-82 and 83 percent of household

heads eligible for UI in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (P510) during

1980-82 did not receive benefita.29     Even this undoubtedly miaaea many people

vith short spells or people who change jobs without unemployment who could

become claimenta if there were strong financial incentives to do so,                 The

larger number of benefit payments caused by added claimants could very well

eliminate any coat savings of a bonus program.

     A final issue about the interpretation of the experiments is the

possibility of displacement effects.     Even though those in the Claimant

Experiment found jobs more quickly, they may have done so at the expense of

other people who took longer to find jobs.         These displacement effects are an

important issue when determining the welfare effects of many labor market

policies.     The experiments in Pennsylvanis and Wsshington will try to examine


     29                                      .       .
       See Blank and Card (1988) for a d:acuaaion of the drfferences between
the CPS and PSID numbers. The population of unemployment spells in the two
surveys differ along aeversl dimensions.
                                          33

this issue by comparing tha control group to individuals in geographically

separated labor markets.    While I am skeptical of the ability of these

experiments to measure such affects given the small fraction of job chentes

affected by the axperiments.    I   plan to examine the data as they become

available.



                  9.   Some Additional   Comments and Conclusions




     The Illinois experiments show that economic incentives have strong

effects on the job finding hehoior of UI recipience.           On the other hand, che

experiments do not provide ccu"incing evidence on the suitability of a

reemployment bonus ptogcem for pecmanent adoption.       The desirability of

permanent bonus progrem would dcpend on fito and cocker strategic responsos :0

such a program.   These respuuccs right work to inccease unemployment and

increase UI payments.     Oisplscemenc effects could   .ilso   reduce the desirabilic':

of a bonus program.     In a permanent program, a larger fraction of those who

qualify for a bonus might complete the paperwork necessary to receive it.                The

numbers   in Table 1 indicate that this would drsmsricall'c reduce the cost

savings of a bonus program.

     Furthermore, any full welfare analysis of s bonus system should examine

the effect of the bonus on earnings of UI recipients.          The savings in payments

by the state UI office are just reductions in UI payments received by

individuals.   However, the ñecressed earnings of 01 recipients might well

greatly outweigh the lost benefit payments.       The numbets in Tables    2   and   3   ace

encouraging in this regard; those in the Olsimsnt Oxperiment earn several

hundred dollars more in the year following the initial claim for UI             This
                                          34

amount is much larger than the reduction in UI benefits received.

        Finally, many of the issues discussed here implicitly deal with the issns

of the design nf an optimal UI system as previously discussed by Shevell end

Weiss    (1979) and Haueman (1984) .   A permenent   bonue system is just another

pattern of payment of UI benefits over time.         Niany   of the issues discussed

here could be applied to this literature and would suggest that the dssipn of

an optimal UI system must account for incentives foc teapocacy layoffs           as    nell

as the possibility    of encouraging cc discouraging edded UI claimants.         For

example, if one were to move towards a payment scheme which provided a isrce

lump sum payment at the beginning of an unemployment spell, this aight veil

dramatically    increase the fraction of individuals who bother to file for UI

end would thus increase UI payments.
