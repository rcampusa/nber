The Shock of Falling Among Older Americans

JEL No. I1

                                          ABSTRACT

Direct medical costs associated with falls have been shown to be $34 billion in 2013, an
underestimate since full costs are not factored in. Using the 1998-2012 waves of the Health and
Retirement Study and several econometric methods to address the endogeneity of falls, this study
seeks to answer the question of how much worse physical and mental health outcomes are for
individuals who fall compared to their steadier counterparts. Results across various specifications
suggest that falling leads to lower activities of daily living, more depression, and more
psychological problems. It leads to greater probabilities of being in poor health, having heart
problems, and having a stroke. These results survive several robustness checks.

The single most serious threat she faced was not the lung nodule or the back pain. It was falling. Each year, about
350,000 Americans fall and break a hip. Of those, 40 percent end up in a nursing home, and 20 percent are never
able to walk again. –p40, Being Mortal, by Atul Gawande

I.       Introduction


According to data from the Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System (WISQARS),

the number of deaths from falls among individuals 65 years of age and older in the United States

rose from 10,227 in 1999 to 25,593 in 2013. Direct medical costs associated with falls were

estimated to be $34 billion in 2013 (CDC 2015). The National Council on Aging and other

organizations are promoting a National Falls Prevention Action Plan, yet the importance of

preventing falls among older Americans has been stressed in the past (Alexander et al. 1992). Falling

can not only lead to disability, loss of independence, and admission to nursing homes, but a stay at

the hospital after falling can bring on other ailments.1 What takes seconds to occur can lead to dire

consequences. That being said, the type of fall is important: whether the fall resulted in an injury,

for example, whether the individual fell for the first time, and the number of falls an individual has

experienced prior to the fall all play a role in the severity of the outcomes in question.


         According to the United States Census Bureau, people 65 years of age and older made up

14.5% (46,243,211/318,857,056) of the population in 2014.2 Falls among older individuals can

result in direct injury and medical costs due to the fall. They may also result in death, disability,

nursing-home admission, prolonged hospitalization, or indirect medical issues and costs (Stevens

2006; Bell et al. 2000). Direct medical care costs totaled $0.2 billion for fatal and $19.2 billion for

non-fatal fall related injuries among people over the age of 65 (Stevens et al. 2006). These figures

1 To prevent further falls, hospital staff members often keep an individual from moving around, which has adverse
effects on health (such as through bed sores or muscle atrophy, in addition to adverse psychological effects), potentially
increasing the probability of falling and of morbidity and mortality in the future. Patients who stay in bed do not use
their lungs as much, which may lead to pneumonia and lung infections (Resnick 2013). There is also the concern of
iatrogenic illnesses; for example, patients, particularly older female patients, can develop ST-elevation myocardial
infarction (STEMI) while hospitalized for a noncardiac condition (Dai et al. 2013).

reflect what patients and insurance companies pay and do not include indirect costs associated with

poor subsequent physical and mental health outcomes; thus, the full costs associated with falls

among older individuals are much higher. Figure 1 shows proposed mechanisms.


        A fall for an older individual can be a shock, as it happens so quickly and can be fatal

(Sterling et al. 2001), yet it has the potential to be relatively easy to prevent if it means providing

funding for home modification measures. Falling is not a shock in the sense that it has an

endogenous quality to it, and not all older individuals are equally likely to fall. It is a symptom of an

issue with postural stability and causes can be complex. Statistical endogeneity arises when analyzing

the effect of falling on health outcomes and mortality due to unobserved heterogeneity. Structural

endogeneity may arise as poor health may increase the probability of falling. Yet given two otherwise

identical individuals, one who falls suffers worse outcomes in the subsequent years. Estimating the

magnitudes of these outcomes employing appropriate sources of identification is the main goal of

this study. Using the 1998-2012 waves of the Health and Retirement Study and several econometric

methods, this study seeks to answer the question of how much worse physical and mental health

outcomes are for older individuals who have experienced a fall. Hazard models predicting the

probability of death after a fall are also run. Aside from estimating direct costs of falls, health

economists do not appear to have analyzed the causal effect of falls on physical and mental health

outcomes. This study seeks to fill this critical gap in the literature.


II.     Empirical Implementation
The empirical methodology begins with the following specification for predicting the probability of

falling, the number of falls, and the probability of falling and injuring oneself for individual i in

Census division d in year of survey t:3


         (1)      Fallidt = α0 + α1 Xit + μi + ε1idt


Where X is a vector of individual-level variables pertaining to gender, age, number of living parents,

race/ethnicity, education, marital status, household income, number of children, veteran status, and

Census division. Extended models include information on behavioral variables pertaining to

prescription drug use, obesity, alcohol consumption, and smoking, in addition to medical variables

pertaining to arthritis and physician use.4 This model is estimated using individual fixed effects μi,

and ε1idt is an error term. Models where the falling variable is limited to those with more than one

fall are also estimated, since it has been found that the perceived risks for those who fall only one

time tend to be exaggerated (Donald and Bulpitt 1999).5


         The following health production function is then estimated:


         (2)      Health Outcomeidt = β0 + β1 Fallidt + β2 Xidt + μi + ε2idt


Where the health outcome of interest is one of the following: good health (=1 if the individual self-

reports him- or herself as being in excellent, very good, or good health), a summary measure for

Activities of Daily Living (ADL, such as walking across a room, dressing, bathing, eating, getting out

of bed, and using the toilet), presence of heart problems, whether the individual had a stroke since

3 It is tempting to focus the analysis only on falls that result in injury, since those are the more relevant. Doing so,
however, would be problematic for at least two reasons: (1) Falling, even without injury, can affect mental health and
render a person less likely to engage in physical activity, for example, for fear of falling again, and (2) Whether someone
gets injured due to a fall is endogenous.
4 Results are robust to the inclusion of the following potentially endogenous variables: being in a nursing home,

employment, years worked, and home care. These results are available upon request. About 3% of the sample is in a
nursing home, 25% are employed, and 8% receive home care.
5 Models were run including osteoporosis (available only in 2012) on the RHS, as this may be a strong predictor of frailty

and falling in turn. These results are similar and are available upon request.
the previous survey, depression as measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies – Depression

(CESD) scale,6 a summary of psychological problems, and the presence of cancer, which can serve

as an imperfect robustness check. Linear probability models are run for all health outcomes; for

dichotomous outcomes, probit models yield similar results.


         Physical health outcomes pertaining to self-reported health, ADL, heart problems, and

stroke were chosen mainly due to the direct and indirect effects of falling on subsequent immobility

and physical inactivity, which are major risk factors for these outcomes. Mental health outcomes

pertaining to depression and psychological problems were chosen partially due to the effects of

falling on physical inactivity (strongly correlated with mental health) and partially due to the fear of

falling and realization/impression (whether or not accurate) that one’s health is deteriorating.

Moreover, the effects on physical health affect an individual’s mental health. Traumatic brain

injuries are a particular concern among older individuals who fall (Jager et al. 2000).7


         As additional robustness checks, shown in Appendix Table 3, the following models are run:

(1) lagged falls, (2) more than one fall, (3) attrition accounted for using inverse probability weighting

(IPW), as in Dave et al. (2008), and (4) pseudo falls as a falsification check.8 Models are also

estimated separately by gender, as significant differences across gender have been cited (Stevens and




6 The CESD scale, with a range from 0 to 8, measures negative mental health symptoms for the week prior to being
surveyed. Questions relate to (1) feeling depressed, (2) feeling everything was an effort, (3) having restless sleep, (4) not
being happy, (5) feeling lonely, (6) feeling sad, (7) not being able to get going, and (8) not enjoying life.
7 It can be argued that self-reported health and depression might better capture the respondent’s state at the time of

interview, since temporal precedence is clear in these cases. That being said, robustness checks which include lagged
falls are run, results of which are presented in Appendix Table 3.
8 Pseudo-falling is defined such that an individual who fell for the first time in one wave is falsely assigned falling in a

previous wave. Pseudo-falling should have no causal adverse effect on health outcomes.
Sogolow 2005), in addition to being estimated separately by marital status and age group (Appendix

Table 4).9 Appendix Table 5 presents results from nonlinear specifications for the number of falls.


         Addressing the potential endogeneity of falls is not an easy task, and the following methods

are employed in additional to the robustness checks listed above: (1) stepwise estimation, in which

covariates are gradually added to the baseline model, (2) individual fixed effects models, which

address unobserved heterogeneity but have the potential to eliminate much variation, (3)

instrumental variables (employing internal instruments à la Lewbel 2012), (4) falsification checks

using outcomes for which we would not expect to see an effect, such as cancer, and (5) propensity

score matching.


         Next, a Weibull hazard model is estimated for the probability of death.10 Hazard ratios from

the following model are reported:


                                                 (3)       λ(t) = λp(λt)p-1


Where t is time and p is a scale parameter. If p is greater than one, position duration dependence is

exhibited, suggesting that death is more likely to occur at time t given that the individual has been

alive up until time t. (Therefore dλ/dt > 0.) Results indicate that this is indeed the case, as the value

of p is 1.453.


Stepwise Estimation


To test the sensitivity of the coefficient on falling, gradually adding covariates is an appropriate

empirical strategy. Should the inclusion of individual characteristics substantially reduce the


9 All results are also robust to the inclusion of Census region x year of survey interaction terms, which may address
factors such as differences in the state of the economy across regions over time. These results are available upon
request.
10 Cox and exponential distributions are also estimated; as seen in Table 6, results are not materially affected by choice of

distribution for the hazard model.
relationship between falling and health outcomes, we can infer that these characteristics may be

driving the observed correlations. Scott and Peck (2004) have identified several factors that

determine falls that may cloud the relationship between falls and health outcomes.


Biological Factors: These include: Age: Those over age 80 are significantly more likely to fall and be

injured. (See Figures 2 and 3.) Gender: Medical expenditures for female fall patients were two to

three times greater than medical expenditures for male fall patients in 2000, even though females

only made up 58% of the elderly population (Stevens et al. 2006; Stevens et al. 2012). Number of living

parents: This variable serves as a proxy for genetic factors.


Social and Economic Risk Factors: These include race/ethnicity (Stevens and Dellinger 2002),

education, marital status (which may reflect social connectedness), income, number of children,

veteran status, and housing (whether in a nursing home and Census division). Veteran status is

included to account for the more generous VA insurance available to veterans.11


Behavioral Risk Factors: These include medication use (Lawlor et al. 2003),12 inadequate

diet/exercise (obesity), risk-taking behaviors (such as alcohol use and smoking), and employment

variables (which can arguably also be placed in the above set of factors).13


Medical Factors: These include physical disability or diminished physical fitness, the presence of

arthritis, physician use, and home care use.


11 Almost all individuals in the sample have some form of health insurance, most in the form of Medicare. Results
including insurance status, available from the author upon request, are materially unaffected.
12 Prescription drug use is associated with falls due to the side effects, particularly those relating to drowsiness (Cameron

2005). Modifying medication use can aid in reducing falls.
13 Vision loss is also associated with falls and strongly correlated with age and health (Lord et al. 2010). Vision loss,

through age-related conditions such as cataracts, age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma,
can cause falls through reduced contrast sensitivity, reduced depth perception, and reduced visual field (Steinman 2017).
Results predicting falling controlling for an extended set of covariates suggest that those with good, very good, or
excellent eyesight are 9.47 percentage points less likely to fall. Results from health outcome models that control for poor
eyesight (affecting 20% of the sample) reveal little or no difference in the coefficients of interest and are available from
the author upon request. The question is: (Using glasses or corrective lens as usual) How good is your eyesight for seeing things at a
distance, like recognizing a friend across the street? (Is it excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?)
         Models are initially run utilizing a limited, more exogenous set of covariates, which include

controls for gender, age, and number of living parents. Extended models are then run adding

race/ethnic status, education, marital status, income, number of children, veteran status, use of

prescription drugs, obesity, alcohol consumption, smoking status, arthritis, physician use, year of

survey, and Census division. Additional models are run (results not reported) with nursing home

status, employment, years worked, and home care use.


Instrumental Variables


Lewbel (2012) has devised a technique whereby internal instruments are generated when external

instruments are weak or unavailable. In this context, it is difficult to find external instruments that

pass the necessary tests.14 The technique put forth by Lewbel (2012) relies on higher order variation

as reflected by the presence of heteroscedasticity in the error term of the first-stage equation, which

is tested using a Breusch-Pagan (1979) test. The Lewbel IV procedure uses the deviations from the

means of the independent variables multiplied by the predicted residuals from the first-stage

regression as instrumental variables. In other words, it employs                                      as identifying

instruments, where X is a vector of all independent variables or a subset of them and                          is the

predicted residual from the first-stage (falling) regression. Researchers that have successfully used

this technique find the Lewbel IV results to be more plausible than ones using questionable external

instruments (Sabia 2007; Kelly and Markowitz 2009; Belfield and Kelly 2012). In this context, the

variability in falling among certain groups can be greater than that in other groups. As a result, the

heteroskedasticity that arises due to these differences provides a source of identification that can

capture an unobserved inclination toward falling.
14Several external instrumental variables were experimented with, including climate data (pertaining to heating and
cooling degree days to identify changes in falling in case an individual is more or less likely to fall under certain weather
conditions) and various spousal variables in the HRS. These instrumental variables were found to be weak, as revealed
by either low F-statistics for joint significance in the first stage or low p-values for overidentification tests, suggesting
that the instruments were not legitimately excludable from the second stage.
Propensity Score Analysis


Propensity score matching may be used to determine the average effect of the treatment (falling) on

the treated (health outcomes). The probability of being in poor health given pretreatment

characteristics is estimated, and the assumption that the effect of unobservable characteristics on the

propensity score is the same as that of observable characteristics is made. This is estimated as:




Where is the average effect of the treatment on the treated (ATT), F is a binary variable equal to 1

if the individual fell since the previous wave and 0 otherwise, H represents a health outcome, and W

is a vector of pretreatment characteristics. The propensity score, p(W), is defined as the probability

of falling given pretreatment characteristics (W). Since panel data are employed, the propensity

score is calculated using time-invariant characteristics pertaining to race/ethnicity, gender, education,

number of children, baseline healthy status (measured in 1992), and veteran status. These covariates

satisfy the balancing property in all bloacks. Mahalanobis matching is employed (Leuven and

Sianesi 2003; Mahalanobis 1936).15 Note that the propensity score matching approach assumes that

there is no other confounding factor after many covariates are controlled for (Rosenbaum and

Rubin, 1983), a strong assumption. These results should therefore be interpreted in conjunction

with several estimation strategies, such as the ones employed in this paper. A formal statistical test

for differences in coefficients between IV and propensity score matching is conducted (Clogg et al.



15 Results are not sensitive to the choice of matching method and are robust to other methods such as Kernel (with
alternative bandwidths) and radius matching.
1995); these tests generally show few differences in marginal effects using the two alternative

approaches.


III.     Data


Health and Retirement Study (HRS)

The Health and Retirement Study (HRS) is a longitudinal study conducted through the University of

Michigan that surveys a representative sample of approximately 20,000 individuals over the age of 50

in the United States, surveyed every two years. See http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu/ for more detail.

Several cohorts are available, and the HRS cohort (born between 1931 and 1941) is used in this

study. The first survey year is 1992, and the most recent one available at the time of this study is

2012. This study employs years 1998-2012, corresponding to eight waves, since questions on falling

are first asked in 1996.16 The question on falling is: Have you fallen down [since R's LAST IW MONTH,

YEAR/in the last two years]?17 If the respondent answered in the affirmative, the following two

questions are then asked: How many times have you fallen [since R's LAST IW MONTH, YEAR/in the

last two years]? and [In that fall/In any of these falls], did you injure yourself seriously enough to need medical

treatment?18


         Weighted means for HRS variables are shown in Table 1. The average percentage of falls in

the sample is 30%, with the average percentage of falls resulting in injury 9%. The sample consists

of individuals between 61 and 81 years of age, with an average age of 71. About 27% are veterans,

and 86% use prescription drugs.


16 That being said, the 1992 survey is used to construct a ‘healthy’ baseline sample. Models limited to those in good
health at baseline (1992), which represents a more exogenous but a selected sample with external validity concerns, yield
similar results (and are available upon request).
17 Since the falling question in 1996 was only asked of individuals 68 years of age and older, these few observations were

dropped. (The HRS cohort employed in this study, born between 1931 and 1941, was between the ages of 55 and 65 in
1996.)
18 Unfortunately, information on where the individual fell is not available.
WISQARS

Fatal injury data from WISQARS is based on the NCHS Vital Statistics System, while nonfatal injury

data is based on the NEISS All Injury Program operated by the Consumer Product Safety

Commission. Population estimates are obtained from the Census of Population.19 These data only

report injuries resulting in visits to the emergency room. Figure 2 shows that rates of fatal falls

among older Americans have risen from 29.39 per 100,000 population in 1999 to 57.25 per 100,000

population in 2013, a 95% increase. For nonfatal falls, the rate has risen from 4654.35 in 2001 to

5582.95 in 2013, a 20% increase (Figure 3). The WISQARS data employed in generating these

figures are for individuals 65 years of age and older over time, representing different cohorts.


IV.        Results


Table 2 shows results from regressions predicting falls and falls with injury. Results from probit and

fixed effects models are presented. Older individuals are consistently more likely to fall more often

with or without a resulting injury, as are individuals who have visited a doctor and those taking

prescription drugs. Fixed effects models reveal that the predicted probability of falling for obese

individuals is 3.55 percentage points lower, arguably suggesting that excess weight may have a

protective effect among older individuals. Appendix Table 1 sheds light on the variation in key

variables employed in the FE regressions. Transition probabilities are reported for dichotomous

variables. Given that an individual did not fall in one wave, the probability of falling in the

subsequent wave, P(Xt|Xt-1) is 21.54%. For obesity, the most likely observed transition is from a

nonobese state to an obese one. Given that an individual is nonobese, there is a 6.51% chance of

becoming obese in the next state. Given that a person is obese, there is a 14.7% chance of




19   See http://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/.
becoming nonobese. As such, there is a chance that the FE result seen in Table 2 is partially driven

by those who transit out of obesity.


           When limiting the sample to those who have fallen (Appendix Table 2), we see that obese

individuals are less likely to have injured themselves as a result of a fall. Males and African-

Americans are less likely to fall, which is consistent with the literature.


           Table 3 shows results for the effect of falling on various health outcomes. The combination

of the various methods helps in arriving at the marginal effect of falling on various health outcomes.

The first block shows results for the effect of falling on the probability of being in good health (a

self-reported health of excellent, very good, or good). The predicted probability of being in good

health is 17.19 percentage points lower for those who fell than for those who did not fall, ceteris

paribus (or 23.4% lower from a mean of 73.5% individuals in good health). This effect is attenuated

somewhat once unobserved heterogeneity is addressed in FE models; it falls to 3.9 percentage points

but remains significant. (The FE results arguably absorb more variation than intended; Appendix

Table 1 reveals that some variables have limited variation.) In order to successfully run Lewbel IV

models, heteroskedasticity must be present. The Breusch-Pagan test for Lewbel IV models reveals

heteroskedasticity to be very present, with a chi-square value of 234.29 and a p-value of

approximately zero. Marginal effects for Lewbel IV and propensity score models are strong and

significant, showing a 15 percentage point lower probability of being in good health as a result of

falling.


           Effects for the remaining outcomes generally carry the expected signs; preferred models are

the extended, Lewbel IV, and PSM models, which appropriately address endogeneity and yield

similar marginal effects. Moreover, the p-value for the difference in coefficients between IV and

PSM models shown in Table 3 suggest that there is no significant difference in coefficients for all
health outcomes. Further statistical tests for differences in coefficients between the LPM (extended)

models versus IV and PSM in turn reveal few significant differences in coefficients, suggesting that

stepwise estimation has arguably adequately addressed endogeneity, assuming that the IV and PSM

models have done so. The overidentification test for IV models suggests that the instrumental

variables satisfy the exclusion restriction, with p-values greater than 5% in all cases except for the

health outcome pertaining to psychological problems, which should be interpreted with caution.

Results from preferred specifications indicate that falling leads to 0.3517 – 0.5157 more difficulties

with activities of daily living, a 7.6 – 12.94 percentage point increase in heart disease, a 1.92 – 7.21

percentage point increase in the probability of having a stroke (although the IV coefficient is

insignificant), 0.56 – 1.0 point more depression as measured by the CESD scale (0 – 8), and a 10.14

– 18.57 percentage point increase in the probability of having psychological problems. As expected,

little effect is seen for cancer for the IV and PSM specifications. Empirically, we can see that falling

is a negative input in the health production function and one that could have adverse long-term

effects. Tables 4 and 5 for the effects of number of falls and falling with injury on health outcomes,

respectively, confirm these results.20 In Table 4, we see that overidentification tests reveal that the

instrumental variables employed in IV models are generally not legitimately excludable from the

second stage, suggesting that higher-order unobserved variation in the number of falls is correlated

with health outcomes. In contrast, these tests suggest that the instrumental variables are valid in all

cases when the endogenous variable of interest is falling with an injury, as seen in Table 5. These

results reveal that the effect of falling with an injury can be substantial.


         The results from hazard models in Table 6 are revealing. They suggest that those who fall

are about 70% more likely to die in the following wave, while those who fall with an injury are

20Appendix Table 5 shows results where a quadratic term for the number of falls is included to address nonlinearities in
the effect of the number of falls on health outcomes. These results reveal that the magnitudes of the effects at the mean
are generally larger for the nonlinear models.
approximately 83% more likely to die in the following wave. Note that the mechanism through

which the death occurred and the length of time it took (within the two years) cannot be specified.


        Results from additional robustness checks are shown in Appendix Table 3. In the first

column, falling is defined using a fall from the previous wave (two years prior). In the second

column, falling is defined for individuals who fell more than once; for individuals who fell only one

time between waves, the falling variable was assigned a value of zero. Unsurprisingly, these results

are stronger in magnitude than those shown in Table 3. In the third column, attrition in the HRS

sample is addressed using inverse probability weighting (IPW), in which individuals whose

characteristics predict higher attrition rates are given more weight in the regression. These results

are consistent with those shown in Table 3.


        Results from extended models stratified by gender, marital status, and age group are shown

in Appendix Table 4. Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, we do not see striking differences in the

magnitudes of the effects between the two categories in the various groups. Stronger effects are

found for the “not married” group for activities of daily living, heart disease, depression, and

psychological problems, pointing to protective effects of being married. Smaller effects are found

for males for heart disease and psychological problems. Only for the three sets of results shown in

bold are the differences in coefficients statistically significant at the 5% level, based on χ2 tests.


V.      Discussion


While studies have highlighted the costs of fatal and non-fatal falls among older individuals and

identified strategies to prevent falls, no prior study has identified the causal effect of falling on

morbidity. Given two otherwise identical older individuals, what effect would a fall have on health

outcomes – both physical and mental – for one person versus the other?
         Results from this study indicate that falling has substantial causal effects on subsequent

health outcomes. Using several different econometric methods to ensure the robustness of the

results, falling leads to a decline in the probability of being in good health, and an increase in the

probabilities of having heart disease, having a stroke, and having psychological problems. It is

associated with lower activities of daily living, and more depression. The magnitudes are

meaningful. For example, difficulties with activities of daily living go up by 155%, heart problems

go up by 36.5%, and depression goes up by 60% from the mean as a result of a fall. As a result of a

fall with an injury, ADL difficulties go up by 166%, heart problems go up by 46%, and depression

goes up by 58% from the mean values for these health outcomes.21


         The CDC has recommended exercise, particularly the type that focuses on balance such as

Tai Chi (Li et al. 2005; Wolf et al. 1996) as a way to prevent falls,22 particularly due to the roles that

frailty and sarcopenia (the decline of skeletal muscle tissue with age) play (Landi et al. 2012; Walston

2012). It is suggested that a fear of falling, which is likely to develop after a traumatic fall, should

not serve as a deterrent to exercise since the relationship of cardiorespiratory fitness and physical

activity with falls is unclear (Mertz et al. 2010; Scheffer et al. 2008; Vellas et al. 1997). Maintaining

eyesight, wearing comfortable shoes, installing simple equipment, and making stairs and shower

stalls more visible are other simple measures (Hafner 2014a,b), yet much preventive equipment is

not covered by Medicare (Pynoos et al. 2005; Day et al. 2002).23 Over 95% of hip fractures are

caused by falls (CDC 2015; Hayes et al. 1993), so hip protectors, sewn into undergarments, have also

21 These results are obtained from the average effects from three preferred specifications in Tables 3 and 5: extended
models, IV models, and PSM models.
22 See http://www.cdc.gov/homeandrecreationalsafety/falls/adultfalls.html.
23 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, signed into law in 2010, makes few changes to Medicare, the top five

things to know being: (1) Medicare coverage is protected since it is not part of the Health Insurance Marketplace; (2)
More preventive services are covered, including a free "wellness" visit, without a charge for the Part B coinsurance or
deductible; (3) The donut hole will be closed completely by 2020; (4) New initiatives are in place to support care
coordination, so doctors may get additional resources to ensure consistent treatments; (5) The life of the Medicare Trust
fund will be extended to at least 2029, a 12-year extension. See https://www.medicare.gov/about-us/affordable-care-
act/affordable-care-act.html. This information is continually being updated in light of political discussions surrounding
health care.
been suggested.24 Pynoos et al. (2005) stress that National Health Interview Surveys indicate that the

majority of fall injuries among older people occurred inside the house, and measure to help with

home modification, which refers to converting or adapting the environment in order to make

performing tasks easier, reduce accidents and support independent living, should be made. Figures

4a and 4b highlight how sporadic the home modification programs currently in existence across the

various states are.25 According to AARP surveys, people prefer to grow old at home (Gross 2007),

further highlighting the importance of home modification programs.


         Measures are being taken to prevent falls (Gillespie et al. 2012; Moyer 2012; Rose 2005;

Stevens 2005). The Fall Prevention Center of Excellence has as its mission to identify best practices

in fall prevention and to help communities offer fall prevention programs to older people who are at

risk of falling. (Their official website is http://stopfalls.org/.) The National Council on Aging has

made preventing falls a priority, such as highlighting the six steps one can take to prevent falls:

https://www.ncoa.org/healthy-aging/falls-prevention/. The No More Falls! Study, being

conducted by the California State Health Department, integrates fall prevention into an existing

community-based public health program for older adults. The Wisconsin Department of Health, in

collaboration with the University of Wisconsin, is assessing the effectiveness of a comprehensive

approach to preventing falls among high-risk seniors. And the CDC is currently conducting a

project to move effective interventions into practice.


         There are several limitations to this study. Self-reported falls may be underestimated in a

manner unlikely to be random (Cummings et al. 1988). The location of the fall and type of injury


24 Hip fractures were looked into for this study. While information on hip fractures is available in the HRS, information
on whether a fall resulted in a hip fracture is unavailable. Including hip fractures on the RHS in regressions predicting
falls does not materially alter the results. These results are available upon request.
25 The list of home modification programs appears to be increasing. For example, Maryland, Ohio, and Vermont did

not have programs listed in 2015, yet they did in 2016. However, a longer time series for this list does not appear to be
available.
that might have resulted from the fall are unavailable. Since panel data are employed, this study does

not answer the question of which specific changing demographic characteristics over time may be

responsible for the increasing trend in falls, which is a subject of future research. Addressing

endogeneity in this context is particularly challenging. Taken together, the empirical results obtained

using different estimation strategies in this paper show that falling is a negative input in the health

production function and one that could have adverse short- and long-term effects. With the high

economic costs associated with falling, investing in simple preventive measures and ensuring that

Medicare facilitates this should be key.

Notes: Data come from the Health and Retirement Study, 1998-2012. Number of person-year
observations is 35,319. The Within Percent is a measure of the overall stability of the variable and
would be equal to 100% for time-invariant variables. It is the normalized between weighted average
of the within percents for the various values taken on by a variable; the closer this value is to 100%,
the less variation over time there is in this variable for a given individual. The transition
probabilities of interest, P(Xt=1|Xt-1=0) and P(Xt=0|Xt-1=1), represent probabilities of
transitioning into a different state between two waves and are shown in bold. Transition
probabilities are only shown for dichotomous variables.
