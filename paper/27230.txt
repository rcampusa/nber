                                          ABSTRACT

Housing and land prices in China have experienced dramatic hikes over the past decade or two.
Moreover, housing and land prices have also become more dispersed across Chinese cities. This
paper intends to explore how housing and land market frictions may affect not only the aggregate
but also the spatial distribution of housing and land prices and hence the extent of spatial
misallocation. We first document the spatial variations of housing and land market frictions. In
particular, larger tier-1 cities receive less housing and land subsidies, compared to tier-2 and
tier-3 cities, whereas land frictions have been mitigated over time. We then embed both types of
market frictions into a dynamic competitive spatial equilibrium framework featured with
endogenous rural-urban migration. The calibrated model can reasonably mimic the price hikes in
the data. Our counterfactual analysis reveals that, in a frictionless economy, the levels of housing
and land prices would both be higher; while the housing price hike would slow down, the land
price would grow more rapidly. Moreover, the housing price would not be slow down unless
housing frictions can be largely mitigated.

1         Introduction
Over the past several decades, the world has witnessed several sizable housing booms over
prolonged periods. China --the world's factory-- has attracted global attention over the
unprecedented rapid growth in its housing market. The disproportionated rapid housing
price growth over the past decade or two dwarfs China's urbanization process. Its rural pop-
ulation drops from about three-quarters to still more than half over the same period. Given
this moderate urbanization pace, it is puzzling why China has experienced one of the most
noticeable price hikes in urban housing market. The unprecedented housing booms trigger
the government to implement regulatory policies toward mortgage finance and housing sales
to cool off the housing market even shortly after the global financial tsunami.1 In addition,
we have also observed a substantial dispersion of housing and land prices across Chinese
cities. The primary purpose of this paper is to investigate how the housing and land market
frictions affect the price growth in these markets, as well as the price dispersions across cities.
We hypothesize that the large dispersion of housing and land prices are likely attributable to
differences in local government institutions and management practices, which cause market
frictions to vary across cities.
        Table 1 presents some summary statistics of housing and land prices across a set of 287
Chinese prefectural cities during 2007-2013. The average housing and land prices in 2013
are 1.58 and 1.53 times their level in 2007, respectively. In addition, over time, the mean
level is always higher than the median level, which suggests a distribution skewed to the
right. In this paper, we develop a dynamic competitive spatial equilibrium framework that
incorporates frictions in both the housing market and the land market. Our model highlights
that land is never simply a derived demand for housing in China. The model is also featured
with endogenous rural-urban migration to mimic the rapid structural transformation process
undertaken in China. We highlight the existing frictions in housing and land markets may
affect the population distribution. Since the housing supply is relatively inelastic due to the
    1
      Based on the 2000 census, about 87 percent of Chinese households owned houses. According to the
National Bureau of Statistics of China, the total residential investment in urban areas reached nearly 57.8
trillion RMB in 2012, which is 100 times more than it was in 1998. The rising demands have led to a surge in
housing prices (as documented below). The processes of China's structural transformation and urbanization
and its migration policies and the deregulation of housing markets are summarized in Appendix A.

Chinese government's strong intervention toward land supply and the government control
over the market entrance of real estate developers. As a result, housing and land prices
may vary significantly across cities. The growth pattern of prices is mainly driven by the
improvement of manufacturing productivity over time, which generates higher incomes in
urban areas and improved housing affordability.
   To further motivate the respective frictions in the housing and the land markets, we
delineate in Figure 1 the evolution of the average market share among the top 8 housing
developers in local residential land markets from 2008 to 2013 by city tiers. On average, the
market share of these top buyers across all cities is about 60 percent, suggests that they are
likely oligopolists in local housing markets. However, they may not exercise oligopsony power
in local land markets when the government essentially controls the land. Nonetheless, such
market imperfection can result in price wedges when comparing with competitive equilibrium


                                              2
benchmarks. We also find that the market shares tend to be lower in larger cities, such as
those tier-1 and tier-2 cities, which implies housing and land markets in larger cities are
more competitive. Over time, the market share of top buyers decreased from 82.8% in 2008
to 59.4% in 2013, which is an outcome from gradual urban land and housing market reform
toward competitiveness.

   In our theoretical framework, we consider an economy that is geographically divided into
two regions: a rural area that produces agricultural goods and an urban area (city) that
produces manufactured goods (inclusive of urban services). Ongoing technological progress
drives workers away from the rural agricultural sector to the urban manufacturing sector. In
the baseline model, we assume that workers arriving in a city must purchase a house with a
down payment and a long-term mortgage. For tractability, we further assume that a house
is required for urban living, and it has no resale value. New homes are built by real estate
developers who purchase land and construction permits from the government. Our basic
framework considers only a single urban area, and then it is generalized to multiple cities.
This extension allows us to assess the contribution of the spatial differences in frictions
to changes in housing price growth rates across cities. More importantly, the multi-city
framework provides theoretical guidance to our procedure in estimating city-level housing


                                                                           3
and land frictions.
   We show that housing and land frictions vary substantially across cities. The average
friction in the housing market is about -0.23 with a standard deviation of 0.58 percent,
and the average friction in land market is about 0.32 with a standard deviation of 1.22
percent. This implies housing developers are subsidized at an amount equivalent to 23
percent of housing sales revenue but taxed at 32 percent of land purchases relative to their
competitive benchmarks. Both frictions exhibit significant variations across the cities. The
75 percentile of the housing frictions across cities are taxed at about 15 percent of housing
sales revenue. In comparison, the 25 percentile are subsidized around 45 percent of the
housing sales revenue, yielding a 60 percentage points spread. The dispersion in land frictions
is even more dispersed. Cities at the 75 percentile are taxed at a level equivalent to 63 percent
of the land sales revenue while cities at the 25 percentile enjoy a 44 percent subsidy, with a
107 percentage points spread. The spatial spread of housing friction is persistent over the
years, while the spread of land frictions drops by almost half.
   To disentangle the contributions of both housing and land frictions in driving both the
price growth and spatial dispersion of prices, we have performed various counterfactual
exercises in which we either eliminate all the frictions, or only eliminate one friction at a
time. We calibrate the model to mimic the early stages of development in China from 1980
to 2012. The 50-year projected path for China's structural transformation through 2063 is
based on the U.S. experience from 1950 to 1990. We restrict our attention to the period
from 2007 to 2013. This is because China's pre-2007 land market was not fully marketized,
and land prices were heavily regulated.
   The main findings can be summarized as follows. At the national level, the process of
structural change can account for 94.2 (94.8) percent of housing (land) price growth factor
from 2007 to 2013. In terms of the annual growth rate, the model can account for 82.4 and
81.0 percent of the changes in the data counterpart. When all the frictions are eliminated, the
growth factor of housing and land prices are about 88.1 and 162 percent of their benchmark
counterparts. Land friction exerts no role in housing prices, and thus, housing friction is
substantial in driving housing price growth. However, the contribution of each friction to
land price growth varies by year.


                                               4
   In the multiple-city case, the coefficient of variation for housing and land prices have
decreased by 30 and 15 percent, respectively, if we eliminate all the frictions. Housing
price inequality is considerably lowered when we only remove housing frictions. As for land
prices, our results suggest that land frictions amplify land price dispersion. On average,
once the land frictions are removed, the coefficient of variation of land price is about 90
percent of the benchmark level. In contrast, housing frictions tend to dampen land price
inequality. Overall, the model underpredicts the housing price ratio in 60 cities. In contrast,
it overpredicts the land price ratio in 40 cities. On average, housing and land price ratios
are about 0.95 and 1.92 times of their data counterparts, respectively.

Institutional Background

   For a typical private housing project in China, the development process includes the
following steps. In most cases, the development process starts with the transfer of Land Use
Rights (LURs) of a residential land parcel from the local government to the developer in the
residential land market. In mainland China, while local governments still retain ultimate
ownership of all urban lands on behalf of the State, enterprises (such as housing developers)
are allowed to purchase 70-year LURs for residential land parcels since the Constitutional
Amendment in 1988. In the transfer of LURs associated with a land parcel from the local
government to the developer, all future rental payments of the land parcel are included in an
initial lump-sum payment by the developer, which can be treated as the transaction price of
the land parcel. Theoretically, the transaction price is determined in a public auction/bidding
process with free competition between different developers. The buyer (developer) also needs
to pay the deed tax equaling to 3% of the total price of the land parcel, and the tax rate does
not vary with city or time during our sample period. After purchasing a residential land
parcel, the developer will hire professional contractors to plan, design, and build high-rise
residential buildings on the parcel, which typically take two to three years, and then sell the
completed dwelling units to household buyers. The transaction prices of dwelling units are
determined by local housing market conditions.
   Since land is an input of housing production, frictions that affect the housing market
will undoubtedly affect the land market. General housing and land market frictions include


                                              5
the government's intervention policies such as strict housing market cooling measures in
major cities with the purpose to curb housing price surge. In contrast, explicit subsidies
to housing developers are prevalent in small cities, especially during the stimulus period
(late-2008 to mid-2010) and the "destocking" campaign (2015-2016), such as the relaxation
of hukou restriction in those 3rd or 4th tier cities. Besides the government's intervention
policies, during the past decades, almost all the Chinese cities are experiencing continuous
urban amenity improvement. The effects of all the expected urban amenity improvements
during the development process, which typically takes two or three years, should have been
considered and reflected in the housing and land prices.
   Several frictions only affect the land market, for example, the establishment of the public
land auction/bidding process since 2002. This new arrangement substantially enhanced the
competition in the urban residential land market. Besides the legal factors, corruption in
the land markets can also be considered as frictions. Some developers can illegally benefit
from bribing corrupted local chiefs. Most of such briberies aim at lowering the acquisition
costs at land purchase (Chen and Kung (2018)).

Literature Review

   The Chinese economy has undergone many political and economic reforms since 1978. Its
rapid growth has made it the second-largest economy in the world, with especially significant
growth since 1992. There is an extensive literature studying the development of China. For
brevity, the reader is referred to Zhu (2012) for a thorough summary of the various stages of
economic development. There is a small but growing literature investigating China's housing
boom, including research by Chen and Wen (2017), Fang et al. (2015) and Wu et al. (2012,
2016). In contrast to this literature, we highlight the structural transformation of the man-
ufacturing sector as a key driver of rural migrants to the cities. There have been numerous
studies on structural transformation using dynamic general equilibrium models without spa-
tial considerations. For a comprehensive survey, the reader is referred to Herrendorf et al.
(2014). Of particular relevance, Hansen and Prescott (2002) and Ngai and Pissarides (2007)
emphasize the role of different total factor productivity (TFP) growth rates played in the
process of structural change. In our paper, the productivity gap between urban and rural


                                              6
areas is the primary driver of ongoing rural-urban migration.
    The literature on dynamic rural-urban migration is much smaller. While Glomm and
Ravikumar (1992) studies rural-urban migration as a result of higher urban productivity
due to agglomerative economies, Lucas (2004) highlights a dynamic driver of such migration,
the accumulation of human capital and hence the ongoing rise in city wages. More recently,
Riezman et al. (2012) show that trade liberalization in capital-intensive import-competing
sectors prior to China's accession to the WTO has accelerated the migration process and
capital accumulation, leading to faster urbanization and economic growth. Focusing on
China, Liao et al. (2017) find that education-based migration plays an equally important
role in work-based migration in the process of urbanization. None of these papers study
housing markets.
    In our paper, migration increases the demand for residential housing and thus affects
prices. To isolate the contribution of migration flows to housing prices, in the model, hous-
ing demand is determined only by migrants moving from rural areas to cities (the extensive
margin). This formalization contrasts with a vast literature using general equilibrium asset
pricing frameworks (e.g., Davis and Heathcote (2005)), where prices are determined by a
representative individual who adjusts the quantity of housing consumed. From the housing
supply perspective, our model emphasizes the role of government restrictions on the pro-
duction of housing units. Our model also considers the scenario that homebuyers might
have limited access to the financial market. Therefore, it connects to a vast literature that
explores financial frictions as drivers of housing boom-bust episodes (e.g., see papers cited
by Garriga et al. (2019)). In contrast to these housing papers, our paper focuses on the
economic development angle with the migration decision endogenously determined in the
model.



2     Theoretical Framework
The economy consists of two regions, urban and rural area. Time is discrete and infinite
indexed by t = 0, 1, 2.... There is a mass one of continuum and infinitely-lived workers who
initially lived in the rural area at t = 0. Workers are all identical except for the disutility


                                              7
costs of migration from rural to urban.
   Because the main issue is urbanization-related spatial misallocation associated with urban
housing and land markets, we simply the decision-making in rural areas by assuming that
the payoff from staying in the rural is exogenously given by U , which is a reservation payoff
resulting from backyard farming. Moreover, the value obtained from residing in a farm house
is normalized to zero.
   In urban areas where the main actions occur, there is a single consumption good cm
produced with the use of both capital and labor. City workers obtain utilities from con-
sumption and housing. Housing is assumed to be a necessity and satiated good for city
workers. Specifically, we follow Berliant et al. (2002), postulating that the utility function
for city workers takes the following form:
                                             
                                              u(cm ) if h  1
                                                 t       t
                              U (cm
                                  t , ht ) =                                                (1)
                                              - otherwise,


where we assume u (·) > 0 and u (·) < 0. That is, consumption is enjoyed and yield
utility u(cm
           t ) when residing in a house; without a house, a city work would be in misery

with U (cm
         t , ht ) = -. Once with a house (ht  1), a worker does not value additional

unit of houses. Thus, in the equilibrium each city worker demands for exactly one unit of
house. This structure, as pointed out byBerliant et al. (2002), helps reducing the dense set
of multiple equilibria and simplifies the analysis dramatically.
   Incumbent city residents at time t will carry a mortgage debt from purchasing a house
at time  < t, b . Let VtC (b ) represent the lifetime payoff for a worker with mortgage
debt b . The worker derives current utility U (cm
                                                t , ht ) as specified in (1) above and discounts

future payoffs at rate  by choosing between staying in the city, VtC
                                                                   +1 (b ), and returning to

the rural area, VtR
                  +1 . The worker spends wage income, wt , on consumption and mortgage

debt repayment, b r , under an exogenous mortgage interest rate r > 0. The optimization
problem for a worker that moved in  < t can thus be specified as:


                     VtC (b ) = max U (cm                 C          R
                                        t , ht ) +  max{Vt+1 (b ), Vt+1 }                   (2)
                                             
                            s.t.    cm
                                     t + b r  = wt

                                               8
2.1       Migration Decisions

A new migrant from rural to urban at time  must purchase a house at market price q .
The housing purchase is financed with an infinite consol fixed-rate mortgage that requires a
down payment at rate . In the following periods, the specified repayment is a constant d ,
which can be derived by equating the size of the loan to the present discounted value of all
mortgage payments:
                                                       
                                                               d
                                     (1 - )q h =                   )t-
                                                                       .
                                                     t= +1
                                                           (1 + r

       Given the constant interest rate, r , the constant payment is simply


                                           d = (1 - )r q h .                                               (3)


Under this simple debt structure, the loan-to-value ratio is capped by 1 - . We assume
                                               r
the mortgage contract satisfies  >            1+r
                                                    to ensure that the down payment exceeds the
mortgage payment each period. Notably, one may consider a city economy with all workers
renting houses from absentee landlords who purchase them in advance to fill the demand.
Maintaining the same housing demand structure, one may then capture this pure rental case
by setting  = r /(1 + r ), under which an agent migrating in period  signs a long-term
rental agreement paying a rent d every period based on the housing price.2 Thus, the pure
rental market can be viewed as a special case of our model.
       The optimization problem of new rural migrant to urban in period  is thereby specified
as follows:


                          VM = max U (cm               C          R
                                        , h ) +  max{Vt+1 (b ), Vt+1 }

                              s.t.     cm
                                         + p h = w + b                                                     (4)

                                                 b  (1 - )p h .


While the recursive formulation of the value function resembles that of an incumbent city
   2
    Similar to the case of resales, allowing for a one-period rental agreement would make the model intractable
because a migrant's decision would then depend on the entire path of current and future housing prices (and
hence migration flows).



                                                      9
resident, the budget constraint is modified with mortgage loan, b , added to the income side
and the housing purchase, p h , to the expenditure side. Moreover, the mortgage contract
requires a downpayment at rate , so the maximum loan to value is 1 - .
   Given the expressions for VM , and VR in (2) and (4), we can now determine the conditions
under which workers with migration cost      move into the city at time  as follows:


                                         VM -  U .


That is, a rural worker will migrate to a city if and only if the payoff from migration, namely
payoff from residing in a city net of the disutility cost of migration, is greater than from
                                             
staying in the rural area. There exists an      that solves the following locational no-arbitrage
condition and determines the cutoff level of rural workers who migrate to the city in any
given period:
                                                  
                                        VM -         =U                                      (5)

   We summarize some analytical properties regarding to the cutoff migraiton cost in the
following proposition.

Proposition 1 (Migration Decision) In each period  , there exists a unique cutoff migration
       
cost   ,   below which workers will choose to migrate to the city in  . The cutoff migration
cost is increasing in urban wage but decreasing in urban housing prices.

   Intuitively, the higher the urban wage rate or the lower the urban housing price, the more
attractive is for rural workers to migrate to urban areas.


2.2    Production

The manufacturing goods market is perfectly competitive. There is a continuum of manu-
facturing producers of mass one. Each is endowed with K0 > 0 units of capital at t = 0,
using the existing capital Kt at the begining of time t and labor Nt to produce the single
manufactured good. The production function takes a prototypical Cobb-Douglas form:

                                                  1-
                                      Yt = A m
                                             t K t Nt ,                                      (6)

                                                10
where   (0, 1) captures the capital share, Am
                                            t is an exogenous total factor productivity

in the manufacturing sector at t. Throughout the production process over time t, capital is
depreciated geometrically at rate   (0, 1), so the capital stock evolves over time according
to:
                                          Kt+1 = Kt1- It .                                     (7)

It is noted that the geometric formulation of capital depreciation improves tractability of
the analysis.
      A manufacturing firm in each period makes capital investment It and labor demand
decision to maximize its value. Specifically, given a discount factor   (0, 1), its optimization
problem takes a recursive form:

                                        1-
                  VtF (Kt ) = max Am
                                   t K t Nt - wt Nt - It + VtF
                                                             +1 (Kt+1 )                        (8)
                               It ,Nt

                                              s.t. Kt+1 = Kt1- It


where a firm's value, depending on the current state Kt , is equal to its profit flow plus the
continuation value, the discounted future value.


2.3      Government

We now turn to the supply side of the housing market. In the model economy, land is owned
and supplied by the government. Total available area of land in the city is normalized to one.
At the beginning of each period, the government determines the amount of land available for
housing developers   t    0 to the pre-existing stock of land Lt-1 , for the purpose of residential
housing construction. The aggregate law of motion for land is thus given by,


                                          Lt =   t   + Lt-1 ,                                  (9)


where the aggregate land area occupied by houses in the city cannot exceed 1 ( i.e., Lt 
1, t). Since the average house size is fixed, the law of motion for the housing stock is entirely




                                                 11
characterized by the fraction of movers, Ft , and existing residents in the city, Ht-1 :


                                     Ht = Ht-1 + Ft ,                                      (10)


Thus, Ht represents the number of houses that the government has granted permission to
build until the end of period t, which we shall for brevity referred to as the housing stock at
t.
     The government not only controls the supply of land but also charges housing developers
a housing development, or permit or leasing fee, t , in units of manufactured goods, which
determines the number of permits granted at the beginning of time t:


                                       t =  (Ht-1 ) ,                                      (11)


where  > 0,  > 0, and the average land development fee is rising over time if  > 1.
Thus, a larger number of permits granted in the past, Ht-1 , implies a higher development
fee, which captures public concern about urban congestion and issues associated with urban
sprawl.


2.4       Housing Developers

A housing developer employs construction materials Iht to build houses ht on land parcels zt
leased from the government. The production function takes a simple Cobb-Douglas form:


                                    ht = Ah             
                                          t (zt - z t ) Iht ,                              (12)


where  > 0,  > 0, 0 <  +  < 1, Ah
                                t > 0 represents housing construction technology, and

z t > 0 captures the minimum land requirement for build house. In equilibrium, z t = t zt ;
that is, the minimum land requirement is a fraction of the equilibrium amount of land
purchased by developers. The presence of decreasing returns to scale is necessary to allow
for a developer to cover the fixed cost incurred from paying for a permit.
     To circumvent the complication associated with inventories management, we assume that
each housing developer lives for only one period and is replaced by an identical developer

                                               12
upon constructing and selling the houses built over the period of time. Thus, a developer
simply decides how much land and construction materials to buy to maximize the operative
profit d
       t , whose optimization problem is specified as:


                                                     
                 d                     h
                 t = max (1 - ht ) pt At (zt - z t ) Iht - qt zt (1 + zt ) - pIt Iht ,        (13)
                       zt ,Iht



where pt represents the selling price of a new housing unit at the end of period t, qt is the land
price that a housing developer must pay to acquire the land parcels from the government,
and pht is unit cost of construction materials which is exogenously given. There are two
wedges: a housing price wedge ht governing housing market distortions/frictions and a land
price wedge zt capturing land market distortions/frictions.
    Upon receiving revenue from selling houses, the developer must pay the fixed development
fee to the government. With many identical housing developers operating in each period,
equilibrium entry (EE) pins down the number of housing developers, St :


                                              d
                                              t = t .                                         (14)



3     Competitive Spatial Equilibrium
We first formalize the definition of equilibrium in our benchmark economy with a rural area
and a urban area, then we proceed to characterize several equilibrium properties.
                                                         h 
Definition: Given exogenous parameters { t , pht , Am
                                                    t , At }t=0 and initial conditions H0 and

K0 , a competitive spatial equilibrium consists of a list of prices {pt , qt , wt }t=0 , individual

quantities {ht , ct }                                                                    
                     t=0 , a migration cutoff value { t }t=0 , a capital stock path {Kt }t=0 and

an employment vector of workers and developers {Ntm , St }t=0 that satisfies the following

conditions:

    1. Workers, manufacturing firms and housing developers all solve their optimization prob-
      lems (2), (8) and (13);

                                             
    2. There is a cutoff of mobility cost    t   pinned down by (4), with those below the cutoff
      migrating to the city;

                                                  13
  3. The number of housing developers is determined by the equilibrium entry condition
      (14);

  4. All markets clear:

       (a) land:
                                                       St zt = t ,                     (15)

      (b) housing:
                                                                              
                                   St Ah             
                                       t (zt - z t ) Iht = F ( t ) - F (      t-1 ),   (16)

       (c) manufactured goods: Dt = Yt .


It is noted that the market clearing condition of the manufactured goods is redundant by
Walras' law.


3.1    Labor Demand and Manufacture Output

Given wage rate wt and existing capital stock Kt , manufacturing firm's hires labor at the
                              Kt 
marginal product, (1 -  )Am
                          t ( Nt ) = wt , which yields a labor demand schedule as follows:


                                                              1
                                         (1 -  )Am
                                                 t
                                                              
                                    Nt =                          Kt .                 (17)
                                             wt

That is, labor demand is increasing in the existing capital stock and manufacturing produc-
tivity but decreasing in wage. Profit maximized output becomes:

                                                                   1-
                                                   1    1-          
                                Yt (Kt ) = (Am
                                             t )
                                                                         Kt            (18)
                                                         wt

depending only on the state variable. The value function can thus be rewritten as:


                          Vt (Kt ) = max Yt (Kt ) - It + Vt+1 (Kt1- It )
                                     It




                                                   14
Solving manufacturing firm's optimization and imposing steady state with constant Am and
hence Kt = Ks and Nt = Ns for all t, we have:

                                               -(1- )
                                         Ks
                               2 Am                     = 1 -  (1 -  )                 (19)
                                         Ns

Thus, we are arrived at:


Proposition 2 (Steady-State Capital-Labor Ratio) In steady-state equilibrium, the capital-
labor ratio is a constant, depending positively on manufacturing productivity.


3.2      Housing and Land

In the following, we turn to solving housing developer's optimization problem, with detailed
manipulation relegated to Appendix A.
   Housing developer's optimization is summarized by land and construction material de-

From housing market clearing condition and z t = t zt , we have construction materials gov-

Combining (22) and (23), we get:

which is a decreasing function of p and F (  ) alone.
   We now substitute (22) and (24) into land and construction material demands (20) and
(21) to obtain two fundamental relationships governing the housing-distortion augmented
net housing price, (1 - ht ) pt , and the land-distortion augmented net land price, (1 + zt ) qt :

where ht                                          and qt                1/                     are both exogenous, de-

pending only on the existing housing stock Ht-1 .
   A quick observation indicates that net housing price and net land price are both increasing
in net migration flows, F (  ). Let us put aside the dynamic general equilibrium effects
via housing evolution and migration dynamics, by focusing on temporal spatial equilibrium
                         
in which Ht-1 and        t-1   are both taken as given. Then, it can be seen that both housing
distoriton ht and land distortion zt do not have any direct impact on either net price. The
results can be summarized in the proposition below.


Proposition 3 (Housing and Land Prices) In temporal spatial equilibrium,

  1. both net housing price (1 - ht ) pt and net land price (1 + zt ) qt are rising with net
      migration flows F (  );

  2. land distortion zt has no direct impact on either net housing price or net land price;

  3. housing distortion ht has no direct impact on either net housing price or net land
      price.


   It is convenient to refer to (25) as an aggregate housing supply flow (AS) locus :

                                                                    +        +
                                                  pt = ASt (F ( t ); ht )                                         (27)


                                                               16
where F (  ) = H is the flow measure of aggregate housing supply. From Proposition 3
above, it is clear that AS is increasing in both net migration flow and housing distortion. Be-
cause net migration flow is indeed the flow of aggregate housing supply, the former property
implies that AS is upward-sloping.
   The locational no-arbitrage condition from the consumer side, on the other hand, gives
an aggregate housing demand flow (AD) schedule:

                                                       -
                                         pt = ADt (F ( t ))                                   (28)


From Proposition 1, we know that the cutoff migration cost is increasing in urban wage but
decreasing in urban housing price. Thus, AD is downward sloping, shifting upward when
urban wage rises.
   Equating AD and AS solves F (  ) and hence aggregate housing flow H , as well as the
                        
cutoff migration cost      . It is clear from the expressions above that the land market distortion
zt has no direct effect on the equilibrium housing price. Actually, the effects of land market
distortions are only in dynamic general equilibrium through the evolution of housing stocks,
the path of migration cutoffs and the intertemporal optimization of households. In temporal
spatial equilibrium, we can thus establish:


Proposition 4 (Housing and Migration) In temporal spatial equilibrium, an increase in
housing distortion ht leads to:

  1. a higher housing price pt ;

  2. a lower net migration flow F (  ) and aggregate housing flow H ;

                                           
  3. a smaller migration cost cutoff          .


   Utilizing Proposition 4, we can obtain:


Proposition 5 (Land and Migration) In temporal spatial equilibrium,

  1. an increase in housing distortion ht leads to a lower land price qt but a higher land
     demand zt ;

                                                  17
   2. an increase in land distortion zt reduces land price but has no effect on land demand.


       Thus, an increase in land distortion land price proportionately such that the augumented
land price (1 + zt ) qt is unaffected. As a result of this complete passthrough, land distortion
has no direct effect on housing price, net migration flow or aggregate housing flow, nor the
induced demand for land.
       We should note that intertemporally any changes in (ht , zt ) would affect Euler equations
as well as law of motion equations, thereby feeding back to affect housing and land prices
as well as migration. We shall leave these complicated dynamic effects to quantitative
examination.


3.3        The Case of Multiple Cities

The model in the previous section restricts the analysis to a single city. We now extend the
model to the case of multiple cities. Suppose there are cities I > 1. All of the cities are
identical and have access to the same technology to produce manufactured goods that can
be costlessly traded across cities. The cities differ in two aspects: (i) the availability of land
(exogenously) supplied by the government, { i }I
                                               i=1 ; (ii) the city specific housing and land

frictions, {ih , iz }I
                     i=1 . As a result, equilibrium wages and housing supply and demand are

city specific.
       In the interest of tractability, city selection is determined by lottery. The probability that
                                                                            I
a rural worker will be assigned to city i is denoted by i , where           i=1   i = 1. The city labor
markets are segmented because labor mobility across cities is not permitted.3 As a result,
in equilibrium, wages across cities do not equalize. As such, once a rural worker is assigned
to city i, his location choice afterward is to either continue to stay in city i or move back to
the rural area.
       For a worker of type , the utility cost of migrating from the rural area to any of the I
                                 M
cities is represented by . Let Vi,t ( ) denote the value function for a worker of type               who
   3
     Based on population census in 2005 and 2010, we calculated net migration flows from Beijing to other
cities (including Shanghai) and from Shanghai to other cities (including Beijing) and found them within ±4
percent. Thus, ignoring the city-to-city migration does not seem to be at odds with the evidence.



                                                   18
migrates to city i in period t and solves this optimization problem:

                           M                                      C                   R
                         Vi,t ( ) = max U (ci,t , hi,t ) +  max{Vi,t +1 ( , bi,t ), Vt+1 ( )},

                                       s.t.      cm
                                                  i,t + pi,t hi,t = wi,t + bi,t ,

                                               bi,t  (1 - )pi,t hi,t .


This problem is similar to the one for the single-city model, but in this case wages and
housing prices are determined at the city level. The ex-ante value associated with migration
is represented by VtM ( ), which equals the expected payoff from living in any one of the I
cities, VtM ( ) =        i
                                 M
                             i Vi,t ( ). Therefore, a worker of type          will migrate to an urban area in
period t when following condition is satisfied, VtM ( ) -  U . In each period t > 0, there
                                                                                                     
exists a cutoff     t,    below which workers move to an urban area. The threshold                   t   can be
pinned down from the following indifference condition:


                                                 VtM ( t) -
                                                                
                                                                t   =U


   Housing developers in each city are endowed with the same technology to convert land
into houses. The entry fee collected by the government in each city will obey these rules, so
the entry fee collected by city i in period t positively depends on the existing housing stock
                  
in city i: i,t = Hi,t -1 , where  > 0. Therefore, the number of housing developers in each

city, Mi,t , will be determined by the following free-entry condition, d
                                                                       i,t = i,t .

   The housing and land markets will clear in each city subject to the exogenous land supply
controlled by the government in each city. The market-clearing conditions in city i can be
derived as follows:


                                                       Si,t zi,t =   i,t ,

                                                                       
                                              Si,t Ah
                                                    i,t zi,t Ii,ht = Fi,t .

4         Calibration and Estimation
We now turn to quantitative analysis. There are two primary tasks: (1) to estimate and
characterize city-specific housing and land distortionary wedges, , and (2) to conduct coun-
terfactual analysis to quantify the roles of the two distortionary wedges.


4.1        Data

To estimate city-specific housing and land distortionary wedge or frictions, we need the
following data at the city level: (1) Real average prices of newly-built housing units; (2)
Real average prices of residential land parcels; (3) Floor areas of newly-built housing units
sold; (4) Investments on housing development excluding land purchase; (5) Residential land
sales; (6) Real unit construction costs. Due to the data availability, we have finally selected
a balanced panel of 93 major Chinese cities. The total population and GDP among the 93
cities take up roughly a fraction of 60 and 70 of the entire country. In Figure C.1 we map
the selected cities in our sample.4
        During 2007-2013, the average annual growth rate of housing and land prices among
our selected cities is 8.92 and 19.92 percent, respectively. The top 3 cities with the highest
housing price growth rate are Ganzhou, Jiujiang and Luzhou, and the bottom 3 cities with
the lowest housing price growth rate are Tongling, Dalian, and Daqing. Similarly, the top
3 cities with the highest land price growth rate are Wuxi, Zhanjiang and Xining, while the
bottom 3 cities are Baoji, Panzhihua and Tongling. We map the distribution of housing and
land price growth rate in Figure C.3. We also provide the ratio of housing and land price in
2013 to that of 2007, also summarized in Figure C.3. In Figure C.4 we map both housing and
land price levels in year 2013. The unit is RMB per square meters in 2010 RMB. The top 3
cities with the highest housing price level are Shenzhen, Beijing and Shanghai, respectively.
They all belong to the tier-1 cities in China. There are in total 10 cities in our sample with
housing price exceeding ten thousand RMB per square meter in 2013. The top 3 cities with
the most expensive land are in turn: Shenzhen, Sanya and Xiamen, respectively.

    To ease the illustration, we have omitted the islands in South China Sea from all the maps in the current
draft.

4.2     Estimation of Housing and Land Frictions

According to the previous theoretical results, we can estimate the city-level housing and land
market frictions as:

                                                 Iht pIt
                                  1 + zt =
                                             qt (zt - z t )
                                             qt (zt - z t ) (1 + zt )
                                  1 - ht   =
                                             pt Ah                
                                                    t (zt - z t ) Iht


where Iht pIt refers to the investment on housing development excluding land purchase ex-
penses in the data. qt (zt - z t ) is land sales revenue and pt Ah             
                                                                 t (zt - z t ) Iht is housing sales rev-

enue, which is computed using data on floor area of newly-built housing units sold combined
with the relevant price information. In addition, we also need to back out the parameter
value for  and  , which is the construction material share and land share in the housing
production. To achieve this end, we run the following panel regression:


                       log(qit ) = c + 1 log( it ) + 2 log(Iit ) + 3 t + i +   it                  (29)


where qit is floor area of newly-built housing units sold measured in 10,000 sq.m.                 it   is
residential land sales measured in 10,000 sq.m. Iit is construction material and we compute
it by dividing the residential investment excluding land purchase by the real unit construction
cost. We have included a time trend and controlled all the city fixed effects. The estimated
coefficient then 1 and 2 corresponds to  and  , respectively.
   The summary statistics for our estimated city-level housing and land market frictions are
presented in Table 2. Our results suggest the average friction in housing market is about
-0.23 with a standard deviation of 0.58 percent, and the average friction in land market is
about 0.32 with a standard deviation of 1.22 percent. This implies housing developers are
taxed at an amount equivalent to 32 percent of the land sales revenue in order to acquire land
input into housing production, but they are able to obtain additional revenue equivalent to
23 percent of housing sales revenue to compensate the extra land cost incurred. Throughout
the years, the national median of each friction is always smaller than the mean, suggesting
that the distributions across the cities are skewed to the right and some cities experience

                                                  21
particularly high frictions. The frictions exhibit large variations across the cities. The 75
percentile of the housing frictions across cities are taxed at about 15 percent of housing
sales revenue, while the 25 percentile are subsidized roughly equivalent to 45 percent of the
housing sales revenue, 60 percentage points lower than those at the 75 percentile. Land
frictions exhibit similar spread: cities at the 75 percentile are taxed at a level equivalent
to 63 percent of the land sales revenue while cities at the 25 percentile enjoy a 44 percent
subsidy, 107 percentage points lower than those at the 75th percentile. The spatial spread of
housing frictions is persistent over the years, where the 75-25 spread of housing frictions is
0.26-(-.29) = 55 percent in 2007, and 56 percent in 2013. The comparable figures for land are
104 and 70 percent in 2007 and 2013, respectively. Overall, variations in land frictions are
substantially higher than in housing frictions, but land friction variations exhibit a downward
trend over time in contrast to housing friction variations.


Frictions by city-tier In Table C.1, Table C.2 and Table C.3, we have presented the
summary statistics within the group of tier-1, tier-2 and tier-3 cities, respectively. The
following features stand out: 1) housing frictions among tier-1 cities are positive, and negative
among tier-2 and tier-3 cities, likely due to the fact that smaller cities are less affected by
the strict housing market intervention policies; 2) land frictions are more severe in lower tier
cities, likely due to less established land aution. We will also dicuss institutional backgrounds
in greater details later.
   To reconfirm these patterns, we further explore how frictions change with respect to city
size, and the results are reported in Table 3. The first column only includes the city size
measured by GDP on the right-hand-side, and it shows that larger cities are taxed more
in the housing sales revenue and also taxed less in the costs of land inputs. Doubling the
GDP increases the housing frictions by 22.3 percentage points. In contrast, doubling GDP
decreases the land frictions by 20 percentage points. If we include both the linear time trend
and the interaction between city size and the time trend to the RHS, for housing frictions
the coefficient on the interaction term is not significantly from zero. This suggests that
the gaps in housing frictions between large and small cities stayed roughly the same over
the years. On the other hand, for land frictions the coefficient on the interaction term is

significantly positive, which implies the city size elasticity of land frictions gets closer to zero
over time. Column 3 includes both year and city fixed effects to the RHS of the estimation.
The coefficients on city size are no longer significantly different from zero. This suggests
that those frictions are probably rooted in the time-insensitive city characteristics such as
institution quality or the geographic locations that correlate with city size, and the frictions
in both housing and land markets are not alleviated by economic development over time.
   The positive relation between city size and housing frictions suggest that housing is still
heavily subsidized in small cities. Since 2005, the Chinese governments have implemented
several rounds of strict housing market intervention policies in major cities (especially the

first tier cities and a few second tier cities), with the purpose of curbing housing price surge.
The major policies include restrictions on loan-to-value ratio and interest rate for housing
mortgages, higher transaction taxes for housing resales, and, perhaps most importantly,
restrictions on multiple home purchase for local households or any home purchase for non-
resident households since 2010. However, during most periods these policies did not apply
to the smaller third or fourth tier cities. By contrast, explicit or implicit housing subsidies
are still prevalent in these smaller cities, especially during the stimulus period (late-2008
to mid-2010) and the destocking campaign (2015-2016). The types of subsidies vary with
city, mainly including transaction tax rebating, local registered permanent residence (hukou)
awarding, lower mortgage interest rates, or even monetary subsidies for home purchase.
    Table 4 reports the evolution of the frictions over time. The first column reports the
regression against a linear time trend, and the results confirm an overall reduction in land
frictions over time. Recall from Proposition 5 that an increase in land distortion reduces
land price. Thus, the reduction in land frictions suggests that the land inputs become more
expensive over time. The second column replaces the linear time trend with year dummies.
Land frictions have been decreasing over the years steadily. On the contrary, there is no

year 2008, 2012 and 2013. The last column introduces city fixed effects in addition to the
year dummies. The point estimates on year dummies are mostly unaffected, suggesting again
that cities experienced similar trends of frictions over the years.

The unit of observation is city-year. The frictions are based on the estimation procedure outlined in Section
4.2.


    The fact that land frictions decrease over time is likely due to the following policy changes.
In May 2002, the Ministry of Land and Resources (MLR) required all residential and com-
mercial land parcel leasehold purchases to be sold via some type of public auction process.
This can be considered as the starting point for the development of a competitive and trans-
parent urban residential land market. However, for most cities, especially the smaller cities,
the subsequent land market development took a relatively long period of almost one decade.
MLR also issued or revised several techniques codes or documents in 2004, 2006, 2007, 2009

                                                     25
and 2011, respectively, to further improve the competitiveness and transparency of urban
land market. Generally, the urban residential land market is more competitive in larger
cities, compared with the smaller cities, for at least two reasons. First, the rules associated
with urban land market are typically better established in the leading cities. Second, typ-
ically there are much more developers in larger cities, and thus more potential competing
buyers in the residential land market.

    According to Proposition 4, if housing is subsidized in most cities, then housing price is
lower than that in a frictionless market. This might be due to the prevalent presale arrange-
ments in the housing development projects in China. Specifically, a developer can presell the
uncompleted units to household buyers during the construction stage. The payment from
buyers would then be immediately transferred to the developer, and thus considered as a
subsidy to housing developers. The housing subsidies can also be a result of local govern-
ments' unexpected investments on urban amenities, which leads to additional returns to the
developers.
    Similary, based on Proposition 5, the fact that land are taxed in most cities implies that
land price is also lower as opposed to its level in a frictionless market. This is also a result of
immature land markets. For example, the price ceilings in land auctions. When the bidding
price reaches the ceiling, the bidders cannot further hike the bidding price, and thus the
transation price may be lower than the market equilibrium price.
    In terms of cross-city comparison, we find that housing are less subsidized in larger
cities, which suggests a higher housing price in larger cities. This can be partly caused by
the cooling measures implemented in the major cities and the stimulus plan in the small


                                                                           26
cities. The major cooling measures include higher downpayment requirement and mortgage
rates for 2nd homes; higher transantion taxes for housing resales. In addition, since April
2010, 46 cities gradually implemented the Home Purchase Restriction policy, which imposes
restrictions on multiple home purchase for local households or any home purchase for non-
resident households. In contrast, in small cities explicit subsidies such as transaction tax
rebating, lower mortgage rates, or monetary subsidies and hukou restriction relaxation are
prevalent. In a similar manner, land are also taxed less in larger cities. This suggests land
prices are higher and also closer to frictionless market prices in larger cities. This is likely
due to the fact that better-functioned land aution market in larger cities is more competitive
as demonstrated in Figure 1. We summary all the patterns and the related institutional
backgrounds in the Table 5.


4.3     Estimation of Migration Probability

The multiple-city framework maintains most assumptions made in the benchmark model
with the following exceptions: the exogenous probability of migrating to city i from the rural
area, i ; the relative manufacturing productivity in city i, {Ai,t }; and the total residential
land area in city i, {Li,t }. When there are I > 1 cities in the urban area, the share of the
population in city i, ni,t , is denoted as follows, where Ni,t denotes the total population in
city i and NtR denotes the total population in the rural area:
    The growth rate of population in city i can be shown to be equivalent to:

                   Ni,t    Ni,t-1 + Ni,t
                         =                ,
                  Ni,t-1        Ni,t-1
                                  NR,t i       (NR,t - NR,t-1 )i NR,t-1
                         = 1+            =1+                            ,
                                 Ni,t-1              NR,t-1      Ni,t-1
                                  NR,t        NR,t-1
                         = 1+(          - 1)i        .
                                NR,t-1        Ni,t-1

From the first to the second equation above, it essentially implies the population growth rate
in city i is

Finally, we can obtain the migration probability from rural to city i in t satisfies the following:

                                 ni,t        nR,t          nR,t-1

   Our city-specific migration probability is a simple average of i,t over our sample period.
We also renormalize the size so that they sum up to be 1. We present the top and bottom
5 cities with the highest and lowest migration probability in Table C.10. The estimation
results seem to be in line with the data. Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, which usually are
believed to be the main receiptant city of migrants, are all on the list of top 5 cities. Note that
since the estimated migration probabilities captures the direction and magnitudes of rural
population inflow into urban cities, and thus it also reflects the differences in productivities
and amenities across urban cities.
   The expression above also suggests in order to keep track the entire population distribu-
tion over time, we need information on initial city size distribution as well as the evolution of
urban(rural) population over time. In the following, we perform urban population projection.


Projection of urban population In 1840 almost 90 percent of the total U.S. population
lived in rural areas. This percentage steadily declined to about 3 percent in 1990 and has
remained at about 3 percent ever since. Because the fraction of the population living in rural
areas is a main indicator of the progress of structural transformation, the United States is
viewed as having completed its structural transformation by 1990. In 2012, the agricultural
share of employment in China is still over 30 percent and the fraction of urban employment
is around 50 percent.5
   Calculating the path of future prices requires making different assumptions about the
length of the structural transformation process. In the baseline case, we assume that the
path of China's structural transformation will take another 50 years since 2013. Under this
assumption, in the year 2063 urban employment in China will become steady thereafter. Our
algorithm is simply as follows: We assume net migration flow into urban area will continue
to grow until the year 2020, and afterwards, it will steadily decline as shown in the right
   5
     While there is discrepancy in the definition of urban areas between these two large economies, the
contrast is sharp regardless.

panel of Figure C.5. The definition of net migration flows from rural to urban areas include
permanent and temporary permits where many of the latter, mostly renting, but are later
granted permanent permits. Overall, the time path for the fraction of urban employment
is plotted in the left panel of Figure C.5. By 2063, the fraction of urban employment will
reach 95 percent.6




4.4       Calibration

We parameterize the model in this section. We let the utility function take the log form
u(ct ) = ln(ct ). A worker's disutility level from migration is assumed to follow a Pareto
distribution defined over interval interval [ , ) :

where = 1 and  > 0 is the inverse of the tail index.
       Each period in the model corresponds to one year; the subjective discount rate,  , is set
at 0.95; and the annual interest rate, r , is set at 5 percent. The down payment ratio ,
the fraction of the house value that the worker must pay in advance is set at 0.3, which is
consistent with the data.  and  in the housing production function have been estimated

set it to be 0.5, which will be subjected to sensitivity analysis. z t is the minimum land
requirement, and we set it to be 10 percent of land purchased by each housing developer.
We summarize the benchmark parameterization in Table 6.

    Note that there may be more optimistic projections on the progress of structural transformation in
China, with a much faster transition for China than the United States. The conjecture above is provided as
a starting point. As a robustness check, we performed various exercises with more optimistic and pessimistic
projected paths. While the results have some effects in the very long-run, but they have only a minor impact
on the simulated dynamics of housing prices between 2007 and 2013.

across all the cities. We also examine whether there is a time trend in the estimated series
within the sample period. If there is one, we extrapolate for those that are out of our sample
periods. We also perform a similar projection algorithm for the residential land supply at
city-level. We approximate city-level land sales by fitting the available land sales data with
the following regression equation:


                              log( it ) = b0i + b1i t + it ,   i = 1, 2...J

only be perceived in 13 cities.7 We again extrapolate the land data for 20 periods, and let
the land supply in the remaining periods maintain at its mean level over the first 20 periods.
We perform similar exercises for ht and zt . We follow same prediction as when we project
urban population by letting the number of periods to complete the structure transformation
be 50 year. Afterward, we force both urban population size and manufacturing productivity
be constant. The capital eventually will adjust till they reach the steady-state level. We
calibrate the sequence of manufacturing productivity Amt to exactly match the population
size in the urban area over time. The numerical algorithm can be found in Appendix ??.

5         Quantitative Results
We quantitatively evaluate how city-level housing and land frictions affect price dynamics at
both national and city-level in this subsection. Given the benchmark parameterization, we
follow the procedure described in Appendix ?? to solve for the equilibrium outcome.


5.1        National Results

In Figure 2 we plot the model predicted housing and land prices together with the data
counterparts during 2007-2013. Overall housing price in 2013 is 1.55 times of that in 2007,
while the model predicts a ratio of 1.46, which can rationalize about 1.46/1.55  94.2 percent
of the change in the data. The model also slightly underpredicts the land price growth in the
data. From 2007 to 2013, the model implied land price level has almost doubled, while in
the data the land price in 2013 is 2.11 times of that in 2007. In terms of the average annual
growth rate, housing and land prices steadily grow at a rate of 7.89 and 14.94 percent in
the data, respectively. While the model predicts a growth rate of 6.5 and 12.1 percent,
respectively, which can account for 82.4 percent and 81.0 percent of the changes in the data
counterpart. To sum up, the model has decently mimicked the data series over time. It
seems that for the land prices the model predicts a less dramatic decline between 2007 and
2008, and faster growth between 2011 and 2012.
        We further explore how housing and land frictions tend to affect both housing and land
price levels as well as their growth trends. We perform a counterfactual exercise in which we
remove all the frictions by setting them to zero. In Figure C.6, we compare the counterfactual
results in the frictionless world with the benchmarks.8 Recall from previous discussion that
on average housing frictions are negative and land frictions are positive and their direct
effects tend to lower housing and land prices. Thus, when all the frictions are eliminated,
housing and land prices both tend to be higher than their benchmark levels. Specifically, we
find housing price rise by 20-30 percent and land price by 20-70 percent over their benchmark
counterparts. But what happens to their growth trends? As shown in Table 7, housing price

    All the price levels in the counterfactual exercise have been renormalized according to the benchmark
price level in 2007.

grows less rapidly than the benchmark economy. The ratio of housing price in 2013 to 2007
is about 1.283/1.456  88.1% of the benchmark level, and the average annual growth rate
drops from 6.5 to 4.3 percent. In contrast, land price grows faster in the frictionless economy.
This is not surprising. In the data, land tend to be much less taxed over time, and the land

ratio is 3.161/1.949  1.62 times of that in the benmark economy and the annual growth
rate has also increased from 12.1 to 21.5 percent.

Notes: We present results for the following economy: benchmark economy; frictionless economy; the economy
without housing frictions; the economy without land frictions. The results include: the ratio of housing or
land prices in 2013 to that in 2007, and the average annual price growth rate.


       To isolate the role of housing and land frictions, we have performed another two sets
of counterfactual exercises, in which we either only remove housing or land frictions and
simulate the price levels over time accordingly. The results are reported in Figure 3.9 The
first impression is that housing prices change little when only land frictions are removed. The
hints can be found in (28) and (27) that land friction does not directly affect the housing
price levels, so its effects only work in general equilibrium by affecting the population inflow
into the city. Overall, as suggested in Table 7, the price ratio slightly decreases from 1.456
to 1.382, and the average annual growth rate decreases from 6.5 to 5.6 percent. As for
the housing price levels, we have shown in Proposition 4 that housing prices are increasing
with housing frictions. Since housing are subsidized in most cities, and thus housing price
slightly increases in the initial years when housing frictions are set to be zero. Housing price
eventually becomes lower than the benchmark level because less population flow into the
cities. In terms of the growth trend, housing price growth slow down when housing frictions
are removed, with the price ratio and the average growth rate decreasing to 1.3 and 4.5
percent, respectively.
       Land prices grow much faster when land frictions are removed, and this is still due to the
removal of rising land subsidies. Table 7 suggests that land price ratio and annual growth
rate increase from 1.95 to 4.08, and 12.1 to 29.3 percent, respectively. When only housing

       We have similarly renormalized all the price levels according to their benchmark level at 2007.

frictions are removed, land prices become lower because housing sales revenue shrink due
to the removal of housing subsidies. The growth trend are also significantly slowed down
with a only 1.39 price ratio and 5.7 percent annual growth rate. This seems to suggest the
elmination of housing frictions can effectively inhibit land price growth.
      Overall, our results show that, in a frictionless world, housing price would grow less
rapidly but land price would grow faster than the benchmark counterparts. By decomposing
into each friction, we further identify that the reduced growth in housing price is due to a
combination of the removal of both frictions, whereas the increased growth in land price is

                                                                                 34
mainly due to the elimination of the land friction.


The role of capital market frictions We have also briefly examined the role of capital
market frictions in driving housing and land prices. The imperfect capital market in our
model is captured by the spread between mortage interests and the rate of return to capital,
and the latter one is much higher. In the following, we performe a counter-factual exercise
in which we double the mortgage interest rates from 5 percent to 10 percent to mimic an
improvement in the capital market. The results are reported in Figure C.7. Both housing
and land prices become much lower than the benchmark counterpart when mortgage rates
are doubled. This is mainly because housing in the city become less affordable with higher
mortgage rates as illustrated in Equation (3). This will thus deter the entry of rural migrants
into the cities. Prices fall accordingly due to less demand. The growth rate of prices have
also become lower due to slower speed of migration into the city.


5.2    City-level Results

We examine city-level results in this section by focusing on the following perspective: First,
how different types of frictions affect the spatial distribution of housing and land prices.
Second, the model performance in terms of matching housing and land price dynamics in
each city, with a particular interests on those tier-1 cities. In Table 8, we measure how
housing and land prices vary across cities for each of the following scenarios: 1) benchmark
results, 2) frictionless economy, 3)4) either housing or land friction is eliminated. We use
the coefficient of variation to measure the inequality, and report the results year by year.
   When all the frictions are removed, the dispersion of both housing and land prices are
largely removed in comparison with the benchmark scenario. This suggests the price dis-
persion are partially driven by the spatial differences of frictions. On average, the CV has
decreased by 30 percent for housing prices 15 percent for land prices, respectively. More-
over, both distributions have become more stable over time, with a standard deviation of CV
changing from 0.17 to almost zero for housing prices, and from 0.39 to 0.04 for land prices.
We have previously argued land friction affects housing prices only through impacting the
migration inflow, and thus housing price inequality remains similar to and only slightly(8%)

Notes: This table reports statistics on both housing and land price dispersion as well as their average levels

inequality using the coefficient of variation. The counterfactual exercises include completely eliminating all
the frictions; either eliminating housing or land frictions.


lower than the benchmark level when only land frictions are removed. On the contrary, when
only housing frictions are removed, housing price inequality are greatly lowered to a level
only 10-percent above the frictionless outcome. As for land prices, our results suggest that
land friction contributes to the land price dispersion. On average, once the land frictions are
removed, the CV of land price is about 90 percent of that in benchmark case. In contrast,
housing frictions tend to dampen the land price inequality. On average, the CV of land price
is about 1.06 times of that in the benchmark case.
    We next turn to the comparison between model predicted prices and their data coun-
terparts. In Figure C.8 we map the prediction power of the model in price ratio as well
as the average annual price growth rate during 2007-2013 for each city in the sample. The
prediction power is simply defined as the ratio of the model implied growth rate to that in
the data. A number larger than 1 implies that the model overpredicts. The model under-
predicts housing price ratio in 60 cities, and overpredicts land price ratio in 40 cities. On
average housing and land price ratio is about 0.72 and 0.76 times of their data counterparts.
In terms of the average annual price growth rate, the model predicts higher housing price

                                                       36
growth in 14 cities than the data, and overpredicts land price growth for 24 cities. The model
implied housing and land price growth rate is about 0.83 and 0.95 times of the benchmark
counterparts.
    We further explore the role of frictions at city-level in Figure C.9. The counter-factual
and benchmark economy each can give rise to a price ratio. We essentially map the ratio
of the counterfactual ratio to the benchmark ratio. A number larger than 1 implies price
grow faster in the counter than the benchmark economy. When all the frictions are removed,
housing price growth in all the cities become slower. The majority of the cities, especially
those coastal and large cities, see a higher land price ratio than the benmark economy. This
is consistent with the findings in aggregate results. In Figure C.10 and Figure C.11 we also
present results where we either eliminate housing or land frictions. Both housing and land
price ratio become lower than the benchmark one in the majority of the cities when housing
frictions are removed. When land frictions are removed, land price ratio becomes much
higher in the majority of the cities, whereas housing price ratio are still lower in most cities.



6     Conclusions
In this paper, we have examined how housing and land market frictions affect the growth of
housing and land prices as well as the spatial distribution of both prices. We have estimated
the city-specific housing and land fricitons among a set of prefectural Chinese cities. We show
that both frictions vary systematically across cities and the spatial disparity is persistent
over time. We have also evaluated the aggregate impacts of the frictions through a dynamic
competitive spatial equilibrium framework featuring on-going rural-urban migration. The
model turns out to fit well with housing and land price growth in the data. The counterfactual
results suggest that housing and land prices tend to be higher than the benchmark once all
the frictions are removed. In such a frictionless world, housing price grows less rapidly but
land price grows faster than the benchmark counterparts. While the reduced growth in
housing price is due to a combination of the removal of both frictions, the increased growth
in land price is mainly due to the elimination of the land friction.
    Along these lines, a natural extension is to conduct normative analysis to assess efficiency


                                               37
losses as a result of spatial misallocation. We would however like to warn the reader that
performing such a task is non-trivial. This is because of dynamic responses of migration to
changes in the wedges, so an efficiency allocation need not be achieved by simple elimination
of the dispersion in marginal revenue products in a static setting as typically done in the
misallocation literature. Moreover, due to household mobility restrictions imposed by the
Chinese government, our study has been focusing on the interplays between labor markets
and housing markets across space. One may inquire whether capital markets may also play
a role because they are likely to be better-functioned in larger cities than small cities. Of
course, this would require location-specific bank loan and credit market data, which is beyond
the scope of the current study.

We can first also sove housing price recursively from two first-order conditions using (32)

    By manipulating two first-order conditions using (32) and (24), we can then express land
price as a function of housing price:

B      Proofs

B.1     Proposition 1

Proof: The migrant's value function can be expressed as:


                            VM = u(w - p h ) +  max{VC         R
                                                     +1 (b ), V +1 }.



                                                             42
                                  
Because VtM is independent on     t,   and thus the left-hand-side of the locational no-arbitrage
                                                    
condition is monotonically decreasing with          t.   This guarantees the uniqueness of the cutoff

t.   Because the migrant's flow utility is rising with the urban wage rate but falling with the
urban housing price, other things being equal, a higher urban wage or a lower urban housing
price raises migrant's value and thus the disutility cutoff of migration.



B.2      Proposition 2

Proof: production function is:
                                                     1-
                                         Yt = A m
                                                t K t Nt .

Wage rate equals to the marginal product of labor, that is,

                                                      -
                                   wt = (1 -  ) Am
                                                 t K t Nt .



Firm's value function can be written as:

                                            1-
                      Vt (Kt ) = M ax Am
                                       t K t Nt - It + Vt+1 (Kt+1 ) ,

                    s.t. Kt+1 = Kt1- It ,


In a stationary scenario, where Am    m
                                 t = A and Nt = N , we have:

                                                                      1

                                        m       1-            K       
                    V (K ) = M ax A K N                  -                + V K   .
                                                             K 1-

The first order condition is obtained as:

                                                    1     1-  -1
                                 V       K      =     (K )  K  .
                                                    

The B.S. equation is:

                                                                 1
                                                                      - 1 -1
                         V (K ) =  2 Am K -1 N 1- - K            
                                                                         K  .
                                                                      



                                                    43
   In steady-state, K = K , then we have:

                                                               -1   1
                                     2 Am K -1 N 1- -             =   ,
                                                                    

which is equivalent to:
                                                       -1
                                      2    m    K
                                  A                         = 1 -  (1 -  ) .
                                                N
This completes the proof.

Proof: Equation 35 can be written into:

                                                                    
                                     pt (1 - h ) = F (  ) 1- ht ,                              (38)


where                                                                             (1-- )
                                            
                             1       pIt   1-           1          1-     t         1-
                ht =      1/(1- )
                                                                                           .
                       Aht                          (1 - t )   t        1--

Therefore, net housing prices increase with F (  ), and both housing and land distortion
have no impact on net housing price.
   Similarly, from equation (36) we have:

                                                      qt F (  )(+ )/
                                 qt (1 + zt ) =                               ,                (39)
                                                     [(1 - ht ) pt ](1-- )/

where
                                                                   (1-- )/
                                                         t
                                               pIt    (1-- )
                                    qt           1/
                                               Aht [(1 - t ) t ](+ )/
is an exogenous scaling variable. Plugging in equation 38 into equation 39, we have:

                                                       qt F (  )1/(1- )
                                    qt (1 + zt ) =             (1-- )/
                                                            ht

   Therefore, net land price is also increasing with F (  ). Both housing and land distortion


                                                       44
have no impact on net land price. This also completes the proof of Proposition 3.



B.4     Proposition 4

Proof: From equation (27) and (28), housing market clearing condition implies

                                       +    +                -
                             ASt (F (                      
                                      t ); ht ) = ADt (F ( t ))                           (40)


If we draw both the aggregate demand and upply curve in a diagram with housng price pt as
the y-axis and net migration inflow F ( t ) as the x-axis, then a higher h will shift up the

aggregate supply curve and has no impact on the aggregate demand curve. These together
imply a higher housing price and lower migration inflow.
   We can further differentiate equation (40) against ht , we have:

                           ASt  F (   t)   ASt    ADt
                               
                                         +     =         .
                           F ( t ) ht      ht     F ( t)


Therefore, it is straightforward to show:

                                          ADt
                               F (      (        - AS t
                                                        )
                                   t)      F( t)    ht
                                      =       ASt
                                                          < 0.
                               ht            F (  )      t



Hence, higher housing friction leads to lower migration inflow, which in turn implies a smaller
                   
migration cutoff      .



B.5     Proposition 5

Proof: Substituting (35) into (24), we further get:

                                                 t   t
                             zt =                                 .
                                    (1 -  -  ) ht F (  )1/(1- )

Together with equation (39), we can show that a higher zt leads to lower land prices and
has no impact on land demand. In addition, utilizing results from Proposition 4, if higher



                                                45
housing friction induces less migration inflow F (  ), then this further implies higher land
demand and lower land prices.

Notes: This figure maps the prediction power of our model in explaining housing and land price growth
during 2007-2013. The explanation power is simply the ratio of model implied growth rate to that in the
data at each city. We measure growth rate using both price ratio in 2013 to 2007 and the average annual
price growth rate.

Notes: We compute price ratio between 2007 and 2013 for both benchmark and frictionless economy at each
city. In the figure, we map the ratio of the "frictionless" ratio to the benchmark ratio. A number larger than
1 implies price ratio become higher in the frictionless economy.
