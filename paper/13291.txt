                                              ABSTRACT

Nearly 20% of young prison inmates spent part of their youth in foster care - the placement of abused
or neglected children with substitute families. Little is known whether foster care placement reduces
or increases the likelihood of criminal behavior. This paper uses the placement frequency of child
protection investigators as an instrument to identify causal effects of foster care placement on adult
arrest, conviction, and imprisonment rates. A unique dataset that links child abuse investigation data
to criminal justice data in Illinois allows a comparison of adult crime outcomes across individuals
who were investigated for abuse or neglect as children. Families are effectively randomized to child
protection investigators through a rotational assignment process, and child characteristics are similar
across investigators. Nevertheless, investigator placement frequencies are predictive of subsequent
foster care placement, and the results suggest that school-aged children who are on the margin of placement
have lower adult arrest rates when they remain at home.

1. Introduction

        When parents are suspected of child abuse or neglect, their children may be

placed in foster care until reunification is deemed safe or adoptive homes are sought.

Each year, states spend $20 billion dollars on child protection services, including the

investigation of over 2 million children and the temporary housing of 800,000 (Bes et al.,

2002; US DHHS, 2004; US DHHS, 2006). Aside from the immediate goal of safety,

foster care is a powerful intervention in the lives of children who appear to be at great

risk of poor life outcomes. An estimated 28% of the homeless population spent time in

foster care as a youth (Burt et al., 1999). Former foster children have also been found to

be far more likely to drop out of school, join welfare, and experience substance abuse

problems (Clausen et al., 1998; Courtney and Piliavin, 1998; Dworsky and Courtney,

2000; US DHHS, 1999; Vinnerljung et al., 2006).

        One area where the association between child maltreatment, foster care, and poor

life outcomes is particularly strong is criminality.1 Nearly 20% of the prison population

under the age of 30, and 25% of prisoners with prior convictions, report that they spent

part of their childhood in foster care.2 This is not surprising given the strong correlation

found between poor family backgrounds and later criminal behavior (Loeber and

Stouthamer-Loeber, 1986; Widom, 1989; Case and Katz, 1991; Sampson and Laub,

1993; Donohue and Levitt, 2001, Currie and Tekin, 2006; Pezzin, 2004). Meanwhile,

interventions for youth at risk for criminal behavior are thought to have some impact and

provide motivation for child welfare policy. For example, high quality day care and

improved neighborhood settings have been associated with lower criminality (Belfield et

al., 2006; Oreopolous, 2003; Kling, Ludwig and Katz, 2005).

         Foster care and juvenile delinquency have also been linked. Courtney, Terao, and

Bost (2004) surveyed children who will turn 18 in foster care in the Midwest and found

that two-thirds of the boys and half of the girls had a history of delinquency. Jonson-

Reid and Barth (2000a, 2000b) considered children in California and found a modest

reduction in delinquency with in-home services compared to foster care placement.

Meanwhile, Doyle (2007) finds that children on the margin of foster care placement in

Cook County, Illinois (which includes the City of Chicago) were more likely to enter the

juvenile delinquency system if they were placed in foster care.

         Little is known whether foster care placement is likely to reduce or exacerbate the

propensity for adult criminal behavior (Courtney, 2000; Gelles, 2000; Goerge, Wulzcyn,

and Fanshel, 1994; Jonson-Reid and Barth, 2000; National Research Council, 1998;

McDonald et al. 1996). While child abuse may lead to criminality later in life, the

removal of children from parents is thought to be traumatic as well. For example,

placement instability has been highlighted as a problem for children in foster care, with

the average foster child experiencing at least one placement disruption and a quarter

experiencing three or more moves.3 This leads to a difficult tradeoff between two

competing goals: child protection and family preservation (Barth, 1999; Maluccio, Pine,

and Warsh, 1994). The uncertainty over the effectiveness of placement is evident in the

number of children in foster care at the end of each year increasing from 200,000 to

3
 There is a large empirical literature on placement instability, as it is one observable characteristic in
administrative data. See Zinn, et al. (2006), James et al. (2004), Newton et al. (2000), and Smith et al.
(2001).


                                                                                                             2
500,000 in the 1960s, dropping back to 200,000 in the 1970s, and rising to more than

500,000 in the 1980s and 1990s. The current emphasis is increasingly placed on family

preservation (McDonald et al., 1996; Annie E. Case Foundation, 2002).

       One of the limitations on previous research is the lack of long-term outcome data.

In addition, there are endogeneity concerns: worse outcomes for foster children could be

due to worse family backgrounds, as opposed to any effect of foster care placement

(Kerman, Wildfire, and Barth, 2002). In addition, children placed in foster care are likely

those who benefit most from placement, which can lead to a selection bias where average

outcomes may overstate the benefit of placement for marginal cases.

       This paper uses a unique dataset that links child abuse investigation data with

criminal justice data in Illinois to compare adult crime outcomes across children who

were placed in foster care with children who were also investigated for abuse or neglect

but not subsequently placed in care. The foster care placement frequency of child

protection investigators is used as an instrumental variable to identify causal effects of

foster care placement on adult arrest, conviction, and imprisonment rates. Families are

assigned to investigators on a rotational basis within geographic field teams to smooth the

caseload. This has the empirical advantage of essentially randomizing families to

investigators: one family may receive an investigator who is more likely to recommend

foster care placement, while another family may draw an investigator who is more likely

to stress family preservation. The assignment process results in family characteristics

that are similar across investigators, and their placement tendencies provide a plausible

instrument to estimate the effects of foster care on later criminal activity. One advantage

of the approach is that the instrumental variable estimates apply to particularly policy-




                                                                                             3
relevant cases: children on the margin of placement where investigators may disagree

about the recommendation of removal.

       The results suggest that school-aged children on the margin of placement have

lower arrest, conviction, and imprisonment rates when they remain at home, especially

for children outside of the Chicago area where the linkage across the databases appears

more accurate. The large size of the estimated effects and their relative lack of precision

suggest caution in the interpretation, though large preventative effects of foster care

placement on later criminal justice problems appear unlikely for these children.

       The paper is organized as follows. Section two presents the empirical framework

that incorporates heterogeneous treatment effects. Section three provides background

information on child abuse investigations and the investigator assignment process.

Section four describes the data sources and reports summary statistics. Section five

presents the results, and section six concludes.



2. Empirical Framework

       The decision to remove a child from home is notoriously difficult. Placement in

foster care may promote child protection, but may be traumatic as well. The empirical

framework follows Doyle (2007) and considers this treatment effect heterogeneity using

a random coefficient model (Bjorklund and Moffitt (1987); Heckman and Vytlacil

(2005)). Consider an outcome Y, such as an indicator for an adult arrest, observable case

characteristics X, and an indicator for removal from home R, for child i:

        (1) Yi = X i β + α i Ri + ε i
        (2) Ri = 1( Z i γ + X i δ + θ i > 0)




                                                                                              4
where Z is a random variable that influences selection into foster care placement but is

excluded from the outcome equation.4 α i will be negative for children where the

placement is associated with a lower propensity for an arrest, but may be positive for

children where the disruption of placement is associated with a higher arrest propensity.

        One problem that arises when estimating treatment effects is that the placement

indicator, R, may be correlated with ε : those from the most abusive families may be

more likely to be placed in foster care and more likely to be arrested. Second, the

heterogeneous treatment effects create the possibility that R may be correlated with α —

the correlated random coefficient model—if child protection agents place children who

are most likely to benefit from the placement. This leads to a selection bias that tends to

overstate the benefits of foster care placement. Although the placement decision may not

be based on α i itself, if the effect of placement on arrest propensities were indicative of

child well being in general, then such a correlation may exist. Last, α may be correlated

with ε , for example if those who benefit most from placement have the highest

underlying propensity for later arrests.

        In this paper, Z is a measure of how likely the investigator assigned to child i

tends to have children placed in foster care. Consider if there were two types of

investigators: strict and lenient. Strict investigators would be defined as having a high

placement rate, Z=zH, while lenient ones would be defined as having a low placement

rate, Z= zL . The difference in outcomes across these investigators could then be used to

measure a local average treatment effect (LATE) (Imbens and Angrist, 1994). The

parameter can be written using a potential outcomes framework and the above latent

 Heckmand and Vytlacil (2005) note that the restrictions inherent in the latent index model may be relaxed.
The model is used here for ease of exposition.


                                                                                                         5
index model, letting a superscript on Y equal 1 if the child is placed in foster care and

zero otherwise (and conditioning on X kept implicit) as:

        (3) α LATE = E (Y 1 − Y 0 | R( Z = z H ) = 1, R( Z = z L ) = 0)
                  = E (Y 1 − Y 0 | z H γ + θ > 0, z L γ + θ ≤ 0)
                  = E (Y 1 − Y 0 | − z H γ < θ ≤ − z L γ )

The local average treatment effect is the average effect for children induced into foster

care on the basis of the investigator assignment. Letting P(z)=P(R=1|Z=z), the parameter

can be calculated using sample means according to:

                                                E[Y | P ( Z ) = P ( z H )] − E[Y | P ( Z ) = P ( z L )]
        ( 4) α LATE ( P ( z H ), P ( z L )) =
                                                                P( z H ) − P( z L )

       The identifying assumptions that justify interpreting (4) as a local average

treatment effect are:

        (5) E ( Zε ) = 0; E ( Zα ) = 0; E ( Zθ ) = 0; γ ≠ 0

       The first three conditions represent the exclusion restriction that Z is not in the

outcome equation, is unrelated to unobserved heterogeneity in the gains from treatment,

and is unrelated to unobservable characteristics associated with selection into foster care.

In a standard correlated random coefficient model, the heterogeneous returns would be

associated with the unobserved propensity to be placed in care. Relaxing the assumption

that Z is not related to unobservables included in the selection process would result in an

estimate that incorporates the selection bias associated with foster care placement

decisions, which may be policy relevant. If investigators were randomized to families,

the exclusion restriction would appear to be an accurate description of the role of the

investigators.




                                                                                                          6
       The fourth condition is that the instrument is associated with foster care

placement. Implicit in the common coefficient γ is also a monotonicity condition: any

child removed by a lenient investigator would also be removed by a strict one, and a child

not removed by a strict investigator would not be removed by a lenient one. This

condition rules out the case where assignment to an investigator described as “lenient”

would result in an increased likelihood of placement.

       The monotonicity condition is less straightforward in the setting considered here

compared to a treatment and control environment, where, for example, the treatment may

be denied to a control group (Imbens and Angrist, 1994). Instead, the model here relies

more heavily on the varying ethos between family preservation and child protection

across child welfare investigators, as discussed below.

       Angrist, Imbens, and Rubin (1996) describe the tradeoff involved when the

monotonicity assumption is only approximated. First, the bias will decrease with the

strength of the relationship between the instrument and foster care placement. Second, in

their language, if the effect of foster care placement for “defiers” (for example, those

individuals induced to receive the treatment when assigned to the lenient investigator) is

the same for the “compliers” (those induced to receive the treatment because they are

assigned to the strict investigator), then the bias disappears. This may be unlikely when

the investigator types are quite different from one another, where defiers may represent

exceptional cases. In the case of a continuous instrument, however, this would appear to

be less of a problem when considering small differences in investigators: that is,

measuring marginal treatment effects (MTE).




                                                                                             7
        A marginal treatment effect is the average effect for children on the margin of

foster care placement, and that margin varies with the instrument. It is the limit of the

local average treatment effect as the thresholds for different types of investigators goes to

zero:

        (6) α MTE = lim z L → z H E (Y 1 − Y 0 | − z H γ < θ ≤ − z L γ )
                          = E (Y 1 − Y 0 | θ = − zγ )

In terms of the calculation in (4), the MTE calculation can be written as a derivative:

                                ∂E (Y | P( z ))
        (7) α MTE ( P( z )) =
                                    ∂P ( z )

        The marginal treatment effect may vary with the probability of placement.

Consider children assigned to relatively strict investigators. These investigators should

observe a similar distribution of child abuse severity levels, yet they remove more

children. Children on the margin in this group likely have unobservable characteristics

that make them the least likely to be placed. For cases of serious abuse or no abuse at

all, all investigators would agree on the placement referral. This would result in no

variation in placement and the likely benefit of placement cannot be identified.

        In this setting, the MTE estimates are of interest in themselves, as they describe

whether outcomes for children on the margin of foster care improve or become worse as

we move from more lenient to more strict investigators. For comparisons of marginal

treatment effects across investigators with large differences in recommendation

thresholds, however, violations of the monotonicity condition become more salient.



3. Background




                                                                                             8
         Reports of abuse or neglect are typically made by physicians, school principals,

police, and family members. In Illinois, all reports of abuse or neglect are made to the

Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS). The case is referred to a field team

that is closest to the child’s residence. A typical team covers one county in Illinois and

consists of eight investigators at any given time. These investigators are called case

managers, though they differ from the case managers who supervise children once they

are placed in foster care.

         There are three main reasons why the investigator assignment may predict foster

care placement. First, the investigator may remove the child from home on an emergency

basis. Second, the investigator may decide that the case does not have merit. Third, in

most cases that result in foster care placement, the decision is ultimately made by a judge

in each county’s Child Protection Division of the Juvenile Court. The investigator is

responsible for collecting the evidence for the case, and presents this evidence along with

a recommendation. Some investigators may be more likely to convince a judge that a

placement is warranted, either by the way the investigation is conducted or the evidence

is presented.5

         The main analysis relies on the variation in placement across investigators.

Previous research suggests that there is variation in investigator recommendations for

similar cases. In particular, case managers are thought to rely more heavily on “practice

wisdom” rather than administrative rules to make placement referrals (Cash, 2001).

Nasuti and Pecora (1993) and Rossi, Schuermand, and Budde (1996) found that case


5
  This approach is similar to that of Kling (2006), who studied the effect of prison sentences on
employment and earnings. In that study, the tendencies of randomly assigned judges to impose different
prison sentences is used as an instrumental variable. In an analogy to criminal proceedings, investigators
studied here are similar to detectives who are the key witnesses in each case.


                                                                                                             9
managers had inter-rater reliability ranging from 60-80% when assessing fictional cases.

In addition, the standard for foster care placement does vary over time and with the

amount of resources available to child protective services, such as federal funding and

monthly subsidies paid to foster parents (Simon, 1975; Campbell and Downs, 1987;

Chamberlain et al., 1992; Doyle and Peters, 2004; Hegar and Scannapieco, 1995). It

appears that the threshold for placement is not constant, and may differ across

investigators.

Investigator Assignment

           Most families are assigned to case managers on a rotational basis in an effort to

smooth the caseload. The assignment process is referred to as “the rotation”, and it

appears to be self-enforced: case managers note that they abide by it to avoid managing

too many cases.6

           One limitation in using the case manager assignment as a randomization device is

that exceptions are made, and the main analysis will focus on cases that are most likely to

enter the rotational assignment process. First, some field teams assign case managers to

particular neighborhoods. For example, one team divides the county into east and west,

with half of the case managers assigned to each sub-team. If particular types of case

managers were assigned to neighborhoods that were more likely to have child abuse or

neglect, then a comparison across case managers would capture differences in these

neighborhoods as well. The analysis here will focus on sub-teams defined as the

interaction between the child’s ZIP code of residence and the field team assigned.

           Second, if a family were investigated more than once, an effort is made to re-

assign the same case manager to investigate the most recent allegation. The exogenous

                                                                                               10
variation in case manager assignment stems from the initial investigation, and the case

manager assigned to the family’s first investigation will be considered in the analysis.

       Third, if the family speaks only Spanish, an effort is made to assign a Spanish-

speaking case manager. Like the neighborhood consideration, if some case managers

specialize in Spanish-speaking cases, then differences across case managers would

incorporate differences in Spanish-speaking versus English-speaking cases as well. For

this reason, Hispanic cases will be considered separately.

       Fourth, cases involving sexual abuse and substance-exposed infants are assigned

to specially-trained case managers. These allegations are dropped from the analysis as

they are less likely to enter the rotational assignment. Taking these exceptions into

account, the analysis below will consider the relative frequency of foster care placement

within sub-teams defined by field team x ZIP code x Hispanic x report-year cells.

       In essence, the results will consider the effect of assignment to different types of

case managers, categorized by their rate of foster care placement, on crime outcomes as

adults. One question that arises is whether these investigators affect families in ways

other than through foster care placement. Recall that these investigators do not supervise

the case once a child enters foster care. Foster care stays are overseen by a separate

division within IL DCFS that works with private child welfare agencies to recruit and

supervise foster families. One potential area where they may have an impact is the

recruitment of relatives to care for foster children, as the investigators often interview

family members. An IL DCFS rule requires a relative to be sought first, however,

regardless of the case manager assigned to investigate the case. An examination of any

relationship between the investigator type and observable case characteristics, including




                                                                                             11
placement type, will be explored in detail below. It appears that the role of the

investigator is concentrated on determining whether a child has been abused or neglected:

evidence that will be used to make the foster care placement decision. As a result, the

differences in outcomes across investigators should largely stem from differences in the

likelihood of foster care placement.7




4. Data Description

         A unique data set that matches individuals across a wide array of administrative

agencies in Illinois is used to carry out the analysis. These data are collected by the

Chapin Hall Center for Children, a research institute located at the University of Chicago,

and linked using name, address, social security number, date of birth, and other

identifiers to create the Illinois Integrated Database (Goerge, Van Voorhis, and Lee,

1994).

         First, longitudinal, administrative data used by the Illinois Department of Children

and Family Services for their abuse investigations and foster care placements are

considered. In particular, the Child Abuse and Neglect Tracking System (CANTS)

provides details of the investigation, including the initial reporter of the abuse, the

allegations, the alleged perpetrator, the field team assigned to the case, and the case

manager assigned to investigate. CANTS data also include the child’s name, date of

birth, sex, race, and address. Meanwhile, the Child and Youth Centered Information

System (CYCIS) tracks children in foster care, and the two systems have been linked to

determine whether the child was ever placed in care. The two information systems
7
 Family preservation services, such as counseling and vouchers for maid services, are increasingly
common in the late 1990s. These programs are generally administered by separate case workers, and those
considered here are focused on the investigation.


                                                                                                    12
reflect the fact that children under investigation are served by a different set of case

managers than children who are placed in foster care.

           The Illinois Integrated Database also includes the Computerized Criminal History

System of the Illinois State Police, which records all arrests in the state. The system

relates these arrests to the associated charges, offenses, court dispositions, and sentences.

The main identifiers to link children to adults are the social security number, name, and

date of birth. One issue with the state police data is that the reports, especially linkages

between the arrest and court systems, is known to be of higher quality outside of Cook

County.8 The results below will be presented for children separately for children residing

in and outside of Cook County.

           The fourth data set is the Illinois Longitudinal Public Assistance Database.

Children investigated for abuse are linked to this Public Assistance database using the

rich set of personal identifiers. The main reason for this linkage is to obtain the child’s

social security number for the linkage to the state police database.

Sample Construction

           The investigation data are considered more reliable beginning in 1990, so all first

investigations of parental abuse or neglect between July 1, 1990 and June 30, 2003 are

considered. The arrest data include the social security number beginning in 2000, so all

arrests in Illinois from 2000 to 2005 are considered for the outcome measures.

           There are two main restrictions of the data. First, every foster child is statutorily

eligible for Medicaid. Once in Medicaid, the personal identifiers known for the match

improve, including the availability of the social security number. It may be possible,

then, to find foster children more likely to be matched to the criminal justice data simply

                                                                                               13
due to the greater availability of the identifiers. To compare children with the same

known identifiers, the analysis here will focus on all children who received Medicaid

prior to the abuse/neglect report. This represents 43% of all first-time abuse reports.

Although this restriction will affect the interpretation of the results, it considers an

important group, especially for foster care. Of the children placed in foster care in

Illinois, 82% had received Medicaid prior to the first abuse report.

         The second major restriction is on the age of children to ensure that they are old

enough at the end of the sample period to be at risk for adult arrests. While individuals

who are 17 years old can be arrested as an adult in Illinois, very few below the age 18

were found to be arrested on adult charges. As a result, all children who are at least 18 in

2005 will be considered, resulting in a sample consisting of children ranging from 4-16

years old at the time of the abuse report. This also results in a foster care placement

measure that is uncensored. The estimates below should be regarded as the effects of

foster care placement for school-aged children.

         Further, to consider the effect of removal from home, the analysis focuses on the

81% of cases where the alleged perpetrator is a natural parent, step parent, or co-

habitating adult. Also, as noted in section two, sexual abuse cases, which represent 8%

of all investigations, are excluded as well, as they are unlikely to enter the rotational

assignment.9 Last, less than 1% of the observations had missing child characteristics or

had too few case manager investigations to calculate the instrument defined below.




9
  Drug exposure cases that do not enter the rotation largely relate to infants and are excluded due to the age
restriction. The few cases where the initial reporter was listed as the Department of Children and Family
Services were also dropped from the analysis as they likely reflect previous DCFS involvement with the
family.


                                                                                                           14
       In terms of the linkage, 3% of the school-aged children considered here had

missing social security number information. More importantly, social security numbers

were available for roughly 80% of those arrested outside of Cook County in each of the

years, and 65% for those within Cook County. Comparisons of the results for children

from Cook County and those from outside of Cook are complicated by this match quality

and should be considered in the interpretation. Results that use name and date of birth to

link the data sets will be considered as well.

Summary Statistics

       The analysis sample includes nearly 45,000 children, roughly half in Cook

County (which includes the City of Chicago) and half outside of Cook at the time of the

child abuse investigation. To better understand the types of allegations, reporters, and

child characteristics, Table 1 reports summary statistics for children who lived in Cook

County and children who resided outside of Cook County at the time of the abuse

investigation. 16% of the children investigated outside of Cook were eventually placed

in foster care, while 26% of those in Cook County were placed. Approximately 10% of

investigated children are placed in foster care in the U.S. as a whole, and the higher

figures here largely reflect the restriction of the sample to children who received

Medicaid benefits prior to the abuse report.

       Race is one variable that differs greatly between Cook County and non-Cook

investigated children. 71% of the investigated children outside of Cook County are

white, compared to 87% of the population aged 5-14 in 2000. In Cook County, only 12%

of the investigated children are white compared to 60% of the 5-14 year old population.

76% of the investigated children in Cook are African American and 11% are Hispanic




                                                                                           15
compared to 26% and 20% of children in Chicago Public Schools in 1998 (CPS, 1998),

respectively. Roughly half of the investigated children are boys in both groups.

        The most common reporters outside of Cook County were the police (21%), the

family itself (18%), and schools (17%). The police and schools are mandated reporters—

they are required by law to report suspected abuse or neglect. Family reports can stem

from domestic violence reports or from a concerned grandparent, possibly a grandparent

who already houses the child. These family reports are the most common report in Cook

County (27%). The children considered here tend to be older at the time of the report,

with an average age of 11 years old. The average age for all first investigations in Illinois

is 6 years old, and this sample is older due to the restriction that these children are at least

18 years old in 2005.

        Another characteristic observed is the allegation. Roughly half of the allegations

are for abuse, and the other half for neglect. The most common report of neglect is a lack

of supervision, which usually implies that the parent has abandoned a child, though it can

reflect problem behavior for the child as well. 13% of the allegations are due to

environmental neglect, when the child’s living conditions are hazardous. The primary

allegation of abuse is “substantial risk of harm” (29%), which describes situations where

physical harm is thought to be imminent. Physical abuse is cited as the main allegation

18% of the time and is usually described as bruises, cuts, burns, or broken bones.

Together, the characteristics in Table 1 describe the types of cases seen by child

protective services and will be used as controls in the analysis below, including

individual indicators for each age.




                                                                                             16
         Apart from the age difference, the observable characteristics for all investigated

children in Illinois are similar. There were fewer physician reports among the sample

compared to the population of first-investigated children (7-13% vs.17%), reflecting

physician interventions for younger children. Meanwhile, more school reports are found

for this school-aged sample (13-17% vs. 9%). The statewide population is also less likely

to be African American (41% vs. 49%). In terms of allegations, physical abuse reports

were less common among the full population (12% vs. 18%), with much of the difference

coming from the 8% sexual abuse and 5% drug-exposed children who were excluded

because they are less likely to enter the rotational assignment or are too young to be at

risk for an adult arrest by the end of the sample period. Rates of the other major

allegation categories were similar in the full population. Last, the full population

included 43% from Cook County compared to the 48% in the analysis sample.

         The sample of investigated children comes from Illinois, and another comparison

is with all children currently in foster care in the U.S. as a whole. One advantage of

considering Illinois is that it includes a large city as well as smaller cities to compare

results. The average length of stay is 2 years in the U.S. compared to an average length

of stay of 4 years in Illinois during the mid-1990s.10 The average age of foster children

currently in care is 10 years old, with 30% under the age of 5 (US DHHS, 2004).

Illinois also relies more heavily on kinship foster care, with half of all initial placements

going to a relative, compared to 23% for all children currently in family foster care in the

U.S. Last, the sample studied here is disproportionately African American compared to

the US foster care population (49% vs. 35%), with a similar proportion of whites, and


10
  Under court order to reduce lengths of stay, efforts were made to reduce this time in foster care beginning
in 1997.


                                                                                                         17
fewer Hispanics (7% vs. 17%). The focus on older, poorer children should be kept in

mind when interpreting the results.



5.   Estimation

A. Investigator Assignment

         Given the rotational assignment process within geographic teams, the instrument

will be calculated for each case manager-team cell, where the team is defined by the case

team x ZIP code x Hispanic x report year. It measures the fraction of children assigned to

the child’s case manager who are placed in foster care, relative to the placement rate for

children that the investigator was eligible to receive as part of the rotation. The main

analysis is done at the child level, so the instrument is defined for each child i assigned to

case manager c in investigation sub-team j as:

                                  1
         (8) Z icj = d icj ⋅
                               nc − ncj
                                          ∑n
                                          k =− j
                                                   ck   ( R ck − R k )


where d icj is an indicator that the case manager c and sub-team j correspond to the ones

assigned to child i. nc is the total number of children investigated by case manager c, ncj

is the number of children investigated by case manager c in investigation team j, R ck is

the fraction of children investigated by case manager c in sub-team k that are eventually

                                      k
removed from home, and R if that fraction of removals for sub-team k. Results are

similar when the instrument is the mean removal rate the a child’s investigator (outside of

the child’s investigation team) and the analysis uses investigation team fixed effects,

though this global measure is useful in demonstrating the results as shown in the figures

below.



                                                                                            18
         The case manager placement differential is analogous to a case manager fixed

effect in a model predicting removal with sub-team fixed effects. It is calculated for all

sub-teams not including the family’s sub-team, so that each family’s removal decisions

do not enter into their calculation. It is not conditional on child characteristics to allow a

direct examination of whether case manager placement tendencies are related to the

characteristics of a given child’s case. In contrast, a model with controls may mask the

possibility that case managers are assigned to particular types of cases.

         Heckman (1981) and Greene (2001) discuss the ability of small sample sizes per

group to allow for meaningful estimates of fixed effects with a rule of thumb of eight

observations per group. The calculation is restricted to case managers with at least 10

investigations. 733 case managers are considered outside of Cook County and 581 case

managers considered in Cook County, with a weighted average of 74 investigations per

case manager outside of Cook and 80 investigations in Cook County.11 All analyses are

done at the child level, which serves to weight the measures by the number of children to

extract the signal from cells with the least noise.

         The measure is constructed on sub-team cells with more than 1 case manager and

at least 8 cases. Children investigated in sub-team cells that do not meet these

requirements will have a non-missing instrument, however, as it is calculated for all other

sub-team cells. Coincidentally, there are 670 sub-teams used in the calculation in each of

the groups with an average of 24 and 20 observations per cell outside of Cook and within

Cook, respectively. Further, the results were similar when the year interactions were not

used in the cell construction to increase the number of children per cell.

11
  The total number of observations used in the calculation differs slightly from the analysis sample, as sub-
teams with only one case manager are excluded from the calculation. These cases are still assigned a case
manager placement differential, however, as this measure is for all cells other than for a given family.


                                                                                                          19
       The instrument is calculated for the case manager originally assigned to the case.

The foster care placement indicator is equal to 1 if the child is ever removed from home,

and this may occur during a subsequent investigation with a different case manager.

Case managing is well known to be a difficult occupation, with 37% of case managers

who began in 1991 no longer working 5 years later: a cohort with a median tenure of 8

years. As a result, the relationship between the assigned case manager and ultimate foster

care placement is unlikely to be one-to-one, and the strength of this relationship will

instead be an empirical one described by the first stage.

       The resulting instrument reveals some variation in placement rates across case

managers. The instrument has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 9-11% in the

non-Cook and Cook County samples.

       The rules and regulations described in section three imply that families are

effectively randomized to investigators within the rotational assignment pool. If this

were the case, then child characteristics should be similar across investigators and

therefore not predict the case manager’s placement differential. To test this hypothesis,

the instrument was regressed on the child characteristics, including year of investigation

indicators. The standard errors were clustered at the case manager level to reflect

dependence across children assigned to the same investigator.

       Table 2 reports the results and shows that the observable characteristics are

unrelated to the investigator placement differential. In particular, physician, police, and

other government reporters, as well as an indicator for African Americans, are highly

positively correlated with foster care placement, yet little relationship is found with the

investigator differential in both the magnitude and sign of the coefficients.




                                                                                              20
         Another test to see whether case managers with high removal frequencies are

assigned more problematic cases is to examine the length of stay once in foster care.

More abusive families can be expected to result in longer stays away from home. If strict

case managers are assigned to these families, then length of stay should be correlated

with the placement differential. In these samples, children typically stay in care for 4

years outside of Cook and for 5 years within Cook. A higher case manager placement

differential is not related to the length of stay, however.12

         To further explore the type of care received, the type of placement can be

compared as well. Although case managers do not supervise foster children once placed

in care, case managers do investigate the family and may be aware of a relative willing to

provide foster care, as described in section three. Nevertheless, an initial placement with

relatives is not related to the case manager placement differential. Of the children placed

in foster care in the samples considered here, 31% of children outside of Cook and 59%

of children in Cook were initially placed with relatives. A ten percentage-point increase

in the case manager placement differential is associated with only a 0.006 percentage-

point increase in the likelihood of relative placement for children outside of Cook

County, and a 0.0004 percentage-point decrease in the likelihood of relative placement in

Cook County. This is not surprising given the administrative rule that relatives are

sought first for any child placed in foster care. Still, the lack of a relationship between

the investigator and the placement type is suggestive that the investigator has little impact

on the type of care received once in foster care.

12
   A ten percentage-point increase in the case manager placement differential is associated with a 0.2%
reduction in the length of stay in foster care outside of Cook County, and a 0.3% reduction in the length of
stay for children in Cook County, with neither estimate statistically significant. This also suggests that the
foster care system does not correct for investigator tendencies by varying the length of stay of children once
they are placed.


                                                                                                          21
         Finally, if case managers with higher removal frequencies place particular types

of children who just so happen to be more frequently observed, this would be a violation

of the monotonicity condition. If this were the case, then observable characteristics, such

as allegations or reporters, may be more prevalent for case managers with higher

placement differentials, conditional on foster care placement. When the case manager

placement differential is regressed on child characteristics for children placed in foster

care, however, child characteristics are again unrelated to the case manager placement

differential in each of the samples.

B. Foster Care Placement and Crime Outcomes

         A first look at the results is shown in Figure 1. Consider Figure 1A, which

considers children outside of Cook County. The x-axis is the investigator placement

differential, which is mean zero and ranges from -0.25 to 0.25. The two lines report local

linear regressions of the removal indicator and the arrest indicator against the case

manager placement differential, evaluated at each percentile of the differential.13

         The placement differential is positively related to the foster care placement rate in

both geographic groups. Outside of Cook, an increase in the differential from the 10th

percentile to the 90th percentile, representing an increase from -0.10 to 0.11, is associated

with an increase in foster care placement from 0.14 to 0.21, for an implied first-stage

estimate of 0.33. That would imply that an increase in the placement rate by 10% is

associated with an increase in the placement rate by 3.3%, or 21% of the mean placement



13
  The results are shown using pilot bandwidths that were chosen by minimizing the sum of squared errors
between the local linear estimator and a fourth-degree polynomial model. For the foster care placement
regression, the bandwidth is 0.034. For the arrest regression the bandwidth is 0.056. Results are robust to
bandwidths down to 0.01, with larger fluctuations with bandwidths below 0.02, although the similarity in
shapes remains at the smaller bandwidths.


                                                                                                         22
rate. Figure 1B shows a similar increase in Cook County: from 0.22 to 0.31, for a first-

stage estimate of 0.43.

        Given the implied 1st stage coefficients of close to one-third, the arrest rate graphs

use the second vertical axis and the scale is one-third of the placement rate axis. One

feature is that the arrest rates are fairly high despite the potential for measurement error

due to the linkage between the systems. 26% of the investigated children outside of Cook

County, and 22% of those from Cook, were found arrested between 2000 and 2005.

When restricted to children aged 25 in 2005, the arrest rates are 40% and 35% for boys

for the two geographic categories and 27% for girls in both samples.

        Figure 1A shows that the arrest rate relationship is remarkably similar in shape to

the foster care placement relationship for children outside of Cook County. For the

change from the 10th percentile to the 90th percentile considered above, the arrest rate for

children outside of Cook County increases from 0.25 to 0.28. For children from Cook

County, the arrest rate does not vary as systematically with the placement differential.14

        As a means of comparison, a predicted probability of placement was calculated

from a probit model that included the control variables listed in Table 1. This

combination of the child characteristics is unrelated to the case manager placement

differential, as expected given the rotational assignment process (see Appendix Figures

A1A and A1B).15 While children assigned to investigators with high placement rates are

more likely to be placed in foster care themselves, and have higher arrest rates later in life

among those from outside of Cook County, their observable characteristics do not predict



14
   Bandwidths were chosen as with Figure 1A, with the placement bandwidth of 0.080 and the arrest
bandwidth of 0.043.
15
   Bandwidths in Figures A1A and A1B mirror those for the placement relationship in Figures 1A and 1B.


                                                                                                    23
that they would be more likely to placed in foster care compared to children assigned to

low removal rate investigators.

Foster Care Placement

        To test the first-stage relationship that children assigned to case managers with

high removal differentials are more likely to be placed in foster care with and without

controls for child characteristics, the estimating equation for child i assigned to an

investigator c in sub-team j in year t is:

        (9) Ricj = φ 0 + φ1 Z icj + φ 2 X i + ∑ δ k 1(t i = k ) + ω icj
                                               k


where δ represents a vector of year effects for the date of child i’s investigation. This

equation will be estimated using a linear probability model, though results are similar

with a probit model.

        Table 3 reports the results. Columns (1) and (5) report the coefficients for models

without any controls. The coefficient for the sample outside of Cook is 0.23 and within

Cook it is 0.27. When controls are introduced, the coefficients are similar: 0.23 and

0.26, reflecting that the instrument is unrelated to the observable child characteristics.

In contrast, these variables are associated with foster care placement. For example,

physician, police, and other government reports are strongly associated with increases in

the likelihood of foster care placement compared to school reports, and African American

children are also more likely to be placed.

        The probability of removal does not increase one-for-one with the case manager

removal rate. This is likely due to measurement error that attenuates the effect toward

zero. First, the case manager of the initial investigation is used to characterize the case

manager type, though this may not represent the case manager in subsequent



                                                                                              24
investigations given the investigator turnover described above. Second, the case manager

is the lead investigator in the case, whereas a judge has the final say on foster care stays.

Nevertheless, the removal rate is associated with placements, with F-statistics of close to

40, well above the rule of thumb of 10 for weak instruments (Stock, Wright, and Yogo,

2002).

         Some information is known about the case manager as well, including sex, race,

experience, educational attainment (master’s degree), and Spanish-speaking ability. The

most stable relationship in these data is that male case managers are slightly less likely to

be associated with foster care placement. These case manager characteristics are much

less predictive compared to the case manager’s placement differential, however. It

appears that differences in removal rates are more idiosyncratic than systematic when it

comes to case manager characteristics.

Child Outcomes

         To consider a model of child outcomes, with and without controls, the empirical

models will consider outcomes, Y, for child i investigated by case manager c in sub-team

j during in year t of the form:

         (10) Yicj = α 0 + α 1 Ricj + α 2 X i + ∑ δ k 1(t i = k ) + ν icj
                                                  k



where the case manager placement differential, Z icj , will be used as an instrument for the

indicator for removal, Ricj .

Adult Arrests

         Table 4 reports the results for arrests. The first two columns report the mean

comparisons across children who were placed in foster care with investigated children

who were not placed. These results are of some interest in themselves, as long-term


                                                                                            25
outcome data are generally unavailable for this group of children. The results show that

children who were placed in foster care have higher arrest rates: 6-7.5 percentage points

higher (compared to a mean arrest rate of 26%) for children outside of Cook County. A 3

percentage-point difference is found in Cook County (compared to a mean of 22%)

shown in columns (7) and (8).

       Columns (3), (4), (9), and (10) mirror the reduced-form results from Figure 1A

and 1B. An increase in the investigator placement differential from -0.1 to 0.1 is

associated with an 18 percentage-point increase in the likelihood of an arrest outside of

Cook County, while a similar change in the differential within Cook County is associated

with only a 4-5 percentage-point increase. The Cook County result is not significantly

different from zero as well.

       Last, Columns (5) and (6) report the 2SLS results for children who were residing

outside of Cook, and foster care placement is associated with very large (39 percentage

points) differences in arrest rates, with a relatively large standard error (19 percentage

points) as well. The larger IV results suggest that the estimated causal effects of foster

care on arrest rates are worse than the conditional means comparison in Columns (1) and

(2) would imply, although differences between the IV and non-IV results are not

statistically significant. A key difference between the two sets of results is that the IV

calculation estimates the effects for marginal cases—those induced into foster care due to

the case manager assignment. The usual omitted variables bias in the means

comparison—that foster children come from worse families and would have worse

outcomes regardless of placement—may be outweighed by a selection bias: children

with higher expected benefits from foster care placement, such as severely abused




                                                                                             26
children, are more likely to be placed. As a result, the means comparison may understate

any negative effect from placement among marginal cases.

        The results suggest that if 10% of “marginal” cases are placed in foster care, then

the arrest rate would be 3 times higher for foster children outside of Cook County, which

is possible with juvenile arrest rates of 50-67% for children who age out of foster care.16

The large coefficients and standard errors suggest that caution in the interpretation is

warranted.

        Columns (11) and (12) report the 2SLS results for children from Cook County.

The estimates have coefficients of 0.10 and 0.08, with standard errors of 0.10. The point

estimate suggests that the arrest rate is 1.5 times higher for children who were placed in

foster care compared to investigated children who were not placed in care, though the

large standard errors place less confidence in these estimates.

        Doyle (2007) used the IV strategy employed here to consider juvenile

delinquency in Cook County and found point estimates that suggested a delinquency rate

that was 3 times higher for children placed in foster care. This suggests that some of

these children may have already been in prison during 2000-2005, though the point

estimates are nearly identical when the subset of children who were less than 18 in 2000

were considered to avoid left censoring in the arrest indicator.

        One issue with the Cook vs. non-Cook comparison is that the data quality appears

to be better outside of Cook as described in the data description and evidenced by an

imprisonment match rate that is more consistent with the population (described below).


16
  To have a 26% arrest rate, a 10% placement rate, and a 39 percentage-point difference would require
arrest rates of 61% for those placed and 22% for those not placed [0.1(X+0.39) + 0.9(X) = 0.26 Æ
X=0.22]. Similarly for those in Cook County the implied arrest rates woujld be 30% vs. 20% [0.1(X+0.1)
+ 0.9(X) = 0.21 Æ X=0.20].


                                                                                                    27
When matches were done by the name and date of birth (where names were first

transformed using SOUNDEX software so that similar names have the same linkage

variable) 34% of children outside Cook County, and 40% of children within Cook

County, are matched to the arrest database. The imprisonment rate remains low for the

Cook County sample, however. The IV estimate for arrests increases for children from

Cook County to 0.20 (s.e.=0.11), as shown in Appendix Table A1. Meanwhile, the

estimates are slightly smaller for children from outside of Cook: 0.23 with a standard

error of 0.21. These results suggest that the comparison of Cook vs. non-Cook children

should be treated with caution as differences may stem from the ability to match children

to adults.

Heterogeneity in Treatment Effects

        The remainder of the paper explores these results further by considering related

outcomes such as convictions and prison sentences following the arrest; marginal

treatment effects discussed in section two; and results for subgroups such as boys versus

girls and older children versus younger ones at the time of the investigation. Given the

fairly large standard errors in the instrumental variables estimates, these results should be

considered more exploratory than definitive. Further, the discussion will focus on the

differences found for children from outside of Cook County, with Cook County results

reported in the appendix.

Convictions and Prison Sentences

        First, it is possible to consider whether these arrests lead to worse outcomes such

as convictions and prison sentences. Panel A of Table 5 reports regressions of the form

of equation (10), where the outcome is whether the individual was found guilty or had a




                                                                                           28
judgment withheld during 2000-2005. Results are similar when the outcome is simply a

guilty verdict17, though a withheld judgment is often used as a probationary measure.

These results are not independent of the arrest results, as those with a conviction were

arrested first.

        The results outside of Cook County mirror the arrest results, with higher mean

differences among former foster children compared to those who were not placed in care

(4 percentage points higher compared to a mean of 15%). The reduced-form estimate

shows that children assigned to high removal investigators have higher conviction rates,

with a coefficient of 0.09 (s.e.=0.035), and a 2SLS coefficient of 0.40 (s.e.=0.15).

Prison Sentences

        The prison sentence rate for this sample is 6.6%, including 9.8% for boys.18 By

comparison, 0.73% of white males between the ages of 20 and 24 residing in Illinois

outside of Cook County entered prison in 2000, while 5.4% of African American males

in that group entered prison in 2000.19 When the age is restricted to children who were

18 in 2000, to avoid any left censoring, the prison sentence rate for boys outside of Cook

County increases to 15%.20

        Panel B of Table 5 shows the results for a prison sentence between 2000 and

2005. The prison sentence results again mirror the earlier results, with higher OLS
17
   The mean of the guilty-only outcome is 11%, and the reduced form coefficient is 0.075 (s.e.=0.031) with
a 2SLS estimate of 0.33 (s.e.=0.14)
18
   Despite high arrest rates, the prison sentence rate in Cook County is 1.9%, much lower than Cook
County imprisonment rates for this population would imply. This suggests that the linkage to the
sentencing data may be worse in Cook County. Another consideration is that these individuals may already
be in prison by 2000. When children who were 18 in 2000 were considered, 4% of boys in Cook County
were found to be sentenced to prison during the 2000-2005 time period in these data.

   Author’s calculations using the US Census population data by county and prison data from the Bureau of
Justice Statistics’ National Corrections Reporting Program for 2000. The rate is similar to the published
numbers described in US DOJ (2007).
20
   When children who were less than 18 in 2000 are considered, the results are qualitatively similar. The
reduced-form coefficient for the arrest outcome is 0.08 (s.e.=0.047), and the coefficient for the prison
sentence outcome is 0.053 (s.e.=0.023).


                                                                                                       29
differences in imprisonment (3 percentage points compared to a mean of 6.6%), as well

as higher imprisonment rates for those assigned to investigators with higher removal

rates: a reduced form coefficient of 0.05 (s.e.=0.023) and a 2SLS coefficient of 0.22

(s.e.=0.10).

       Within Cook County, the results for convictions and prison sentences show little

effect of foster care placement for marginal cases. When the databases were matched by

name and date of birth instead of the social security number, however, the estimated

effect for convictions increases to 0.097 (s.e.=0.10), and an imprecisely estimated (but

positive) point estimate for the prison sentence outcome is found as well. For children

from outside of Cook, the estimates are somewhat smaller for convictions, though a

similar estimate is found for the prison outcome (see Appendix Table A1).

Marginal Treatment Effects

       To further explore the source of the linear IV results, it is possible to estimate

marginal treatment effects as described in section two. Four sets of results are presented:

the arrest indicator for children from outside of Cook and within Cook, as well as the

conviction and prison indicators for children from outside of Cook. Given that the linear

IV results were similar with and without controls, the MTE estimates will be calculated

without controls for child characteristics.

       To estimate the marginal treatment effects, the predicted probability of placement

was estimated using a probit model. The case manager placement differential was the

only explanatory variable in the model to capture the variation in placement solely due to

the instrument. These predicted probabilities range from 0.11 to 0.23 for children from

outside of Cook and 0.20 to 0.34 for children from Cook. With the lack of full support




                                                                                            30
for the probability of placement on the unit interval, especially at the extremes, it is not

possible to estimate parameters such as the average treatment effect. Instead, marginal

treatment effects can be estimated. These parameters are necessarily dependent on the

instrument considered, though an advantage of the instrument considered here is that it

exploits variation that is naturally within the bounds of likely policy changes.

         Next, the relationship between the outcome indicators and this predicted

probability was estimated using a local quadratic estimator.21 As suggested by Figure 1,

the arrest rate increases with the placement propensity. For arrests among children from

outside of Cook County, for example, an increase from the 10th percentile of predicted

placement to the 90th percentile (an increase from 0.13 to 0.19) is associated with an

increase in the arrest rate from 0.25 to 0.27, for an estimated local average treatment

effect of 0.33 (see Appendix Figure A2A).

         The derivative of these relationships provides the marginal treatment effect

estimates.22 Figure 2 reports the results, along with 5 to 95% percent confidence intervals

calculated using a bootstrap procedure clustered at the case manager level. The

propensity score was re-estimated in each of the 250 re-samplings to capture the variation

in the point estimates caused by estimating this variable.

         Figure 2A shows that the MTE function for arrests among children from outside

of Cook County is above zero and the mass is centered around the linear IV estimate of

21
   The local quadratic estimator was chosen because the first derivative of the relationship is sought and
local quadratic estimators are thought to have better properties (Fan and Gijbels, 2000). In practical terms,
the results are nearly identical when a local linear regression was estimated instead. The pilot bandwidths
were again chosen by minimizing the sum of squared errors between the local quadratic estimator and a
fourth-degree polynomial model, and are 0.031, 0.060, 0.085, and 0.048 to arrive at the MTE estimates in
Figures 2A-2D, respectively. Results are robust to bandwidths from 0.01 to 0.1. For example, at a
bandwidth of 0.01, the arrest rate for children from outside of Cook County is increasing for the first thirty
percentiles of predicted placement, is flat for the next thirty percentiles at 0.26, and increases for the
remaining percentiles up to a maximum of 0.29 at the 97th percentile.
22
   The derivative comes directly from the local quadratic coefficients.


                                                                                                            31
0.4. The function is also upward sloping, with noisy estimates at the extremes, although

it is not possible to reject a zero slope. Nevertheless, the implied upward slope in the

point estimates is suggestive that the children on the margin of placement among the high

removal investigators have the largest increases in arrest rates. These are likely children

with unobservable characteristics that make them the least likely to be placed in foster

care, reflecting the selection of children into foster care who are more likely to benefit

(or, in this case, appear less likely to be harmed in terms of adult arrests).

       Figure 2B shows that the IV estimate of zero for children from Cook County is at

the center of the MTE estimates. The estimates are above zero with higher arrest rate

effects found for children with both low and high propensities of placement associated

with the investigator assignment. Figure 2C shows the conviction results for children

from outside Cook, and again the estimates are above zero and the function has an

upward slope. Last, Figure 2D reports the results for the prison outcome and here the

MTE estimates are close to 0.25 for the bulk of the data, with lower estimates for the first

10 percentiles of predicted placement.

       Among children who are not on the margin, either because it is clear there was no

abuse or it is clear the child must be protected, the effects of foster care placement are not

identified. For less clear cases, the upward slopes, especially for arrests and convictions,

suggest that children who are on the margin among high removal rate investigators—

children likely to have unobservables associated with a lower likelihood of placement—

have worse crime outcomes when placed in foster care compared to children on the

margin among low removal rate investigators.

Child Characteristics




                                                                                             32
           Given that the instrumental variable results are imprecisely estimated, differences

across groups of children are not found to be statistically significantly from one another.

These results are again more exploratory than definitive, but may highlight the types of

children whose placement in foster care may lead to criminal activity.

           Table 6 reports the results for the three outcomes of arrests, convictions, and

prison sentences for children outside of Cook County. The largest difference in both the

level of the outcomes and the size of the estimated effects is found for the comparison of

boys versus girls. Boys are more likely to be found arrested (31% vs. 22%), more likely

to be found guilty or have a verdict withheld (19% vs. 11%), and more likely to be found

sentenced to prison (10% vs. 3.3%). The OLS results show that those who are placed in

foster care have higher arrest, conviction, and imprisonment rates for both boys and girls.

The IV results show larger coefficients for girls in terms of arrests and convictions. In

terms of prison sentences, boys have the large IV coefficient and the girl’s coefficient is

much smaller and statistically insignificant. Once subgroups are considered, some of the

estimates lose their statistical significance, although the similarity in the point estimates

tends to confirm the earlier results. The one exception is the point estimate for the prison

outcome among girls, which loses economic and statistical significance.

           In terms of allegations, the results are similar whether the allegation is abuse or

neglect, though the prison sentence outcome is found to be stronger for abuse cases.23

The results are similar when broken out separately for white cases and African American

cases, with larger IV point estimates for each outcome category compared to the pooled

results.

23
  Another difference between Cook and non Cook cases is the frequency of family reports. When these
are excluded, the IV point estimates remain large, but are somewhat smaller. For example, in terms of
arrests, the 2SLS estimate is 0.275 with a s.e. of 0.19.


                                                                                                        33
        One important caveat when interpreting the main results is that these children are

between 4 and 16 years old when they are investigated to allow for an examination of

longer-term outcomes. One way to begin to investigate the role of age is to consider

children who were investigated when they were under the age of 10 with those who were

10 years old or older. The removal rates are somewhat higher for the younger children

(17% vs. 15%), as they were at risk of removal for longer periods of time. The point

estimates suggest that the effects are similar for both age groups.

        Last, the probability of foster care placement was estimated with a probit

including only the child controls. Then the sample was broken into two groups based on

their predicted foster care placement. Note that this analysis differs from the MTE results

which considered children with similar observable characteristics among those at the

margin of placement, while this exercise compares the effects of placement across

children who have different observable characteristics. The last two columns of Table 6

report the results for these two groups. The placement rate is 11% in the low predicted

placement group and 25% in the high-predicted placement group. The results are fairly

similar across the groups with a somewhat larger IV point estimate in terms of arrests for

the high probability of removal group, and somewhat larger point estimates for the low

removal rate group for the conviction and prison outcomes.

        The results for Cook County are in the appendix and, as expected, these results

are somewhat less stable. Smaller point estimates are found for children suspected of

being neglected, within race categories (where the relationship is often negative), and for

boys.

Violent vs. Property Crime




                                                                                          34
       The arrest data also record whether the nature of the offense is drug related,

property, violent, or other. Results are compared across the different types of arrest

categories. These categories are not mutually exclusive, as each individual may be

arrested within one or more categories over the 2000-2005 time period.

       The results are reported in Table 7 for children investigated outside of Cook

County. When arrests for each type of offense were estimated separately, the results

revealed no effect on drug arrests, either in OLS or in the reduced form, despite a 7.5%

drug arrest rate. Property crime arrests were found for 10.5% of the investigated

children, and the OLS results show that those placed in foster care had a 3.5 percentage-

point higher property-crime arrest rate (s.e.=0.6). The reduced-form coefficient was

0.058 with a 2SLS estimate of 0.21 (s.e.=0.10). Results were similar for violent crime,

which had an 8.7% arrest rate, with an OLS estimate of 0.027 (s.e.=0.006), a reduced

form coefficient of 0.050 (s.e.=0.023), and a 2SLS estimate of 0.16 (s.e.=0.11).

       It might be expected that abuse cases lead to more violent crime compared to

neglect cases though a “cycle of violence” (Widom, 1989). The violent crime arrest rate

measured here is 8.4% for children investigated for abuse, and a similar rate of 7.9% is

found for those investigated for neglect. In terms of the estimated effects of foster care,

the IV point estimates were somewhat larger for abuse cases compared to neglect cases,

similar to Table 6, although this was found for both the violent crime and property crime

arrest categories.

Recidivism, Felony convictions, and Prison Sentence Length

       The results largely mirror those above for children outside of Cook County when

other severity measures are considered. For example, repeat arrests during 2000-2005




                                                                                           35
show similar increases with foster care placement, with a mean of 14% and an IV point

estimate of 0.34 (s.e.=0.15). An indicator for being found guilty or having a judgment

withheld when the arrest offense was a felony has a mean of 5.3% and an IV point

estimate of 0.19 (s.e.=0.088). Another measure of the severity of the arrests is whether

the individual ever received a prison sentence of one or more years. 2.3% of the

investigated children were found to have at least one such sentence between 2000 and

2005, and the IV point estimate is 0.13 with a standard error of 0.067.

Robustness Checks

       Appendix Table A1 reports some robustness checks. First, the results outside of

Cook County were similar when a probit and IV probit models were used, with somewhat

larger point estimates and somewhat smaller standard errors in terms of arrests and

convictions. The indicator for a prison sentence, the outcome that was least likely and,

therefore, more likely to be affected by the functional form chosen, exhibits a larger IV

point estimate and a larger standard error when the probit model was used. Within Cook

County, the arrest estimates are again similar with the probit model.

       Second, models with ZIP code fixed effects to control for neighborhood

characteristics that may influence criminal activity showed similar results, as expected as

the instrument was calculated within ZIP code categories. Last, the estimates when the

databases were matched by name and date of birth are reported, as described above.

Limitations

       In addition to the potential for violations of the identifying assumptions described

in section two, one limitation of the estimation is that the outcomes are for adults in

Illinois. To the extent that children in foster care are more likely to remain in Illinois as




                                                                                            36
adults, we may find a higher match rate.24 In fact, it may be that assignment to strict case

manager may encourage families to leave the state, although this should lead to smaller

estimated effects of foster care. One piece of evidence against this possibility of

differential migration among those assigned to strict investigators is that Doyle (2007)

found lower employment rates (matches to the Illinois unemployment insurance

database) among those who entered foster care. In the end, foster care may have an effect

on both the propensity to be imprisoned (and employed), as well as on migration.

         Another limitation is that the empirical strategy does not lend itself to an analysis

of the effect of the length of stay in foster care on outcomes. When models are

considered for children who were either not removed or were in foster care for more than

1 year, the results are nearly identical. This is partly due to the fact that most children are

in care for more than 1 year in these samples.



7. Conclusion

         Foster care placement is a major intervention into the lives of children who appear

to be at high risk of poor life outcomes, including adult criminality and subsequent arrests

and incarceration. Previous work has found strong correlations with foster care

placement and incarceration, yet whether placement results in greater or lower arrest rates

has not been considered. The analysis here uses the effective randomization of abuse

investigators to families to estimate causal effects of placement on crime outcomes.

Children assigned to investigators with higher removal rates are more likely to be placed

in foster care and are found to have higher arrest and imprisonment rates, as well. The


24
  In fact, it may be that assignment to strict case manager may encourage families to leave the state. This
should lead to lower Illinois arrest rates, however.


                                                                                                         37
point estimates are large and relatively imprecisely estimated, however, which suggests

some caution in the interpretation. Nevertheless, the estimates suggest that large benefits

from foster care placement are unlikely for this group of children at the margin of

placement, at least for the outcomes considered here.

           The results are strongest for children outside of Cook County, where the match to

the state police data appears more accurate. When children and arrested adults were

matched by names and dates of birth, the results are less precise, but the point estimates

show similar increases in arrest rates across the geographic areas.

           When interpreting the results three main caveats should be kept in mind. First,

the sample consists of school-age welfare recipients investigated in Illinois, a large urban

state where placement of children with family members is more popular than the nation

as a whole. Future work will consider younger children as they become at risk for adult

arrests.

           Second, the results consider a group on the margin of placement. While this

speaks directly to the policy question of whether we should place greater emphasis on

family preservation or child protection, it does not attempt to measure the benefit of

placement for children in such danger that all investigators would agree the child should

be placed in care.

           Last, the outcomes studied here may relate to child wellbeing, though they may

not reflect the potential prevention of serious child abuse in extreme cases. To the extent

that the children on the margin of placement are less likely to suffer from the most

serious abuse, this may be less of a concern. Still, child welfare agencies may be willing

to trade off higher adult crime rates for slightly lower levels of serious abuse.

The models with zip code fixed effects eliminated observations in ZIP Codes with only one observation, resulting in a slightly smaller sample size. Match using
name and date of birth (DOB) allows the use of individuals with missing social security numbers, resulting in larger sample sizes. Columns (1) and (4) are estimates
from probit models with marginal effects reported, while the remaining columns are estimates from linear models. All models include the full set of controls.
