                                            ABSTRACT

An ongoing debate in employment policy is whether promoting small and medium enterprises creates
more employment. Do small enterprises generate more employment growth than larger firms? We
use the elimination of small-scale industry (SSI) promotion in India to address this question. For 60
years, SSI promotion in India focused on reserving certain products for manufacture by small and
medium establishments. We identify the consequences for employment growth, investment, output,
productivity, and wages of dismantling India’s SSI reservations. We exploit variation in the timing
of de-reservation across products; our identification strategy is also robust to measuring the long-run
impact of national SSI policy changes using variation in pre-treatment exposure at the district level,
and to conducting placebo tests using products that were never de-reserved. Districts more exposed
to de-reservation experienced higher employment and wage growth. The results suggest that promoting
employment growth in the Indian case was not achieved via SSI reservation policies.

1. Introduction
    An ongoing debate in employment policy is whether promoting small and medium enterprises creates

more employment. Do small enterprises generate more employment growth than larger firms? For the

past 60 years, India has attempted to boost employment growth by shielding small manufacturing

establishments from competition. Promotion measures have included subsidized credit, technical

assistance, excise tax exemptions, preference in government procurement, and subsidies for power and

capital. Until recently, the “premier instrument” for protecting small establishments was a policy of

reserving a number of products for exclusive production by small-scale industry. Proponents of small

establishment promotion have argued that these policies encourage labor-intensive growth, mitigate

capital market imperfections, and shift income towards lower wage earners (Hussain, 1997).


    Critics of small and medium establishment promotion in India argued that these policies in fact

discouraged their growth and slowed the overall expansion of the manufacturing sector. Mohan (2002)

documents that following a major expansion of the number of products reserved for small establishments

in 1978, manufacturing employment growth slowed down. He argues that small establishments making

reserved products have been prevented from growing or upgrading their technology, because they would

have had to stop making those products if their investment grew above the allowed limits for small-scale

industry (SSI). In a similar vein, Panagariya (2008) argues that the policy of reserving many labor-

intensive products for SSIs has limited Indian exports of these products.


    In this paper, we address two related questions. First, was the SSI reservation policy an effective tool

for job creation? While our ultimate concern is how best to promote employment creation, India’s

dismantling of this policy – which was specifically targeted at promoting small establishments – allows us

to address the linkages between establishment size and job growth.           The dismantling of the SSI

reservation policy began in 1997 and resulted in the near complete removal of reservations by 2008,

allowing us to identify the impact of de-reservation on the growth of employment, output, investment,



                                              Page 2                            draft date: 11/7/2014
and wages. This period was characterized by few other reforms, as most of the trade liberalization and

dismantling of the License Raj had been done in previous decades. Second, we can use our data to

directly answer the question: do small establishments generate faster employment growth?


    We use a newly available panel dataset from India’s Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) to explore the

linkages between establishment size and employment growth in the Indian context and to use the removal

of the SSI reservations policy to cast light on these questions. While these data were previously available

as a repeated cross-section, the new dataset provides unique establishment identifiers, allowing us to

bypass the tricky business of trying to link establishments through beginning and end of year accounting

information. To explore the impact of the SSI reforms, we classify establishments into incumbents (those

already producing the reserved product) versus entrants (those that moved into the product space after the

product was de-reserved). Due to enormous heterogeneity in which products were reserved within any

one industry, we conduct most of the analysis at the establishment level. We also explore the net impact

of de-reservation at the district level. The panel dataset does not include district identifiers; however, we

have created the first mapping of the panel dataset to district locations by merging these in from the

annual cross-sections that we purchased separately.


    We find that when products were removed from the reserved list, the average incumbent stagnated,

while the average entrant grew. The net impact on employment growth of removing protection for small

and medium enterprises is positive. De-reservation increased the growth of larger establishments relative

to smaller establishments, and reduced employment growth among smaller, older establishments. De-

reservation also encouraged the growth of young entrants and incumbents who were previously

constrained by the capital limits.


    We directly address the potential endogeneity of the reforms. In 1996, at the height of the SSI

policies, more than 1,000 products were reserved for production by small and medium enterprises. By

2008, restrictions on all but 20 products had been eliminated. Since the reform quickly led to the removal



                                               Page 3                            draft date: 11/7/2014
of 98 percent of all products from the reserved list, we are able to avoid the selection associated with a

partial reform. We are fortunate that most of India’s other major reforms, including delicensing and

major trade reform episodes, were completed before the period of our analysis.             We address the

sequencing of the reforms by documenting that there are no pre-treatment trends indicating higher or

lower employment growth before products were de-reserved, and that the products de-reserved during

early years were not systematically situated in industries with large establishment size. We then conduct

two falsification tests. The first test assigns false de-reservation status to those very few products

remaining that were not de-reserved, while the second test assigns false treatment status two years prior to

the real de-reservation. In each case the effect of the true de-reservation remains robust, while the false

de-reservation shows no effect.

    Our second approach to possible endogeneity of the SSI reforms exploits the fact that SSI policies

were set nationally but their effects are identified locally depending on prior exposure. At the district

level, the elimination of SSI policies was an exogenous shock whose severity was greatest in regions

whose pre-existing production structure included a large share of reserved products.           We create a

concordance that allows us to link our establishment -level panel to Indian districts. We then compare

changes in employment, output, investment, and wage outcomes for districts that were more or less

exposed to the de-reservation based on their pre-existing product mix. Using product mix prior to the SSI

reforms and tracing treatment at the district level based on the prior allocation of SSI reservations is our

preferred approach to addressing potential endogeneity concerns. Estimating district-wide impacts also

allows us to measure the net impact on employment outcomes across both shrinking (incumbent)

establishments and expanding (new entrants into previously restricted products) establishments.


    We find that districts that were more exposed to the de-reservation based on their pre-treatment

product mix experienced higher employment and wage growth over the period from 2000 to 2007. The

results suggest that the average change in the fraction of de-reserved employment (0.095) is associated

with a 7% increase in district-level employment.



                                              Page 4                            draft date: 11/7/2014
    Our measure of employment is based on the ASI, which covers all establishments with 10 or more

workers using power, or 20 or more workers without power; thus our results suggest that de-reservation

was associated with increased organized (formal) sector employment. The de-reservation may also have

affected informal (unorganized) manufacturing employment. 2 If de-reservation simply pushed some

workers into informality, then this would be a negative outcome that our ASI data would miss. To

investigate this possibility, we conduct a similar, district-level analysis using unorganized manufacturing

surveys from 2000 and 2005. We find no statistically significant association between the fraction of de-

reservation and district-level employment in unorganized manufacturing. If anything, the evidence

suggests that de-reservation may be associated with workers shifting from the unorganized to the

organized sector.


    India’s policy of reserving products for exclusive manufacture by SSIs is unique, but its concern for

promoting small and medium enterprises is shared by many countries. The evidence to date on firm size

and employment growth in developing countries is mixed. A number of studies document that small firms

grow faster than large firms (Mead and Liedholm, 1998; Gunning and Mengistae, 2001 and Bigsten and

Gebreeyesus, 2007; Sleuwaegen and Goedhuys, 2002). In contrast, VanBiesebroeck (2005) shows that

after controlling for a number of other characteristics, medium and large firms in nine sub-Saharan

African countries grow faster than small firms. Meanwhile, Teal (1998) and Harding, Soderbom and

Teal (2004) find little relationship between firm size and growth in Ghana, Kenya and Tanzania.


    For India, both Das (1995) and Shanmugam and Bhaduri (2002) document that small firms grow

more quickly; however, these analyses are limited to small, specialized subsets of Indian manufacturing

and do not shed light on why overall employment growth in labor-intensive industries has been slow.

More recently, Garcia-Santana and Pijoan-Mas (2014) calibrate a span-of-control model that accounts for



2 India uses the terms “unorganized” and “informal” to mean slightly different things. Our data cover the
unorganized sector, although we use the two terms interchangeably.




                                                  Page 5                              draft date: 11/7/2014
the reservation policy, using data from 2001, when most reservations were still in place. They simulate

the effects of removing the reservation policy and predict that doing so would increase manufacturing

output by nearly 7 percent. To our knowledge, ours is the first paper to empirically test the results of the

actual dismantling of the SSI reservations policy at the establishment level, which makes it quite

complementary to Garcia-Santana and Pijoan-Mas. Our finding that the average decline in reservations

would increase employment by approximately 7 percent at the district-level is remarkably close to the

simulation results for output generated by their structural model. However, our primary focus is on

generating employment, not output.


    While this paper focuses primarily on the linkages between establishment size and employment

growth, there is also a related literature on policy distortions, productivity growth, and reallocation of

production in developing countries. This includes Aghion, Burgess, Redding, and Zilibotti (2005), Alfaro

and Chari (2009, forthcoming), Banerjee (2006), Besley and Burgess (2004), Goldberg, Khandelwal,

Pavcnik and Topalova (2010a, 2010b), and Hsieh and Olken (2014). Aghion et al (2005) and Besley and

Burgess (2004) are both important early papers on the costs of regulation in India that show how licensing

and labor market regulations had significant but heterogeneous costs for both growth and productivity.

However, they do not address directly the linkages between promoting small establishments and

employment growth. Besley and Burgess (2004) emphasize the movement to informal sector enterprises

as a result of regulation, an issue which we address at the end of this paper using the NSS unorganized

manufacturing data.


    Alfaro and Chari (2009, forthcoming) examine more broadly changes in market structure and firm

behavior over a longer time period spanning before and after the 1991 reforms. Alfaro and Chari (2009)

find that firms which dominated in the early years continue to dominate in later decades, with the

exception of the services sector where there is more significant dynamism. Despite significant entry by

new firms, Alfaro and Chari show (using the Prowess data of all publicly listed firms) continued

dominance of state-owned enterprises and older manufacturing enterprises.               Alfaro and Chari


                                              Page 6                            draft date: 11/7/2014
(forthcoming) examine the impact of the 1991 reforms on the overall size distribution of firms, finding

that the reforms led to the entry of many small firms and reinforced the role of larger firms. Our paper is

complementary to these, as we focus specifically on the removal of SSI policies, a reform which occurred

after the major trade reforms and delicensing of earlier years.


    Goldberg, Khandelwal, Pavcnik and Topalova (2010a) are the first authors to use product-level data

for India. They explore the determinants of new product introductions as a function of the earlier trade

reforms, which were largely completed by the time the SSI liberalization occurred. Goldberg et al find

that falling input tariffs account for more than a 30 percent increase in new product introductions during

their sample period. Goldberg, Khandelwal, Pavcnik and Topalova (2010b) examine whether the

rationalization of product lines is linked to India’s trade reforms, and find very weak links between the

two. Our paper has a different, but complementary focus: we are interested in how the elimination of

product restrictions that favored small establishments—a change which occurred after the major trade

reforms—affected employment growth.


    The literature on the linkages between firm size and employment growth in developed countries has

also evolved, with early researchers finding that small firms grow more quickly and more recent research

suggesting that the driver of growth is youth, not size (see, among others, Evans, 1987a, 1987b; Hall,

1987; and Sutton, 1997). More recently, Neumark, Wall, and Zhang (2011) have also found evidence that

small businesses create more jobs. However, they find that the negative relationship between

establishment size and job creation is sensitive to whether firm size is measured using base period size or

average size of the enterprise. In particular, because of the possibility of mean reversion, estimates using

average firm size show smaller but still significantly higher job creation rates for smaller firms.


    Recent work by Haltiwanger, Jarmin and Miranda (2013) argues that these earlier papers on U.S.

firms are flawed due to measurement issues and omitted variable bias. They argue that smaller firms are

associated with higher employment growth primarily because of their youth, and they present evidence



                                               Page 7                             draft date: 11/7/2014
showing that the higher employment growth of smaller enterprises disappears once they control for age.

Haltiwanger et al. conclude that public policy should promote young enterprises rather than small

enterprises. For U.S. data, the evidence suggests both that younger firms grow faster than older firms, and

that larger firms grow faster than smaller firms after conditioning on age.


    In the last part of the paper, we use the subset of establishments that were never exposed to SSI

policies to directly measure the links between establishment size and employment growth. This last part

of the paper allows us link our SSI results with the earlier literature focusing directly on which types of

establishments grow faster. Measuring establishment size using an average of two periods, we find that

large establishments grow more quickly than small establishments, and young establishments grow more

quickly than old establishments. Further, we document that larger, younger establishments have higher

labor productivity. The elimination of the SSI policies encouraged younger, larger establishments that are

more productive and tend to grow quickly, thereby resulting in higher employment growth, productivity

increases, and higher wages in India. Taken together, our results point to the failure of using India’s small

scale policies to promote aggregate employment growth.


    Our findings are also consistent with the heterogeneous firms literature (Melitz, 2003). In this context,

the de-reservation policy may be seen as lowering the fixed entry cost that establishments must pay in

order to join a particular product market. The resulting increase in competition in the product market

raises the productivity level required for survival, as average productivity and wages rise. The smallest

establishments are forced to exit the product space, and larger establishments increase their market shares.

Alternatively, we can view the reservations policy as affecting the optimal behavior of multi-product

establishments. Larger establishments that may have found it optimal to produce reserved products may

not have been able to do so when the reservations policy was in place, and thus may have switched to a

more optimal allocation after the reforms. In addition, by raising competition, de-reservation may have

pushed establishments to specialize in products in their “core competencies” (Eckel and Neary, 2010).




                                               Page 8                            draft date: 11/7/2014
    Our findings contribute to the literature on establishment growth in two important ways. First, we

document, for the first time, the relationships between establishment size, age, and growth among a

substantial portion of the manufacturing sector in India. Second, we provide the first systematic

examination of whether policies that promote small and medium enterprises through product reservation

are an effective tool for employment promotion. Our results suggest that in India, employment growth has

been highest for younger and larger enterprises, and that reserving specific products for small and

medium enterprises was not an effective approach to maximizing employment or wage growth. The

dismantling of small-scale reservations was accompanied by net employment and wage gains for districts

that initially had a larger share of previously reserved products.


    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 explains the rationale behind SSI

reservation in India, describes the trends in reservation and de-reservation, and reviews the data sets used

in estimation. Section 3 identifies the impact of SSI reservation policies on employment, investment,

output, and wages over the 2000 through 2007 period. Section 4 documents the relationship between

size, age and employment growth, and Section 5 concludes.



2. Small-scale Reservation Policies in India
    India has historically supported its small scale sector. According to Mohan (2002), one major reason

was the government’s belief that employment generation is critical in a labor surplus economy. Many

believed that SSIs, particularly labor-intensive manufacturing enterprises, would be able to absorb surplus

labor. One important pillar of the policy of SSI promotion was the reservation policy, initiated in 1967.

Under this policy, which applies exclusively to manufacturing, certain products were reserved for

production by SSIs. Initially, only 47 items were reserved (see Figure 1), but by 1996 that number had

grown to more than 1,000 products. Mohan points out that the only selection criterion mentioned in

official documents was the ability of SSIs to manufacture such items. He also notes – as does an official




                                               Page 9                           draft date: 11/7/2014
report of an expert committee on small enterprises, of which he was a member – that the choice of

products was “arbitrary” (Hussain, 1997; Mohan, 2002).


    SSIs were originally defined as “industrial undertakings” with up to Rs. 500,000 in fixed assets and

fewer than 50 employees.3 Over time, the employment condition was dropped and the investment ceiling

raised, so that by 1999, industrial undertakings with up to Rs. 10 million in plant and machinery (at

historical cost) were considered SSIs. 4 Large industrial undertakings that already made the reserved

products were allowed to continue manufacturing them, but their output was capped at current levels. Any

further expansion or entry required a commitment to export at least 75% of output (Mohan, 2002).


    Despite India’s liberalization of a variety of industrial and trade policies in 1991, the reservation of

products for SSIs remained in force until the late 1990s. However, the Advisory Committee on

Reservation recognized growing concerns about SSI policies that followed the 1991 trade liberalization.

SSIs had to compete with imported goods, and large undertakings (which had been grandfathered in)

might be able to exercise monopoly power in the market for reserved goods as most other producers

would be small. Moreover, growing consumer demand for high-quality goods, and ongoing technological

progress, made it more difficult to produce many items in small undertakings. The Advisory Committee

therefore appointed a special committee to reconsider the list of reserved items in 1995 (Office of

Development Commissioner, Ministry of Micro, Small, & Medium Enterprises, Government of India,

2007). Based on recommendations from this committee, most of the 1,000 products were de-reserved

starting in 1997 (Figure 1). While there were a few items removed from the list in earlier years, large-

scale de-reservation started in 1997 (15 products) and picked up in 2002 (51 products). From 2003 to


3 An “industrial undertaking” may include more than one establishment. As we discuss below, almost all
observations in our data include only one establishment, and we conduct our analysis at the establishment level;
however, when we consider the capital size threshold we use capital across all reported establishments.

4 The investment ceiling was raised from Rs. 6.5 million to Rs. 30 million in 1997, but was subsequently reduced to
Rs. 10 million in 1999. Banerjee and Duflo (2012) use these changes to examine the impact of directed credit on
firm performance.




                                                  Page 10                              draft date: 11/7/2014
2008, approximately 100 to 250 products were de-reserved each year, with only 20 products remaining

reserved at the end of that period.


    We mapped the list of SSI products to a panel of manufacturing establishments from the Annual

Survey of Industries (ASI) from 2000-01 to 2007-08. 5 The ASI provides a representative sample of all

registered manufacturing establishments in India, with large establishments covered every year, and

smaller establishments covered on a sampling basis. While previously the ASI did not release identifiers

that would allow researchers to follow the same unit across years, the Central Statistical Office recently

reversed this policy and released a panel going back to 1998. However, due to incomplete product

coverage in 1998 and 1999 we are forced to begin our analysis in 2000. We drop 1998 and 1999 because

without detailed product coverage we cannot identify which establishments were affected by SSI

reservations and which were not.


    The basic unit of observation in the ASI is an establishment (called a factory in the ASI data). The

ASI allows owners who have more than one establishment in the same state and industry to provide a

joint return, but very few (less than 5% of our sample) do so. In discussing the literature on firm size and

growth, we occasionally refer to “firms” but our analysis is conducted at the level of the establishment.

Establishments report products in the ASI survey using ASI Commodity Classification, or ASICC, codes.

We created a concordance between the SSI product codes—which indicate which products were reserved

for small and medium enterprises—and the ASICC codes. We describe our procedure in Appendix A.


    Table 1 provides further details on the establishments in the ASI. Our dataset contains approximately

30,000 establishments in any given year, 25% of which made at least one reserved product in 2000. Table

1 documents that SSI reservation policies were pervasive at the beginning of the sample period and


5 The ASI uses the accounting year, which runs from 1 April to 31 March. We refer to each accounting year based
on the start of the period; for example, the year we call “2000” runs from 1 April 2000 to 31 March 2001. Note that
the product de-reservation in 2008 took place at the tail end of the 2007-08 accounting year; therefore we do not
count these products as being de-reserved during 2007-08.




                                                 Page 11                              draft date: 11/7/2014
affected one out of four establishments in our sample. By 2007, however, only 10% of establishments

were making reserved products. Establishments making de-reserved products are, on average, younger

than establishments making reserved products. Figure 2 also shows that as of 2007, establishments

making de-reserved products were more likely to be younger and larger, compared to establishments

making reserved products.


    Our other key variables are output, investment (capital), and wages. Throughout the paper, output and

capital are defined in real terms, where output is deflated by the wholesale price index (WPI) for the

appropriate product category, and capital is deflated by the WPI for plant and machinery. Wages are

measured by dividing the total annual wage bill, deflated by the consumer price index, by the number of

employees. We also measure labor productivity as real output divided by the number of employees.



3. Removal of Small-scale Reservation Policies
        In this section, we use the rapid and complete dismantling of the SSI reservation policy

documented in Figure 1 to measure its impact on establishments of different sizes and ages. While we are

particularly interested in the impact on employment, we also report consequences for investment, output,

wages, and labor productivity. Legally, small-scale reservation policies applied primarily to

establishments with a historical cost of plant and machinery below Rs. 10 million during our sample

years. Consequently we would expect a heterogeneous response to the removal of reservation policies

across establishments depending on whether or not they were constrained by the Rs. 10 million ceiling.


        Our level of analysis is either at the establishment or the district level. The reason why we do not

present our results at the industry level is that reservation policies were implemented at the sub-industry

level. Within any single industry, only a handful of products were typically reserved. At the

establishment level we know exactly which products were reserved, so we are able to identify the

coverage of the reservation policies much more accurately. In addition, the timing of deservation at the




                                              Page 12                            draft date: 11/7/2014
industry level is problematic because most industries have multiple de-reserved products, many of which

have different dates of de-reservation.

        Later in the paper we also present the results at the district level, which allows us to aggregate

results on the net impact of dereservation across entrants and incumbents in the product space as well as

across different industries. The identification strategy at the district level is different than at the

establishment level, so we present these two sets of results separately.


3.1 Establishment-Level Effects of De-reservation

        For the establishment-level analysis, treatment is defined as the elimination of small-scale

reservation on the establishment’s first-observed primary reserved or de-reserved product. We start with a

difference-in-differences (DID) equation of the following form for establishment i in year t:


𝑦𝑖𝑡 = 𝛼𝑖 + 𝛼𝑡 + 𝛽𝐷𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑡 + 𝜔𝑖𝑡                                                         (1)


The dependent variable yit is alternatively defined as the (log of) employment, output, capital, the average

per-employee wage, or labor productivity (output/employee) of establishment i at time t. Deresit is a

dummy variable that is equal to 1 if the establishment’s main reserved product has been de-reserved.

Where possible, we include all establishments – even those that do not help to identify β because they are

not affected by the reservation policy – because these establishments help to identify the secular year

trends in establishment performance.


        Because we are controlling for both year (𝛼𝑡 ) and establishment (𝛼𝑖 ) fixed effects, β is identified

from a combination of (1) products becoming de-reserved and (2) establishments switching into or out of

making (de)reserved products. To distinguish between these channels, we interact the de-reservation

dummy with indicators identifying incumbents and entrants into the product market. We create a dummy

variable Incumbent that equals 1 if a establishment ever made a de-reserved product before it was de-

reserved. Similarly, we create a dummy variable Entrant that equals 1 if a establishment ever made a de-




                                                Page 13                              draft date: 11/7/2014
reserved product after it was de-reserved, but not before. Note that our establishment fixed effects absorb

the direct impacts of being an incumbent or entrant, so we include only the interactions with our Deres

variable:


𝑦𝑖𝑡 = 𝛾𝐷𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑡 ∗ 𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖 + 𝜌𝐷𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑡 ∗ 𝐸𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑡𝑖 + 𝛼𝑡 + 𝛼𝑡 ∗ 𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖 + 𝛼𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡

        (2)


In all of our establishment-level regressions, we recognize that incumbents previously engaged in making

reserved products may have secular trends that differ from non-incumbents, and therefore we also include

an interaction between the year and incumbent dummies.


    While we do not control for other confounding policy changes, other major reforms with

heterogeneous effects across manufacturing products were limited during this time period. By 1998, 93%

of industries were no longer subject to licensing requirements. Major changes in policies vis-à-vis foreign

investment occurred in the early 1990s, and then stalled during the period of SSI reform. Nataraj (2011)

shows that tariffs were largely harmonized across industries by the late 1990s, so even though there were

some reductions during the 2000s the variation in tariff rates across product types had fallen dramatically

by the start of the sample period.


    Our establishment-level results from estimating equations (1) and (2) are reported in Table 2. The

point estimates in panel (a) of Table 2 indicate that when we do not distinguish between incumbents and

entrants, de-reservation across the entire sample of establishments had no statistically significant impact

on employment or capital. However, removal of small-scale reservation was associated with a significant

increase in output, labor productivity, and the average, per-employee wage. The coefficients on output,

labor productivity and wage indicate that on average across all establishments, the removal of small-scale




                                              Page 14                           draft date: 11/7/2014
reservation was associated with a 5.2% increase in output, a 2.9% increase in labor productivity, and a

2.1% increase in the average (real) wage. 6


         These averages mask considerable heterogeneity among incumbents and entrants. Panel (b) of

Table 2 shows that for entrants into a previously reserved product space, employment, output, capital

investment, wages, and labor productivity increased significantly. Employment increased on average by

8%, output by nearly 25%, and capital investment by 10 percent. Average real wages increased by

approximately 6.5%. In keeping with the relatively large increase in output relative to employment, labor

productivity also increased by over 17%.


         For incumbents that previously produced reserved products and remained in the sample, the

coefficients on all outcome variables are small in magnitude and, with the exception of the wage results,

statistically indistinguishable from zero. The coefficient on wage is marginally significant and suggests

that de-reservation is associated with a 1% increase in average wage among incumbents. These findings

suggest that with de-reservation, the average incumbent stagnated, while the average entrant grew. In the

following section, we examine the extent to which these effects varied by establishment size and age, and

thus affected the relationships among size, age, and growth.


3.2 Effects of De-reservation by Establishment Size and Age


         In this section we explore whether the impacts of de-reservation differed by establishment size

along two dimensions. The first is based on the historical value of fixed assets, which was used as a

threshold to determine eligibility for the manufacture of reserved products; the second is employment

size.




6 Changes are estimated as [exp(b)-1] for each coefficient b.




                                                  Page 15                     draft date: 11/7/2014
         Reserved products could typically be produced only by “industrial undertakings” with historical

values of plant and machinery below a certain value. 7 However, undertakings with historical capital

investment above the threshold could produce reserved products if they committed to exporting a certain

share (usually 75%) of production. Moreover, large incumbent undertakings (those that were already

producing the product before it was reserved, or small incumbent undertakings that grew above the

threshold) could obtain a “Carry On Business” license to continue production. However, these

undertakings were constrained to produce no more than they had previously produced.


         Table 3 shows how the effect of de-reservation varied for establishments that reported average

book values of plant and machinery above versus below the Rs. 10 million threshold prior to de-

reservation. In this table, we limit the sample to establishments for which we observe plant and machinery

in at least one year prior to de-reservation. 8 In panel (a), we find that de-reservation reduced employment

among establishments that were previously below the threshold.                    However, the reforms increased

employment, output, capital, wages, and labor productivity among constrained establishments, defined as

those that had exceeded the 10 million Rs. threshold.


         In panel (b), we split the results by incumbents versus entrants. As expected, incumbents with

pre-de-reservation levels of plant and machinery within the SSI cap reduced employment, output, and

capital stock, with a concurrent decline in labor productivity. In contrast, the largest increases in

employment and capital are found among new entrants that would have been actively constrained by the

SSI cap. The effect on employment is statistically significant as well as economically large; the average

7 An “industrial undertaking” may include more than one establishment. Therefore when measuring plant and
machinery for firms that report more than one establishment in our dataset, we use the total value across
establishments. In addition, the threshold technically applies to the historical value of plant and machinery; our
measure is imperfect in that it reflects the reported, book value of plant and machinery, and is therefore likely to
understate historical value.

8 This restriction does not exclude entrants, because we do not require that the establishment be observed making
the reserved product prior to de-reservation. For example, if an entrant started to make tapioca flour after it was de-
reserved in 2004, and we observed that entrant’s plant and machinery prior to 2004 (when it was making other
products), then we include it.




                                                   Page 16                                draft date: 11/7/2014
previously constrained establishment exhibits an increase of nearly 13% in employment after de-

reservation. Output and capital also increased by 15% and 11%, respectively. Incumbents that were

presumably grandfathered, and constrained by historical output levels, also exhibited increases in

employment, output, and capital stock, but to a lesser extent.


        We also find a large increase in output among entrants who would have been within the threshold

(and thus allowed to enter the product space) even before de-reservation. One likely reason is that the

product reservations discouraged even small establishments from entering the product space, since they

would have known that they could not grow beyond a certain limit. Another possibility is that there may

have been monopolistic conditions created by large, grandfathered incumbents. Once reservations were

lifted and de-reserved product markets became more competitive, smaller establishments entered and

grew. Unlike larger incumbents and entrants, small entrants increased output by approximately 25% but

capital stock only by 10%, with small and insignificant increases in employment. Thus labor productivity

and wages among these small entrants also increased substantially.


        We would expect that if the SSI threshold were a binding constraint prior to the reforms, the most

productive incumbent establishments would have grown until they reached the threshold. Incumbent

establishments just below the threshold, and those that reached the threshold and were granted “Carry on

Business” licenses should benefit most from de-reservation. Figure 3 shows the effects of de-reservation

across size categories for plant and machinery for incumbent establishments, with the largest effects for

those near the threshold. The establishments are classified based on their average, pre- de-reservation

values of plant and machinery. This figure suggests that incumbents just below the threshold were in fact

constrained by the reservation policy, and increased their capital investment after de-reservation.

Investment by incumbents above the threshold also increased.


        To what extent do these differences by capital investment size hold if we measure size in terms of

employment? To examine this issue, we interact the de-reservation variable in Equation 2 with a dummy



                                              Page 17                         draft date: 11/7/2014
for each establishment size and age category. Size is measured as average employment size, as defined in

Section 4 below. Figure 4, panel (a) plots the coefficients on de-reservation for each size and age class,

and shows that larger establishments grew faster with de-reservation, while smaller establishments

shrank. This pattern holds across all age classes.


        In panels (b) and (c), we break down the effect for incumbents and entrants. For ease of

interpretation, we interact de-reservation with each size category, controlling for age, and vice-versa,

rather than showing results for each size and age class independently. Panel (b) shows that among both

incumbents and entrants, larger (smaller) establishments grew faster (slower) with de-reservation. The

relationship is strong and monotonic, and the standard errors are small. This evidence suggests that the

de-reservation encouraged both large incumbents as well as large entrants. Panel (c) shows that de-

reservation particularly encouraged growth among young entrants. The results for incumbents confirm the

hypothesis that the oldest and smallest establishments shrank the most.


        Taken together, these findings suggest that de-reservation increased the tendency of larger,

younger establishments to grow relative to smaller, older establishments. The growth in employment was

driven both by entrants that moved into the previously reserved product space, as well as by large

incumbents that were previously constrained by the reservation ceiling.


3.3 Potential Endogeneity of De-Reservation Policy


        One possible concern is that products were strategically chosen for de-reservation, suggesting

potential endogeneity of the reforms. Documents from the Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium

Enterprises indicate that products were de-reserved based on the recommendations of a special

committee. Committee members were asked to consider a variety of factors when determining which

products to de-reserve, including the labor intensity of production, the minimum economic scale of




                                               Page 18                        draft date: 11/7/2014
production, the export orientation of small establishments manufacturing those items, and consumer

interests.9


         Our baseline specifications include establishment fixed effects, which control for any time-

invariant, establishment-level characteristics that are correlated with de-reservation. However, the

committee indicated that some products were selected for de-reservation based on recent changes in

product innovation. Therefore, it is possible that the product markets for de-reserved items were changing

in a systematically different way than the markets for non-de-reserved items. We might also be concerned

that our differential results for entrants and incumbents are driven not by entrants growing due to de-

reservation, but because the de-reservation policy simply attracted entrants that were already growing

quickly. In this section we perform a number of exercises to investigate whether these issues affect our

analysis.


         Pre-De-reservation Trends in Outcomes. We plotted average, pre-de-reservation trends in

employment and other outcome measures. Results for employment are provided in Appendix B. We find

no evidence that pre-de-reservation trends in the outcomes differed systematically by year of de-

reservation. Entrant and incumbent levels and growth are also similar prior to de-reservation, although

incumbents exhibit a longer right tail of employment and a longer left tail of employment growth.


         Optimal Establishment Size. Appendix B also explores the possibility that industries that were

particularly constrained by the SSI regulations – because they had higher optimal establishment sizes –

were selected for de-reservation earlier. We calculated the average, unconstrained establishment size for

         9 The special committee produced a report identifying products for de-reservation. This report indicated a
number of reasons for selecting the first set of products recommended for de-reservation, namely: feasibility of
producing quality products given the threshold on investment; need for higher investment due to product innovation;
safety and hygiene issues associated with certain products; export potential; resource utilization; and the creation of
a “monopoly like situation” in certain product markets due to the Carry On Business licenses granted to large
establishments (Office of Development Commissioner, Ministry of Micro, Small, & Medium Enterprises,
Government of India, 2007).




                                                  Page 19                               draft date: 11/7/2014
each industry, using establishments that never produced a reserved product. Our results, shown in

Appendix B, do not suggest a systematic relationship between industry size and year of de-reservation.

Appendix B also confirms that our baseline results are robust to including industry fixed effects, which

should absorb any time-invariant industry characteristics including optimal establishment size.


        Placebo Tests. We performed two placebo tests. First, we assigned each product that was never

de-reserved a false year of de-reservation, based on the de-reservation years of similar products. For

example, we assigned wooden furniture and fixtures, which were never de-reserved, a false de-reservation

year of 2007, because wooden storage cupboards and storage shelves were de-reserved in that year. We

then included both the true and the false de-reservation in the baseline specifications in Table 4. Panel (a)

shows the aggregate results, while panel (b) shows the interaction with incumbents and entrants. We

classified all establishments making false de-reserved products as incumbents, since they began making

the products before the products were really de-reserved. Therefore in panel (b) we include an interaction

with Incumbent but not Entrant. In both panels, the results of true de-reservation remain robust, while

there is no evidence of a false de-reservation effect.


        Table 5 shows the results of a second placebo test, in which we assign false de-reservation two

years before the true de-reservation. Again, the true de-reservation effects remain robust, while the false

de-reservation effects are small in magnitude and are not significant. Panel (b) also helps to confirm that

entrants and incumbents did not exhibit pre-existing trends in the outcomes prior to the de-reservation.


        Long Differences. Another way to mitigate concerns about the exact timing of de-reservation is to

consider long differences. By the end of our sample period, almost all product reservations had been

removed. Using long differences consequently addresses selection in timing during the reforms. We

regress the change in the dependent variable for a given number of lags (ranging from 1 year to 5 years)

on the change in reservation status. We do not include establishment fixed effects in this case. The use of

long differences also reduces potential noise in year-to-year changes in establishment characteristics.



                                               Page 20                           draft date: 11/7/2014
         Table 6 presents results for employment and wages, and results for the other outcomes are in

Appendix B. The effect of de-reservation on all outcomes remains robust, and magnitudes actually

increase in size over time. 10 Employment growth, wage growth and other outcomes become stronger.


         Product Switching. A related concern is that the positive coefficients on entrants may reflect the

fact that establishments moving into these products are a selected sample. Entrants focusing on core

competencies may have been expected to grow even in the absence of the de-reservation. To investigate

this possibility, we include a dummy variable that equals one when an establishment changes its main

product, regardless of whether the product is reserved, is de-reserved, or was never reserved. Appendix B

shows that establishments that switch do, in fact, appear to grow, suggesting selection into switching.

Nonetheless, the effects of the de-reservation remain robust in magnitude and significance.


3.4 Net Impact of SSI Reservation Policies on District Outcomes


         Finally, we examine the effects of the de-reservation policy at the district level using the pre-

treatment allocation of reserved and non-reserved products. Our measure of exposure to de-reservation is

similar to that used by Topalova (2010) to study the impact of tariff liberalization on Indian districts. It

exploits the fact that the de-reservation policy was implemented at a national level and varied across

products, but calculates each district’s exposure based on beginning-of-period product mix. Therefore, it

avoids any changes in a district’s product mix that may have been induced by the de-reservation policy.

At the same time, it uses geographic variation in exposure to de-reservation, which is less likely to have

influenced the special committee’s decisions than product-level characteristics. Figure 5, panel (a) shows

          10 One limitation of the long-difference results is that as they are skewed towards larger establishments,
since these establishments survive for longer periods of time. This concern is not an issue for the district-level
analysis below, since we use all observed establishments in any given year, and limit our sample to a balanced panel
of districts. In unreported results available from the authors we calculated the mean and median employment levels
among establishments in each of the long difference regressions. We find that the average employment size of
establishments in the lagged regressions is substantially larger than the average employment size of establishments
in the baseline regressions. However, there are only small differences in size as we increase the lag length.
Therefore, the observed increase in effects with longer lags is likely due to the increasing effect of the policy over
time, rather than a selection effect.




                                                  Page 21                              draft date: 11/7/2014
the fraction of employment in each district that was associated with reserved products in 2000. Panel (b)

shows the extent to which products were subsequently de-reserved by 2007, weighting each de-reserved

product by its labor share in 2000.


        For each of the 354 districts in India that have at least 10 establishments reported in the ASI for

each year in our sample, we construct a measure of exposure to de-reservation as follows:


                                          ∑𝑝(𝐸𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑜𝑦𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡2000𝑑𝑝 𝑋𝐷𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑝𝑡 )
                           𝐹𝑟𝐷𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑑𝑡 =
                                              𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙𝐸𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑜𝑦𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡2000𝑑


        FrDeresdt, the fraction of employment exposed to de-reservation, is calculated as the sum over all

products p of employment associated with that product in district d in 2000, multiplied by a dummy

variable indicating whether the product was de-reserved, and divided by total district-level employment in

2000. We allocate each establishment’s employment to its various products based on output shares.


        We estimate the following long-difference DID model at the district level:


∆𝑦𝑑 = 𝛽∆𝐹𝑟𝐷𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑑 + 𝜇𝑑                                                              (3)


The left hand side variable, ∆yd is alternatively the change in log of employment, output, capital, wages,

or labor productivity between 2000 and 2007. The right hand side variable is the change in the fraction of

employment exposed to de-reservation between 2000 and 2007, where the fraction is calculated as

described above. We calculate these variables at the district level by aggregating the establishment-level

variables, inflated by their sampling weights.


        Table 7 panel (a) shows the district-level DID results. The point estimates show a positive

relationship between de-reservation and employment, output, capital and wages, and a negative

relationship between de-reservation and labor productivity, although the results are only statistically

significant (at the 5% level) for employment. In the data, the average change in the fraction of de-reserved



                                                 Page 22                        draft date: 11/7/2014
employment was 0.095. Thus, the point estimate from panel (a), at 0.719, suggests a 7% increase in

district-level employment.


        One potential concern is that the de-reservation may have resulted in inter-district migration, thus

affecting district-level results. To address this issue, Panel (b) controls for the average change in de-

reservation among neighboring districts. The coefficient on the effect of own-district de-reservation on

employment becomes larger (0.846) and is significant at the 1% level; the coefficient on neighboring-

district de-reservation, while not statistically significant, is negative (-0.405). These results are consistent

with the migration of workers towards neighboring districts that experienced higher levels of de-

reservation.


        Panel (c) confirms that the effect of de-reservation on district-level employment is positive and

statistically significant when using lags ranging from 1 to 5 years. In keeping with the establishment-level

results in Table 6, which showed an increase in the impact of de-reservation over time, the magnitude of

the coefficient on employment increases over time. In panel (d) of Table 7 and in Appendix B, we also

see that output and wages are positively affected.


    These results suggest that the removal of SSI reservations increased formal sector employment, which

is captured by the ASI. At the same time, it is possible that the SSI policy reforms affected unorganized,

or informal, manufacturing as well. One possibility is that the reforms drove formal sector workers into

informal sector jobs, which typically pay lower wages and provide fewer benefits. While panel data do

not exist for the unorganized sector, we used two rounds of the National Sample Survey Organisation’s

Unorganized Manufacturing Enterprises Survey – from 2000 and 2005 – to conduct a district-level

analysis. Panel (e) of Table 7 shows the results of regressing the change in unorganized sector

employment, output, capital, and labor productivity, at the district level, on the change in the fraction of

de-reserved output in the formal sector. We do not include wages as an outcome variable, as many

unorganized establishments rely on unpaid household employees.



                                               Page 23                             draft date: 11/7/2014
    There is no statistically significant association between the fraction of de-reservation and district-

level employment in unorganized manufacturing. If anything, the negative coefficient on unorganized

employment in panel (e) and the positive coefficients in panels (a) through (c) suggest that de-reservation

may have been associated with a shift away from the unorganized sector towards organized sector

employment.



4. Establishment Size and Growth
    Our primary focus in this paper is on the relationship between employment growth and establishment

size. In Section 3, we used a policy change that eliminated special support for small and medium

establishments to identify the implied impact of size on employment growth. Our results suggest that

eliminating incentives for small establishments boosted aggregate employment growth. In this section,

we adopt a more direct strategy to understanding the relationship between size, age, and growth for Indian

manufacturing. We exclude all establishments that were affected by the SSI policies, either as incumbents

or as entrants into the reserved product space. We then trace—using approaches adopted previously in

the literature for the US—the reduced form relationship between establishment size, age, and employment

growth. In addition to providing a robustness check on the previous section, we can also think of this

section as casting light on the long run relationship between employment growth and establishment size

and age.


4.1 Modeling the Relationship Between Size, Age and Growth


        We begin with an establishment growth model based on Evans (1987a), in which the growth of a

establishment between time t and time 𝑡′ is a function of its employment size S, age A, and other

characteristics X at time t:


                                         𝑔(𝑡′) = 𝑓(𝑆(𝑡), 𝐴(𝑡), 𝑋(𝑡))                      (4)




                                             Page 24                           draft date: 11/7/2014
We initially define growth between any two consecutive years in which we observe the establishment (t

and 𝑡′) as:


                                                     𝑆(𝑡 ′ ) − 𝑆(𝑡)
                                           𝑔(𝑡′) =
                                                     𝑆(𝑡)[𝑡 ′ − 𝑡]


This is an establishment’s average annual growth in employment between t and 𝑡′, as a fraction of its size

when we last observed it (“base-year” size) in year t. In keeping with much of the prior analysis of size

and growth, we initially limit our analysis to continuing establishments; entry and exit are discussed

below.


    This approach to measuring the role of size in employment growth has been challenged on several

grounds. There is the potential that the commonly observed negative relationship between size and

growth is driven, in part, by regression to the mean. Establishments that have experienced an

idiosyncratic, negative shock in year t may shed labor and thus be classified in a smaller size category. As

they are unlikely to experience a similar shock in year 𝑡′, they may return to their normal employment

levels, thus creating a spurious, negative relationship between size and growth (Haltiwanger et al., 2013).


    To address the potential for regression to the mean, we consider alternative measures of both growth

and size. Following Haltiwanger et al. (2013), we construct size as the average size between t and 𝑡′:

Savg(t) = 0.5[S(t) + S(𝑡′)]. We also modify the measure of growth to reflect the updated version of

establishment size:


                                                     𝑆(𝑡 ′ ) − 𝑆(𝑡)
                                        𝑔𝑎𝑣𝑔 (𝑡′) =
                                                    Savg (t)[𝑡 ′ − 𝑡]


    This “average size” approach was first proposed by Davis et al. (1996), and has also been

implemented by Haltiwanger et al. (2013) and Neumark et al. (2011). These recent papers and earlier




                                              Page 25                           draft date: 11/7/2014
work show that using average size (with and without age controls) significantly affects the relationship

between size and growth.


    Another challenge in estimating the relationship between size and growth arises because of sample

selection. Small establishments tend to have higher failure rates than large establishments. These higher

failure rates mean that if only continuing establishments are included in estimates of the size-growth

relationship, then the estimated growth rate of small establishments is likely to be biased upwards.

Examining only continuing establishments also fails to account for growth due to entry, which may bias

the growth rate of small establishments downwards. To overcome these challenges, we replicate

Haltiwanger et al.’s measure of growth, which allows for both entry and exit.


          We estimate the relationship between growth and size as follows:


𝑔𝑖𝑗 (𝑡 ′ ) = 𝛽0 + 𝛽𝑠 𝑠𝑖𝑗 (𝑡) + 𝛽𝑠2 𝑠𝑖𝑗 (𝑡)2 + 𝛽𝑎 𝑎𝑖𝑗 (𝑡) + 𝛽𝑎2 𝑎𝑖𝑗 (𝑡)2 + 𝛽𝑠𝑎 𝑠𝑖𝑗 (𝑡)𝑎𝑖𝑗 (𝑡) + 𝑋′𝑖𝑗 + 𝛼𝑦 + 𝜀𝑖𝑗

                                                                                                            (5)


where sij is the log of employment in establishment i and industry j and aij is the log of establishment age.

As controls, we include in the Xij vector of establishment characteristics a dummy variable for multi-

establishment firms, urban establishments, and government-owned establishments. 11 We also include year

dummies ay in order to control for secular trends in establishment growth rates. For notational clarity, we

distinguish between an accounting year (y) and the time period in which we observe an establishment (t

or 𝑡′).


    We also allow for a flexible relationship between size and growth by measuring size and age using

dummy variables for various categories (1-4 employees, 5-9, 10-19, 20-49, 50-99, 100-249, 250-499,



11 We define multi-plant firms as those that report more than one establishment in their ASI return. The government
ownership dummy is set equal to one if the establishment is either partially or wholly owned by any level of
government.




                                                  Page 26                              draft date: 11/7/2014
500+ for size; 0 years, 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, 9-10, 11-12, 13-15, and 16+ for age). We estimate fully-

saturated models using a complete set of interactions between size and age, and we predict growth rates

by applying the estimated model while holding size (or age) fixed in a particular category and allowing all

other variables to be equal to their observed values. This strategy also guards against a potential challenge

noted by Bernard et al. (2014) – that the calculated growth rates of newborn establishments might be

biased upwards if they were only open for part of their first year of production, and thus only reported

partial year sales. These authors document this bias for export sales; our analysis allows us to separately

identify growth rates of establishments that are at least 1 year old, which should eliminate the concern that

employment may also be affected by this partial-year bias.


4.2 The Relationship Between Size, Age and Growth


    We present our estimates of (5) using both base-year size and average size in Table 8. In panel (a), we

rely on base-year size and include only continuing establishments. Column (1) does not control for age,

while column (2) adds age as a control and the interaction between size and age. Column (3) includes

industry dummies and column (4) weights each observation by its sampling multiplier. The coefficient on

size in all four specifications in Table 8 is significant and negative, indicating that employment growth is

higher for smaller establishments.


    To account for the higher-order and interaction terms, we estimate the actual effect of size and age on

growth, evaluated at sample means, as follows:


                                            𝜕𝑔
                                     𝑔𝑠 ≡      = 𝛽𝑠 + 2 ∗ 𝛽𝑠2 𝑠 + 𝛽𝑠𝑎 𝑎
                                            𝜕𝑠


                                            𝜕𝑔
                                     𝑔𝑎 ≡      = 𝛽𝑎 + 2 ∗ 𝛽𝑎2 𝑎 + 𝛽𝑠𝑎 𝑠
                                            𝜕𝑎




                                               Page 27                           draft date: 11/7/2014
    The median size in our data set is 45 employees, while the median age is 14 years. Evaluated at the

median, the net impacts of size and age continue to be negative (gs = -0.029, ga = -0.026) when size is

defined as the number of employees in the base year. These results are consistent with the work by Evans

(1987a), who finds that gs = -0.0374, ga = -0.0381 in a sample of U.S. firms.


    In panel (b) of Table 8 we switch to using average rather than base-year size, and we include entering

and exiting establishments. These two changes substantially alter our results. The coefficient on size,

which was negative in panel (a), becomes positive and statistically significant in panel (b), suggesting that

larger establishments exhibit higher employment growth. Comparing Columns (1) and (2) shows that the

positive relationship between size and growth holds regardless of whether or not we control for age. 12 Our

results are similar in column (3) where we include industry dummies and in column (4) where we weight

each observation by its sampling multiplier. In all of these specifications, the coefficients on age remain

negative and statistically significant, indicating that younger establishments exhibit higher employment

growth. Using the estimates from Column (2), the effect of size on growth (gs) is +0.065 and the effect of

age on growth (ga) is -0.015, when evaluated at median size and age.


    Figure 6 confirms these findings while allowing a more flexible relationship between size, age, and

growth. When base-year size is used, small establishments (panel (a)) grow faster. But when we use

average size, large establishments grow faster. The effect is even stronger when we further allow for entry

and exit. In contrast, young establishments grow faster in all cases (panel (b)). Panel (c) of Figure 6 brings

together the size and age results by showing projected growth rates for each size and age class, using

average size and allowing for entry and exit. The results in panel (c) confirm that growth is driven by

young, large establishments.




12 We also estimated Equation (5) while using average size but not accounting for entry or exit. We found that the
coefficient on size is positive but smaller than in Panel (b) of Table 8, confirming the hypothesis that failing to
account for exit biases the coefficient on size downwards.




                                                  Page 28                              draft date: 11/7/2014
    Finally, we re-estimate Equation (5) with labor productivity as the dependent variable. If large firms

not only grow faster, but also exhibit higher labor productivity growth, then the result also suggests a

positive link between establishment size and long run aggregate growth, and would be consistent with the

higher wages paid post-reform in the first half of the paper. The results, shown in Table 9, document that

larger, younger establishments are more productive than smaller, older establishments. Taken together,

the results in Tables 8 and 9 and Figure 6 indicate that establishment growth in India is not fundamentally

different than in the United States. Our results are similar to those of Haltiwanger et al. (2013). Once we

use average size and allow for entry and exit, we also find that larger, younger establishments exhibit

faster employment growth. The SSI reforms encouraged growth among a similar set of faster growing,

more productive establishments.



5. Concluding Comments
    In this paper, we use the elimination of a policy that promoted small and medium establishments in

India to answer the following question: which kinds of establishments create more employment? For the

past 60 years, India has promoted small-scale industry (SSI) by reserving production of some goods for

smaller establishments. During the sample period, one in four establishments in the Annual Survey of

Industries was covered by this policy.13 The stated goal of small-scale reservation was to promote

employment growth and income redistribution, but some commentators have argued that the policy

constrained growth. We use the elimination of the SSI reservation policy between 1998 and 2007 as an

exogenous shock to understand size and employment linkages over time.

    India eliminated all but a handful of product restrictions protecting small and medium establishments

from competition over a short horizon between 1997 and 2007. This period was characterized by few

other reforms, as most of the trade liberalization and dismantling of the License Raj had been done in


13 Since large establishments are over-represented in the sample, and the reservation policy was targeted at small
establishments, it is likely that an even greater share of the overall population of formal establishments was covered
by the policy.




                                                  Page 29                               draft date: 11/7/2014
previous decades. The elimination of small scale reservation over a short horizon allows us to measure

the importance of size in employment promotion. We find that districts that were more exposed to the

de-reservation policy experienced higher employment growth between 2000 and 2007. The magnitude of

the effect is large: between 2000 and 2007 a district facing the average amount of de-reservation would

have experienced a 7% increase in overall employment.

    To explore the mechanisms through which these changes might have occurred, we examine the

effects of the de-reservation policy on incumbents versus entrants. Consistent with the reservation

policy’s stated goal of protecting employment in small establishments, we find that the de-reservation

decreased employment among smaller, older establishments. Also consistent with the claim that

reservation was holding back the growth of larger establishments, we find that de-reservation led to the

entry and expansion of output, employment, and investment among new entrants to the previously

reserved product space. We document increased investment in plant and machinery among those

establishments that were previously constrained from expanding their existing stock of fixed assets. These

findings could be interpreted through the lens of the heterogeneous firms literature (Melitz, 2003); as de-

reservation increases competition in a product market, large establishments increase their market shares at

the expense of small establishments.

    Our results in the second half of the paper provide an alternative way to trace the relationship between

establishment size, age, and employment growth. Using a subset of establishments, which we follow over

time and which were not affected by the reforms, we examine long run size and employment linkages.

Our results show that Indian establishments have behaved in a similar fashion to U.S. establishments. If

size is measured using base-year size, then small establishments grew faster. However, if size is measured

using the average measure as defined by Haltiwanger et al. (2013), then larger establishments in India

exhibited higher employment growth than smaller establishments. As in the United States, the importance

of small-scale is eclipsed by the importance of youth. Younger, larger establishments also exhibit higher

labor productivity than older, smaller establishments.




                                              Page 30                           draft date: 11/7/2014
    How well did the reservation policy achieve its goals? While small scale reservation may have

protected employment in certain small establishments, it did so at the expense of employment elsewhere.

With respect to the goal of income enhancement, our results show that eliminating reservation policies for

smaller enterprises increased productivity and average wages. However, it is not clear whether this effect

is due to entrants paying higher wages to existing workers, or to a shift towards a higher-skilled

workforce. Taken together, the results from the first and second parts of this analysis suggest that the

removal of small-scale reservations increased overall employment by encouraging the growth of younger,

larger establishments – those that are most likely to pay higher wages, create more investment, be more

productive, and generate growth in employment.

  Notes: Coefficients from a regression of log of nominal plant and machinery value on de-reservation, for incumbents
  to the product space. The value of plant and machinery is calculated at the level of the industrial undertaking.
  Industrial undertakings with historical investment in plant and machinery up to Rs. 10 million (illustrated by the
  dashed line) could be considered small-scale industries.

Notes: Panel (a) shows the coefficients from a regression of log of employment on de-reservation, interacted with a dummy
variable for each size and age class. Panel (b) shows the coefficients from a regression of the log of employment on de-
reservation, interacted with dummy variables for size and for whether the establishment is an incumbent or an entrant into the
product space, controlling for age. Panel (c) shows the coefficients from a similar regression, using age rather than size
interactions.

Notes: Dependent variables are shown in column headings. “t ≥ year deserved” is a dummy variable that takes the
value of 1 when the product is removed from the list of reserved products. “t ≥ false year deserved” is a dummy
variable that takes the value of 1 after the false year of de-reservation assigned to a product that was never de-
reserved. “Incumbent” indicates that the establishment previously made the product when it had reserved status.
“Entrant” indicates that the establishment only made the product after it had been de-reserved. “Q/L” indicates labor
productivity (real output divided by number of employees). Errors are clustered at the establishment level. *, ** and
*** represent significant at the 10%, 5% and 1% levels respectively.

Notes: Panel (a) shows long-difference regressions of changes in dependent variables (shown in column headings)
from 2000-2007 on change in fraction of district employment 2000 that was subsequently associated with product
de-reservation. Panel (b) adds a control for the mean change in exposure to de-reservation among neighboring
districts. Panels (c) and (d) show regressions of changes in labor and wage, respectively, at lagged intervals from 1-5
years. Regressions use all districts that, after applying weights, have at least 10 establishments in each ASI year.
Panel (e) shows long-difference regressions that are analogous to Panel (a) but use unorganized sector employment
from 2000-2005 (and Δ Fraction for only 2000 to 2005 on RHS). “Q/L” indicates labor productivity (real output
divided by number of employees). Errors are clustered at the district level. *, ** and *** represent significant at the

Appendix A: Data Cleaning Details (FOR ONLINE
APPENDIX)
Annual Survey of Industries Data


    We use an establishment-level panel from the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) covering 2000 to

2007. The ASI sampling frame covers all registered (formal) manufacturing firms. Large firms are

considered part of the “Census” sector, and are surveyed every year. Smaller firms are considered part of

the “Sample” sector, and are sampled every few years. The survey provides sampling weights that allow

the construction of representative samples at the state-by-industry level.

    We excluded services and mining establishments from our analysis, as the growth patterns in these

sectors may be different from those in manufacturing. We also note that the growth measures based on

“average” size are, by definition, bounded by -2 and +2. However, the growth measure based on “base-

year” size is bounded below by -1, but is not bounded above. About 1% of our establishments exhibited

growth rates of more than 200% (more than +2 using the “base-year” size measure), and examination of

these observations suggested that many of them may have been data entry mistakes. We therefore

removed any establishments that had growth rates based on “base-year” size that were among the top 1%

of growth rates. We also examined the size-growth relationships including these establishments. As we

would expect, we find a much larger, negative relationship between “base-year” size and growth when

including these outliers, but there is little change in the results based on “average” size.


District Codes


    This analysis uses the ASI panel identifiers supplied by Ministry of Statistics and Programme

Implementation. The panel dataset does not include district identifiers; we merge these in from the annual

cross-sections that we purchased separately.


Matching Establishment-Level Data with Product Reservation Status



                                               Page 51                             draft date: 11/7/2014
    During the years we study (2000-2007), product codes in the ASI were classified under the ASI

Commodity Classification (ASICC). During this period, there were 4,805 ASICC product codes in

manufacturing that respondents could choose from when answering the survey. Although respondents

could in theory list up to 10 output products on their form, over 90% of respondents listed 4 or fewer

products. For most years of the panel, 50-60% of respondents listed only one product.

    We created a concordance between the ASICC product codes and the list of reserved and de-reserved

products. Because some of the ASICC codes are very broad, we matched products reserved to each

establishment based on both ASICC and 5-digit industry. In some cases, the match between ASICC codes

and SSI codes was so exact that we were able to create the match based solely on the product

descriptions. In other cases, we used the lengthy descriptions associated with the industry codes to help

resolve many questionable concordances. We assumed that a product was matched to an ASICC code if it

was at least a partial match.

    The following tables show a subset of illustrative industries with ASICC codes and reserved products

matched to those codes.

Appendix B: Additional Robustness Tests (FOR ONLINE
APPENDIX)
    This appendix shows results from several robustness tests discussed in the main text.

Pre-De-Reservation Trends

    First, we explore pre-de-reservation trends in key outcome variables. Results for employment are

presented here; results for other outcome variables are similar. Panel (a) of Figure B.1 shows box plots of

pre-de-reservation growth in employment for establishments making reserved products, by year of de-

reservation. As a comparison, it also shows box plots of growth in employment for establishments making

products that were never de-reserved, and other establishments (those that never made a reserved or de-

reserved product). Sampling multipliers are used to generate a representative sample at the product level.

This figure shows that there is little evidence that the timing of de-reservation is correlated with pre-de-

reservation changes in employment at the product level.


        Panel (b) performs a similar exercise at the establishment level. Here, we do not apply sampling

weights, but rather show establishments for which we observe at least two pre-de-reservation years. 14 As

with the product level results, there is no evidence of a difference in pre-de-reservation trends in growth.


        We might also be concerned that our differential results for entrants and incumbents are driven

not by entrants growing due to de-reservation, but because the de-reservation policy simply attracted

entrants that were already growing quickly. To investigate this possibility, panels (c) and (d) show box-

plots of pre-de-reservation levels and trends in establishment-level employment, for entrants and

incumbents. Employment levels are similar among incumbents and entrants, although incumbents exhibit

a longer right tail. In contrast, incumbents exhibit a longer left tail of slow-growing (or shrinking)

establishments, relative to entrants, as shown in panel (d). Nonetheless, these figures suggest that entrants


14 Note that in this case, we are able to include establishments making product de-reserved in 2001, as we can
observe those establishments in 1998 and 1999, although we do not have a complete list of the products they made
in those years.




                                                Page 55                              draft date: 11/7/2014
and incumbents are fairly similar in terms of pre-de-reservation size and growth patterns. We find similar

pre-treatment patterns for output, capital, and wage, both by year of de-reservation, and for entrants

versus incumbents.


Industry Characteristics


        It may also be the case that industries that were the most constrained – those with the largest

optimal establishment sizes – were those selected for de-reservation at an earlier date. In that case, we

may not have observed a differential trend in pre-de-reservation employment growth, if the constrained

establishments were growing slowly due to constraints, while the still-reserved establishments were

growing slowly simply because they were aiming for smaller establishment size.


        We examine this possibility in two ways. First, we investigate whether there is any evidence that

industries with larger optimal establishment sizes were de-reserved earlier. To do so, we calculate the

average unconstrained size in each industry as average employment among establishments that never

make a reserved or de-reserved product. We then assign each establishment making a reserved product,

the average unconstrained size in its industry. Figure B.2, panels (a) and (b) show the distribution of

average unconstrained industry size (in levels and logs) associated with establishments making reserved

products, by year of de-reservation. There is no apparent trend in average industry size by year of de-

reservation.


        Another way to control for industry-specific optimal size is to include industry fixed effects in

our regressions. Our baseline regressions include establishment fixed effects, but as establishments may

switch industries, we can also include industry fixed effects. Table B.1 shows that the results are robust to

doing so.


Long Differences




                                              Page 56                            draft date: 11/7/2014
        Table 6 in the main manuscript presents the long-difference results for employment and output.

Table B.2 shows the long-difference results for output, capital, and labor productivity. As with

employment and wages, the effects of the de-reservation on these additional variables increase over time.


        Similarly, like Table 7 in the main manuscript, Table B.3 shows the long-difference results at the

district level for output, capital, and labor productivity. The coefficient on output becomes statistically

significant at the fifth lag, but otherwise there is little evidence that de-reservation is associated with these

outcomes in a statistically significant manner.


Product Switching


        Table B.4 shows the results of the baseline regressions where we also control for product

switching. We create a dummy variable that equals one when an establishment changes the main product

it makes, regardless of whether the product is reserved, is de-reserved, or was never reserved. The results

show that establishments that switch products do appear to grow subsequently, suggesting that there is

likely a selection effect. However, the results for entrants remain similar in sign and magnitude to the

original results, indicating that product switching is not driving the results for the SSI de-reservation.

Notes: Dependent variables are shown in column headings. “t ≥ year deserved” is a dummy variable that takes the
value of 1 when the product is removed from the list of reserved products. “Incumbent” indicates that the
establishment previously made the product when it had reserved status. “Entrant” indicates that the establishment
only made the product after it had been de-reserved. Errors are clustered at the establishment level. *, ** and ***
represent significant at the 10%, 5% and 1% levels respectively.

Notes: The dependent variable is the difference between output (Panels (a) and (b)), capital (Panels (c) and (d), or labor
productivity (Panels (e) and (f)) in year t and year t-k where k is 1-5 (Columns (1)-(5), respectively). The right hand side
variables are also differenced by the appropriate lag k. Errors are clustered at the establishment level. *, ** and ***
represent significant at the 10%, 5% and 1% levels respectively.

Notes: Dependent variables are shown in column headings. “t ≥ year deserved” is a dummy variable that takes the
value of 1 when the product is removed from the list of reserved products. “Incumbent” indicates that the
establishment previously made the product when it had reserved status. “Entrant” indicates that the establishment
only made the product after it had been de-reserved. “Switch” is a dummy that takes a value of 1 when a
establishment changes the main product it makes. “Q/L” indicates labor productivity (real output divided by number
of employees). Errors are clustered at the establishment level. *, ** and *** represent significant at the 10%, 5% and
1% levels respectively.
