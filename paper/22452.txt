                                          ABSTRACT

Population aging is widely assumed to have detrimental effects on economic growth yet there is
little empirical evidence about the magnitude of its effects. This paper starts from the observation
that many U.S. states have already experienced substantial growth in the size of their older
population and much of this growth was predetermined by historical trends in fertility. We use
predicted variation in the rate of population aging across U.S. states over the period 1980-2010 to
estimate the economic impact of aging on state output per capita. We find that a 10% increase in
the fraction of the population ages 60+ decreases the growth rate of GDP per capita by 5.5%.
Two-thirds of the reduction is due to slower growth in the labor productivity of workers across
the age distribution, while one-third arises from slower labor force growth. Our results imply
annual GDP growth will slow by 1.2 percentage points this decade and 0.6 percentage points next
decade due to population aging.

    The fraction of the United States population age 60 or older will increase by 21%

between 2010 and 2020, and by 39% between 2010 and 2050 (Administration on Aging,

2014). This dramatic shift in the age structure of the U.S. population—itself the effect of

historical declines in fertility and mortality—has the potential to negatively impact the

performance of the economy as well as the sustainability of government entitlement

programs, and could result in a decline in consumption for the population as a whole.

       The potential macroeconomic and fiscal effects of population aging have been

widely acknowledged and a number of studies have sought to forecast the effects of aging

on future economic performance (e.g., Cutler et al., 1990; Borsch-Supan, 2003; Vogel,

Ludwig, and Börsch-Supan, 2013; National Research Council, 2012; Sheiner, 2014). There

are, however, few empirical estimates of the realized effect of aging on economic growth.

This is a critical gap in knowledge. While demographic change is relatively easy to forecast

on account of its predetermined nature, the ensuing economic adjustments—by firms,

individuals, and policymakers—are not similarly deterministic. It is thus impossible to

forecast the path of economic growth without making assumptions about the economic

adjustments that may dampen or amplify the effects of predetermined changes in

demography. It is similarly difficult to gauge the appropriate amount of policy intervention

to counteract the economic and fiscal effects of population aging.

       In this paper, we present empirical elasticities that summarize the realized

economic response to the aging of the U.S. population since 1980. Our analysis begins with

the observation that population aging is already long underway and has been playing out

with varying degrees of intensity across different regions of the country. In some areas, the

population has been aging at rates on par with those expected in the near future. Between



                                               2
1980 and 2010, the growth rate in the population ages 60+ was above 30% for six states,

similar to the projected national growth rate for 2010 to 2040. Over the same time period,

three states experienced reductions in the fraction of their population 60 or above.

       We leverage this variation in the rate at which U.S. states are aging to estimate the

effect of aging on the rate of state growth in per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the

state labor force participation rate, and measures of labor productivity. To account for

other factors that drive both the rate of state population aging and state economic

outcomes, such as migration, we use the predetermined component of a state’s age

structure—its age structure 10 years prior—as an instrumental variable for its changing

age structure. We use this variation in predictable aging to estimate a causal impact of

aging on GDP growth.

       Our estimates imply that 10% growth in the fraction of the population ages 60 and

older decreases growth in GDP per capita by 5.5%. Decomposing GDP per capita into its

constituent parts—GDP per worker and the employment-to-population ratio—we find that

two-thirds of the reduction in GDP growth is driven by a reduction in the rate of growth of

GDP per worker, or labor productivity, while only one-third is due to slowing labor force

growth. This finding runs counter to predictions that population aging will affect economic

growth primarily through its impact on labor force participation, with little effect on

average productivity (National Research Council, 2012; Burtless, 2013). In addition, we

find that the decline in productivity growth does not only reflect changes in the age

composition of the pool of workers (who are on average older in states that age faster).

Instead, evidence that population aging slows earnings growth across the age distribution

suggests that it leads to declines in the average productivity of workers in all age groups,



                                              3
including younger workers. Importantly, these spillover effects do not appear to be driven

by selection on the extensive labor supply margin, as we find population aging does not

affect the employment rate of younger workers.

        Our paper contributes an essential piece of evidence to the literature on the

macroeconomic effects of changes in population age structures. Although not focused on

aging per se, most relevant to our paper are a pair of studies by Feyrer (2007, 2008) that

estimate the realized effect of changes in the age distribution of workers on changes in total

factor productivity using a panel of OECD and low-income countries between 1960 and

1990.1 Feyrer concluded that the relationship between worker age and total factor

productivity has an inverse-U shape; specifically, productivity growth increases with the

proportion of workers ages 40-49 and decreases as the proportion who are older rises. In

its review of the literature, the National Research Council’s Committee on the Long-Run

Macroeconomic Effects of the Aging U.S. Population concluded that the pattern of age

coefficients reported in the Feyrer papers was sensitive to specification, and unlikely to be

true (National Research Council, 2012). The Committee concluded that productivity effects

were likely to be negligible, but called for further research on the issue. Similar to the

Committee’s view, Burtless (2013) argued that since the earnings of older workers have

been rising in comparison to younger workers, even as the older population share has

grown, there is little evidence that the aging of the U.S. workforce has hurt economic

productivity.2

  Feyrer (2008) also estimated models of changes in wage growth on changes in the age distribution of the
workforce at the state and metropolitan levels using U.S. data; however the estimates were sensitive to
empirical specification and generally not statistically significant.
2
  Other studies in the growth literature have considered the importance of the “dependency ratio” without
focusing on population aging specifically. Bloom, Canning, and Sevilla (2003) examine the implications of a


                                                      4
        There are two advantages to our empirical approach. First, by comparing the

economic experiences of U.S. states with different aging trajectories, we are able to

leverage counterfactual estimates of what would have happened to output, employment

and productivity if the population had aged faster or slower. Our approach yields an

elasticity of economic growth with respect to population aging that incorporates the

economic response to demographic changes, and which thus may be useful to predict

future impacts on economic growth as population aging continues to unfold. Second,

examining economic units within the same country allows us to hold constant the effects of

national pension systems, labor market institutions and cultural retirement norms that

may interact with population aging in cross-country studies. Our estimates should

therefore be interpreted as the relationship between population aging and economic

growth holding the national policy environment constant. Consequently, our research

design does not capture “indirect” effects of population aging on the federal budget (e.g.,

rising Medicare expenditures) or the effects of the federal policy response—as distinct

from state policy responses—to aging (e.g., tax increases to fund Social Security benefits).

While indirect federal-level effects are certainly of interest, they are separate

considerations and can be recovered through other methods.

        In the next section, we describe how population aging affects economic growth in a

standard model of economic output. In Section II, we show the variation in population

aging across states between 1980 and 2010. This is followed by our empirical strategy in

Section III. We present our results in Section IV and conclude in Section V.

I.   How Population Aging Affects Economic Growth

        Figure 1 shows the percent of the U.S. population ages 60 and older between 1900

and 2000, and the projected percent through 2050. The figure illustrates how the

population has aged nearly continuously over the last century. The only decade in which

the population did not age was the 1990s when the baby boom passed through the middle

of the age distribution. The U.S. population is projected to continue aging, at a relatively

faster rate through 2030 (due again to the baby boom), and at a slower rate thereafter.

        The size of the U.S. population and its age distribution at any point in time are the

result of historical trends in birth rates, mortality rates, and immigration rates. U.S.

population aging today results from the sharp decline in the birth rate in the 1960’s, which

marked the end of the Baby Boom, and the long-running decline in mortality rates.

Immigration can offset these demographic forces to some degree, but has not been of

sufficient magnitude to reverse population aging.

        But how do these demographic forces affect economic growth? Consider a general

representation of aggregate economic output and its subcomponents. Let the production of

a state economy be represented by the function y st  F  st , k st ,  st  , where y st is per capita

output at time t in state s,  st is the (per capita) stock of ideas or technology, k st is an index

of physical capital per person, and  st is the per capita effective labor input.

        The effective labor input depends on the employment rate in the economy and the

human capital of the workforce, and both of these components are potentially shaped by

the population age structure. Among individuals, labor supply behavior varies by age and

over time. Similarly, human capital, which derives from cognition and health as well as

investments in formal schooling and work experience (Mincer, 1974; Becker, 1975), varies


                                                   6
over the individual life cycle, and across birth cohorts. Thus, we incorporate age-specific

employment and human capital into the expression for the effective labor input:

 st  pt (a st ) t (ast ) , where the function pt (a st ) is the number of workers per person (i.e., the

employment rate) at time t and depends on the older population share, represented by a st .

The function  t a st  is the human capital (productivity) of the labor force and also depends

on the older population share.

         To illustrate how changes in these components affect output growth, we

differentiate the production function and rearrange terms to express the percent change in

per capita output growth in terms of production elasticities3 and percent changes in each

factor of production:

 We denote the elasticities as constant across state and time. There could be heterogeneity in these
measures and our empirical analysis will explore whether (some of) these elasticities change over time. Our
discussion below will also consider reasons why these elasticities may change over time.


                                                                      7
Equation (1) shows how the relationship between output growth and growth in the older

population share depends on three key elasticities. First, this relationship is a function of

  , the elasticity of production with respect to the economy’s effective labor supply. This

production elasticity with respect to labor is itself a function of the stocks of capital and

technology. Second, growth in the older population share affects production growth

through  a , the elasticity of labor productivity with respect to the older share. Finally, the

relationship is governed by  pa , the elasticity of labor force participation with respect to the

older share. Thus, changes in the older population share can impact the effective labor

supply of the economy through two channels: by changing the fraction of the population

that works and by affecting the productivity composition of the workers in the labor force.

Productivity here can also include intensive margin labor supply changes as the population

ages, though we will separate intensive labor supply from per-hour efficiency in our

empirical analysis. The model places little structure on the relationship between the older

population share and production, but we specify these particular elasticities because they

are the essential components of the labor input. As noted above, the model allows the labor

input to in turn affect production through interactions with the stocks of capital and

                   F  st , k st ,  st 
technology since                            includes these factors. Consequently, there are no
                         st

assumptions here that the relationship between labor and production is independent of

capital and technology.

       The effects of population aging on both labor force participation and productivity

are not simply mechanical functions of the age profiles in labor supply and productivity.

Older workers may be complements or substitutes for younger workers such that changes


                                                  8
in the older share may affect the economy’s productivity and labor supply through

interactions with younger workers. The model’s human capital function makes no claims

about these interactions, though we provide empirical evidence about the relationship

between changes in the older share and changes in labor outcomes at younger ages.

II. Data

        To construct measures of the age structure in a state, we obtain state population

counts by age from the 1980, 1990, and 2000 Census Integrated Public Use Microdata

Series (IPUMS) and the 2009-2011 American Community Surveys (ACS) (Ruggles et al.,

2015). Due to the relatively small size of the ACS, we combine the 2009-2011 samples to

construct a “2010 Census.”4 In addition to population counts, the Census and ACS contain

individual-level data measuring employment status, hours worked and labor earnings in

the preceding calendar year. We aggregate these data to the state-year level to obtain the

state employment rate, total hours worked and total labor earnings. To facilitate sub-

analyses by sector, we construct a parallel set of population and labor market measures at

the level of two-digit industry, state and year. 5

        To measure aggregate output, we acquire GDP by state and year from the Bureau of

Economic Analysis (BEA). State GDP is defined as “the value added in production by the

labor and capital located in a state,” measured in dollars. These data “provide a




4
  Alternatively, we could have used state-level population statistics from the Census. However, we chose to
construct our population size and labor supply measures from the same individual-level data in order to
minimize differences arising from differences in data aggregation procedures. Using these noisier measures
of state-level population should not affect the consistency of our estimates but may increase our standard
errors.
5
  We use the 1990 Census Bureau industrial classification scheme, which is consistently reported in IPUMS for
all years since 1950.


                                                     9
comprehensive measure of a state’s production” (BEA, 2006).6 The state GDP data also

include industry-specific output measures, which we use to study the differential impacts

of aging on different sectors of the economy. Because the annual labor outcomes from the

Census and ACS refer to the previous year (i.e., 1979 in the 1980 Census), we match GDP

data from the year preceding the indicated Census year (i.e., 1979, 1989, 1999 or 2009).7

However, for ease of exposition, we refer to the Census years when indexing by time below.

         The BEA also collects state-level data on total employee compensation, which

includes wages and salaries paid to employees as well as noncash benefits. Wages and

salaries are the primary component of employee compensation and include overtime pay,

sick and vacation pay, severance pay, incentive payments (e.g., commissions, tips, and

bonuses), and voluntary contributions to deferred compensation plans. Noncash benefits

include in-kind benefits and employer contributions to pension plans, health insurance,

and social insurance programs. We use the BEA employee compensation data as a

measure of full labor compensation in a state, and as a complement to the Census earnings

data.8

         We construct 10-year growth rates by state for all of our analysis variables. These

data are presented in Table 1, where growth in a variable as of Census year t refers to the

percent change between t-10 and t. The top panel shows all Census years pooled, while the


6
  An advantage of using aggregate production instead of consumption data is that GDP includes asset income,
which can be used to compensate for declines in consumption.
7
  There is still a slight misalignment between state and year for the labor outcomes since, before 2000, the
Census only included information on state of residence in the current year. For 2000 and 2010 it is possible to
aggregate labor outcomes by state of residence in the previous year. We conducted robustness checks of our
main regressions for 2000-2010 using the aligned and misaligned measures, respectively, and found that this
did not affect our results. These estimates are shown in Appendix Table A.5 and discussed below
8
  One limitation of the BEA measure of total compensation is that it does not include compensation for the
self-employed. Adding in labor earnings for the self-employed using the Census and ACS has little effect on
the results.

lower panels show the data decade by decade. There is significant variation across states in

the size and growth rate of the 60+ population in all years. In the pooled sample, the

fraction ages 60+ ranges across states and Census years from 0.095 to 0.313, with mean

0.24 and standard deviation 0.029. The 10-year growth rate of the fraction 60+ ranges

from -9% to 47%, with mean 4% and standard deviation 8%. Economic growth also varies

substantially across states and years. In the pooled state-year sample, the 10-year growth

rate in GDP per capita ranges from -12% to 131%, with mean 55% and standard deviation

26%. Productivity growth, measured as the 10-year growth rate in GDP per worker, ranges

from -8% to 117%, with mean 55% and standard deviation 19%. Finally, labor force

growth, the other component of growth in GDP per capita, ranges from -10% to 9%, with

mean -0.3% and standard deviation 4%.

           To shed light on the regional patterns underlying the variation summarized in Table

1, we also present choropleth maps of the state variation in population aging that occurred

decade by decade. 9 Between 1980 and 1990 (Figure 2A), there was relatively fast growth

in the older population in the West and in the Rust Belt. At the same time, 15 states,

including the large states of California, Texas, Florida, and New York, experienced a

contraction in the relative size of their older population. Between 1990 and 2000 (Figure

2B) the majority of states experienced declines in the relative size of their older

populations, with just 12 small states seeing weakly positive growth. However, between

2000 and 2010 (Figure 2C) the growth rate of the older population was above 15% in 20

states, including the northern Pacific and Mountain states, and nearly all of the South

Atlantic states. Only 4 states—Florida, North Dakota, South Dakota, and the District of

    Note Hawaii and Alaska are not shown in Figures 2A-2C, but are included in our analysis sample.

Columbia—experienced less than 5% growth during this period. Florida is notable in that

by this time it already had a relatively high older population share.

       If age-specific migration and mortality patterns were entirely independent of

economic changes, then it would be useful to compare the economic outcomes of states

that experienced fast population aging to states that experienced slow population aging.

But economic changes can themselves shape the population age structure by affecting

contemporaneous patterns of migration and mortality, and thus any association between

economic growth and population aging at the state level is unlikely to represent the causal

impact of population aging. As we detail in the next section, we address this issue with a

research design that makes use of the fact that population age structures are to an extent

the result of historical demographic patterns (e.g., fertility trends). Our research design

leverages the predetermined components of the population age structure for identification

in order to circumvent these confounding sources.

III. Empirical Strategy

    To obtain an estimable specification for the differentiated production function in

equation (1), we note that differentiating

                   ln y st    ln  st   k ln k st    [a   pa ] ln a st

would give equation (1). Since technology and capital at the state level are unobserved, we

model their effects with state and time fixed effects. Specifically, let  s   t   st 

 ln st  k ln kst . This permits growth over time while also allowing states to have

different levels of capital and technology. We also allow for state-specific output shocks,

modeled as  st . Our identifying assumption will be that our instrumental variable is



                                                          12
uncorrelated with these shocks, and this assumption is discussed later. We take first-

differences and include additional control variables to arrive at the following estimable

specification:

                                          𝐴                 𝐴     ′
      ln 𝑦𝑠,𝑡+10 − ln 𝑦𝑠𝑡 = 𝜑𝑡 + 𝛽 [ln (𝑁𝑠,𝑡+10 ) − ln (𝑁𝑠𝑡 )] + 𝑋𝑠𝑡 𝛿𝑡 + (𝜀𝑠,𝑡+10 − 𝜀𝑠𝑡 ) ,        (2)
                                              𝑠,𝑡+10            𝑠𝑡


where 𝑦𝑠𝑡 is an economic outcome (e.g., GDP per capita) for state s in Census year t, A is the

number of individuals aged 60 and older, N represents the total population aged 20 and

older, and X contains a set of time-varying control variables whose influence is also allowed

to vary over time.10 We include in X the initial (period t) two-digit industry composition of

the state labor force (specifically, the log of the fraction of workers in each industry) to

account for initial conditions that may predispose states to particular growth paths.11 The

log-difference specification for both dependent and independent variables normalizes

comparisons of growth across states with different initial population shares and yields an

easily interpretable elasticity, 𝛽. When presenting our main results, we will show that our

results are robust to different functional forms.

     Our main outcome of interest is growth in GDP per person aged 20 and older. To

understand the mechanisms driving changes in GDP growth, we also examine specific

decompositions of GDP per capita. First, we decompose GDP per capita into two

components: GDP per worker (labor productivity) and the fraction of people working. This

decomposition enables us to assess how much of the effect of population aging on

economic growth operates through changes in labor force growth as compared to changes

in productivity growth.

10
  𝜑𝑡 ≡ 𝛾𝑡+10 − 𝛾𝑡 .
11
  In complementary work, we find that an area’s initial industry structure predicts changes in labor outcomes
(see Maestas, Mullen and Powell, 2013).


                                                       13
     Second, we further decompose the productivity component, GDP per worker, into

three subcomponents: GDP per dollar paid to labor (i.e., GDP/earnings), earnings per hour

worked (i.e., wage) and hours H per worker L (intensive labor supply). This decomposition

of the productivity component tests for compensating adjustments in earnings, as opposed

to changes in intensive margin labor supply. Since labor earnings may not fully reflect labor

costs, we repeat the decomposition substituting BEA’s measure of total labor

compensation, which includes the value of in-kind benefits paid to workers. Overall, these

decompositions provide a rich picture of the mechanisms driving the relationship between

population aging and economic growth.

        While equation (2) relates changes in state population aging to changes in state

economic outcomes, changes in the age structure of a state may depend – in part – on

factors related to economic growth. For example, economic decline could induce prime-

aged workers to migrate out of the state while older workers may be more likely to stay

given the smaller lifetime return to moving. Consequently, we would observe that aging

states have less favorable economic outcomes, though this relationship is not causal.12

Similarly, differential industry growth and decline across states may affect mortality rates

and these mortality effects may not be uniform across all age groups, directly altering the

age composition of states depending on their economic conditions.

        To address these potential confounds, we use an instrumental variables strategy to

estimate equation (2) that exploits the differential and predictable component of

population aging across states over time. We first construct national census survival rates,

defined as the ratio of the national population age j+10 in one Census to the cohort’s

12
  There is some evidence that population aging itself may affect interstate migration; see Karahan and Rhee
(2014).


                                                     14
population size in the prior Census (at age j).13 We then multiply the number of individuals

age j in the state in one Census by the age-specific national survival rate to predict the

number of individuals age j+10 in the state in the next Census. For example, to predict the

number of 60 year olds in Alabama in 2000, we multiply the number of 50 year olds in

Alabama in 1990 by the national ratio of 60 year olds in 2000 to 50 year olds in 1990. This

approach uses initial state composition interacted with national level cohort changes and

has the advantage of disregarding variation resulting from differential state-level migration

and mortality for identification. The instrument is similar in spirit to the Bartik instrument

(Bartik, 1991; Blanchard and Katz, 1992), which predicts local economic growth by

interacting national industry-specific growth with initial local industry composition.

        More precisely, the instrument is the predicted change between t and t+10 in the log

of the fraction of the state population 60+:

                     𝑁                         𝑁       𝑗𝑡


The main source of variation used by the instrument is the variation across states in the

relative size of their population ages 50-59. States with a large fraction of 50-59 years olds

are predicted to experience relatively large increases in the number of older individuals.14



13
  Note our census survival ratios incorporate international (as opposed to interstate) migration.
14
  Some variation may also come from changes in the denominator N. That is, if the younger population is
(predictably) growing faster in one state than in another, the first state will have less population aging by our


                                                            15
The variation in population aging that we exploit is predictable and observable by

residents of the state before time t. In this manner, the instrument parallels population

aging at the national level.

IV. Estimates and Mechanisms

A. Effect of Population Aging on Economic Growth

        We begin with a visual depiction of our research design. In Figure 3A, each data

point is an observation of the decadal change in a state, weighted by population size in the

base year. The figure shows the strong negative association in the raw data between

realized population aging and per capita GDP growth over the period 1980-2010. Figure 3B

shows the first-stage relationship critical to our research design. Here, we see that realized

population aging is strongly predicted by the predicted aging instrument. Finally, Figure 3C

presents the visual reduced form relationship between the predicted aging instrument and

subsequent economic growth.

        Table 2 presents the coefficients summarizing these relationships after we include

controls for state industry composition in the base year and time fixed effects. Panel A

shows the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates of equation (2) for the entire time period

1980-2010, and separately for each decade. The dependent variable is the change in log

per capita GDP. The point estimates indicate that states experiencing growth in the

fraction of individuals ages 60+ also experience slower growth in per capita GDP. Using the

full sample, we estimate that a 10% increase in the fraction of the state population ages 60+

is associated with a decrease in economic growth of 8.3%. Contrasting this estimate with

the much larger slope coefficient in Figure 3A reveals the importance of controlling for

metric even if the two states experienced the same (absolute or proportional) change in the number of older
individuals.


                                                     16
time fixed effects. Limiting the sample to one ten-year difference at a time, we consistently

find a large and statistically significant association.

       As noted above, there are many reasons why state populations might age at

different rates and economic growth itself could impact the state age structure by affecting

migration decisions; this would bias the OLS estimate away from zero if younger workers

move to faster growing places to pursue new job opportunities or, conversely, if older

individuals move to slower growing places to take advantage of the lower cost of living.

Similarly, if economic growth affects mortality rates, then this too may contribute bias. The

direction of the bias is less obvious in this case since it depends on how any growth-

induced mortality changes play out across the age distribution.

       Panel B of Table 2 presents the reduced form relationship between our

instrument—the predicted change in the log of the fraction of individuals 60+ in a state—

and economic growth. We find that a 10% increase in the predicted fraction of the 60+

population decreases per capita GDP growth by 3.9%. Panel C shows the first-stage

coefficient, conditioning on time fixed effects and controls for initial industry composition.

The additional controls matter relatively less for the first-stage relationship between

predicted and actual growth in the older population. For each 10% increase in predicted

growth of the 60+ population, we find that a state actually experiences a 7.2% increase

(compared to an implied 8.3% in Figure 3B).

       Table 3 presents two-stage least squares estimates of the effect of population aging

on economic growth for all decades pooled and separately, weighted and unweighted by

base-year state population in the top and bottom rows, respectively. Using the full sample,

we estimate that a 10% increase in the fraction of the population 60+ decreases economic



                                                17
growth by 5.5%. Our IV estimate is smaller in magnitude than the OLS estimate, consistent

with systematic migration of younger individuals to faster growing areas. The difference

between the OLS and IV estimates is marginally statistically significant (p=0.06). The IV

estimates are largely unaffected by the weighting scheme. Without weighting, we estimate

a statistically significant effect of 4.8%. While noisy, we find consistent results for each

decade, regardless of weights.

       While our specification models changes in per capita GDP as a function of changes in

the older population share, economic growth may also be affected by changes at other

points of the age distribution. Moreover, predicted increases in the 60+ population share

may be correlated with predictable growth in the share of other age groups, suggesting the

possibility of an omitted variable related to changes in other (correlated) age group shares.

We can test for this possibility explicitly given that our instrumental variables strategy can

be extended to predict growth in other age groups. To implement this, we include multiple

age groups, one at a time, in our specification and, as before, estimate our main model using

two-stage least squares, where the instruments are the predicted changes in each included

age group using the same method to predict changes as before. The excluded age group is

the 20-29 age group. The results are presented in Appendix Table A.1. We find that only

growth in the 60+ population leads to a statistically significant decrease in growth in GDP

per capita. When we include all other age groups, our estimate is nearly the same as

before—a 10% increase in the fraction of the population aged 60+ is associated with a

5.9% decrease in the rate of economic growth. Including or excluding the other age groups




                                               18
has little effect on this estimate. Consequently, we conclude that separately identifying

these other age groups is not necessary for consistent estimation in our context. 15

        We also test the robustness of our results to functional form assumptions. Silva and

Tenreyo (2006) show that a logged dependent variable in a linear regression restricts the

error term. The specification in equation (2) assumes that the error term is multiplicative

in per capita GDP growth. Using an exponential specification and Poisson regression

relaxes this assumption, allowing for both multiplicative and additive error terms. We

replicate our main analysis using instrumental variables Poisson regression and present

the results in Appendix Table A.2. We find similar results as before, suggesting that our

estimates are not driven by functional form assumptions.

     Similarly, we test whether our results are driven by specifying changes in the log of per

capita GDP as a function of changes in the log of the older population share instead of

changes in the level of the older population share. In Appendix Table A.3, we use changes

in the level of the older share, estimating that each percentage point increase in the older

share decreases per capita GDP growth by over 2%. Given that the mean older population

share in the sample is 0.24, a 10% increase in the older share implies a reduction in per

capita GDP growth of 4.9%, which is similar to our main estimate.

        In Appendix Table A.4 we show that our main estimates are robust to the inclusion

of region-year interaction terms, and therefore common regional shocks are not driving

our results. Appendix Table A.5 shows that the one-year misalignment in when labor

outcomes are measured in the Census compared to state of residence does not materially

15
  We have also estimated a version of Appendix Table A.1 in which we do not use a log transformation of our
explanatory variables because the age groups are different sizes and thus a 10% increase in the size of the
60+ population is different than a 10% increase in the 40-49 population. These results are qualitatively
similar to the results presented in Appendix Table A.1.


                                                    19
affect our estimates for the 2000-2010 period (the one period in which both the current

and prior year’s state of residence are available). The IV estimate increases in magnitude

when we use the prior year’s state of residence.

     Finally, our instrumental variable strategy assumes that the initial age distribution of a

state is not predictive of trends in economic output except through changes in the state age

structure. We test this assumption in multiple ways in Appendix Table A.6. In Column (1),

we present estimates using an instrument generated from the age distribution 20 years

prior, instead of 10 years. That is, we use the state age distribution in year t-10 (instead of

year t) to predict state-level population aging between t and t+10. Using the same method

as before, we predict the fraction of the population ages 60+ in year t as well as in year t+10

to construct the predicted change. The age distribution in year t-10 should be

disassociated with underlying economic trends between period t and t+10.16 The Column

(1) estimate is similar to the main estimate of this paper, suggesting that any pre-existing

trends are uncorrelated with our instruments.

     In Columns (2) and (3), we report estimates from a specification that controls for the

initial (period t) log of per capita GDP in state s to account for trends in initial economic

conditions. This control is potentially important given previous evidence of convergence

across states (Barro and Sala-i-Martin, 1992). Because of the biases associated with

estimating a specification with a lagged dependent variable, we use the GMM estimator

introduced in Arellano and Bond (1991). In Column (2), we present estimates using the

Arellano-Bond estimator. The estimate is larger in magnitude than the main estimate of

16Alternatively, we could predict changes in the age structure in a state based on the period t age structure
for individuals born in that state, not those living in the state at time t. Unfortunately, there is no first stage
for this instrument as it is not correlated with changes in a state’s age structure due to the high levels of
migration out of individuals’ state of birth before age 50.


                                                         20
the paper, though we cannot reject that the two estimates are equal (p-value=0.12).

Column (3) replicates Column (2) but also includes the lagged industry employment share

variables as additional controls. Again, the estimate increases in magnitude, though we

cannot reject the equality of the Column (2) and Column (3) estimates (p-value=0.26).17

The results shown in Appendix Table A.6 strongly suggest that underlying trends are not

driving our results.

B. Decomposing the Effect—Labor Force and Productivity Growth

        While the literature concurs that population aging is likely to lead to slower growth

in GDP per capita due to slower labor force growth, there is little evidence to suggest how

population aging might affect aggregate productivity. Table 4 decomposes GDP per capita

into these two components and separately estimates the effect of population aging on GDP

per worker and the number of workers per capita. Column (1) reproduces the total effect

of population aging on growth in GDP per capita. By construction, the estimated effects of

population aging on growth in GDP per worker (Column 2) and growth in workers per

capita (Column 3) sum to the total effect in Column (1).

        We find that, as expected, population aging decreases labor force growth (Column

3). Specifically, a 10% increase in the fraction of the population 60+ leads to a 1.7%

decrease in the growth rate of workers per capita. However, population aging has an even

larger effect on productivity growth; a 10% increase in the fraction of the population 60+

leads to a 3.7% decrease in the rate of growth in GDP per worker.

        To decompose the productivity effect further, we use the following identity:



17Similarly, we cannot statistically reject that the Column (3) estimate is equal to the main estimate of this
paper.

where the components are defined as:

          Earnings

          𝐿
     4)       = fraction of population working (extensive margin of labor supply)
          𝑁


We then estimate equation (2) separately for the 10-year log difference of each component.

The results are shown in Table 5. The estimate in the top row of column (1) indicates that

growth in the older population share has little effect on the number of hours worked per

worker, or intensive margin labor supply. Rather, column (2) shows that a 10% increase in

the older share reduces GDP per hour worked by 3.4%. Because the intensive margin effect

is small, the effect of population aging on growth in GDP per hour worked (column 2 in

Table 5) is nearly the same as the effect of population aging on growth in GDP per worker

(column 2 in Table 4). Thus the estimated productivity effect is not explained by reductions

in the average number of hours worked.

          Next, in columns (3) and (4) of Table 5 we test whether the effect of population

aging on productivity growth reflects changes in the marginal product of labor. If workers

are paid proportional to their marginal product of labor, then earnings should adjust in

response to changes in productivity. If such adjustments are occurring, then the decline in

productivity growth should be reflected in earnings per hour worked18 and the effect of


18
  We use total earnings divided by total hours worked in a state, which is equivalent to a weighted (by hours)
average of individual hourly wages.


                                                         22
population aging on GDP per dollar earned should be zero. Our findings in columns (3) and

(4) of Table 5 support these hypotheses. A 10% increase in the fraction of the population

60+ decreases growth in the average wage by a statistically significant (p<0.05) 2%

(column 4), and decreases GDP per dollar earned by a statistically insignificant 1.4%

(column 3). The estimates in columns (3) and (4) sum to the estimate in column (2) by

construction. Thus, the decomposition points to changes in the marginal product of labor as

the primary source of the decline in productivity growth.

       Since labor earnings may not fully reflect labor costs due to benefits, we repeat the

decomposition substituting BEA’s measure of total labor compensation for labor earnings,

presented in the bottom row of Table 5. In these models, we find an even stronger negative

effect of population aging on growth in the average wage when it includes monetary and in-

kind benefits. Our estimates imply that a 10% increase in the fraction of the population 60+

leads to a statistically significant (p<0.01) 3.3% decrease in growth in average

compensation per hour worked and a statistically insignificant 0.1% decrease in growth in

GDP per dollar of labor compensation.

       It is important to note that our productivity estimates represent the combined effects

of all determinants of output per worker. Although output per worker can be decomposed

to estimate the separate contributions of capital, labor and total factor productivity (Wong,

2001; Feyrer 2007), this approach requires data measuring the physical capital stock over

time for the economic units of analysis. Unfortunately, no such government statistics on

physical capital exist for U.S. states. That said, while in principle a state’s physical capital

stock may adjust to compensate for a smaller workforce or changes in output per worker,

the fact that capital markets are integrated across U.S. states (in contrast to labor markets)



                                                23
means estimates from a state-based research design are unlikely to incorporate capital

effects. Furthermore, because capital flows more freely than labor in response to supply

and demand shocks (Kalemli-Ozcan et al., 2014; Bernard et al., 2013), any increases in the

supply of capital investment due to population aging (since older individuals hold more

wealth) are unlikely to accrue to the states in which they originate.

       Overall, our decomposition exercise suggests that about 1/3 of the total effect of

population aging on economic output growth operates through changes in labor force

participation. We find little evidence that intensive margin changes are an important driver

of the overall effect. The other 2/3 of the total effect is due to changes in GDP per hour

worked. We show that this reduction in productivity growth is matched by a reduction in

wage growth, which points to the existence of labor market adjustments that compensate

for real losses in the marginal product of labor.

       In the next sections, we explore potential mechanisms by which population aging

leads to slower economic growth, and in particular slower growth in labor productivity.

First, we estimate the effect of population aging on growth in GDP per capita at the industry

level to test if the effects are concentrated in any particular industry or set of industries.

Second, we examine the effects of population aging on employment and earnings for

different age groups to investigate the role of spillover effects from older to younger

workers.

C. Effects by Industry

       It is possible that population aging affects different industries to varying degrees,

depending on the age structure of their workforce, industry-specific skill demands or

whether the industry produces tradable or nontradable goods or services. In addition,


                                               24
shifting consumption patterns with age may induce changes in demand for particular kinds

of goods and services. For example, as people withdraw from the labor force they tend to

reduce consumption of work-related goods and services and increase consumption of

healthcare services (Hurd and Rohwedder, 2008; Hurst, 2008). Our state-based research

design will capture these aging-induced product demand shifts to the degree the goods and

services demanded by older individuals are mostly consumed in the state where they are

produced. An example of such a service is health care, which in most instances must be

consumed where it is produced.19

        To explore this, we estimate equation (2) separately by industry. Although the

dependent variable is based on industry-specific GDP per person in a state, population

aging is measured at the state level as before. We present these industry estimates in Table

6. The first entry shows the effect of population aging on growth in output per capita of all

private industries. This estimate is similar to our main estimate for total output per capita

(private plus public sector) in column 1 of Table 4, and implies our main estimate is not

driven by changes in public sector output. The rest of the entries in Table 6 show the

estimated effects of population aging industry by industry. The largest effect arises in the

construction industry. We estimate that a 10% increase in the fraction of the population

60+ decreases growth in construction output per capita by 8.6%. We also find a

statistically significant aging-induced reduction in growth in Wholesale Trade, Retail Trade,

Finance/Insurance, and Services. The estimate for Manufacturing is of similar magnitude,

but imprecisely estimated. These patterns suggest that the decrease in overall economic

growth cannot be explained by a reduction in the growth of one or a small number of

  As noted elsewhere, our research design does not capture changes in demand that drive production in
other states (e.g., Internet sales) or that are dispersed uniformly across the national economy.


                                                    25
industries. Instead, it appears that population aging diminishes growth in most industries,

with statistically inconclusive estimates for Agriculture, Mining,20 and

Transportation/Utilities.

D. Spillover Effects on Younger Age Groups

        Workers in different age groups may be substitutes or complements to one another

and therefore the productivity of one age group can depend on interactions with workers

in other age groups. Such productivity spillovers could occur between older and younger

workers if, for example, an older worker’s greater experience increases not only his own

productivity but also the productivity of those who work with him. In this section, we

examine the effects of population aging on the employment and earnings growth of men

and women in different age groups to investigate the role of spillover effects from older to

younger workers.

        First, we estimate equation (2) separately for men and women by ten-year age

groups, where the dependent variable in each regression is the change in the log

employment rate of the age-gender group. As before, the key independent variable in all

models is the change in the log fraction of population ages 60+ (both genders combined),

for which we instrument as above. The two-stage least squares estimates are shown in

Table 7. We find little effect of population aging on employment growth in younger age

groups, but larger reductions in employment growth in older age groups. The results

suggest that an increase in the fraction of the population ages 60+ does not crowd out

younger workers. Rather, these results imply that the slowdown in employment growth


20
  The Mining sector workforce is expected to age rapidly over the next several decades (Brandon, 2012), but
because of its geographic concentration within just a few states, we lack statistical power to detect effects on
economic growth.


                                                       26
induced by population aging was indeed concentrated among older individuals and, in

particular, among older men. It is true, however, that as the population ages the workforce

becomes older. Table 8 shows how population aging induces an increase in the share of the

workforce that is 50 and older and a decrease in the share under 40.21

        Table 9 presents the corresponding wage effects by age group and gender.22 The

outcome variable is the change in the log wage, which as before is defined as total labor

earnings divided by total hours worked (by age group, gender, state, and year). Here, we

find large effects of population aging on productivity growth among younger workers, as

well as older workers. Our point estimates imply that a 10% increase in the fraction of

population ages 60+ reduces productivity growth across the age distribution (through age

69), and for males and females alike, by 3-5%.

        Our estimates reveal how population aging-induced changes in labor supply alter

the productivity composition of the workforce. We find that population aging leads to

slower average wage growth for workers ages 60-69, which implies that individuals in this

age range who retire tend to be more productive on average than those who stay in the

workforce, that growth in the number of older workers drives down wages for the older

age group, or both. The reduction in wage growth for younger workers could arise from the

loss of positive production spillovers from retiring older workers to their younger

counterparts if the productive older workers are more likely to retire.23 More generally,

lower average productivity among older workers may affect younger groups if younger and
21
   Note our results illustrate that an aging-induced reduction in the younger employment share does not
necessarily imply an aging-induced reduction in the younger employment rate.
22
   In this analysis, we cannot account for the full compensation costs since the BEA does not estimate
compensation data by age group.
23
   Note the presence of negative wage growth effects across the age distribution is also consistent with
efficiency losses arising from the “thinning” of labor markets in areas with faster population aging (Gan and
Li, 2004).


                                                      27
older workers are complementary inputs in production, resulting in slower wage growth

for both groups.

       The relative productivity of older workers relative to younger workers may depend

on work experience, health, education, and a host of other factors. Feyrer (2008) notes that

typical estimates of the return to experience from Mincer wage regressions imply a 60

percent difference between the productivity of 20-year old and 50-year old workers. A case

study of German car manufacturers found suggestive evidence that more experienced older

workers were more productive than younger workers (Börsch-Supan et al., 2008).

       Until recently, this experience-productivity advantage was in part offset by the

higher educational attainment of younger workers compared to older workers. But as a

result of the secular growth in educational attainment through the 1970’s (Goldin and Katz,

2007), completed education among 65 year olds is rising dramatically, from 10.1 years in

1980 to an expected 13.3 years in 2020. The subsequent slowdown in educational

attainment means that, in sharp contrast, completed education among 25 year olds is rising

very little, from 13.3 years in 1980 to a projected 13.9 years in 2020. The net result is that

the average older worker is now nearly as educated as the average younger worker.

       Age-related health differences may also offset part of the experience-productivity

advantage, owing to the higher prevalence of disability with age. However, trends in health

suggest this too may be lessening as obesity-related disabilities disproportionately affect

younger cohorts (Freedman et al., 2013). Perhaps the biggest open question pertains to the

age profile of cognition and its effect on work productivity. While some aspects of cognition

decline gradually over the adult lifespan (e.g., processing speed), others hold steady until

late life (e.g., knowledge) (Verhaegen and Salthouse, 1997), and there is considerable



                                              28
heterogeneity in the timing of decline across individuals (Hartshorne and Germine, 2015).

Most intriguingly, cohort improvements in cognitive functioning point to a process of

cognitive aging that is itself highly plastic (Staudinger, 2015).

           These age and cohort patterns in human capital acquisition and decumulation point

to the possibility of heterogeneity in the effects of population aging on economic growth

over time. Appendix Tables A.7-A.9 present the employment and wage effects by age and

gender for each decade between 1980 and 2010. We find that the negative spillover effects

on wages of younger workers were strongest in the 1980s—when employment rates

among older men were at their lowest point ever, when the human capital gap between

older and younger workers was closing rapidly, and prior to the proliferation of desktop

computers and the Internet. 24 Since then, employment rates among older men and women

have risen, and the diffusion of technology has changed the skill demands of many jobs.

           While further research is needed to identify the exact mechanisms at work, our

findings foretell a further slowdown in productivity growth reflecting not only

compositional differences in the workforce but also real productivity losses among

individuals across the age spectrum. At the same time, greater investment in human capital

development throughout the lifecycle coupled with policies and practices that encourage

employment at older ages could prevent these losses to some degree.

V. Discussion and Conclusion

           As the populations of developed countries become older than ever before, a

persistent question has been what impact will this unprecedented demographic change

have on consumption standards? Noting that population aging has been long underway in

24
     We do find some weak evidence of crowd out in employment of younger workers in the 1980s.


                                                     29
the U.S., and that changes in the population age structure of the U.S. were largely

predetermined by historical trends in fertility and mortality, we use variation in the rate of

population aging across U.S. states over the period 1980-2010 to estimate the economic

impact of aging on state output per capita. Over this time period and across states, we

observe substantial variation in population aging, including aging rates comparable to rates

forecasted for the United States in the near future.

           Our estimate of the elasticity of growth with respect to aging is that a 10% increase

in the fraction of the population ages 60+ decreases growth in GDP per capita by 5.5%.

Between 1980 and 2010, the older share increased by 16.8%. Thus our estimate implies

that per capita GDP growth over the same time period was 9.2% lower than it otherwise

would have been absent population aging. This corresponds to a 0.3 percentage point

decrease in the annual rate of growth over a time period when the average growth rate was

1.8 percentage points.

           Between 2010-2020 the older share of the U.S. population is expected to rise by

21%. Thus our estimate indicates population aging will reduce per capita GDP growth

during the current decade by 11%. Annualizing this rate, population aging will be

responsible for a 1.2 annual percentage point decrease in per capita GDP growth, relative

to the growth rate with no change in the national share 60+. Between 2020-2030, the older

population share will rise by 11%, implying an annual reduction in growth of 0.6

percentage points.25 Assuming that the counterfactual growth rate is 1.88% (the growth

rate between 1960 and 2010), our estimates imply that growth will slow to 0.68% this

decade and 1.28% next decade.


25
     Between 2030-2050, the older population share will rise by just 2%.


                                                       30
        Our estimates are larger than those predicted by the National Research Council

(2012). The Council predicted a slowdown in growth in GDP per capita of 0.33-0.55

percentage points per year relative to a long-run rate of growth in GDP per capita of 1.88%.

The explanation for the difference between our estimate and theirs, is that the Council

assumed population aging would primarily affect labor force growth and not productivity

growth. Our estimate of the effect of population aging on labor force growth alone is similar

to their estimate of the total effect of population aging.

        In fact, for the 1980-2010 period, about 2/3 of the total effect of population aging on

growth in GDP per capita arose from slower productivity growth, while 1/3 was due to

slower labor force growth, with labor supply effects concentrated entirely among older

workers. The slowdown in productivity growth applies across the age distribution and

includes younger workers. We interpret this as indicating that older and younger workers

are complements in production, and so the productivity of the older workforce affects the

productivity of younger workers. This pattern could also arise from a loss of positive

productivity spillovers from older to younger workers if productive older workers are

more likely to exit the labor force. We find little evidence that our estimated effect is driven

by any particular industry or set of industries.

        While our results suggest moderate reductions in economic growth associated with

population aging at the state-level, it is worth recalling that our estimates do not account

for any effects at the national level that may compensate for or exacerbate the slowdown in

output growth.26 Population aging may induce broader general equilibrium effects that we


26
  The National Research Council also did not account for general equilibrium effects of population aging on
the federal budget that might lead to changes in tax policy, so this is not a source of difference between our
estimate and their forecast.


                                                       31
cannot capture in a state-based research design, such as changes in federal tax policy.27 As

a result, our estimates do not preclude even larger effects of population aging on per-capita

economic growth in the United States in the coming decades. On the other hand, further

improvements in human capital coupled with greater labor force participation at older ages

could temper these effects, as well as reduce the magnitude of changes in federal tax policy

that will be required to address them.




27
     But note our research design does capture the effects of state policy responses.
