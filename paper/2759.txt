                          VOTING ON THE BUDGET DEFICIT


                                    ABSTRACT




        This paper analyzes a model in which different rational individuals vote
over the composition and time profile of public spending.    Potential

disagreement between current and future majorities generates instability in
the social choice function that aggregates individual preferences.  In

equilibrium a majority of the voters may favor a budget deficit.     The size of
the deficit under majority rule tends to be larger the greater is the

polarization between current and potential future majorities.  The paper also
shows that the ex-ante efficient equilibrium of this model involves a balanced

budget.    A balanced budget amendment, however, is not durable under majority
rule.

    Opinion polls show that American voters are well aware of the Federal

budget deficit, and disapprove of it.     However, there are clear indications
that it is politically very difficult to reach an agreement about how to
balance the budget. In particular, several polls show that even though voters
dislike deficits, they are not in favor of any specific measure which would

reduce them.1
    Two explanations for this apparent inconsistency of opinions are commonly

proposed.   One is that voters do not understand the concept of budget

constraint, and suffer from "fiscal illusion'.       However, it is quite difficult

to reconcile this notion with the standard assumption of individual

rationality.2   The other is that disagreement amongst voters generates cycling

and prevents the existence of a stable majority.       As a result, individual
                                                                   in a
preferences about intertemporal fiscal policy cannot be aggregated
consistent way, and no action can be taken to balance the budget.  However,

this argument fails to explain why the absence of a stable political
equilibrium should result in a budget deficit, rather than in a surplus or a
balanced budget: in principle,   it seems than any outcome could be observed if

the political equilibrium is indeterminate.
     This paper provides an alternative explanation of budget deficits which
is not based on either individual irrationality or non existence of

equilibrium.    The central ingredient of our explanation is the inability of

current voters to bind the choices of future voters.       This inability, coupled
with potential disagreement between the current and future majorities,
introduces a time inconsistency in the dynamic social choice problem that
determines the size of budget deficits: the policies desired by the current

majority would not be carried out if future majorities exhibit different
preferences. The awareness of this possibility may induce the current
majority to run a budget deficit in excess of what would be ex—ante optimal
for society as a whole. This explains why it is hard to agree on how to
eliminate deficits, even if there is a consensus that they may be socially

sub—optimal.
     Our results have a simple economic intuition.       Consider a rational voter

who is presented with a number of options on how to allocate the budget
amongst alternative uses.   Suppose further that he is uncertain about how
future majorities would choose amongst these same options in subsequent
                                                               be in favor of
periods. In such a situation, the rational current voter may
       deficits.  The costs of running current  deficits are not fully
budget
internalized by today's voter, not because of  his irrationality, but because

of his awareness that future policy choices might not reflect his
preferences.  In other words, the expected marginal disutility of having to
reduce spending in the future, to repay the debt incurred today, is not

sufficiently high.  As a result, he votes in favor of fiscal deficits.
     The paper also shows that, in this model, a balanced—budget is the ex—

ante optimal policy. That is, if the size of the deficit is chosen behind a
"veil of ignorance" on how the debt proceeds are spent, then the voters are
unanimous in choosing a balanced—budget.  This implies that current voters
would like to precommit governments in the distant future to a balanced budget
                                                                 on itself.
rule.  However, no current majority wants the rule to be binding
                                                                         is
Thus, a balanced-budget rule is enforceable only if a qualified majority

required to abrogate it.         This constraint may imply a suboptimal lack of
                                                                    in this situation as
flexibility in reacting to unexpected        events.   Therefore,
in many others, society has to choose on the tradeoff between 'rules and
discretion."

several extensions.


                                      2.   THE   MODEL



     A group of heterogeneous individuals has to decide by majority rule on
the production of two kinds of public goods, g and f. The group is endowed

with one unit of output in each period, and it can borrow or lend to the rest
of the world at a given real interest rate, for notational simplicity taken to
be 0. The world lasts two periods, and all debt outstanding has to be repaid
in full at the end of the second period.          Thus, the group faces the inter-

temporal constraint:

        For future reference, this interior optimum is illustrated in the diagram
of Figure 1. The downward sloping line denotes the cpportunity set faced by
the median voter in period 2, as a function of the debt inherited from the

past, b.       The equilibrium in period 2 occurs at point E, where the median

voter's indifference curve is tangent to his budget line.                                        The upwards sloping

line EP2 is the median voter's income expansion path. It traces out the
equilibrium combinations of g2 and f2 as b varies. The income expansion path
is not necessarily linear: Using                   (14),       its slope is given by R(g)/R(f).    With

decreasing absolute risk aversion (R                           K 0), this slope is greater than 1 if F

lies above the        1450   line (i.e., if         a      >   ,   as       in Figure 1); it is smaller than

1   if E lies below the            1450   line (i.e., if                >   fl.       The opposite holds if u(-)
exhibits increasing absolute risk aversion.                              Thus, except in the limit case of
constant absolute risk aversion,                   the equilibrium composition of public

spending is affected by the size of debt inherited from the past, b. in the
plausible case of decreasing absolute risk aversion, a larger value of b

implies a more balanced composition of    and f, for any given value of' the

value of b drives the equilibrium away from the 145° line, and hence brings
about a more unbalanced composition of                         g and f,              for any given cz

Throughout the paper, we define a more (less) balanced, composition as one
defined by a point in Figure                 1,   less (more) distant from the                        145°   line. This

        In period          1   there is uncertainty about the identity of the median voter

of period 2.            As a result, from the point of view of the voters in period 1,
the parameter    in (3) is a random variable. The policy most preferred by

aware that, in the subsequent                          period, g2 and f2 will be chosen by a median
voter with possibly different                          preferences. The expectation operator is taken
with respect to all possible types of future median voters, knowing how each
type would behave.                 Thus, today's median voter chooses the value of the state
variable b so as to influence the policy choices of future median voters,
based on the distribution                    of the future preference parameter,
        The median voter of period                 1 makes two choices: he chooses the


composition          of'   public goods in period                     1       and the amount of government borrowing

(lending).           If    1   >       >   0, the first order condition relative to g1 is:


                                   —                                           0                                           (6)

     The interpretation of (7) is straightforward.   The first term on the left

hand side is the marginal gain of issuing one more unit of debt; at the
                                                       of spending one extra
optimum, this must coincide with the marginal utility
unit on either of the two public goods (good g  in (7)). The second term of

(7) is the expected marginal disutility of having to repay the debt, by
curtailing public spending tomorrow. This in turn is computed by taking into
                                                                      random

of debt, b*, chosen by the median voter in period 1.
     In order to assess the sign of b*, in the next subsection we consider

equation (7) at the point b=0.  If at this point equation (7) is satisfied,
then b*   0.  If instead at b=O the left hand side of (7) is positive, then by
the second order condition we know that in equilibrium b*>0. And conversely,
if at brO the left hand side of              is negative, then the second order

conditions imply b*<O.


3.3  The Equilibrium Level of Debt
     First of all, consider what happens if the median voter at time                         1   is

certain that he will also be the median voter in period 2 (i.e., if
                                                                                                 =
                                                                                                     4
with                      In   this case,    the     second       term   in    (7)     reduces        to
          certainty).
                    so that b* r 0 is the only solution to (7) for any value of
      u'(G(o',b),
        This should come as no surprise:       since its rate of time discount

                                                                           of

amount in both periods.                  It    is easy to show that                  b*            0 is also the policy
that would be chosen by a benevolent social planner maximizing a weighted sum
of individual utilities (for any choice of weights). Thus, with no
uncertainty and no disagreement between current and future majorities, the
political equilibrium lies on the Pareto frontier.7
        The remainder of this section investigates the case in which         with                                                a
positive probability.     It is convenient to break down the second term on the
left hand side of (7) into the weighted average of two conditional

expectations:           the expectation conditional on the event that                                             1       >
                                                                                                                               a)       0; and
the expectation conditional on the event that                                   a            1   or           r 0.

        Consider this second case first.                          Thus, suppose that future median voters
are expected to always be at a corner, so that they produce only one kind of

public good (only g2 if                  a         1, and       only f2 if cz            =       0).     Suppose further that
           with positive probability.                           We have:


Proposition 1

greater the larger is the difference between                                    a and            the expected value of                      a.

        Proof:
Let cz =      1   with probability            ir   and
                                                          a a 0 with probability                          1—a,                1)ir>0.    Then,
using (6), equation (7) can be rewritten as:



                  a u'(g) -          a u'(l-b)
                                                          (1-a)u'(f)

                                                                                            with strict
inequality if                  .     Moreover, at               the point ba0, u'(l—b)  u'(g(a, b)) and
u'(l—b)        u'(f(a, b)), with strict inequality if                                    1>a           > 0.           Hence, at the
point b=0 the two left hand sides of (8) are always strictly positive.                                                                     As

argued above, by the second order conditions this implies that b*>0.
        In order to prove the second part of the Proposition, note that the

expected value of             a here         is just      ir.    Fix

                                                                  9
Applying the implicit function theorem to (8), we obtain                                           that             c   0.   Hence,
                                                                                                           do

                                  as                                                                                         (10)



Thus, if    cz'
                  >    ,     a    lower value of n (a higher likelihood that                              a     r   0)

increases bTM. And conversely, if cz < , a higher value of' i (a higher
likelihood that    r 1) also increases b*. Hence, b* tends to be larger when

the difference between a1 and the expected value of    is greater.      Q.E.D.

     This result has a simple intuition.  An increase in debt today implies a

reduction of aggregate spending tomorrow.                                       But since         lies outside the (0,1)

interval, tomorrow only one kind                               of'   public good will be provided.                  Hence, with

positive probability (and with probability                                      1   if   1   >   > 0), this reduction of
                                                                         from
spending will affect only the good that will have a low marginal utility
the point of view of today's median voter. Thus, the median voter of period 1

does not fully internalize the cost of issuing debt: he finds it optimal to
spend in excess of the current aggregate endowment. Moreover, this incentive
to borrow is stronger the lower is the marginal utility of the future public

good. This is more likely to happen if the future median jter is more likely
to exhibit very different tastes from the current median voter. That is, if
   is large and the probability of having cz   1 is small, or viceversa.


     Mext, consider the case in which    lies in the open (0,1) interval.

With no loss          of'   generality, suppose further that over this interval    is

Hence, under this condition, at the point brO the left hand side of (11) (and
hence of (7)) is strictly positive.           Thus:

     Next, let us define the probability distribution H(ci) as "more

That is, a more polarized probability distribution assigns more weight to
values of    that are further apart from c. The appendix also proves that,

Then, using (11)     appealing                     conditions,


Proposition 3
     Under the same conditions of Proposition 2, b* is larger the more polarized
is the probability distribution of               over the   interval   (0,1).


     If u'(x)/R(x) is everywhere decreasing (constant) for 1>x>O, then

Propositions 2 and 3 hold in reverse: b* <0 (b*rO) and b* is more negative if
      is more polarized.      If u'(x)/R(x) is not monotonic over               1>x>0,   then the

sign of b* is ambiguous.
     Condition    Cc)   is stronger then decreasing absolute risk aversion: it says

that the coefficient of absolute risk aversion, R, must fall more rapidly than

marginal utility as x increases.  Nonetheless, this condition is satisfied for
a large class of utility functions, such as any member of the HARA class which
also has decreasing absolute risk aversion. This family includes commonly
used utility functions, like the power function.
     In order to gain an intuitive understanding of the role played by

condition (c), consider the diagram of Figure 2.               The downward sloping line


                                                 11
denotes the opportunity set faced by the median voters in both periods if

brO.   A positive value of b shifts this line to the right in period 1, and to

the left in period 2.      A and B denote the points chosen in periods   and 2 by    1



the median voters of type      a and   crespectively, again for brO. For

concreteness,      it has been assumed that       >      )
                                                             cx.    The indifference curves

for the median voter of type ci in periods 1 and 2 are labelled I and II

respectively.  Finally, the upwards sloping lines EP1 and EP2 denote the income

expansion paths of types ci and a. As noted in Section 3.1, their divergent
slopes reflects the assumption of decreasing absolute risk aversion.                     Thus,

decreasing absolute risk aversion implies that the divergence between the
choices of the two types of median voter (points A and B) increases with
income.  To put it differently, with decreasing absolute risk aversion,
disagreement concerning the optimal composition of g and f is a luxury good: it
grows with the overall size of public spending.10
     The ambiguity in the sign of b* for 1>m>O is due to the opposite
influence of the two following countervailing forces. By running a surplus

(by setting b<O), the median voter in period 1 moves A to the left along EP
and B to the right along EP2; this has the effect of reducing the distance
between the indifference curves labeled I and II. Hence, setting b<O "buys

insurance" for the median voter of period         1,    in the sense that it tends to

equalize the level of utility in the two periods.                  This is the force that works

in the direction of making b<0 more desirable.
     On the other hand, by running a deficit (by setting b>O), the median
voter of period 1 moves B to the left along EP2. Since the slopes of EP1 and
    are divergent, this has the effect of moving point B closer to point A;
EP1
that is, it moves the future composition of public spending towards the point
that is preferred by today's median voter.             This is the force that provides the

incentive to issue public debt today.
       Condition    (c) guarantees   that this second effect prevails over the first

one.    This condition is more likely to be satisfied if the slopes of EP1 and
       are very divergent from each other (that is, if the coefficient of
EP2
absolute risk aversion is decreasing very rapidly); or if the indifference
curves are very flat (that is if the utility function is not very concave),

because in this case the indifference curves labeled                 I   and II are already close

to one another.
       Combining    the results of     Propositions 1—3, we can conclude that a

positive equilibrium level of debt is more likely if: 1) the future median
voter is likely to have extreme preferences and be at a corner (i.e.,

      (0,1) is likely); or ii) condition (C) on u(•) is likely to be
satisfied.     Moreover, in both cases, the size of debt is larger the greater is
the probability mass assigned to values of         that are very different from

that is, using the previous terminology, the more polarized is the
distribution of the future median voters preferences.
     It is worth noting that,    in a sense, (1) is the limit case of case (ii);
if the future median voter is at a corner, then its income expansion path

coincides with either the vertical or the horizontal axis.       With reference to
Figure 2, then, leaving some debt to the future has always the effect of

moving the future composition of public spending in the desired direction, as
in the less extreme case (ii).

     Furthermore, in a more general model, the future median voter could find
itself at    a corner even for values of ci belonging to the interior of the

[0,11 interval.     For instance, this would happen if the utility function u(•)
did not satisfy the Inada conditions, so that the indifference curve of Figure
1 could intersect either the horizontal or the vertical axis.  Alternatively,
it could happen if the public goods g and f had to be provided in some minimum

positive amounts (for instance, because of survival reasons): in this case
too, the future decisionmaker could find itself at a corner with respect to

       g2 or f2, despite the fact that
either                                       0. '"he expectation of this

event, in turn, would induce the current median voter to run a budget deficit,

Just like in the case of Proposition    1.    Obviously, this event would be more

likely to happen the closer is       to either 0 or 1.11


3.4 Positive Implications

     Propositions 1—3 relate the size of budget deficits to the instability of
the median voter's preferences over time.       This type of instability depends

upon the distribution of individual preferences within society.       In the

remainder of this section we show that, the more "homnogenous" are the

preferences of different individuals, ceteris paribus the more stable are the
median voter preferences over time.
     Consider a family of density functions indexed by c, y(a,c).       For a given

c, let y(ci,e)   be the frequency distribution of a over the [0,11 interval,
where a is the parameter' that summarizes the preferences of a specific



                                         13
individual in equation (2).           Different density functions are associated                    to
different values of c.          Thus, c can be thought of as a perturbation of the
distribution of the voters           preferences, associated with random shocks to the
voting participation         or to the eligibility of' the voting population.
       To any realization of C        is   associated a value of the median voter's

preferences, m(C), defined implicitly by:


           f    y(a,c)da - 1/2             0


The extent to which     m varies      as       takes different values depends on the

properties of the density function             y(ci,c).   Specifically, applying the
implicit function theorem to (1!!) one obtains:



           dm   = -   j      y(a,c)dci

                        y(a ,€)



where yE(a,e)                    The numerator of         (15)   is the area underneath the

density function that is shifted from one side to the other of                      cim   as c             a
                                                                                                         dci
varies.   According to (15), for a given value of the numerator,                      the term
is larger in absolute value the smaller is                             That   is,   if there are
relatively few individuals in the population that share the median voter's
preferences (i.e.:     if'   1(m,C)    is small for all C),         then   m tends     to vary a lot
as the distribution is perturbed by random shocks. Conversely, if the median
voter preferences are representative of a large part of the population, (i.e.:

if   y(a,)   is large), then      m    tends to be stable even in the face                of'    large
perturbations to the underlying distribution of voters preferences.
     This result is illustrated in Figure 3. Consider the top distribution
first. When e goes from     to ci, a fraction of individuals corresponding to
the area A is moved from the right to the left of                  a    m(C0), to the area                A'

r A.   This area is the numerator of (15).                The new median voter,        a        r

is found by equating the area between ci and a, B, to the area A. Consider
now repeating the same perturbation to the distribution in the bottom of

Figure 3. Clearly, the same area B now corresponds to a much larger horizontal
distance between
                      cz and    a:   since the frequency of the population around                    m         is

relatively small, the median voter's preferences here have to shift by much
      d   .—
'-I
more than in the ease of the top distribution of Figure 3.         This is the sense
in which a more polarized distribution of societies preferences (such as in
the bottom of Figure 3) tends to be associated with more instability and aore

polarization in the induced probability distribution of the median voter's
preferences.
     These considerations are suggestive of an empirically testable
interpretation for the results of Propositions 1-3.  Namely, that more

polarized and unstable societies have larger budget deficits than more
homogeneous societies. As suggested by the foregoing discussion, in a more
polarized and unstable political system there is a higher probability that
future maJorities will choose policies that are very different from those
chosen by today's majority.      And according to Propositions 1-3, it is

precisely   in this case that the current majority is in favor of budget

deficits.     Moreover, according to Proposition debt is more likely to be
                                                      1.

issued when the future majorities are likely tn have extreme preferences (for

then the likelihood of being at a corner is greater). Finally, note that even
condition (c) itself (which implies that debt will always be issued in the

presenen. of political uncertainty) can be interpreted as an instance of

polarization:    if the utility function u(.) satisfies condition Cc), then
different   types of median voters have divergent income expansion paths.        In

this case, current and future majorities         tend to choose different policies    in

the following sense: they allocate changes in their budget (cuts or

increments) to very different     items.    According to Proposition 2, this kind of
"incremental'! polarization always creates incentives in favor of issuing

public debt.


                k.   CONSTITUTIONAL   CONSTRAINTS ON THE BUDGET DEFICIT


     The previous results state that in equilibrium a majority of the voters
may be in favor of a budget deficit. This section investigates the efficiency

properties of this equilibrium.
     Section 3•1 showed that a social planner certain of being reappointed
would always choose b*rO, for any weighting of individual preferences.          That

is, a balanced budget is always a component of the first best policy. On this
ground, it is tempting to conclude that a budget deficit is inefficient in
this model.     However, this argument would be wrong, or at least misleading.



                                            15
By assumption, a social planner can precommit to choosing the composition of
both periods       1   and 2 public goods according to a stable social welfare
function.        This assumption   is violated in the political equilibrium of the
model and in any real world political regime: the current majority cannot

precommit    the spending choices of future majorities.          In other words, the

solution to the social planners optimum is not necessarily the optimal social
contract to write for a group of individuals who cannot also precommit the

expenditure choices of future governments.
        In order to characterize such an optimal social contract consider the

following conceptual experiment.          Suppose that the collective decision prccess
in period    1   is separated    in two stages.     First the group chooses a level of

debt, b.     Then it chooses the composition of the public good in terms of g1
and
    f1.     The decision taken at this second stage depends on the value of a for
the median voter,        a,   as in equation (6).    Suppose further that at the first
stage, when choosing b, the group ignores the value of ci corresponding to the
second stage. That is, suppose that the decision concerning b is taken behind
a "veil of ignorance" about the outcome of the second stage. We can think of
a constitutional amendment on the size of budget deficits as being chosen in
this way)2 Under these hypothesis, the optimal level of b for agent i is

determined as the solution to the following problem:




      Max                                                                b))]}
          E(m1[u(g(a', b)+u(G(a, bfll+ (1—a')[u(f(a,b))+u(F(cz,
                                                                                       (1Z1)
       b



where E is the expectations operator with respect to the random variables

           and where g(.), f(S),

the previous section.   If cz and   are drawn from the same prior

distribution, then it is easy to show that the only solution to (111) is brO,
for any value of cz1.13 Thus, using the terminology of Holmstrom-Myerson

(1983), we can conclude that a balanced budget rule is "ex-ante efficient":
before knowing the identity of the current majority, the group is unanimous in
favoring a balanced budget amendment.1
        If however the value of      a corresponding
                                              to the second stage is known
when choosing b, then we are back in the equilibrium examined in the previous
section, where a majority might support a deficit and oppose the balanced



                                              16
budget amendment.     In other words, each current majority generally does net
want to be bound by the amendment, even though it wants such an amendment for
all future majorities.    Thus, such an amendment can be approved only if it
does not bind the current majority.  However, a budget amendment taking effect
at some prespecified future date would be irrelevant: if one needs only a
simple majority to abrogate the rule, then any future majority would follow
the policy described in Section 3 and would abrogate the amendment. Using

again the terminology of Holmstrom—Myerson (1983), we can conclude that a
balanced budget amendment, though ex-ante efficient, is not "durable" under

majority rule.
     This problem could be overcome by requiring a qualified majority to
abrogate the amendment. But this requirement would eliminate the flexibility
that may be needed to respond to Lnexpected and exceptional events.

Obviously, a budget rule could be contingent on prespeoified events, such as
cyclical fluctuations of tax revenues or "wars."     However, since it is very

diffioult, or even impossible, to list all the relevant contingencies, it
might be desirable to retain some degree of flexibility. Thus, requiring a
very iarge majority to abandon (even ;emporarily) the budget balance
constraint may be counterproductive.
     These normative    results may contribute to explain the empirical
observation that the majority of voters seems to generally favor an abstraot
notion of balanced budgets, even though when choosing specific policies it
votes in favor of budget deficits (see the literature quoted in footnote 1).

Balance budgets are ex-ante efficient.     Therefore, the majority of voters,
asked in a poll if they would like a balanced budget constitutional amendment,
would answer "yes."    However the same majority of voters may choose to run a

budget deficit in the current period, if uncertain about the preferences of
future majorities.
     More generally, these results suggest the desirability of institutions
that would enable society to separate its intertemporal choices from decisions
concerning the allocation of resources within any given period.  In evaluating
such institutions, there seems to be an inescapable conflict between the goal
of preserving sufficient flexibility to meet unexpected contingencies, and the
oonstraints imposed by the requirement of enforcing this separation.

                              5.   SUMMARY AND EXTENSIONS


     This paper shows that disagreement between current and future voters
about the composition of public expenditure generates a suboptimal path           of'


public debt.     Public debt becomes the legacy left by today's voters to the

future, so as to influence the choices of future voters.          This legacy tends to
increase with the likelihood of disagreement between current and future
voters.     Thus, this paper establishes a precise link between political
polarization and budget deficits.      Political polarization can be interpreted

as a situation where the preferences of future majorities can be very
different from the preferences of today's majority.         This can occur if a
government with extreme preferences (relative to the historical average) wins
the temporary support of a majority of the voters.          Alternatively, it can
occur in political systems where parties with very different preferences are

equally likely to obtain a majority.      Thus, the implications of this paper are
in principle    testable against either time series or cross sectional data.

Perhaps the most natural empirical work along these lines would be a cross
sectional comparison of the deficit policies of countries governed by
different political     institutions and with different degrees of political

conflict.
     The model presented in this paper can be generalized in several
directions.    First of all, the restriction to only two types of public goods
is made only for simplicity. Enlarging the set of public goods presents only
one difficulty: it implies an increase of the dimensionality of the parameter
space over which different voters disagree. This complicates the description
of the collective decision problem.      However, this difficulty can be overcome
by either imposing special assumptions on the distribution of voters over this
larger dimensional space -— for instance by assuming the existence of' a
"median—in—all—directions", as in Davis—Degroot—Hinich (1972); or by requiring
a super—majority vote to change the status-quo, as in Caplin-alebuff

(1988). Under either of these assumptions, the results of the previous
sections could be extended to the case of more than two public goods.

     Secondly, the model could be extended to the infinite horizon, by

applying the dynamic programming solution procedure presented in Alesina—
Tabellini    (1987a).   In an infinite horizon model one could also study the
possibility of cooperation between current and future median voters, for



                                           18
instance based upon trigger strategy equilibria.       In these equilibria the path

of'   the   public debt could be brought arbitrarily close to the socially
efficient value.       However, in order to obtain the socially efficient solution
one needs cooperation between successive median voters: cooperation amongst
different voters within the same time period would not solve the intertemporal
distortions that are the focus of this paper.       As such, the reputation
mechanism that would be needed to enforce cooperation might require

substantial amounts of coordination.       In addition, with discounting of the

future, the qualitative implications o       reputational equilibria may be similar
to those of the equilibrium studied in the present paper.5
     Finally, a natural and yet difficult extension of the basic model would
be to allow the voters to choose Thether or not to repudiate the debt.
                                                                        in the
Indeed, the results of this paper are driven by a fundamental asymmetry
commitment technologies available to the voters: even though current voters

cannot bind the spending choices of future majc.rities, nonetheless they are
assumed to be able to force future majorities to honor their debt obligations.
This asymmetry seems to faithfully reflect a feature of the real world, at
least in industrialized economies during the recent decades.       Eut still, the

puzzle remains of what is the source of this asymmetry.       Some recent

interesting literature has investigated the idea that reputational mechanisms
create incentives in favor of honoring the internal debt obligations of

previous governments (see in particular Grossman—Van Huyck (1987a)).16 The
political economy approach of this paper suggests a second line of attack:
domestic debt repudiation may not be politically viable, because it would be

strenuously opposed by the private sector holders of the debt. Recent
accounts of historical episodes of debt repayments in Europe during the
iriterwarperiod lend support to this view (see for instance Alesina
(1988b)). Further investigation of this line of thought sets an exciting task
for future research.

1.    Both   recent    polls      (New York Times, November 1987) and polls taken in the

      early eighties (Blinder—Holtz Eakin (1983)) show that a large majority
      of American voters          is in favor of budget balance aniendrnents.        A much

      lower fraction of voters is in favor of any specific measure to reduce

      budget deficits and there is disagreement on which expenditures (taxes)
      to reduce (increase), if any.
2.    For recent arguments explaining the deficit as the result of "fiscal

      illusion", see Buchanan et. al. (1987) and the references quoted
      therein. Rogoff-Sibert (1988) and Rogoff (1987) have shown that

      suboptimal budget deficits may be observed before elections if voters
      are rational but imperfectly informed. This mechanism can explain short
      budget cycles around elections, but it cannot explain long lasting and
      large budget deficits which go well beyond the electoral cycle.
3.    One interpretation of this model is that each member of the group is

      taxed identically and the total amount of tax revenues is exogenously
      given.  For a model with similar features, in which distortionary taxes
      and private consumption are endogenously determined, see Alesina
      Tabellini (1987a). By following the same procedures used in that paper,
      the present model can be extended to incorporate endogenous taxation

      with no qualitative changes in the results.
14•   Any expected      utility     function    that    is linear in   a vector of parameters
      belongs to this class.           Even though linearity was not essential in
      Grandmont       (1978), it is essential here, since we deal with an expected

      utility function.           There are families of preferences which do not admit
      linear representation          and yet are intermediate preferences.          However, in
      the absence of linearity           in the vector of parameters, the property of

      intermediate preferences would not necessarily be preserved by the

      expectations operator.  The essential property of intermediate
      preferences is that supporters of distinct proposals are divided by a
      hyperplane in the space of most preferred points. See Grandmont (1978)
      and also Caplin-Nalebuff           (1988).

5.    This setting is reminiscent of that analyzed in Strotz (1956), where a

      consumer with time inconsistent preferences solves a dynamic opti-
      mization problem.           See also Peleg and Yaari (1973) and the references



                                                   20
      quoted therein.           In those papers, like here, the time consistent

      solution is described as the non cooperative equilibriL!n of a game

      played by successive decision makers.
6.    This    second order sufficient condition can be stated as follows:



            R(f2)3R(g2)+R(g2)2R(f2)2+( 1—y)R'(g2)R(f2)2+
                                                                                              (F.1)

            +yR(g2)3R(f2)+yR(g2YR(I2)2+(y—l                     )R'(f2)R(g2)2>0


      where       y

                       1-.m

                                    rn


                                          and where R() r -u"()/u'() is the coefficient


      of absolute risk aversion of u(S). In turn, a sufficient (but not
      necessary) condition for (F,1) to hold is that:



            R(f2)R(g2)+R(g2)2+R(g2)> 0
      and
         R(f2)R(g2)+R(f2)2+R(f2 > 0
7.    in a more general framework, the socially optimal policy might imply
      running a deficit or a surplus (for instance, to smooth tax distortions
      over time, as in Barro (1979) and Lucas-Stokey (1983)).                     Here, for

      simplicity, we abstract from these complications.
8.    This condition can also be stated as:


              ü"'(x)   >   2[u'(x)]2/u'(x),                1>x>O

      or

              R'(x)        R2(x)   <     0,       1>x>O.

9.    The same results would go through if the definition of "more polarized
      in (13) was stated with respect to other measures of distance between
      and    a,   such as euclidean norm or                     (&   —

                                         however would introduce an additional compli-

      cation. Namely, the probability that the future decisioninaker will be at
      a corner could now be endogenous, and in particular depend on the
      borrowing policies of' previous governments. This would add another

       dimension to the problem           of'   choosing the optimal debt policy.
12.    The notion that optimal social contracts may be thought                    of'   as being

       chosen under a "veil of ignorance" concerning                how the policy game is

       played in subsequent stages is due to Rawls (1971) and Buchanan-Tullock
       (1962).
13.    If         and      have the same probability distribution, say             H(),     then the

       first order condition of (V1) with respect to b can be written as:


                                                                         +
            a'J[u'(g(a,b))g(a,b) + u'(G(a,b))Gb(a,b)JdH(a)

            +(1_01) f[u'(f(a,b)fb(a,b)          +                               r 0
                                                    u'(F(o,b))Fb(m,bfldH(a)

       It can be shown that if           b0,    then the terms inside each integral sum to
       zero.       Hence, by the second order conditions,           b0   is the solution to

       (14).
111.   Unanimity would be lost if the distributions of                    and         in (14) were
       different from each other.

15.    Alesina (1987), (1988a) investigates the properties of these

       reputational equilibria           in   a repeated static game played by two randcily
       alternating policyrnakers.
16.    P.   much larger     literature   has investigated     the   problem     of external debt
       repudiation, for instance Sachs (385), Bulow—Rogoff (1987), Grossman-
       Van Huyck (1987b).

     Consider now this expression at the point brO. Thediscussion on p. 8 of
the rext implies that, at brO, ou'(g1) — v(oT)    0. Since, as shown above,

under (c) aT r argmin v(4), we have that, if brO:
