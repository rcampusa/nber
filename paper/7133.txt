Offshore Invesment Funds: Monsters in Emerging Markets?

                                           ABSTRACT

       The 1997-99 financial crises in the emerging markets have brought to the foreground the
concern about offshore investment funds and their possible role in exacerbating volatility in the
markets they invest in. Offshore investment funds are alleged to engage in trading behaviors that
are different from their onshore counterparts. Because their behavior is less moderated by tax
consequences, and because they may be subject to less supervision and regulation, the offshore funds
may trade more intensely. They could also pursue more aggressively certain trading strategies such
as positive feedback trading or herding that could contribute to greater volatility in the market.
               Using a unique data set, we compare the trading behavior in Korea by offshore funds
with that of their onshore counterparts registered in the United States and the United Kingdom.
There are a number of interesting findings. First there is indeed evidence suggesting that the
offshore funds trade more intensely than their onshore counterparts. Second, however, there is no
evidence that the offshore funds engage in positive feedback trading. In contrast, there is strong
evidence that the funds from the US and UK do so. Third, while offshore funds herd, they do so
significantly less than the offshore funds from the US or UK. In sum, the offshore funds are not
especially worrisome monsters.

1.     Introduction


       The 1997-99 financial crises in the emerging markets have brought to the
foreground the concern about offshore investment funds and their possible role in
exacerbating volatility in the markets they invest in. Offshore funds are collective
investment funds registered in tax havens, typically small islands in the Caribbean,
Europe and Asia Pacific. The host countries/territories not only do not tax the funds, they
typically do not forward the financial information to other tax and financial authorities.
Furthermore, the regulation on these funds in the tax havens is often less stringent than
that of major industrialized countries where most of the onshore investment funds are
located. Helm (1997, p414) listed seven areas in which offshore funds face less
regulations as compared with their counterparts in the U.S. For example, offshore funds
would have greater flexibility and less procedural delays in changing the nature,
structure, or operation of their products, and they would face fewer investment
restrictions, short-term trading limitations, capital structure requirements, governance
provisions, and restrictions on performance-based fees.
       As a consequence, offshore funds may engage in trading behaviors that are
different from their onshore counterparts. For example, it has been alleged that foreign
portfolio investors may engage in positive feedback trading (e.g., rushing to buy when the
market is booming and rushing to sell when the market is declining), and eager to mimic
each other's behavior while ignoring information about the fundamentals. There is a
concern that offshore funds may be more prone to this kind of trading pattern than their
onshore counterparts either due to the nature of their investment styles or due to lower
regulatory constraints they face at home. Behaviors such as these by offshore funds could
exacerbate a financial crisis in a country to an extent not otherwise warranted by
economic fundamentals.
        A better understanding of the offshore funds' behavior is highly relevant for the
renewed debate on capital controls on short-term portfolio capital flows. Aside from
outright capital controls imposed by capital receiving countries, one may imagine better
supervision and risk regulation by the governments of the capital-exporting countries as
another way to regulate international capital flows. Indeed, many may prefer this
                                              3



approach to outright capital controls imposed by capital-importing countries. However,
the presence of offshore funds adds challenges to this approach. Even when the G7
governments can agree on a particular regulatory structure, it may not apply to the
offshore centers. Moreover, many currently onshore funds could migrate offshore as a
result of changes in the regulations in their onshore domiciles.
       The hypothesis that offshore funds may pursue destabilizing trading strategies can
be connected with an emerging literature on behavioral finance, mostly in the domestic
finance context. For example, using evidence from domestic market data, it has been
argued that institutional investors often exhibit herding behavior, though the tendency is
quantitatively small (see Lakonishok, Shleifer and Vishny, 1992). There are also
theoretical models in which rational investors may pursue positive feedback strategies,
destabilizing prices in the process (De Long, Shleifer, Summers, and Waldmann, 1990).
           A number of authors have empirically examined the behavior of foreign investors
in emerging markets. They include Frankel and Schmukler (1996, 1998), who have
investigated closed-end country funds; Choe, Kho, Stulz (1998), who have examined the
effects of foreign investor as a whole on the Korean stock prices; Froot, O'Connell and
Seasholes (1998) who have examined the aggregate portfolio flows into various
countries; and Kim and Wei (1999), who have looked into the differences as well as
similarities in trading behavior between individual versus institutional foreign investors,
and foreign investors who reside in Korea versus those outside. None of these papers
has compared the behavior between offshore and onshore funds.
           Fung and Hsieh (1997), Brown, Goetzmann and Ibbotson (1999) and Brown
Goetzmann and Park (1999) pioneered the examination of trading strategies of hedge
funds, many of them located offshore. They find that hedge funds appear to shift weights
on different assets very frequently. The last paper finds that the currency hedge funds
were unlikely to have triggered the Asian currency crisis. Lacking the data on actual
position holdings of the funds, these papers utilize return information to infer trading
strategies a la Sharpe's (1992) style analysis. This is clever and very useful, but there
can be errors if certain assets that the funds have actually traded on are not included in
the analysis by the econometricians, and the omitted and included assets have correlated
returns.
                                                   4


        In this paper, we utilize a unique data set on actual month-end trading positions of
foreign funds in Korea to study the behavior of offshore funds. To put the results in
context, we compare them with those funds that are registered in the United States and
United Kingdom (and also Singapore and Hong Kong as a supplementary group), where
the relevant regulations and regulators are among the most respected in the world', and
where most onshore funds are located. The Singapore and Hong Kong make a useful
comparison group because they, like the offshore centers, do not tax capital gains. The
data covers the period from the end of 1996 to June 30, 1998, which allows us to see if
the behavior of the funds changes during a financial crisis.
        It is useful to note that the effect of foreign investors as a group was found to be
small on the Korean market volatility in 1997 in part because foreign investors were not a
large part of the market (Choe, Kho, Stulz, 1998). We still would want to know if the
offshore funds engage in trading patterns potentially more destabilizing than their
onshore counterparts. If the answer is yes, then, in markets where they have a larger
presence (that is, in smaller and/or more open markets thatiKorea in 1997 which may
include Korea itself in the future), they could still contribute to the market volatility in a
significant way.
        The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes our data sets. Sections 3,
4, and 5 examine three aspects of foreign investor behavior, respectively: turnover,
feedback trading, and herding. Section 6 offers some concluding remarks.


2.      Data


Offshore and onshore funds and their positions
        Our investor position data set identifies each foreign investor by a unique ID
code, and reports the domicile of each fund, and its month-end holding of every stock
listed in the Korean stock exchange. Our sample covers the period from the end of 1996

'In a survey firms reported by the Global Competitiveness Report 1998 (World Economic Forum, 1998),
the respondents were asked to rate the perceived adequacy of financial regulation. On a 1 (least adequate)
to 7 (most adequate) scale, the United States and United Kingdom received an average of 6.53 and 6.36
scores, respectively. Both of them are among the top five most adequate countries among the 53 countries
covered in the sample. In addition, Singapore and Hong Kong (with the scores of 6.29 and 5.72,
respectively) are also among the top fifteen countries in the country in terms of adequate regulations of
                                              5



to June 30, 1998. This proprietary data set was kindly provided to us by the Korea
Securities Computer Corporation (KOSCOM), an affiliate to the Korea Stock Exchange
(KSE).
         Our set of offshore funds are mutual funds or unit trusts that report their domicile
to the Korean government as either Bahamas, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Channel
Islands, Guernsey, Jersey, Liechtenstein, Panama, or the British Virgin Islands. There are
77 such funds that own some stocks at least sometime during the sample. It is interesting
to note that almost every single such domicile has a current or historical Anglo-Saxon
connection. According to anecdotal evidence, many of the investors in the offshore funds
are current or past nationals of the United States, United Kingdom or other G7 countries.
         For comparison, we also look at mutual funds or unit trusts that are registered in
the United States and United Kingdom (as a group), two largest homes of the onshore
investment funds, and those in Singapore and Hong Kong (as another group). All of the
four have well-regarded securities and mutual fund laws and competent regulatory
agencies. There are a maximum of 783 funds in the US/UK group, and 36 funds in the
Singapore/HK group in the sample.
      We exclude funds from many other domiciles such as Luxembourg from the
analysis because we cannot separate offshore from onshore funds registered in the same
country. We also exclude pension funds, commercial banks, investment banks, or
insurance companies from our analysis, because none of them active in Korea except for
one commercial bank comes from an offshore center on our list.
          Table I reports the number of funds in each category. We see that the average
position of an offshore fund in Korea is a lot smaller than the average of an American or
British fund, though slightly larger than that of a Singapore or Hong Kong fund. There is
no category labeled as hedge funds in our sample. Our understanding from
communicating with KOSCOM is that they would register themselves either as mutual
funds, unit trusts, or as "others". Notice that a hedge fund can either be an onshore or
offshore fund. Our presumption would be that a greater fraction of the funds from our
offshore group are hedge funds or pursue hedge-fund-like strategies than those from the
U.S. and U.K.

        The position data by investor and by stock is hard to come by in general. In our
case, the Korean government's restriction on foreign ownership of Korean stocks and the
need to enforce it helps to make this data available.2




Stock Data
        For each stock, we collect information on (i) month-end price, (ii) month-end
number of shares outstanding, and (iii) whether the investment ceiling is binding in that
month. In addition, we also collect information on the Korea Composite Stock Price
Index (KOSPI) from KOSCOM and month-end Won/dollar exchange rate from the
Federal Reserve Board's website3.
        Figures 1 and 2 plot the exchange rate (US dollar/1,000 Won) and the stock
market price index (KOSPI), respectively. Combining the two pieces of information,
Figure 3 traces the dollar value of a $100 investment in KOSPI on January 1, 1997
throughout the sample (to June 30, 1998).
        November 1997 was the month when the foreign exchange crisis occurred in
Korea. On November 18, the Bank of Korea gave up defending the Korean Won. And on
November 21, the Korean government asked the IMF for a bail out. In some of our
analyses, we break the sample into two: a pre-crisis period before and including October
1997 (ten months in our sample), and an in-crisis period from November 1997 to June
1998.


3.      Intensity of Trading

        Not having to pay capital gains tax, and facing less supervision and regulation
from home governments may induce offshore finds to trade more intensively than their

2
 For example, between May and November 1997, foreign investors, in aggregate, could not own more than
23% of the outstanding shares per company and foreign investors, individually, could not own more than
6%. Since May 1998, there exists no restriction on foreign ownership, except for 42 listings on KSE and 6
on KOSDAQ. Upper ceiling on foreign investors in aggregate changed from 10% (Jan, 1992) -) 12% (Dcc,
1994) -3 15% (Jul. 1995) -3 18% (Apr, 19%) -3 20% (Oct. 1996) 4 23% (May, 1997) 4 26% (Nov,
1997) - 55% (Dec, 1997) - 100% (May, 1998). As for individual foreign investor, the upper ceiling
changed from 3% (Jan, 1992) -3 4% (Apr, 19%) -3 5% (Oct. 1996) -3 6% (May, 1997) -3 7% (Nov.
1997) -3 50% (Dec. 1997) -9 100% (May, 1998).

onshore counterparts4. In addition, investment funds that prefer to trade more actively
may self-select to locate in the offshore centers.
        In this section, we examine whether offshore funds actually trade more intensely
or not. Because our data does not record within-month transactions, we cannot compute
an accurate measure of turnover. However, we observe the total changes in the weights
allocated to different stocks on a monthly basis. Our presumption is that, across investor
groups, the total changes in the month-to-month weights are highly correlated with the
true turnovers. We will use the term "trading intensity" in subsequent discussions to
denote the changes in the weights on all the stocks.
        Let w(j, k, t) denote the market value of the position in stock k held by investorj
at the end of month t, divided by the total value of all stocks held by the same investor at
the same time. We compute the sum of the absolute values of the changes in the weights
across all stocks for investorj at time t using the following definition:

         TN(j, 1) =      I w(j, k, t) — w(j, k, 1—1)

The average trading intensity (weight changes) for investor j defined as:


                    T-1"
where T is the total number of months in the sample. The average trading intensity for
investors in a given group is then the average of all TN(j) over investorj in the group i
(subscript-i omitted):

           1N=7W(j)
Under the central limit theory, the TN measure is asymptotically normal.
         Panel A of Table 2 reports, for each of the three groups of the funds, the trading
intensity measured in this way. For the whole sample, we see that the average trading

  While the offshore funds may not pay taxes in their domiciles, they may still need to pay taxes in Korea,
in particular, 25% withholding tax on dividend and interest, and 10% of the gross proceeds realized from
the sale for capital gains. In cases where the purchasing price is available, the tax is the lesser of 25%of
the capital gains and 10% of the gross proceeds. See the Korea Stock Exchange Website,
www.kse.org/kr/statlindex.html. These tax rates are typically lower than what the onshore funds have to
pay to their home taxing authorities.
                                             8



intensity for the offshore funds is 45% bigger than that for the US/UK funds. Using a
difference-in-mean test, we can see that the difference between the two is statistically
significant at the five percent level (Column 4). On the other hand, the offshore finds'
trading intensity is not statistically different from the Singapore/Hong Kong finds
(Column 5).
       If we break the sample into pre-crisis and in-crisis sub-periods, we see an
interesting pattern. The average trading intensity increases for each of the three groups of
funds in the crisis period relative to the pre-crisis period (and significant for the US/UK
funds). The offshore finds' average trading intensity continues to be bigger than the
onshore funds from the US/UK.
       As a robustness check, we also experiment with defining the trading intensity in
terms of the physical shares of stocks instead of the market value of the stocks. To be
more precise, we let w(j, k, t) be the number of stock k held by investor] at the end of
month t, divided by the total number of all stocks that she held at the same time. Then,
TN(j) and TN are defined in the same way as before. The results are reported in Panel B
of Table 2. We can see clearly that all the qualitative results from Panel A remain to be
true here. Thus, the offshore funds do trade more intensely than onshore funds (from the
US and UK) both before the crisis, and even more so during the crisis.


4.      Positive Feedback Trading


        There are concerns that offshore funds may engage in positive-feedback trading
more aggressively than onshore finds, and that positive feedback trading could
destabilize the market. Positive feedback trading pattern is when one buys securities
when the prices rise and sells when the prices fall. This trading pattern can result from
extrapolative expectations about prices, from stop-loss orders --automatically selling
when the price falls below a certain point, from forced liquidations when an investor is
unable to meet her margin calls, or from a portfolio insurance investment strategy which
calls for selling a stock when the price falls and buying it when the price rises.
        Positive feedback trading can destabilize the market by moving asset prices away
from the fundamentals. At least since Friedman (1953), many economists believe that
                                              9


positive feedback traders cannot be important in market equilibrium as they are likely to
lose money on average. This view has been challenged in the last decade or so. Dc
Long, Shleifer, Summers, and Waldmann (1990) argued that in the presence of noise
traders, even rational investors may want to engage in positive feedback trading, and in
the process destabilize the market.
        Empirical examination of this issue has emerged recently. Using quarterly data
on U.S. pension funds in the U.S. market, Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny (1992, LSV
for short in later reference) did not find strong evidence of significant feedback trading.
On the other hand, and Grinblatt, Titman and Wermers (1995) did find evidence of
positive feedback trading with their sample of 274 US mutual funds during 1975-1984.
Using transaction-level data, Choe, Kho, and Stulz (1998) also find evidence that foreign
investors as a group engage in positive feedback trading in Korea. No paper that we are
aware of compares the positive trading tendencies of offshore versus onshore trading
strategies.


Methodology
      The objective is to examine the connection between the trading behaviors of the
investors (within a given sub-group) and the previous month performance of the stocks.
We examine the connection for three time periods: the whole sample (January, 1997 -
June, 1998), the pre-crisis period (January, 1997-October, 1997), and the in-crisis period

(November, 1997-June, 1998).
        Within each time period, we form five approximately equally sized (in terms of
stock-months) portfolios based on the previous month performance of the stocks. The
performance of a stock is defined as the return of the stock in excess of the market return,
minus the depreciation of the Korean won exchange rate against the U.S. dollar. That is,
the return for a particular stock from month t-1 to month t is [ln(P) - ln(P11)] -
[ln(KOSPJ) - ln(KOSPI11)] - [ln(S) - 1n(Sj)], where P1, KOSPI, and St are the price of
the stock (stock subscript omitted), KOSPI index, and Won/$ exchange rate at time 1.
        Following Lakonishok, Shleifer and Vishny (1992), we employ two measures of
investors' trading direction: a buyers' ratio and a scale-adjusted net purchase:
                                                    10



                                    Number of Buyers
(1)     Buyers' Ratio =
                            Number of Buyers + Number of Sellers

                                               Number of Shares Purchased - Number of Shares Sold
(2)     Scale - adjusted Net Purchase =
                                               Number of Shares Purchased + Number of Shares Sold

        The first measure describes the fraction of active traders that is a net buyer. It is
constructed to minimize the dominance of a few large traders in the statistics. The
second measure describes the net purchase (scaled by the total trading). The denominator
(the scale adjustment) makes sure that a large purchase does not receive more weight than
a small purchase
        To avoid possible biases in quantifying the trading behavior, we exclude certain
observations (investors or stock-month). First, investors who are registered after
December 31, 1996 are dropped because their entrance to the market could show up only
as a buy. Second, stock-months for which a stock has reached the foreign ownership
limit are dropped because any change in the net position of the foreign investors as a
whole has to be a sell to Korean investors.


Results and Interpretations
        Table 3 reports the basic finding using buyer's ratio as a measure of trading
direction. Let us look at the US/UK funds first. For the entire sample period (97.1-98.6)
(reported in Column 4 of the top panel), 39% of active traders buy the worst performing
stocks (in terms of last month returns), compared to more than 50% of active traders who
buy the recent best performing stocks. Indeed, in the sixth row, we report a formal t-test
on difference between the two buyers' ratios. The standard errors are reported in
parenthesis5. We see the difference is positive and statistically significant. This is
consistent with the view the US/UK funds are positive feedback traders.
        In contrast, for the offshore funds (reported in Column 3), the buyer's ratios for
the recent worst and best performing stocks are 41% and 46%, respectively. The
difference between the two ratios is smaller than for the US/UK funds. In fact, a formal t-




 The same reporting format is used for all sub-groups of investors in all time periods.
                                                     11



test indicates that the difference is not statistically significant at the ten percent level6.
The same is true for funds from Singapore/Hong Kong.
        When we look into pre- and in-crisis sub-samples (middle and lower panels of
Table 3), we see that the propensity to engage in positive feedback trading by American
and British funds is stronger during the crisis than before it. There is still no statistically
significant evidence that offshore funds engage in positive feedback trading.
         In Table 4, we use the scale-adjusted net purchase as an alternative measure of
trading patterns. Onshore funds from the US and UK sell recent losers more aggressively
than recent winners, a pattern consistent with positive feedback trading. In comparison,
the offshore funds do not exhibit statistically significant difference in the net purchase of
the recent worst and best performing stocks. Hence, we reach the same qualitative
conclusion as before: no evidence to support the hypothesis that offshore funds engage in
positive feedback trading more aggressively than onshore funds from the US or UK. If
anything, the contrary is true.
         In Table 5, we decompose the stocks along a second dimension, the market
capitalization at the beginning of the month, into small, medium and large stocks. So
within a sample period, the stocks are now classified into nine categories. We observe
that the offshore funds tend to hold mostly medium and large stocks relative to the
U.S./I.JK funds. Moreover, for the US/UK funds, the positive feedback trading pattern is
most visible for large stocks in the pre-crisis period, but most visible for small or medium
stocks during the crisis.
         A possible defense of positive feedback trading is that foreign investors (residing
abroad) may be informationally disadvantaged relative to domestic investors. They may
take a (relatively greater) decline in the price of a particular stock as unfavorable news
revealed by domestic investors, and may therefore rationally choose to sell it (more
aggressively relative to other stocks) (See Brennan and Cao, 1997, for such a model). It
may be useful to check if the positive-feedback-trading pattern in our sample is expost
profitable. We do it in two steps. First, in each month, we form an equally-weighted

 Of course, the buyers' ratio is not strictly monotonic in past returns. So for example, the difference
between those of the best and median performing portfolios is statistically significant But one would not
characterize the offshore funds as positive feedback traders since the buyers' ratio is U-shaped as a function
of past returns.
                                             12




portfolio often best performing stocks, and another equally-weighted portfolio often
worst performing stocks, based on the previous month's return as defined above for
Tables 3 and 4.
       The average returns of the two portfolios in the previous months are reported in
the first row of each of the three panels (representing three different periods) in Table 6
(labeled as "horizon -1"). Second, we track their performances over the subsequent six
months. The results are reported in the other rows of Table 6 (labeled as "horizons 1-
6"). We perform a difference in mean test (mean return of the past winners minus that of
the past losers) and find that the difference is negative for all six horizons under
investigation. The difference is statistically significant for the one- to five-month
horizons at the ten percent level. In other words, the data suggest that the relative ranking
of stock performance reverses itself in the sample. On average, if one has to choose
between a negative and a positive feedback trading strategy, the former would have been
superior, at least at the one- or two-month horizon. The excess return is quantitatively
large at 8% monthly rate. Of course, in this down market, selling both the best and worst
performing portfolios would be ex post more profitable (and one should sell recent
winners more aggressively).
        As a robustness check, we also form equally weighted portfolios of 30 best
performing and 30 worst performing (based on previous-month's returns) stocks. The
results are reported in the right half of Table 6. For these enlarged portfolios, again, there
is reversal in the ranking of relative performance. In fact, the recent past losers
outperform the recent winners, in a statistically significant and quantitatively large way,
over one-month, two-month, and so on, all the way to five-month horizons. Again, a
contrarian trading strategy rather than a positive feedback one would have been
profitable.
        As qualifications, we note that our thought experiments have not adjusted for risk
levels of the stocks, and do not preclude the possibility that a positive feedback trading
strategy could be profitable within a day or for horizons longer than six months.

5.     Correlated Trading


       Herding is the tendency that investors of a particular group mimic each other's
trading. Portfolio investors may herd rationally or irrationally. Informational asymmetry
may cause uninformed but rational speculators to choose to trade in the same way as
informed traders (Bikhchandani, Hirshleifer and Welch, 1992; and Banerjee, 1992).
Since informational problem may be more serious when it comes to investing in a foreign
market than the domestic one, herding may be more severe correspondingly. Whether
offshore funds herd more or less than the onshore funds depends on their relative capacity
in collecting and processing information about the emerging market in question.
       There is an alternative explanation for herding among institutional investors.
Unlike individual investors, fund managers face regular reviews (e.g., quarterly for
mutual funds, and annually for pension funds) on their performance relative to a
benchmark and/or to each other. This may induce them to mimic each other's trading to
a greater extent than they otherwise would (See Scharfstein and Stein, 1990). By this
logic, whether the offshore funds herd more or less than the onshore funds depends on
whether informational asymmetry is greater or less for them. By this logic, there might
be less herding among offshore funds if they are subject to either fewer or less frequent
performance reviews.
       There have been several empirical papers that quantify herding behavior. Using
data on institutional investors, the pioneering paper by Lakonishok, Shleifer, and Vishny
(or LSV, 1992), followed by Grinblatt, Titman, and Wermers (1995), and Wylie (1997),
all report evidence of herding among US or UK institutional investors. Using data on
foreign investors (or U.S. investors) in Korea as a single group, Choe, Kho, and Stulz
(1998) find evidence of herding. None of the previous papers that we are aware of
compares different herding tendencies by different investor types on data from a single
source, which is the central focus of this section of our paper.


Methodology
      We employ the herding index measure proposed by LSV (1992). While we refer
to the LSV measure as herding index as they do, it is useful to remember that what it
                                                        14



measures is the correlation in trading patterns among members of a group (the tendency
to which investors buy or sell the same subset of stocks). Obviously, herding leads to
correlated trading, but the reverse may not be true.
       Let B(i,j,t) be the number of investors in group i that have increased the
holdings of stockj in month t(i.e., number of net buyers), and S(i,j,t) the number of
investors in group i that have decreased the holdings of stock j in month I (number of
net sellers). Let p(i,t) be the number of net buyers in group i aggregated across all
stocks in month I divided by the total number of active traders (number of net buyers
plus number of net sellers) in group i aggregated across all stocks in month!. Then,
H(i,j,I) is defined as the herding index for investors in group i, on stockj, in month t.


                              B(i,j,t)                      B(i,j,I)

                                            —p(i I) —E
                                                       B(i,j,t)+ S(i,j,I)
                                                                             (ij)

                             B(i, j,I)
(2)     '(' I) =   N                  N
                   B(i,      j,I) +         S(i, j,I)
                   j=I                j=1



(3)     H(i,l)=---H(i,j,I)

(4)
                         t=I j=1




        H(i, t) is the herding index for group i in month t, averaged across all stocks. H(i)
is the herding index for group i, averaged across all months in the sample. In the
definition of H(i, j, t), p(/, I) is subtracted to make sure that the resulting index is
insensitive to general market conditions (i.e., a bull or bear market). By taking absolute
values, the first term in equation (1) captures how much of the investment is polarized in
the direction of either buying or selling. The second term in equation (1), also called as
adjustment factor, is subtracted to correct for the mean value of the first term under the
assumption of no herding. The second term can be computed under the assumption that
                                                 15



B(i,j,t) follows a binomial distribution. Note that for large N and T, H(i,t) and HQ)
follow normal distributions by the central limit theorem.
       To avoid any possible bias in computing the herding indices, we exclude certain
investors and observations (stock-month) from our sample. Like the sample we have
constructed to examine positive feedback trading, we exclude here (1) investors that are
registered after December 31, 1996, (2) stock-months for which the foreign ownership
limit is reached, and (3) stock-months for which the stocks are not owned by foreign
investors in the previous month. The last exclusion is motivated by the short-selling
constraint. When short selling is not allowed, any trade on that stock would have to first
show up as a buy, thus biasing the herding index upward (Wylie, 1997). Finally, if a
stock in a given month is traded by only one foreign investor in that group, that
observation is dropped.


Results and Interpretations
        The basic results are presented in Table 7a. For each investor group i and sample
period, we report the corresponding herding statistics, H(i), with standard errors in the
parenthesis below. Then we perform a sequence of difference-in-mean tests between
offshore and onshore finds (reported in Columns 4 and 5), and between pre-crisis and in-
crisis periods for any given group of investors (reported in Row 4).
    c' The most important findings are the following. First, for both offshore funds as
well onshore funds from the US and UK, their positive herding statistics are statistically
significant. The only possible exception is the set of funds from Singapore and Hong
Kong. Second, most importantly, the evidence suggests that, to the extent investment
funds herd, the US/UK funds herd significantly more than their offshore counterparts (for
the whole sample and for the pre-crisis period).
        One may worry that a firm that issues new stocks or buys back its stocks could
artificially inflate the herding measure even there is no herding. In Table 7b, we drop all
the observations that involve changes in the quantity of outstanding shares7. We find




 There were 601 occasions (stock-months) on which the outstanding shares increased, and 2 occasions on
which the outstanding shares declined.
                                                     16



that, aside from some minor differences, the results we have reached from Table 7b are
essentially the same as those in Table 7a.


Er post Profitability
          What we label as "herding statistics" (following LSV, 1992) is actually a measure
of correlated trading. A bigger value of the "herding" measure for the US/UK funds
could result from the fact that they are more likely to respond to common signals than the
offshore funds. In other words, the herding measures do not distinguish between two
possibilities: that investors intentionally (rationally or not) mimic each other's trading,
versus that investors respond to common information about the fundamentals.
          To distinguish between the two is difficult which is probably why previous
empirical papers do not do this. We decide to provide some suggestive evidence here by
examining expost rationality of the herding behavior in our sample. Under the joint
hypotheses that the funds respond to common signals and that the signals are payoff-
relevant, we would expect that those stocks that the investors herd more aggressively
should yield abnormal returns (relative to those stocks they do not herd as much).
          Let Rft,, denote the return of stock j from Ito 1+] in excess of the KOSPI return

minus the won exchange rate depreciation. Let Hft denote LSV herding index for

stock j in month 1, and NP the (scale-adjusted) net purchase of stock j in month 1. All
three variables are defined for a given investor group, i, which we omit from the
subscripts for simplicity. For each investor group, we run the following fixed effects
regression:


(7)        Rft,, = a +   a +a +    + fi Hft )NPft + 6),



where a1 and a are time and industry dummies8. If those stocks that the funds herd to

buy appreciate faster than others, and/or if those that the funds herd to sell depreciate
faster than others, we would expect             to be positive. We perform this regression for



8
    Due to computer capacity constraint, we use 67 industry dummies instead of over 600 stock dummies.
                                             17



both the one-month and three-month investment horizons. The results are reported in
Table 8.
       In overwhelming number of groups, we see that the estimates of /1 are not
different from zero, and in the two instances when they are significant, they have a
negative sign. This is true for both the one-month and three-month horizons. Hence, the
joint hypotheses are rejected.


6.      Concluding Remarks


        In this paper, we study the behavior of offshore investment funds as compared
with their onshore counterparts in the US, UK, Singapore and Hong Kong. This is made
possible by a unique data set that details the monthly stock positions of foreign investors.
        There are a number of findings that are worth highlighting here. First, there is
evidence that offshore funds indeed trade more aggressively than their onshore
counterparts, judging from the average turnover (or more precisely, monthly average
value of changes in the month-to-month positions, scaled by the fi.inds' size). Second,
there is no significant evidence to support the allegation that the offshore funds engage in
 positive feeding trading. In contrast, there is strong evidence that funds from the US and
UK do exhibit a tendency to do so. Third, while offshore funds do herd, they do so far
 less than onshore funds from the US or UK.
           In sum, the offshore funds are not especially worrisome monsters.

Notes:
 (1)           Stock-months non-resident foreign institutions invest are divided into five groups according to prior-month
     return, defined as return in excess of the KOSPI return minus the won depreciation against the US dollar. For each
     return-group, the (equally-weighted) mean value of buyers' ratio [(no. of buyers -no. of sellers)! (no. of traders] is
     reported.
 (2)           Within each investor group and sample period, difference in mean t-test is performed on the (equally-
     weighted) mean value of buyers' ratio stocks that are best and worst performers in the previous month. Standard
     errors are in the parentheses. ** and * indicate significant at the 5% and 10% levels, respectively.

Notes
(1)          Note that sub-categories do not add up exactly with the upper-category. This is because observations (stock-
    month) not initially owned by the investor group are excluded from the sample (see the justification in the text) and
    this exclusion is not universal over all investor groups.
             — denotes no active traders. 0.0000 implies that all active traders are sellers.

Notes:
(1) We form portfolios of best and worst performers based on previous month excess returns (reported in the rows labeled as
    "horizon -1"), and then track their relative performances in the subsequent six months (reported in rows labeled as
    "horizons 1-6"). We constrain the sample to those that three investor groups trade on.
(2) The return (for a given stock) is defined as (1nP - lnP1) - (lnK - lnK.1) - (S - S+1), where P is stock price, K is
   KOSPI market index, and S is spot exchange rate (won/US dollar). Since price data is available only up to October
    1998, the computations are constrained accordingly. ** and * denote significant at the 5% and 10% levels, respectively.
