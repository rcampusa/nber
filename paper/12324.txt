                                            ABSTRACT

Forecasts of the rate of price inflation play a central role in the formulation of monetary policy, and
forecasting inflation is a key job for economists at the Federal Reserve Board. This paper examines
whether this job has become harder and, to the extent that it has, what changes in the inflation
process have made it so. The main finding is that the univariate inflation process is well described
by an unobserved component trend-cycle model with stochastic volatility or, equivalently, an
integrated moving average process with time-varying parameters; this model explains a variety of
recent univariate inflation forecasting puzzles. It appears currently to be difficult for multivariate
forecasts to improve on forecasts made using this time-varying univariate model.

                                    1. Introduction



       The rate of price inflation in the United States has become both harder and easier

to forecast, depending on one’s point of view. On the one hand, inflation (along with

many other macroeconomic time series) is much less volatile than it was in the 1970s or

early 1980s, and the root mean squared error of naïve inflation forecasts has declined

sharply since the mid-1980s. In this sense, inflation has become easier to forecast: the

risk of inflation forecasts, as measured by mean squared forecast errors (MSFE), has

fallen. On the other hand, the relative improvement of standard multivariate forecasting

models, such as the backwards-looking Phillips curve, over a univariate benchmark has

been less in percentage terms since the mid-1980s than before. This point was forcefully

made by Atkeson and Ohanian (2001) (henceforth, AO), who found that, since 1984 in

the U.S., backwards-looking Phillips curve forecasts have been inferior to a naïve

forecast of average twelve-month inflation by its average rate over the previous twelve

months. In this sense, inflation has become harder to forecast, at least, it has become

much more difficult for an inflation forecaster to provide value added beyond a univariate

model. One can speculate on economic reasons why this might be so, but a first step in

informing such speculation is pinning down what, precisely, have been the changes in the

inflation process that led to these changing properties of inflation forecasts.

       This paper proposes a parsimonious model of the changes in the univariate

process for postwar U.S. quarterly inflation, in which inflation is represented as the sum

of two components, a permanent stochastic trend component and a serially uncorrelated

transitory component. Since the mid 1950s, there have been large changes in the



                                              1
variance of the permanent disturbance, whereas the variance of the transitory disturbance

has remained essentially constant. According to our estimates, the standard deviation of

the permanent disturbance was moderate – for GDP inflation, approximately 0.5

percentage points at an annual rate – from the mid 1950s through approximately 1970; it

was large, nearly 1.5 percentage points, during the 1970s through 1983; and it declined

sharply in the mid 1980s to its value of the 1960s. Since 1990 it has declined further and

now stands at a record low since 1954, less than 0.20 percentage points.

       The time-varying trend-cycle model is equivalent to a time-varying first order

integrated moving average (IMA(1,1)) model for inflation, in which the magnitude of the

MA coefficient varies inversely with the ratio of the permanent to the transitory

disturbance variance. Accordingly, the MA coefficient for inflation was small

(approximately .25) during the 1970s but subsequently increased (to approximately .65

for the 1984-2004 period).

       The time-varying trend-cycle model of the univariate inflation process succinctly

explains the main features of the historical performance of univariate inflation forecasts.

During the 1970s the inflation process was well approximated by a low order

autoregression (AR), but in the mid 1980s the coefficients of that autoregressions

changed and, even allowing for those changes, the low order autoregression became a

less accurate approximation to the inflation process since 1984. The changing AR

coefficients and the deterioration of the low-order AR approximation accounts for the

relatively poor performance of recursive and rolling AR forecasts in the 1984-2004

sample. Moreover, it turns out that the AO year-upon-year forecast, represented as a

linear combination of past inflation, is close to the optimal linear combination implied by




                                             2
the post-1984 IMA model at the four-quarter horizon, although this is not so at shorter

horizons for the post-1984 period nor is it so at any horizon during the pre-1984 period,

cases in which the AO forecasts perform relatively poorly.

       This time-varying trend-cycle model also explains the excellent recent forecasting

performance of an IMA model published by Nelson and Schwert (1977), which they

estimated using data from 1953 to 1971. During the 1970s and early 1980s, the variance

of the permanent component was an order of magnitude larger than it was in the 1950s

and 1960s, and the Nelson-Schwert (1977) model did not provide good forecasts during

the late 1970s and early 1980s. During the late 1980s and 1990s, however, the size of the

permanent component fell back to its earlier levels, and the Nelson-Schwert (1977)

model was again a good approximation.

       The time-varying trend-cycle model provides a strategy for real-time univariate

forecasting. Currently the Nelson-Schwert (1977) forecast is performing very well, and

the AO forecast is performing nearly as well, at least at long horizons. But the inflation

process has changed in the past, it could change again, and if it does, the performance of

fixed-parameter models like AO and Nelson-Schwert will deteriorate. We therefore

consider it imprudent to adopt a fixed-parameter inflation forecasting model either as a

benchmark or for real-time forecasting. Instead, our pseudo-out-of-sample forecasting

results suggest two approaches to time-varying trend-cycle models which could be

effective in the face of such changes: an unobserved components model with stochastic

volatility, implemented using a nonGaussian filter, and an IMA(1,1) model with moving

average coefficient estimated using a ten-year rolling window of past observations. The




                                             3
rolling IMA(1,1) model is simpler, but adapts to changing parameters less quickly than,

the unobserved components/stochastic volatility model.

       The changing univariate inflation dynamics also help to explain the dramatic

breakdown of recursive and rolling autoregressive distributed lag (ADL) inflation

forecasts based on an activity measure. One reason for the deterioration in the relative

performance of the ADL activity-based forecasts is that the variance of the activity

measures has decreased since the mid-1980s (this is the “Great Moderation”), so in a

sum-of-squares sense their predictive content, assuming no changes in coefficients, has

declined. But the coefficients of the ADL models have also changed. Because the ADL

forecasts generalize a univariate autoregression, they inherit the defects of the univariate

AR forecasts in the second period. The evidence on the stability and statistical

significance of the coefficients on lagged activity variables in the ADL is mixed, and

sampling variability impedes making sharp statements about the stability of the Phillips

curve after allowing for changes in the coefficients on lagged inflation. Although a

complete analysis of Phillips curve forecasts that incorporate these time-varying

coefficients is beyond the scope of this paper, we illustrate some implications of our

univariate findings for multivariate analysis.

       The literature on inflation forecasting and the empirical Phillips curve is too large

to survey here comprehensively, but several recent papers which are closely related to

this one are noteworthy. Fischer, Liu, and Zhou (2002) and Orphanides and Van Norden

(2005) confirmed Atkeson and Ohanian’s (2001) basic point that, since the mid-1980s, it

has been quite difficult for inflation forecasts to improve on simple univariate models.

Roberts (2004) identified a flattening of the Phillips curve and a change in the




                                              4
coefficients on lagged inflation in unemployment-rate Phillips curves occurring around

1984, the break date we focus on in much of our analysis. Clark and McCracken (2005)

stress that the sampling variability of pseudo out-of-sample forecast comparison statistics

is so large that the statistical case for the breakdown in Phillips curve forecasts is not

watertight, despite their poor recent performance in economic terms. We too find

considerable sampling variability in forecast comparison measures and return to this

point below. Dossche and Everaert (2005), Harvey, Trimbur, and van Dijk (2005), and

Leigh (2005) also implement unobserved components models of inflation (for different

purposes), although their models omit the stochastic volatility that is the central part of

our story.

       The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 lays out the main

forecasting facts and puzzles. Sections 3 – 5 examine changes in the univariate inflation

process. Section 6 lays out some implications of the univariate results for activity-based

Phillips curve forecasts. Section 7 concludes.



                     2. U.S. Inflation Forecasts: Facts and Puzzles



       This section summarizes the performance of models for forecasting U.S. inflation

using a pseudo out-of-sample forecast comparison methodology, with a focus on

answering the question of whether inflation has become harder to forecast. One purpose

of this section is to provide a consistent and concise summary of miscellaneous related

results that appear elsewhere in the literature on inflation forecasting and volatility (see

Ang, Bekaert, and Wei (2005), Atkeson and Ohanian (2001), Clark and McCracken



                                               5
(2005), Stock and Watson (2002), and Tulip (2005); for complementary results for the

UK, see Benati and Mumtaz (2005)). The section begins with a description of the data

and the forecasting models, then turns to the results. To keep things simple, in this

section we focus on split-sample results, comparing the period 1970:I – 1983:IV to the

later period 1984:I – 2004:IV. The sample split date of 1984 coincides with estimates of

the onset of the great moderation and is the split date chosen by Atkeson and Ohanian

(2001). These split sample results convey the main facts about the changing behavior of

inflation forecasts. In subsequent sections, we examine formal evidence for a break at an

unknown date and consider methods that allow for continual rather than discrete changes

in the inflation process and the forecasting relations.



2.1 Data

       The paper focuses on GDP price index inflation. As a sensitivity analysis, results

are also presented for the personal consumption expenditure deflator for core items (PCE-

core), the personal consumption expenditure deflator for all items (PCE-all), and the

consumer price index (CPI, the official CPI-U). We consider a number of activity

variables: the unemployment rate (all, 16+, seasonally adjusted) (u), log real GDP (y), the

capacity utilization rate, building permits, and the Chicago Fed National Activity Index

(CFNAI) (for discussion of the choice of activity predictors see for example Stock and

Watson (1999)). For series with revisions, the vintage as of May 2005 was used.

       All empirical work uses quarterly data. Quarterly values for monthly series were

computed by averaging the monthly values for the three months in the quarter; if




                                              6
logarithms are taken, they are logarithms of the average value of the monthly indexes. 1

For the main results, the full sample is from 1960:I through 2004:IV, with earlier data

used to initialize regressions with lags; results that use a different sample are noted

explicitly.

        Some predictors appear in “gap” form, denoted (for example) as ugap1-sided and

ugap2-sided for the one- and two-sided unemployment gaps. Gaps are computed as

deviation of the univariate activity series (e.g. u) from a lowpass filter with pass band

corresponding to periodicities of 60 quarters and higher. Two-sided gaps are computed

as deviations from the symmetric two-sided MA(80) approximation to the optimal

lowpass filter after padding the endpoints of the series with backcasts and forecasts

computed from an estimated AR(4) model. One-sided gaps are computed using the same

MA(80) filter replacing future observations with recursively constructed AR(4) forecasts.

Two-sided gaps are useful for analyzing historical relationships but are not feasible for

forecasting.



2.2 Forecasting Models and Pseudo Out-of-Sample Methodology

        We begin by considering two univariate forecasting models and one multivariate

forecasting model, implemented using different predictors. Let πt = 400ln(Pt/Pt–1), where

Pt is the quarterly price index, and let h-period average inflation (at an annual rate) be π th

= h −1 ∑ i =0 π t −i . Adopt the notation that subscript |t on a variable denotes the forecast
        h −1




1
  The analysis was also performed using end-of-quarter aggregation with no important
changes in the qualitative conclusions. Many of the coefficient values reported below are
sensitive to the method of temporal aggregation (as they should be) but the magnitude
and timing of the changes in parameters and the consequent conclusions about
forecasting are not.


                                                 7
made using data through time t, for example π th+h|t is the forecast of π th+ h made using data

through t.

        AR(AIC). Forecasts are made using a univariate autoregression, specified in

terms of the change of inflation with r lags, where r is estimated using the Akaike

Information Criterion (AIC). Multistep forecasts are computed by the direct method, that

is, by projecting h-period ahead inflation on r lags. Specifically, the h-step ahead

AR(AIC) forecast was computed using the model,



                     π th+ h – πt = μh + αh(B)Δπt + uth ,                                    (1)



where μh is a constant, αh(B) is a lag polynomial written in terms of the backshift

operator B, uth is the h-step ahead error term, and the superscript h denotes the quantity

for the h-step ahead regression. Note that this specification imposes that πt has a unit

root.

        AO. Atkeson-Ohanian (2001) (AO) forecasted the average four-quarter rate of

inflation as the average rate of inflation over the previous four quarters. They did not

forecast at other horizons so there is some ambiguity in specifying the AO forecast at

other horizons. Because the AO forecast is essentially a random walk forecast, and a

random walk forecast is the same at all horizons, we extend the AO forecast to other

horizons without modification. Thus the AO forecast is,



                                                 1
                             π th+h|t = π t4 =     (π t + ... + π t −3 ) .                   (2)
                                                 4

       Backwards-looking Phillips curve (PC). The PC forecasts are computed as direct

ADL forecasts, that is, by adding a predictor to (1) to form the autoregressive distributed

lag (ADL) specification,



                    π th+ h – πt = μh + αh(B)Δπt + βhxgapt + δh(B)Δxt + uth ,                (3)



where xgapt is the gap variable based on the variable xt and Δxt is the first difference of xt.

The lag lengths of αh(B) and δh(B) are chosen by AIC. The PC forecast using ut as the

gap variable (so ut = xgapt = xt) and Δut as Δxt is denoted PC-u; this is the conventional

backwards-looking Phillips curve specified in terms of the level of the unemployment

rate with a constant NAIRU, omitting supply shock control variables. The forecasts PC-

Δu, PC-Δy, PC-ΔCapUtil, PC-ΔPermits, and PC-CFNAI omit gap variables and only

include the stationary predictors Δu, Δy, Δ capacity utilization, Δ building permits, and

the CFNAI, respectively. The PC-Δy forecast, which uses only the growth rate of GDP

as a predictor and omits a gap term, is the activity-based inflation forecast recommended

by Orphanides and van Norden (2005).

       Pseudo out-of-sample forecast methodology. All forecasts were computed using

the pseudo out-of-sample forecast methodology, that is, for a forecast made at date t, all

estimation, lag length selection, etc. was performed using only data available through

date t. The forecasts in this section are recursive, so that forecasts at date t are based on

all the data (beginning in 1960:I) through date t. The period 1960-1970 was used for




                                               9
initial parameter estimation. The forecast period 1970:I – 2004:IV was split into the two

periods 1970:I – 1983:IV and 1984:I – 2004:IV.



2.3 Results

       The results of the pseudo out-of-sample forecast experiment are summarized in

Table 1, where the different panel of the table report results for the three inflation series.

The first row in each panel reports the root mean square forecast error (RMSFE) of the

benchmark AR(AIC) forecast in percentage points at an annual rate, at the indicated

forecast horizon h. The remaining rows report the MSFE of the row forecast, relative to

the AR(AIC) (so the relative MSFE of the AR(AIC) forecast is 1.00); an entry less than

one indicates that the candidate forecast has a lower MSFE than the AR(AIC)

benchmark.

       Table 1 does not report standard errors for the relative MSFEs, however standard

errors are reported for the univariate model MSFEs are reported in Table 4 in the next

section. As is emphasized by Clark and McCracken (2005), the standard errors can be

large, ranging from 0.05 to 0.20 for four-quarter ahead forecasts. Despite these large

standard errors, the results in Table 1 suggest four conclusions.

Notes to Table 1: The first row of entries are root mean squared forecast errors
(RMSFEs) of the AR(AIC) benchmark forecast. For the remaining rows, the first eight
numerical columns report the MSFE of the forecasting model, relative to the AR(AIC)
benchmark (hence AR(AIC) = 1.00). The multivariate forecasts are denoted PC-x, where
x is the activity variable used in the autoregressive distributed lag model stated in the
table header. For the PC-u, PC- ugap1-sided, PC-y, PC-ygap1-sided, PC-CapUtil, and PC-
Permits forecasts, the variable xgapt is, respectively, ut, ugapt1-sided, etc. For the
remaining forecasts, xgap is omitted and Δxt is given in the forecast name, e.g. for PC-
Δu, Δxt = Δut. In the PC forecasts, the lag lengths for αh(B) and δh(B) were chosen
independently by AIC, with between 0 and 4 lags, and the forecasts are direct (not
iterated). The final column reports the reduction in RMSFE from the 1970-1983 period
to the 1984-2004 period for the row forecasting method, at the four-quarter horizon.
Bold entries denote the lowest MSFE for that period/horizon. All forecasts are pseudo
out-of-sample. Results for the CFNAI are only computed for the second sample because
of a shorter span of data availability.

1. The RMSFE of forecasts of GDP inflation has declined. In this sense,

   inflation has become easier to forecast. The magnitude of this reduction is

   striking. Whatever its other merits or demerits, the AR(AIC) forecast is

   simple to produce and has been a staple of economic forecasters for decades,

   and a forecaster using this method consistently from 1984 to 2004 would have

   RMSFEs of only 0.62 percentage points for annual GDP inflation, down from

   1.89 percentage points over the 1970-1983 period, a reduction of two-thirds.

   As the final column of Table 1 demonstrates, even those forecasting models

   with performance that deteriorates in the second period, relative to the first,

   still exhibit reductions in forecast uncertainty of at least one-half.



2. The relative performance of the Phillips curve forecasts deteriorated

   substantially from the first period to the second. For example, during the

   1970-1983 period at the four-quarter horizon, the PC-u forecast of GDP

   inflation outperformed the AR(AIC) benchmark (relative MSFE = .88), but

   during the 1984-2004 period it performed worse than the AR(AIC) benchmark

   (relative MSFE = 1.48). The change in relative performance is even larger at

   h = 8, but there are fewer nonoverlapping observations at this horizon so the h

   = 8 relative MSFEs have considerable sampling uncertainty (cf. Clark and

   McCracken (2005)). This deterioration of Phillips curve forecasts is found for

   all the activity predictors examined in the table. For example, at the eight

   quarter horizon, forecasts based on the capacity utilization rate had a RMSE




                                     12
           45% less than the AR(AIC) in the 1970-1983 sample but had a RMSE 52%

           greater in the 1984-2004 sample.



       3. The poor performance of the PC forecasts is not simply a consequence of

           failing to allow for a time-varying NAIRU or time-varying potential GDP.

           The PC-Δu and PC- ugap1-sided specifications allow for a slowly time-varying

           NAIRU (in the case of PC-Δu, by omitting the level of u). In some cases

           these outperform the PC-u specification, but in other cases, especially in the

           post-1984 sample, they do worse. Whether one allows for a time-varying

           NAIRU or not, the PC forecasts are not competitive with either the AR(AIC)

           or AO forecasts in the 1984-2004 sample.



       4. The AO forecast substantially improves upon the AR(AIC) and Phillips curve

           forecasts at the four- and eight-quarter horizons in the 1984-2004 period, but

           not at shorter horizons and not in the first period. The shift in relative

           performance is dramatic. For example, at the h = 4 horizon (the only horizon

           reported by Atkeson and Ohanian (2001)), in the first period the MSFE of the

           AO forecast, relative to the PC-u forecast, is 1.06/0.88 = 1.21, whereas in the

           second period this relative MSFE is .89/1.48 = 0.60.



       A different way to summarize Table 1 is that inflation has become both easier and

harder to forecast. On the one hand, inflation is easier to forecast in the sense that all

these forecasting models have RMSFEs that are much smaller after 1984 than before. On



                                              13
the other hand, after 1984 it has been harder to be an inflation forecaster, in the sense that

it is more difficult to improve upon simple univariate models, at least using activity-based

backward-looking Phillips curves.

        Evidently, there have been major changes in the univariate inflation process and

in the bivariate process of inflation and its activity-based predictors, however these

results do not indicate what those changes were or when they occurred.



                   3. Changes in the Univariate Inflation Process



        The remainder of this paper explores a question raised by Table 1: what,

specifically, have been the changes in the inflation process that led to the apparent

changes in the relative and absolute performance of inflation forecasting models? In this

section, we begin to answer this question by focusing on the univariate inflation process.

This section continues to consider split-sample results with a 1984 break date; timing of

changes is considered in Section 4.



3.1 Split-Sample Summary Statistics

        There have been substantial changes in the autocorrelations and spectra of

inflation. Some measures of persistence of the inflation process have changed, while

others have not.

eight autocorrelations of Δπt in both periods for GDP inflation. In the first period the

only autocorrelation that is nonzero at the 10% level is the first (the t-statistic is 1.89); in

method of inverting the augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test statistic (constant, no
time trend).

the second period, the first autocorrelation is statistically significant at the 5% level,

along with the fourth, perhaps reflecting some seasonality. In both periods, Δπt is

negatively serially correlated (except for the positive fourth autocorrelation), with the

first autocorrelation much larger in absolute magnitude (more negative) in the second

period than the first.

        Persistence. One measure of persistence is the magnitude of the largest

autoregressive root of the levels process, in this case, the largest autoregressive root of

inflation. As shown in Table 2, by this measure persistence did not change substantially

between the two periods, either in a qualitative or quantitative sense. The confidence

intervals are remarkably stable across series and time periods, being approximately (.85,

1.03); both confidence intervals include a unit root. By this measure, the persistence of

inflation has not changed between the two periods. These split-sample confidence

intervals are consistent with the results of the thorough analysis in Pivetta and Reis

(2004), who report rolling and recursive estimates of the largest autoregressive root (and

the sum of the AR coefficients) that are large and stably near one.

        Although the largest AR root appears to be stably large, inflation persistence can

nevertheless be viewed as having fallen: the fraction of the variance of Δπt explained by

the persistent shocks and the fraction of the mass of the spectrum of Δπt near frequency

zero are both considerably greater in the first period than in the second (see Appendix

figure A.1).

3.2 The IMA/Trend-Cycle Model

       The IMA(1,1) and unobserved components models. The apparent unit root in πt

and the negative first order autocorrelations, and generally small higher order

autocorrelations, of Δπt suggest that the inflation process might be well described by the

IMA(1,1) process,



                    Δπt = (1 – θB)at,                                                      (4)



where at is serially uncorrelated with mean zero and variance σ a2 .

       The IMA(1,1) model is equivalent to an unobserved components (UC) model in

which πt has a stochastic trend τt and a serially uncorrelated disturbance ηt:



                    πt = τt + ηt,   ηt serially uncorrelated (0, σ η2 )                    (5)

                    τt = τt–1 + εt, εt serially uncorrelated (0, σ ε2 ),                   (6)



where cov(ηt, εt) = 0.

       Results. Table 3 presents estimates of the IMA(1,1) parameters, the implied UC

parameters, and statistics testing the IMA(1,1) model against more general ARIMA

models, for the pre- and post-1984 periods. Consistent with the changes in the

autocorrelations, the MA parameter is considerably larger in the second period than in the

first; consistent with the decline in the variance of inflation, the MA innovation has a

smaller variance in the second period than in the first. This is true for all series.

standard errors are in parentheses. Block (e) reports tests for parameter stability, first
one parameter at a time in the UC model with an imposed break in 1984 (shown as t-
statistics), then the Quandt (maximal) likelihood ratio (QLR) statistic (df = 2) over all
break dates in the inner 70% of the sample (the QLR statistic) for the UC model, and
finally the (heteroskedasticity-robust) F – statistic version of the QLR statistic for an
AR(4) model for Δπ (df=5). The p-values in parentheses in the final block take the
1984 break date as exogenous for the first two rows, but the QLR critical values allow
for an endogenous break (Andrews (1993)). Block (f) reports a decomposition of the
total four-quarter ahead forecast error variance (first row), based on the UC model,
into the three components of filtering (signal extraction) error, future permanent
disturbances, and future transitory disturbances.

        Blocks (c)-(f) of Table 3 report various statistics assessing the fit and stability of

the IMA(1,1) model. Wald tests of the null that the process is an IMA(1,1), against the

alternative that it is a higher order process, fail to reject in both cases.

        Although the unit root confidence intervals in Table 2 include one, the confidence

intervals include values of the largest AR root that are relatively small, less than 0.9, so

one might ask for additional evidence on the magnitude of the AR root in the context of a

model with a moving average term. To this end, Table 3 reports ARIMA(1,0,1) models

that do not impose a unit root in inflation. The point estimates are strikingly close to one,

the smallest being .987. Because the distribution theory for the estimator of α is

nonstandard when its true value is close to one, we rely on the confidence intervals in

table 2 for formal inference about this root.

        Block (e) of Table 3 reports tests of the hypothesis of parameter stability in the

UC model. The hypothesis that the permanent innovation has the same variance in the

two periods is strongly rejected, but the hypothesis that the transitory variance is the same

is not. These tests are Chow tests which treat the 1984 break date as exogenously

specified, which is inappropriate in that a large body of evidence about changes in the

U.S. macroeconomy informed our choice of a 1984 break. To address this concern, the

final two lines report the Quandt likelihood ratio (QLR) statistic, which is the maximum

likelihood ratio test for a break over all possible break dates in the inner 70% of the full

sample (1959 – 2004), first for the IMA(1,1) model then for an AR(4) model. For the

IMA(1,1) model, the QLR test rejects at the 1% significance level, providing formal

evidence of instability in the parameters of the UC model. The tests on individual

parameters suggest that this instability appears in the permanent innovation variance but




                                                19
not the transitory innovation variance. For the AR(4) model, the null hypothesis of

stability is rejected at the 5%, but not the 1%, significance level; the smaller p-value for

the UC model is consistent with fewer degrees of freedom because fewer parameters are

being tested for stability in the UC model than in the AR(4) model.

        One measure of how important the permanent shocks are is to decompose the

four-quarter ahead forecasts into three sources: errors in estimation of the current trend,

that is, signal extraction (filtering) errors, forecast errors arising from currently unknown

permanent disturbances over the next four quarters, and forecast errors arising from

currently unknown transitory disturbances over the next four quarters. This

decomposition is given in the final block of Table 3. In the first period, future trend

disturbances are by far the largest source of four-quarter forecast errors, followed by

filtering errors. The magnitude of both sources of error falls sharply from the first period

to the second: the forecast error attributed to the trend disturbance falls by over 90%, and

the forecast error variance arising from filtering error falls by 60%. Like the contribution

of the trend shock itself, the decline in the contribution of the filtering error is a

consequence of the decline in the volatility of the trend shock because the trend is less

variable and therefore is estimated more precisely by the UC filter. The contribution of

the transitory shocks remains small and is approximately unchanged between the two

periods.

        Historical precedents. The IMA(1,1) representation for inflation is not new. As

mentioned in the introduction, Nelson and Schwert (1977) selected an IMA(1,1) model

for monthly U.S. CPI inflation (identified, in the Box-Jenkins (1970) sense, by inspecting

the autocorrelogram of πt and Δπt). Using a sample period of 1953m2 – 1971m7, they




                                               20
estimated an MA coefficient of .892 (their equation (4)). This monthly IMA(1,1) model

temporally aggregates to the quarterly IMA(1,2) model 2 ,



                    Δπt = (1 – .487B – .158B2)at.           (NS77)                           (7)



       Schwert (1987) reports IMA(1,1) models for two monthly price indexes (the CPI

and the PPI) and one quarterly index, the GNP deflator. Using data from 1947:I –

1985:IV, Schwert (1987, Table 6) estimated the MA coefficient for the GNP deflator to

be .665.

       A third historical reference is Barsky (1987), who uses Box-Jenkins identification

methods to conclude that quarterly CPI inflation (third month of quarter aggregation) is

well described by an IMA(1,1) model, with a MA coefficient that he estimates to be .46

over the 1960-1979 period (Barsky (1987, Table 2)).

       We return to these historical estimates below.



3.3 Explaining the AO Results

       All the univariate models considered so far, including the AO model, produce

multistep forecasts that are linear in πt, πt–1,…, so one way to compare these models is to

compare their forecast functions, that is, their weights on πt, πt–1,…. Figure 1 plots the

forecast functions for four-quarter ahead forecasts computed using the AO model, an



2
  Let Pt m be the monthly log price index. If Δln( Pt m ) follows the monthly IMA(1,1)
Δ2ln( Pt m ) = (1 – θmB)at, then the monthly latent quarterly inflation series follows (1 –
B3)2 ptQ = (1 + B + B2)3(1 – θmB)at, which, when sampled every third month, corresponds
to an IMA(1,2) at the quarterly frequency.

Figure 1. Implied forecast weights on lagged quarterly inflation for forecasts of four-

and using an IMA(1,1) model with θ = .25 and θ = .65.




                                        22
IMA(1,1) model with θ = .25, and an IMA(1,1) model with θ = .65. (As discussed in

Section 5, the value θ = .25 closely approximates the value of θ estimated using the 1970-

1983 sample for all four inflation series, and the value θ = .65 closely approximates the

estimates for all four series over the 1984-2004 period.) The AO forecast function

weights the most recent four quarters of inflation evenly, whereas the IMA(1,1) forecast

functions are geometrically declining. The AO and θ = .25 forecast functions are quite

different, and the resulting forecasts typically would be quite different. In contrast, the

AO and θ = .65 forecast function provides a closer approximation to the θ = .65 forecast

function, and one might expect the AO and θ = .65 forecasts to be fairly close much of

the time.

       The changing coefficients in the IMA(1,1)/UC representation provide a concise

arithmetic explanation for the performance of the AO forecasts evident in Table 1. Over

the 1970-1983 period, during which the MA coefficient is small, the AO model would be

expected to work poorly. During the later period, during which the MA coefficient is

large, at the four-quarter horizon the AO model provides an approximation to the

IMA(1,1) forecast and would be expected to work well. This approximation is also good

at the eight-quarter horizon, but not at short horizons, so the AO model would be

expected to work well at longer seasonal horizons, but not short horizons in the second

period. This pattern matches that in Table 1.

  4. Dating the Changes in the Inflation Process Using an Unobserved

                     Components – Stochastic Volatility Model



        The tests for parameter instability reported in Table 3 indicate that there have

been statistically significant and economically large changes in the univariate inflation

process. This section takes a closer look at when those changes occurred, and they are

associated with continual parameter drift or discrete regime shifts. Is the IMA model

with a single break in 1984 a satisfactory approximation to the inflation process, or have

the changes been more subtle and evolutionary?

        The model of this section is a generalization of the unobserved components model

in which the variances of the permanent and transitory disturbances evolve randomly

over time, that is, an unobserved components model with stochastic volatility (UC-SV).

In the UC-SV model, logarithms of the variances of ηt and εt evolve as independent

random walks. The UC-SV model is,



                      πt = τt + ηt,        where ηt = ση,tζη,t                                          (8)

model, computed by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) using a vague prior for the

initial condition and γ = 0.2, for GDP inflation, using data from 1953:I – 2004:IV (the

longer sample is used here to obtain estimates for the 1950s, and to facilitate comparisons

with the Nelson-Schwert (1977) estimate, which was based on data starting in 1953).

       The estimates in Figure 2 show substantial movements over time in the standard

deviation of the permanent component: the 1970s through 1983 was a period of high

volatility, 1953 through the late 1960s or early 1970s and 1984-1990 were periods of

moderate volatility of the permanent innovation, and the 1990s through 2004 have been

period of low volatility of the permanent innovation. In contrast, there is little change in

the estimates of the variance of the transitory innovation. The moving average

coefficient of the implied instantaneous IMA(1,1) representation tracks inversely the

smoothed estimates of σε,t, being moderate (around .4) in the 1950s through late 1960s,

small (less than .25) during the 1970s through 1983, higher in the late 1980s, and

increasing further in the 1990s to a current estimate of approximately .85.

specifies the log variances as following a Gaussian random walk. This imparts

than a model, like the UC-SV model, with smooth parameter variation, then the UC-SV

model (8) – (11) might miss the rapid changes in volatility associated with a shift in

regimes.

         To investigate this possibility, we modified the UC-SV so that the disturbances

ζη,t and ζε,t in (8) and (9) were drawn from a mixture of normal distributions, N(0,.1I)

with probability .95 and N(0,.5I) with probability .05; this heavy-tailed mixture

distribution introduces occasional large jumps. As it happens, the smoothed estimates of

ση,t and σε,t from the mixture-of-normals UC-SV model are qualitatively and

quantitatively close to those from the normal-error UC-SV model. To conserve space,

the mixture-of-normal UC-SV results are not presented, and for simplicity the only UC-

SV model considered below is the normal-error model (8) – (11).

         Relation to estimates in the literature. The series analyzed by Nelson and

Schwert (1977), Schwert (1987), and Barsky (1987) differ from those analyzed here, and

the Nelson-Schwert and Schwert estimates for CPI were computed using monthly data.

Despite these differences, their estimated IMA(1,1) parameters are consistent with figures

3 and 4. The published estimates of the quarterly MA coefficient are .46 for 1960-1979

(Barsky (1987)) and .665 for 1949-1985 (Schwert (1987)). Comparing these estimates to

averages in figure 2(c) over the corresponding time period indicates general agreement

between the instantaneous MA coefficient estimated in figure 2(c) and the earlier

estimates (the high estimate in Schwert (1987) seems to be driven in part by the pre-1953

data).

                      5. Pseudo Out-of-Sample Univariate Forecasts

        This section examines whether unobserved components and moving average

model with time-varying parameters could have produced useful real-time univariate

forecasts.



5.1 Forecasting Models

        The comparison considers two models studied in Table 1, the recursive AR(AIC)

benchmark and the AO model, plus additional rolling and recursive models.

        Recursive IMA(1,1) and AR(4). The models are estimated using an expanding

sample starting in 1960.

        Rolling AR(AIC), IMA(1,1), and AR(4). The models are estimated using a data

window of forty quarters, concluding in the quarter of the forecast.

        Nelson-Schwert (1977) (NS77). The NS77 model is the quarterly IMA(1,2)

model (7) implied by temporal aggregation of Nelson and Schwert’s (1977) monthly

IMA(1,1) model.

        UC-SV, γ = .2. Forecasts are computed using the UC-SV model with γ = .2. The

UC-SV model is applied to data from 1960 through the forecast quarter to obtain filtered

estimates of the trend component of inflation, which serves as the forecast for future

values of inflation (πt+h/t = τt/t).

        Fixed coefficient IMA(1,1). These are IMA(1,1) models with coefficients of .25

and .65. The coefficient of .25 approximately corresponds to the value in Table 2 for the

period 1970 – 1983, and the coefficient of .65 approximately corresponds to the value for

1984 – 2004.



                                            28
       Multiperiod forecasts based on the IMA(1,1) and UC models are iterated, and

multiperiod AR forecasts use the direct method (1).

       The recursive and rolling models produce pseudo out-of-sample forecasts. The

NS77 model produces a true out of sample forecast, since the coefficients were estimated

using data through 1971. The UC-SV model with γ = .2 and the fixed-coefficient

IMA(1,1) models are not pseudo out-of-sample models because their parameters (γ in the

first instance, θ and σa in the second) were estimated (or, in the case of γ, calibrated)

using the full data set, so in particular their parameters were not estimated by recursive or

rolling methods.



5.2 Results

       Table 4 summarizes the forecasting performance of the various models over the

1970-1983 and 1984-2004 periods for GDP inflation (entries are MSFEs, relative to the

recursive AR(AIC), which is also the benchmark in Table 1). Figure 3 provides

additional detail about the forecasting performance at different points in time by

presenting a two-sided smoothed estimate of the relative MSFE (relative to the recursive

AR(AIC) forecast), with exponential smoothing and a discount factor of .95 (end points

are handled by simple truncation). Inspection of table 4 and figure 3 suggests five

findings.

       First, among the fixed-parameter models, the θ = .25 model performs well in the

first period, whereas the θ = .65 model performs well in the second. This is consistent

with the choice of these two parameter values as being approximately the MLEs of θ in

the two periods. The UC-SV(.2) model evidently adapts well to the shifting parameter

   Notes to Table 4: Entries are MSFEs, relative to the recursively estimated AR(AIC).
   Bold entries are the smallest relative MSFE for the indicated series/period/horizon,
   among the out-of-sample (NS77) and pseudo out-of-sample forecasts. The fixed-
   parameter models do not generate pseudo out-of-sample forecasts because their
   parameters are not estimated using recursive or rolling samples. Standard errors for
   the relative MSFEs for the univariate models are given in parentheses. The standard
   errors were computed by parametric bootstrap with 5,000 draws. Specifically,
   synthetic quarterly data from 1959:I – 2004:IV were generated from the estimated
   UC-SV model using as the volatility parameters at each date the median estimate in
   Figure 2 (a and b), and the various univariate forecasting models were estimated and
   implemented using each artificial data draw, and the standard deviation of the
   synthetic counterparts to the entry in this table is the parametric bootstrap standard
   error.

values and produces forecasts that rival those of the θ = .25 model in the first period, and

those of the θ = .65 model in the second. In this sense, among UC (IMA(1,1)) models,

the UC-SV(.2) model can be thought of as providing an approximate bound on the

forecasting performance of the pseudo out-of-sample forecasts.

       Second, among the pseudo out-of-sample forecasts, the rolling IMA(1,1) forecast

performs very well – nearly as well as the UC-SV model – in both periods. Closer

inspection of the forecast errors indicates that the primary source of the improvement of

the AO model over the rolling IMA(1,1) model during the second period occurs during

the late 1980s, a period of sharp change in the MA coefficient during which the rolling

forecast took time to adapt.

       Third, the AR models do not forecast as well as the rolling IMA and UC/SV

models. Eliminating the AIC lag selection by using an AR(4) improves performance in

some but not all sample/horizon combinations; this is also true if AIC lag selection is

replaced by BIC (unreported results).

       Fourth, the NS77 forecast is truly an out-of-sample forecast, and its performance

is in the post-1984 sample at all horizons is remarkably good.

       Fifth, although the differences in the forecasting performance between these

models is large in an economic and practical sense, this conclusion should be tempered

by recognizing that there is a great deal of sampling uncertainty. Table 4 reports standard

errors, which were computed by parametric bootstrap using the estimated time-varying

UC model (using the median estimates of the time-varying variances) as the data

generating process. As emphasized by Clark and McCracken (2005), there is

considerable sampling variability in the relative MSFEs, which are often within one



                                             32
standard deviation of 1.00 (note however that the relative MSFEs for nested models do

not have a normal distribution). Given these large standard errors, we suggest the

following interpretation. The in-sample analysis of Section 4 provides strong evidence,

which includes formal hypothesis tests, that there has been time variation in the inflation

process and that this time variation is well described by the UC model with time-varying

variances. That analysis suggests that a rolling MA(1) model will improve upon other

univariate linear forecasting models. As measured by the relative MSFEs in Table 4, this

prediction is borne out, and the improvement is economically large but imprecisely

estimated.



5.3 Results for Other Price Indexes

       Table 5 summarizes results for three other price indexes (PCE-core, PCE-all, and

CPI). For PCE-core and PCE-all, in virtually all regards the results are quantitatively

and qualitatively similar to those in Tables 3 and 4, so none of the main findings

discussed so far hinge on using GDP inflation instead of either of these other price

indexes. All the 90% confidence intervals for the largest AR root include one; both PCE

series are well modeled using the TVP-UC model; and the QLR statistic rejects

parameter stability in the UC model. The forecasts from the rolling IMA(1,1) are in most

cases the best or nearly the best among the forecasts considered; the main exception to

this is that the AO model outforecasts the rolling IMA(1,1) model in the second period,

due mainly to the slow adaptation of the rolling IMA(1,1) to the rapidly changing

parameters in the mid-1980s. The main difference between the results for the CPI and for

the other inflation series is that the quarterly CPI does not seem to be well modeled as a

IMA(1,1) (the IMA(1,1) model is rejected against the IMA(1,4) alternative in both

samples). One issue with interpreting the results for the CPI, especially model stability

results, is that the construction of the CPI is not consistent over time, in particular the

treatment of housing has changed. Perhaps more important, however, are issues of

temporal aggregation. The measurement procedure for the GDP price index, the PCE

price index, and the CPI are all different and paying attention to the measurement details

could yield a different method of temporal aggregation than the stylized model used in

footnote 2. The fact that the temporally aggregated NS77 forecasts (see (7)) are excellent

for the CPI is consistent with the monthly (but not quarterly) CPI following an IMA(1,1),

and suggest that closer attention to temporal aggregation issues, especially for the CPI, is

warranted.

        Additional results for PCE-core, PCE-all, and CPI inflation are presented in the

Appendix. The breakdown of the ADL Philips curve forecasts seen in Table 1 is

observed using these other inflation measures. PCE-core and PCE-all inflation are well

described by a IMA(1,1) model with time-varying coefficients: for both indexes, the first

(and only the first) autocorrelation of inflation is statistically significant from zero, a

nonparametric estimate of the spectrum of Δπt approximately has the shape implied by a

MA(1) model. The autocorrelations of CPI inflation suggest that a different model,

perhaps an IMA(1,2), is more appropriate, which (as discussed above) could be a

consequence of temporal aggregation. Still, the time paths of the standard deviations of

the UC-SV model for all three indexes, including CPI inflation, are qualitatively similar

to those for GDP inflation. In addition, the rolling IMA(1,1) model forecasts well for all




                                               35
these series, including the CPI, at all horizons in both sample periods. The NS77 MA(2)

forecasts remarkably well in the second sample period: of sixteen possible cases (four

horizons and four series), in the second sample period the NS77 model produces the best

forecasts in eleven cases.



5.4 Reconciling the AR and MA Results

       Long-order autoregressions provide arbitrarily good approximations to moving

average processes in population, so any explanation of the difference between the rolling

AR and rolling MA forecasts must appeal to finite-sample differences between the two

estimated models. There are three such differences that are relevant and that can

reconcile the AR and the MA results. First, in the second sample, θ is larger which

implies that more distant autoregressive coefficients will be larger in absolute value,

increasing the truncation bias of a finite-lag AR. Second, for this reason, the AIC will

tend to call for longer AR lags, however this introduces greater estimation variance in the

AR. Third, the implied population AR coefficients are larger in absolute value when θ is

larger, and the larger population AR coefficient means that its estimator will have a larger

bias towards zero. Each of these three finite-sample effects work towards making the AR

model a worse approximation in the second sample than in the first.



5.5 Summary

       The results in Sections 3 – 5 provide a simple picture of the evolution of the

inflation process. The variability of the stochastic trend in inflation increased in

magnitude during the 1970s through 1983, then fell significantly, both in statistical and



                                             36
economic terms. Although the stochastic trend component of inflation diminished in

importance, it remains nonzero (said differently, confidence intervals for the largest AR

root continue to include one). Moreover, because the variance of the permanent (but not

transitory) component fell dramatically, the variance of Δπt has fallen. Because the

smaller permanent component variance corresponds to a larger MA coefficient, the

declining importance of the stochastic trend in inflation explains both the good

performance of the AO forecast in the second sample at long horizons, and its poor

performance at short horizons and in the first sample. An important piece of evidence

supporting this interpretation is that the rolling IMA(1,1) model produces forecasts that

have the lowest MSFE, or nearly so, at all horizons for all four inflation series among the

recursive and rolling univariate models, including the AO model.

       The declining importance of the permanent component (equivalently, the increase

in the MA coefficient) implies that an AR approximation needs more lags and larger

coefficients, two features that work towards increased sampling variability and greater

finite-sample bias of AR forecasts. This is consistent with the better performance of the

rolling MA forecasts, compared to the rolling AR forecasts, since the mid-1980s.



                   6. Implications for Multivariate Forecasts



       The foregoing univariate analysis has three implications for the specification of

conventional ADL Phillips curves of the form (3):




                                            37
   1. The coefficients on lags of Δπt will, to a first approximation, decline

       exponentially as would be implied by inverting a MA(1) (this implication holds

       exactly if lagged xt is uncorrelated with lagged Δπt). The restricted one-step

       ahead specification has a rational lag specification for these coefficients:



           Δπt = μ + βxt–1 + δ(B)Δxt–1 +α(B)Δπt–1 + ut, where α(B) = –ψ(1 – ψB)—1. (12)



       If the coefficients β and δ(B) are zero, the rational lag parameter ψ would equal

       the MA parameter θ.



   2. There will be instability in the coefficients on lags of Δπt over the sample, with

       the coefficients being larger in absolute value since the mid-1980s than during the

       1970s and early 1980s.



   3. Failure to allow for time variation in the coefficients on lagged Δπt could lead to

       an apparent shift in the coefficients on xt; in principle the Phillips relation could

       be stable once one allows for changes in the coefficients on lagged Δπt.



       This section examines these three implications. The analysis is in-sample (not

forecasting) and focuses on specifications with the unemployment gap and the output

gap, where both one- and two-sided gaps are considered. The two-sided gap form is

useful for historical analysis and assessing coefficient stability. The one-sided gap form

is useful for assessing forecasting content.



                                               38
        Table 6 reports estimates of the one-step ahead model using the unrestricted

ADL(4,4) specification (3) (first two columns) and the restricted specification (12) (final

two columns), where the activity variable xt is the unemployment gap (one- and two-

sided, parts a and b) and the output gap (one- and two-sided, parts c and d). Table 6

suggests five conclusions.

        First, the coefficients on lags of Δπt in the unrestricted model are qualitatively and

quantitatively consistent with the exponential decline in the restricted model. These

results support implication 1 above. Other researchers have stressed the importance of

using long restricted specifications for the lags on Δπt in Phillips curves. Gordon’s (1998

and earlier) specifications use lagged annual inflation rates, in effect imposing a step

function specification on the lag shape for quarterly inflation. Brayton, Roberts, and

Williams (1999) find that polynomial distributed lag specifications with long lags (up to

25 quarters) fit better than models with shorter unrestricted lags. The results in Table 6

support the use of restricted, long-lag specifications. However the functional form in

Table 6 differs from these other authors, in that it is a rational lag specification, not a step

function or a polynomial distributed lag.

        Second, consistent with implication 2 above, the coefficients on lags of Δπt

increase in absolute value from the pre-1984 to the post-1984 samples. As in the

IMA(1,1) model, the rational lag parameter ψ increases from the first to the second

sample, indeed, the estimated parameter ψ in the multivariate model is quantitatively

close to the estimated MA parameter θ in each sample, for both activity gaps.

Phillips curve given in the table header, for the sample period given in the column

on the parameters. Standard errors are in parentheses. SER is the standard error of the

       Third, in the restricted rational distributed lag model, the Chow test for a break in

1984 in the coefficients on lags of Δπt rejects at the 5% level in three of the four

specifications (and in all four at the 10% level). However, in the unrestricted ADL

model, the same Chow test does not reject at the 10% level in any of the four

specifications. The greater degrees of freedom of the Chow test in the unrestricted

specification evidently reduces power by enough to mask the changes in those

coefficients.

       Fourth, the evidence on implication 3 – whether the Phillips curve is stable after

allowing for changes in the coefficients on lagged Δπt – is mixed. There is some

evidence that imposing the rational lag specification with a changing parameter ψ leads

to a more stable coefficient on the activity gap xt. For example, in the one-sided

unemployment gap specification, the coefficient on xt fell by 73% in absolute value

between the two samples in the unrestricted specification (from –.367 to –.100), but only

fell by 56% in the restricted specification. Although these changes are large in an

economic sense, they are imprecisely estimated, and the hypothesis that the coefficient on

xt–1 is constant across the two samples is not rejected in any of the eight cases considered

in Table 6.

       Fifth, the marginal explanatory content of the activity variables dropped

substantially from the first to the second sample, both in the unrestricted and restricted

specifications. Neither 1-sided gap variable produces a significant Granger causality test

statistic in the second sample, and the partial R2 of the 1-sided gap variables is quite small

in the second period, less than .04 for both restricted specifications. Although these

results are in-sample, consider only two gap variables, and are only for a one-step ahead



                                             43
specification, they suggest that it could be challenging to use the time variation found in

the univariate analysis to develop useful activity-based forecasts.

       Additional evidence of some stability in the relationship between four-quarter

GDP inflation and gap measures is presented in Figure 4, which plots the four-quarter

ahead prediction error from the UC-SV model (γ = .2) and the two-sided unemployment

gap. The slope of this bivariate regression is less in the second period than in the first,

and the R 2 falls by roughly one-half between the two periods. Still, for GDP inflation,

the slope is statistically significant (and negative for the unemployment gap, positive for

the output gap) in both periods. Also, in results not tabulated here, the implied coherence

between the activity variables and changes of inflation at business cycle frequencies is

large and relative stable across periods, typically being in the range 0.5 – 0.6. This stable

coherence is consistent with the positive and stable association found at business cycle

frequencies by Harvey, Trimbur, and van Dijk (2005, figures 16 and 17), who used a

bivariate unobserved components (trend-cycle) model with different, but possibly

correlated, real and nominal cyclical components.

                               7. Discussion and Conclusions



       This paper has explored some implications of the changing univariate inflation

process for multivariate activity-based inflation forecasting, but more work remains.

These results present the hope that, with suitable modification using a rational lag

specification like (12), the outlook for forecasting using backward-looking Phillips

curves might be less gloomy than the results in AO and in Section 2 would lead one to

believe. This said, it is not straightforward to turn the increased stability in two-sided gap

models into reliable one-sided gap forecasting specifications. Still, there is some

evidence that real-time forecasts have provided improvements upon the best univariate

models. Kohn (2005) reports large reductions in true (not pseudo) mean squared errors

of real-time Fed staff forecasts of quarterly CPI inflation, relative to the AO model, over

1984-2000, and Ang, Bekaert, and Wei (2005) find that true out-of-sample survey

forecasts (median Michigan or Livingston forecasts) outperform a large number of

pseudo out-of-sample univariate and multivariate time series competitors. Both the

Board staff forecast and the survey forecasts are combination forecasts, pooled over

judgmental and model-based forecasts, and both presumably incorporate considerably

more information than are present in the simple activity-based forecasts examined here.

Perhaps further attempts to develop competitive time series forecasts could profit from

pursuing systematically those features that have proven successful in these survey

forecasts.

       One thing this paper has not done is to attempt to link the changing time series

properties of inflation to more fundamental changes in the economy. The obvious



                                             46
explanation is that these changes stem from changes in the conduct of monetary policy in

the post-1984 era, moving from a reactive to a forward-looking stance (see for example

the recent discussion in Estrella (2005), who explains the post-80s failure of the term

structure to have predictive content for inflation in terms of changes in Fed policy). But

obvious explanations are not always the right ones, and there are other possible reasons

for the decrease in the variability of the permanent component of inflation. To a

considerable extent, these other possibilities are similar to the ones raised in the context

of the discussion of the great moderation, including changes in the structure of the real

economy, the deepening of financial markets, and possible changes in the nature of the

structural shocks hitting the economy. We do not attempt to sort through these

explanations here, but simply raise them to point out that the question of deeper causes

for these changes merits further discussion.

       The tables and figures in this appendix provide results for inflation as measured

by the PCE-core, PCE-all, and CPI. The results complement those for GDP inflation

presented in the text.

       Figure A.1 plots the estimated spectrum of the change in PCE-all inflation. Two

estimates are reported: a nonparametric estimator (smoothed periodogram) and a

parametric IMA(1,1) estimator. The parametric estimate looks like a smoothed version

of the nonparametric estimate, suggesting that the IMA(1,1) model fits the data

reasonably well. Relative to the first period, the spectrum in the second period is lower in

magnitude – this reflects the reduction in volatility between the two periods – and has

more power at high than at low frequencies. Closer inspection reveals that the shape of

the spectrum has changed, as well as its level, with the second period having relatively

more power at higher frequencies than in the first. This is consistent with the more

negative first autocorrelation in the second period than in the first.
