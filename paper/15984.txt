                                              ABSTRACT

One of the most commonly cited studies on the effect of child subsidies on fertility, Whittington, Alm
and Peters (1990), claimed a large positive effect of child tax benefits on fertility using time series
methods. We revisit this question in light of recent increases in child tax benefits by replicating this
earlier study and extending the analysis. We do not find strong evidence to justify the model specification
from the original paper. Moreover, even if the original specfication is appropriate, we show that the
Whittington et al. results are not robust to more general measures of child tax benefits. While we do
not find evidence that child tax benefits affect the level of fertility, we find some evidence of a short-run
fertility response that occurs with a two-year lag.

1         Introduction

Standard economic theory tells us that the demand for children is influenced by the cost of

raising children. Holding other things constant, a decrease in the cost of raising children
should lead to an increase in the demand for children. As shown in Figure 1, the average
value of the U.S. child tax subsidy adjusted for inflation has increased from under $850

in 1980 to more than $2,000 in 2005.1 The U.S.D.A. estimates that annual expenditures
on children range from $7,580 to $16,970 depending on the age of the child and household

income (Lino 2007); thus, the $1,150 real increase in child tax benefits can be thought of as
a 7 to 15 percent discount on the cost of raising children. How much of an effect (if any) did

this reduction in the cost of raising children have on fertility?
        Whittington, Alm and Peters (1990) were the first to seriously estimate the responsiveness
of fertility to child tax benefit changes. Their analysis of time series data from 1913 to 1984

suggests that the U.S. fertility rate is very responsive to child tax benefits. They estimate
that a $100 increase (in 2005 dollars) in the tax value of the personal exemption would

increase the general fertility rate by 2.1 to 4.2 births (a 3.2 to 6.5 percent increase).2
        While the sign of the estimated effect is not unexpected, the strong and robust magnitude

of the Whittington et al. (1990) estimate is surprising. If a $100 increase in annual child tax
benefits could increase fertility by 3.2 to 6.5 percent, should we have expected a 32 to 65
percent increase in the U.S. fertility rate in response to the $1,000 Child Tax Credit, holding

all other factors constant?3
        Since Whittington et al. (1990), a handful of empirical studies have estimated a fertility

response from changes in child tax benefits or other child subsidies. One set of papers uses
    1
     The details regarding the calculation of the average per-child tax subsidy are given in the Appendix.
    2
     Whittington et al. report their results in 1967 dollars. Their estimates of the effect of the value of the
personal exemption in 1967 dollars on the general fertility rate range from 0.121 to 0.236. Converting the
dollar amounts to 2005 dollars using the CPI-U, we find that their estimates range from 0.021 to 0.042.
   3
     From 1997 (the year the Child Tax Credit was passed) to 2005, the general fertility rate in the United
States increased by 4.9 percent. Note however that eligibility restrictions and interactions in the tax code
make the $1,000 Child Tax Credit worth much less than this amount on average. From 1997 to 2005, the
average child subsidy increased by approximately $550 in real terms.



                                                      1
similar aggregate time-series or pooled time-series methods to examine the long-run effect

of child tax benefits on fertility (e.g. Georgellis and Wall (1992), Zhang, Quan and van
Meerbergen (1994), Gauthier and Hatzius (1997), Huang (2002)). These studies generally

find that fertility responds to tax benefits, though the estimated responses are smaller than
that found by Whittington et al.
   Another set of studies uses individual data and finds mixed results as to whether financial

incentives influence fertility in the short run. While Whittington (1992) finds evidence in the
PSID that tax benefits strongly influence family size in the United States, Baughman and

Dickert-Conlin (2003) find that the largest estimated fertility response to Earned Income
Tax Credit (EITC) expansions in the 1990s (for married non-white women) was less than

half the magnitude reported in Whittington et al. and many subpopulations display no
economically significant response. Similarly, Laroque and Salanie (2005) find evidence of
only a small effect on fertility in France, despite the generosity of French child subsidies.

   Milligan (2005) reports fertility response estimates of a similar magnitude as Whittington
et al. (1990) using data from Quebec. However, it is likely this large fertility effect is in part

due to the temporary nature of the Quebec subsidy program; Parent and Wang (2007) show
that women may have had children earlier in order to claim the subsidy with no change in

their completed fertility. Most recently, Cohen, Dehejia and Romanov (2007) find strong
effects of financial incentives on fertility among low-income populations in Israel.
   Despite the lack of agreement in the literature, Whittington et al. (1990) is cited by

an increasing number of publications (many in non-economics journals) as evidence of a
strong link between child tax benefits and fertility. In this paper, we revisit and extend the

analysis in Whittington et al. along two dimensions. First, we update the data series with
21 additional years of data and broader measures of child tax benefits. While Whittington

et al.’s analysis was limited to the real tax value of the personal exemption, we incorporate
the child tax credit (CTC) and the earned income tax credit (EITC) in our measure of child
subsidies. As illustrated in Figure 1, these additional components of child tax benefits grew


                                                2
in importance over the last two decades and account for much of the significant growth in

the value of the average child tax subsidy; currently, they make up more than half of the
total subsidy available to families with children. Extending and updating the data series

allows us to develop more precise estimates of the relationship between fertility and child
tax benefits and reexamine the relationship in light of recent increases in these subsidies.
   Second, we also revisit the model specification and estimation procedure from the original

paper. We find that the variables in the analysis are highly persistent which raises concerns
about the potential for spurious regression results using the authors’ original specification.

Furthermore, we do not find strong evidence to justify the model specification from the
original paper.

   We also show that even if the original specification is correct, the results of Whittington
et al. (1990) are specific only to the personal exemption series and are not robust to broader
measures of tax subsidies. Because a tax subsidy in the form of a child tax credit should

affect fertility in the same way as a tax subsidy from the personal exemption, this finding
casts additional doubt on the results of Whittington et al.

   Finally, we provide an illustrative analysis of the short-run effects of child tax benefits on
the general fertility rate by estimating the models in first differences, under the assumption

that the variables we found to be highly persistent are in fact unit roots. We find evidence
that child tax benefits increase fertility with a two-year lag. However, the total short-run
effect is not statistically different from zero. These results suggest that tax benefits do not

affect the overall level of fertility, but are consistent with an effect on the timing of fertility.
   The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the estimation methods used to

replicate the original Whittington et al. results. In Section 3 we update the data and report
our new results. Section 4 concludes. Details on the data reconstruction are relegated to the

Appendix.




                                                 3
2         1913-1984: Data and Replication

Whittington et al. (1990) regressed the general fertility rate from 1913 to 1984 on a set

of explanatory variables that they argued would affect fertility: male and asset income,
unemployment, infant mortality, immigration, female wage, and binary variables for World
War II and the availability of the birth control pill. The dependent variable is the general

fertility rate, defined as the number of births per thousand women age 15-44. While some
of the series were reported in the appendix of the published paper, others have been lost

since the paper’s publication. We reconstructed the missing series using the footnotes and
references in Whittington et al.

        Table 1 reports summary statistics of the reconstructed series and those reported in
Whittington et al. (1990). It is clear that there are small differences between the two datasets,
even for some series that were copied directly from the Whittington et al. appendix. In

fact, of those series for which we obtained original data (general fertility rate, personal
exemption, male and asset income, and female wage), only the personal exemption series

exactly matches the reported moments. The other series are either different than the series
used to report the summary statistics or some error was made in computing the mean and

standard deviation.4 The unemployment, infant mortality, and immigration series that we
constructed quite accurately match the reported moments.
        The primary variable of interest for Whittington et al. (1990) is the real tax value of the

personal exemption for dependents. Today, the personal exemption is only one of several
child subsidy provisions in the federal tax code accounting for about one-third to one-half

of the total child subsidy. However, for the 1913-1984 period considered in Whittington
et al., the personal exemption was the primary source of the implicit child subsidy, never

accounting for less than 90 percent of the total child subsidy. The statutory value of the
    4
     Brigitte Madrian generously gave us access to a 1991 letter she received from Leslie Whittington in
which the full male and asset income series used in Whittington et al. (1990) is reported. According to this
letter, the average female wage index values for 1972 and 1919 were typos. However, correcting these typos
leads to greater discrepancies between both the reported moments and the replication results, so we use the
series as reported in Whittington et al. in the replication analysis.


                                                     4
personal exemption for dependents changed only nine times between 1913 and 1984; however,

its real tax value fluctuates substantially due to changes in marginal tax rates and the price
index.
    Following Whittington et al. (1990) we estimate the following reduced form equation for
the period 1913 to 1984:


  General Fertility Ratet = β0 + β1 Personal Exemptiont + β2 Male and Asset Incomet

                               + β3 Unemploymentt + β4 Infant Mortalityt + β5 Immigrationt              (1)

                               + β6 Female Waget + β7 Pillt + β8 WW2t + β9 Time Trendt + ǫt .


    Whittington et al. (1990) estimate equation (1) by FGLS because of concerns about (first-

order) serial correlation. Further details on the estimation approach are not included in the
original paper. We report the original estimates of the primary specification as reported in

Whittington et al. as Model (1) in Table 2. Next, we report the regular OLS estimates
using the replicated data with Newey-West standard errors as Model (2) in Table 2. Finally,

we report the results using Prais-Winsten FGLS (with a single iteration) and the replicated
data as Model (3) in Table 2. Model (3) closely replicates the original Model (1) results.5
The estimated coefficient on the tax value of the personal exemption is very close to the

reported value in Whittington et al. In addition, the remaining coefficient estimates are also
similar to Whittington et al.’s results.6

    It is vital that Equation (1) is correctly specified, in the sense that it represents a long-run
relationship between the primary variables of interest7 . This issue is of paramount impor-
    5
      At first glance, there appears to be a substantial discrepancy between Model (3) and Model (1), as
measured by the R2 . In GLS estimation R2 is not well defined, so it is unclear what definition was used by
Whittington et al. Using the total sum of squares from the original OLS regression and the sum of squared
residuals from Model (3) yields an R2 of 0.919. While this technique does not give an accurate description
of the fit of Model (3), it does represents a plausible method that may have been used to arrive at their
reported R2 of 0.916.
    6
      We experimented with various estimation and iteration schemes and this provided the closest results.
Slight differences in the data (including the series that were obtained from the paper itself) and potential
differences in details of the estimation procedure likely explain deviations from the original results.
    7
      We take as given that a single-equation analysis is appropriate. Discussion of the feasibility of this
assumption is beyond the scope of this paper.



                                                     5
tance in the present application because these series are highly persistent. We conducted

unit-root tests on the series in Equation (1) and found that the only series where we could
reject the unit-root null hypothesis at a size of 10% was the unemployment rate and even

this series exhibited a high degree of persistence.8 We describe these results to emphasize
the high degree of persistence in these series without taking a stand as to whether or not
they have an exact unit root. If there does not exist a long-run relationship then a regression

in levels, such as Equation (1), would be inappropriate and likely to produce spurious re-
sults.9 In fact, Wooldridge (2009), a well-known undergraduate econometric textbook, uses

Whittington et al. as an example of a spurious regression.



3         1913-2005: Updated Data and Results

3.1        Updated Data

We construct an updated dataset with 21 additional years (1985-2005) of data. In so doing,

we examined each of the reconstructed (1913-1984) series to determine whether a better
source was available. We found more up-to-date sources for several of the data series and

use these rather than the reconstructed series in the updated data. Details regarding the
data construction are provided in the Appendix.
        We follow the Whittington et al. (1990) methodology in calculating the value of the

personal exemption as described in the Appendix. We also construct a measure of the total
value of child tax benefits in the federal income tax, as recent tax changes have increased the
    8
      We conducted the unit-root tests of Harvey, Leybourne and Taylor (2009) and Carrion-i-Silvestre, Kim
and Perron (2009) on the updated data. The tests of Harvey et al. (2009) are constructed to accommodate
uncertainty over the nature of the initial condition or the presence of a linear time trend. The tests of Carrion-
i-Silvestre et al. (2009) allow us to accommodate a structural break induced by the widespread availability
of the birth-control pill. The autoregressive lag lengths were chosen by the variant of the modified Akaike
information criterion (MAIC) described in Perron and Qu (2007).
    9
      Recall that the so-called “spurious regression” problem is not confined to unit-root processes. Similar
effects may arise even when the series are stationary (see, for example, Granger (2003), Granger, Hyung
and Jeon (2001), Su (2008)). In addition, it should be noted that autocorrelation correction may ameliorate
spurious regression concerns.




                                                        6
relative importance of other child tax benefits. In addition to the tax value of the personal

exemption, the total child subsidy series also includes the value of the child tax credit (CTC)
and the earned income tax credit (EITC).

       The child tax credit acts as a child subsidy in a similar manner as the personal exemption,
providing tax benefits to parents with children. However, the EITC is a tax credit that both
increases in value with the number of children and affects the after-tax wage of recipients.

Therefore, the EITC could also affect fertility through its effect on the opportunity cost
of time. However, theory and empirical evidence both suggest that the effect of the EITC

on the opportunity cost of time is minimal.10 Because the labor supply effect is weak in
aggregate and the child tax benefits from the EITC are large, the EITC acts more like a

child subsidy than a wage subsidy and we think it is appropriate to include the EITC in the
measure of the total child subsidy. However, we also report results excluding the EITC from
the total child subsidy series.

       The average value of these credits is calculated by dividing the total federal tax expen-
diture on these credits by the number of children in the United States in each year. The

summary statistics for the extended data are reported in Table 3.


3.2       Updated Results: Original Specification

Table 4 summarizes our first set of results. In Column (1), we report our replication of

Whittington et al. (1990)’s main specification with one change – the typos in Whittington et
al.’s series are corrected (see the discussion in footnote 4 and the Appendix). These results
are reported in constant 1967 dollars and are calculated using data series from the years

1913-1984. For Columns (2) and later, we make an additional change: the value of the child
  10
    Theory suggests that the effect of the EITC on female labor supply is ambiguous except for single women
not in the labor force where there is an unambiguous increase in the likelihood of labor force participation.
The empirical literature finds that the EITC does increase the labor force participation of single women
mothers (Meyer and Rosenbaum 2001). However, the EITC appears to reduce the labor force participation
of married women (Eissa and Hoynes 2004). The reduction in labor force participation by married women
to some extent offsets the increase in labor force participation by single women. In terms of hours of work,
the empirical literature finds no significant effect of the EITC on aggregate female labor supply (Eissa and
Hoynes 2006).


                                                     7
tax subsidy, male income, and female wage are converted to constant 2005 dollars. The effect

of changing the base year can be seen clearly in the coefficient on the tax subsidy: whereas
our replication of Whittington et al. in Column (1) showed that $100 in tax benefits (in

1967 dollars) are associated with an increase in the general fertility rate of 9.9 births, the
results in Column (2) show that the comparable change in the general fertility rate for $100
in tax benefits (in 2005 dollars) is 1.7 births. This value provides a benchmark against which

results from our subsequent analyses can be measured.
      Column (3) begins the analysis using our extended data series for 1913-2005. The results

in Column (3) show that using updated data sources and extending the data through 2005
reduces but does not substantively change the key coefficient estimated in Whittington et

al. (1990). However, the results are sensitive to the definition of tax benefits. In Column
(4) we repeat the analysis including the child tax credit in the tax subsidy series. While the
coefficient on the child tax subsidy variable has the same sign as in Column (2), it is less

than half the size and no longer significant. In Column (5) we show that a similar conclusion
holds when the EITC is added to the tax subsidy series. The main results of Whittington

et al. are weaker but still present in the extended time horizon, but are not robust to more
general measures of child tax benefits.

      The specifications presented in all five columns of Table 4 are not valid if there is no
long-run relationship.11 We perform a variety of cointegration tests, both residual-based and
systems-based, to determine if there is evidence for a long-run relationship. The indicator

for the availability of the birth-control pill acts as a structural break (with known timing),
so we perform tests that allow for this.

      On balance the tests are suggestive that no cointegrating relationship occurs. However,
the results are at times sensitive to the exact specification.         In the residual-based test of

Westerlund and Edgerton (2006), which has a null hypothesis of no cointegration, we find
no evidence to reject. However, using the residual-based test of Arai and Kurozumi (2007),
 11
      We also consider more general, dynamic models in the Appendix.



                                                    8
which has a null hypothesis of cointegration, the test results are sensitive to the specification.

For a lag length of less than three, the null hypothesis of cointegration is rejected for a test
with nominal size of 5 percent. However, with a lag length of three, we fail to reject the

null hypothesis for some specifications at this size. Meanwhile, the systems-based test of
Saikkonen and Lütkepohl (2000), for most specifications, suggests either no cointegration
or a cointegrating relationship only between those variables outside the variables of interest

(i.e., excluding the general fertility rate and any subsidy variable). The test results and
further discussion may be found in the Appendix.

   We view the cointegration tests as largely suggestive that no cointegrating relationship
exists. They do not completely rule out the claim that the original specification is appro-

priate.    For example, it is well known that the performance of cointegration tests can be
sensitive to the exact form of persistence in the variables. However, the key point is that
even if we assume that the original specification is appropriate, which means the results

from Table 4 are not spurious, Columns (4) and (5) and the results in the Appendix show
that there is no statistically significant evidence of an effect of tax subsidies on the general

fertility rate once the data are updated and we include more comprehensive measures of tax
subsidies.


3.3       Short-Run Effects

If there is not a long-run relationship between child tax benefits and fertility then the Whit-
tington et al. (1990) results are driven by the high persistence of the variables in the model

rather than a meaningful relationship between these variables. In this section we will con-
sider a unit-root specification as illustrative of a model with a high degree of persistence.

The spurious regression problem can apply to any regression involving persistent variables,
not only those with unit roots. However, the unit-root specification is convenient because it
allows us to estimate the short-run relationship by simply differencing the variables, which

may exist even if there is no long-run relationship.


                                                9
       To produce estimates of the short-run effect, we consider a regression similar to Equation

(1), except using differenced variables. Table 5 summarizes the results from these regressions.
Column (1) displays the results for differenced variables over the time period originally

considered in Whittington et al. (1990) using the replication dataset converted to 2005
dollars. Surprisingly, the coefficient on the tax subsidy flips sign and decreases in magnitude.
In Column (2), we run the same specification but utilize the extended data series. Columns

(3) and (4) show the results for the other two child tax subsidy measures. Across all four
models, the estimated short-run effect is negative.

       As pointed out in Whittington et al. (1990), there are several reasons to believe that a
fertility response from changes in covariates may occur with a lag. The birth of a child will

lag the decision to have a child by at least nine months and frequently longer, and therefore
the relevant variable in analyzing fertility in year t may be the covariate’s value in year t − 1.
Covariates in time t may have little influence on fertility in year t.12 Moreover, there is a

reason to believe that the fertility response from changes in child tax benefits may be even
more delayed. While a fertility response would not likely be observed until at least one year

after a change to child tax benefits, it takes some time for taxpayers to learn that a tax
change has taken place. Changes to the tax code are often made while the tax year is well

underway. Individuals are not likely to learn about tax changes until they do their taxes
(by April of the following year). While this may have an immediate effect on the decision
to have a child, the actual birth is then realized with a delay. Therefore, while a single lag

may be appropriate for the other regressors, the real value of child tax benefits should enter
the fertility equation with at least two lags. That is, we posit that a tax policy change in

year t may not affect the decision to have children until at least year t + 1 and thus would
not affect the total fertility rate until at least year t + 2.

       Thus, we explore whether the short-run effect changes when additional lags of the child
tax subsidy are included. Table 6 reports the results from a regression of the differenced
  12
    Immigration by women of childbearing age is an exception since some women may be pregnant at the

total fertility rate on varying number of lags of the child tax subsidy. The child tax subsidy

variable specified here includes all three components of the child tax subsidy: the personal
exemption, the child tax credit and the EITC. The current and lagged values of all other

controls are included in the estimations although the estimated coefficients are not reported.
Table 6 also reports the measure of the estimated total short-run effect of tax benefits, equal
to the sum of the coefficients of all lagged child tax subsidy variables, with standard errors.

    The results in Table 6 suggest that there is a statistically significant short-run effect of
changes in child tax benefits on changes in fertility with two lags. However, the estimated

total short-run effect across the four specifications are small and statistically insignificant,
ranging from -0.004 to 0.010. The point estimates suggest that a $100 increase in the real

value of child tax benefits in 2005 dollars is associated with an increase of approximately 0
to 1 birth. The magnitude of this total effect is much smaller than the magnitude of the
Whittington et al. (1990) estimate of 1.7 births as calculated in Table 4, Column (2), and is

statistically insignificant across all specifications.
    These results provide weak evidence of an overall short-run response of fertility to tax

benefits for this particular specification, under the assumption that the variables found to
be highly persistent are in fact unit roots. Our estimates of the total effect are small and

generally positive, but statistically insignificant.



4     Conclusion

The effect of tax policy on fertility rates is often neglected in the literature on federal tax
policy, even though child tax benefits are large and have recently grown in importance. One
of the most cited studies on this topic, Whittington et al. (1990), estimates a very large

fertility rate response to the tax value of the dependent exemption. We have updated their
analysis by incorporating 21 additional years of data along with more general measures of

tax benefits for having children. We also revisited their original specification and do not find



                                                 11
strong evidence that their original specification is appropriate. However, even if the original

specification is appropriate we find in our updated analysis that the results of Whittington
et al. are not robust to more general measures of child tax benefits.
