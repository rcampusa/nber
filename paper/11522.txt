Increasing the probability of paying child support, in addition to increasing resources available for

investment in children, may also alter the incentives faced by men to have children out of wedlock.

We find that strengthening child support enforcement leads men to have fewer out-of-wedlock births

and among those who do become fathers, to do so with more educated women and those with a

higher propensity to invest in children. Thus, policies that compel men to pay child support may

affect child outcomes through two pathways: an increase in financial resources and a birth selection

process.

I.      Introduction

        Between 1970 and 1989, the proportion of children living in poverty grew by

nearly one third, with most of the increase attributable to the increase in single-mother

families (Lerman, 1993). In response to these changes, and in an effort to compel absent

fathers to provide financially for their children, federal and state government officials

began pursuing policies designed to strengthen child support enforcement. Not only have

child support payments increased during the past twenty years (Case, Lin, and

McLanahan 2003), but income from child support appears to have beneficial effects on

children over and above income from other sources (Knox, and Bane 1994; Graham,

Beller, and Hernandez 1994; Knox 1996). To account for the latter, researchers

hypothesize five potential mechanisms: 1) child support income is more likely to be spent

on children, as compared with other income, 2) child support alters family dynamics

(between mothers and fathers) in a positive way, 3) child support reduces mothers’

reliance on welfare and increases employment and marriage, 4) mothers invest more in

their children as a signal to absent fathers of their commitment to the child in order to

obtain more child support in the future, and finally 5) child support is positively

correlated with father-involvement and commitment to the child. The first four

mechanisms are typically characterized as causal, while the last is considered a selection

effect (Argys, Peters, Brooks-Gunn, and Smith 1998).

        Attempts to distinguish among the five mechanisms have been hampered by the

difficulties inherent in empirically identifying the separate effects.1 We posit an

on child goods and services increases as the share of income from child support increases among divorced
mothers. Hernandez, Beller, and Graham (1995) identify the impact of income separate from father

alternative explanation that can be identified empirically – that stricter child support

enforcement creates incentives for men to have fewer children outside marriage, and for

those who do, to partner with women who are more likely to invest in their children

independent of child support receipt. Thus unlike previous research that posits either a

causal effect or selection, we posit that stricter child support enforcement causes positive

selection on the maternal quality where quality refers to a mother’s own level of human

capital and propensity to invest in her children. As such, we might expect current

policies of stricter child support enforcement to have positive effects on both present and

future child outcomes. Positive maternal selection also provides theoretical support for

two of the five previously mentioned mechanisms (that child support income is more

likely to be spent on the child and that child support may reduce reliance on welfare)

since higher quality mothers are more likely to invest in their children and less likely to

rely on welfare.

         In the first part of this paper we discuss the incentives generated by stricter child

support enforcement policies, how they affect the fertility of single women, and how they

change the average underlying characteristics of single mothers. The discussion

incorporates the interaction between state policies of stricter child support enforcement

and the major public program serving single women with children– the AFDC program.

We predict that under certain assumptions, increasing the probability that fathers will be

required to pay child support results in 1) fewer children born to mothers who are most




involvement by comparing the impact of child support in a period in which fathers’ contributions were
more likely voluntary (because of lax enforcement) with a period of strong enforcement in which fathers
were more likely compelled (and therefore more reluctant). They find that as enforcement increases, the
positive impact of child support on education declines, suggesting that previous estimates of child support
reflect, in part, unobserved characteristics of fathers who voluntarily contribute.

likely to use AFDC, and 2) more births to women with a higher underlying propensity to

invest in children.

         The intuition behind the first prediction is based on the fact that all child support

payments received by women on welfare are taxed nearly 100 percent by the state. Thus

stricter enforcement does not provide single women who are likely to rely on welfare

with incentives to have children. In contrast, stricter enforcement provides men with clear

disincentives to have children, especially if their payments go to the state rather than to

the mother of their child. The intuition behind the second prediction that stricter child

support enforcement will lead to a change in the underlying composition of single women

is that, given men’s inability to control how their child support dollars are spent (on the

child or the mother), stronger child support enforcement provides them with an incentive

to have children with women who have a greater underlying preference for investing in

children.

         In the second part of this paper we provide empirical support for the two

predictions of the model and employ an identification strategy that enables us to isolate

this particular mechanism empirically. First, we use annual data on state expenditures for

child support enforcement and on natality for the period 1985-1998 to estimate the

impact of increasing the probability that fathers will have to pay child support on non-

marital child bearing and maternal investments in children born outside marriage.2 We

find that more stringent child support enforcement results in fewer births, especially

among less educated single women, and, conditional on education, greater use of early

prenatal care (a measure of the underlying propensity to invest in children), both of

universe of births, not a sample.


                                                       -4-
which suggest positive selection on maternal quality.3 By focusing on the impact of

increases in state expenditures on child support enforcement that were largely driven by

federal legislation (as opposed to state laws), and by using a within state difference-in-

difference framework that enables us to control for factors that vary at the state-year and

that might be correlated with both child support enforcement and fertility, we limit the

potential for policy endogeneity bias in the findings. And because our measure of

maternal investment is prenatal care which is initiated prior to the receipt of any child

support, any positive impact of child support enforcement on this measure of maternal

investment is unlikely related to an increase in available financial resources.

         The findings that stricter child support enforcement leads to a decline in the

number of out of wedlock births and an average increase in both maternal education and

child investment suggests positive selection on maternal quality as hypothesized.

However, it does not rule out alternative mechanisms. Two alternative mechanisms that

would give rise to similar empirical findings are 1) fathers who anticipate child support

obligations in the future will (voluntarily) provide financial support to mothers during the

prenatal period in order to increase mothers’ own prenatal investments in the child, and

2) mothers who anticipate child support payments in the future will experience an

increase in their permanent income that enables them to increase their prenatal

investments by borrowing against future child support payments. These two mechanisms

may be classified as income effects as opposed to a composition or selection effect.



3 These findings do not support the theory proposed by Auginbaugh (2001) that child achievement signals
a higher propensity for child investment and thus leads to an increase in future child support receipt. This
theory would predict a decline in maternal prenatal investment as a result of the increased probability of
child support receipt as there would be less need to signal because men would be more likely to be
compelled to pay child support. That is, under strict child support enforcement, women would not have to
rely on voluntary support and thus would have less need to signal in order to gain support.


                                                      -5-
       To determine whether either of these two mechanisms is operating, we use data

from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a longitudinal survey of new

mothers that includes information on future child support, receipt of financial assistance

during the prenatal period, prenatal investments (by mothers and fathers) and mothers’

ability to borrow. We find that mothers who receive child support at year one are more

likely to make greater prenatal investments. However, even when we condition on

prenatal financial transfers from the father, the positive impact of future child support on

maternal investment in the prenatal period remains. That is, even among mothers who

receive no prenatal transfers, those with future child support payments are still more

likely to invest in the prenatal period. This finding is inconsistent with the first

mechanism – that fathers who expect to pay child support in the future will invest more

during the prenatal period which enables mothers to invest more in prenatal care.

       Nor do we find evidence to support the second mechanism – that mothers who

receive child support in the future will invest more in prenatal care because they are able

to borrow against future child support payments. We find no difference in the impact of

future child support receipt on prenatal investment between mothers who are able to

borrow and those who are not. The results from the Fragile Families data suggest that

selection on fertility, rather than an income effect, is driving the finding that increases in

the probability of future child support payments lead to an increase in the average

probability of maternal prenatal investment in children.

       Our analysis has implications for a broad range of research that examines the

effect of policies on child outcomes. Insofar as policies affect fertility decisions as well




                                               -6-
as subsequent parental behavior and child outcomes, failing to take account of the former

may lead to incorrect estimates of the true effect of the policies.

        The rest of the paper is laid out as follows. In section II, we explore the incentive

effects of stricter child support enforcement and their implications in terms of potential

selection on the birth mother and review the relevant literature. In section III we discuss

our identification strategy and present the results from the aggregate state-level analysis

of births from vital statistics data. In section IV we present results from the Fragile

Families analyses, which explores the mechanism(s) behind the finding that more

stringent child support enforcement leads to increased prenatal investment. Section V

concludes by discussing the implications of our findings regarding estimation of the

impact of child support on child wellbeing.



II.     Incentive Effects of Stricter Child Support Enforcement



A.      Impact of stricter Child Support Enforcement on Fertility – Background Literature

        Theoretical predictions of the impact of stricter child support enforcement (CSE)

on the number of births or composition of parents are ambiguous. On the one hand,

stricter CSE raises the financial obligation of the absent father to the mother, raising the

cost to single fathers of having children. On the other hand, stricter CSE lowers the cost

of having children faced by single mothers. While the former should lead to a decline in

out of wedlock births, the latter should lead to an increase; so that the net effect of stricter

CSE on fertility is ambiguous a priori.




                                               -7-
        The empirical evidence with respect to the impact of child support enforcement

on fertility suggests that the incentive effects of stricter CSE for men outweigh those for

women: states with stricter child support enforcement have witnessed a decline in out-of -

wedlock births.4 These studies rely on changes in state laws governing child support

enforcement (paternity establishment, immediate withholding, etc.) to identify the impact

of stricter child support enforcement on fertility.5 Examples of this literature include

Sonenstein, Pleck, and Ku (1994) who find that adolescent males are aware of paternity

establishment policies and modify their sexual behavior and contraceptive use

accordingly. Garfinkel and his colleagues (Garfinkel, Huang, McLanahan, and Gaylin

2003; Plotnick, Garfinkel, McLanahan, and Ku 2004) who link higher paternity

establishment rates to non marital child bearing and find that higher paternity

establishment rates reduce non-marital child. Though most of these studies employ state

and year fixed effects, endogeneity of the child support enforcement policies still poses a

problem if the timing of the policies within each state is driven by unobservable

characteristics related to fertility and nonmarital child bearing that are changing over

time. We address the potential policy endogeneity of stricter child support enforcement

and describe our identification strategy in Section III.



4 Another possibility is that stricter CSE is not negatively affecting fertility, but positively affecting
marriage if the cost of being a single father increases relative to being married. Heim (2003) finds no
impact of child support enforcement on divorce rates; Nixon (1997) finds a negative relationship between
child support enforcement and divorce as does Huang (2002). For our purposes, however, it doesn’t matter
which mechanism is responsible. Though it is interesting to note that if stricter CSE were lowering out of
wedlock births by encouraging marriage (as opposed to lowering fertility), we would expect those marrying
to come from the upper tail of the distribution of “quality” single mothers – that is, mothers with higher
education. As such, the underlying quality/education of single mothers would decline. That is not what we
find, suggesting that stricter child support enforcement in not affecting the composition of single mothers
by increasing the incentives for marriage.
5 There also exists a literature linking increased child support enforcement with child support payments
(Freeman and Waldfogel 1998; Argys, Peters, and Waldman 1995; Nixon 1994; Miller, Garfinkel, and
McLanahan 1997; Beller and Graham 1991).


                                                     -8-
       While there is considerable empirical evidence regarding the impact of stricter

CSE on fertility, there is no research on how child support affects the composition or

quality of parents. We provide the first such empirical estimates of the impact of stricter

CSE on the composition of mothers and thus the potential quality of parenting and child

outcomes.



B.     Impact of Stricter Child Support Enforcement on Composition of Mothers

       A simple model of the decision of an unmarried couple to have a child illustrates

how the composition of mothers may change if child support enforcement increases. In

such a model, fathers’ utility (Um) depends on their own consumption (cm) and the quality

or capital of their children (q). Q increases with financial resources devoted to the child –

a fraction of both the mother’s income (Iw) and any child support payments received (cs).

Fathers choose their consumption level (cm) and how much child support to provide (cs).

Likewise, mothers care about their own consumption (cw) and q and choose how much of

Iw and cs to invest in the child. Some mothers invest a greater portion of their income in

their children than others. We can think of these mothers as having a greater preference

for child quality, denoted α.

       Although a non-cohabitating father is unable to assure that all child support

payments to the mother are spent on the child and not on her own consumption (Willis

1999), he may observe a mother’s α. Since α determines how much of her income and

child support she will invest in her child, men will always prefer to have children with

women with a greater α.




                                              -9-
         When deciding whether to have a child, a man will compare the indirect utility

gained from not having a child (income spent on his consumption only) and having a

child with a woman with a given α (income spent on consumption and child support). A

critical level of α exists above which his utility from having a child exceeds that of not

having one. This critical level increases with the probability that he will be forced to pay

child support and with the probability that the woman will rely on welfare

(AFDC/TANF). The intuition behind the latter is that, with some exceptions (some

states allow for a $50 pass through each month), most child support payments to mothers

on welfare are taxed 100 percent by the state. As such, men receive little if any

additional benefit (in the form of higher child quality) from their child support payments

if the mother relies on welfare.6 Thus when forced to pay child support, men will want

to have children with women with a greater α and when women are likely to use welfare,

men will require an even higher α to have a child with her.

         Figure 1 illustrates these points. In the figure, the horizontal line Um (NC)

represents a father’s utility associated with not having a child (NC). Utility does not

change with α because it is only a function of income (Im). The dark line Um(C, NE)

represents a father’s utility from having a child with no child support enforcement, and

the line Um(C, E) represents his utility from having a child with child support

enforcement. α*NE represents the minimum α required for the utility of having a child to

exceed that of not having one (Um(C, NE)> Um(NC)) under no enforcement. As is

evident from the graph, this critical value is lower than that under enforcement α*NE <


6 This argument presumes that welfare use has no independent effect on child investment or well-being.
That is, a mother with a given α and income will invest the same amount in her child regardless of the
source of income (earnings, child support, or welfare). Alternatively, one could argue that relying on
welfare is a negative investment in the child and therefore negatively related to α. This would amplify the
results, providing an additional incentive for men to select with a women with a high α.

α*E. The intuition behind this is simply that the constraint introduced by child support

enforcement (if it is binding) lowers a father’s utility for any given α. The fourth line

(Um (C,E,W)) represents the indirect utility associated with having a child with a woman

on welfare under a regime of strict child support enforcement. The critical value α*EW,

above which men will choose to have children, is higher still.

       Stricter Child Support Enforcement and the Composition of Mothers




III.      Child Support Enforcement, Prenatal Investments and Birth Outcomes: Evidence
          from Vital Statistics Data

          Our analysis of the impact of stricter child support enforcement on birth rates,

prenatal investment and birth outcomes differs in important ways from previous research.

Previous studies have examined the impact of state child support policies on the number

of births among single mothers (Case 1998; Garfinkel, Huang, McLanahan, and Gaylin

2003). We are the first to examine the impact of stricter child support enforcement on the




                                                  - 11 -
composition/quality of mothers (as measured by their educational attainment) and the

prenatal investments they make in their children as measured by their early initiation of

prenatal care and number of prenatal visits.

         Another important distinction lies in our empirical methods. A major challenge of

estimating the impact of stricter child support enforcement on fertility and maternal

investment is to identify the effect of child support enforcement separate from other

potentially unobservable factors that might affect both the state’s child support policies

and fertility or investment in children. Previous studies of the impact of child support

enforcement policies on fertility attempt to control for unobserved influences using a

variety of methods. Most compare changes in fertility over time between states that

adopt stricter child support enforcement and those that do not (also referred to as a state

fixed effect approach). This provides some control for policy endogeneity by controlling

for state-level factors that are fixed and do not vary over time, but not factors that might

vary within state over time.7 In this paper we adopt an alternative approach that controls

for time-varying unobservable factors within a state that might affect child support

enforcement and fertility/investment. Examples of such factors might include changes in

society values and norms or changes in the availability and cost of contraception.

         To do this we obtain within state difference-in-differences estimates of the effect

of stricter child support enforcement. This estimate is obtained by defining two groups: a

treatment or experimental group and a control group. Because state child support



7 Case (1998) is a notable exception. She explicitly recognizes this possibility in her investigation of the
impact of laws establishing stricter child support enforcement on the number of out of wedlock births. In a
simple OLS, she finds that the laws predict an increase in out of wedlock births. After instrumenting for
the state laws using characteristics of the state legislatures, she finds that stricter child support enforcement
does lead to a decline in out of wedlock births, though the results are not significant. Her results
underscore the importance of controlling for policy endogeneity.


                                                       - 12 -
enforcement expenditures target single women, we define single women as the treatment

and married women as the control group. We therefore construct our estimates of the

impact of stricter child support enforcement by comparing its impact on the

fertility/investment decisions of single mothers relative to married mothers residing in the

same state. The assumption of this identification strategy is that changes over time in the

behavior of men and women that are unrelated to child support enforcement are common

to single and married women. It also assumes that married women are unaffected by child

support enforcement. While this assumption is restrictive, it is preferable to simply

comparing fertility/investment decisions under strict child support enforcement regimes

with those under more lenient regimes because it allows one to identify the effect of

stricter child support enforcement separate from broader changes in social norms, the cost

of investing in children or other factors as measured by the behavior of married women.

       Since these single-married fertility/investment differentials can be computed

within cells defined by state and year, our approach implicitly controls for all time-

varying state specific factors by allowing us to include not only individual state and year

fixed effects but state*year fixed effects (as discussed further in the next section). The

state*year fixed effects subsume the individual state and year main effects so that they

need not be included separately. In other words, the vector of state*year fixed effects

includes individual state and year fixed effects as well as an interaction between them.




A.     Data and Estimation




                                             - 13 -
          Data on all births in the US come from the 1985 -1999 Natality Detail Files

collected by the CDC.8 Summary statistics are provided in Appendix Tables 1 and 2.

Rather than perform the analysis on a dataset of all individual births, we aggregated the

data to the group level with groups defined by year, state, age group, race, education and

marital status.9 We matched these data with data on child support enforcement by the

year in which the child was conceived (calculated using gestational age and date of birth).

Our measure of child support enforcement is expenditures on child support that come

from the annual reports of the Office of Child Support Enforcement, US Department of

Health and Human Services. This represents a departure from other work that has

focused on either specific policies/laws with respect to child support enforcement and/or

child support expenditures. We focus on expenditures for the following reasons: 1)

previous work has found the data on child support policies to be “incomplete and in some

places inconsistent” (Freeman, and Waldfogel 1998), and 2) there are multiple policies

and laws that require selection of an arguably arbitrary subset. However, we do repeat

the analysis with a single policy – whether child support is withheld from father’s wages

– and discuss those results in the following section.



The equation estimated takes the form:

    (1)      Ysymrae = β1 singlem + β2 ln(CSE)*single msy-1 + β3 Racer + β4 Educatione

                 + β5 Agea + β6 state*yearsy-1 + εsymrae



8 Beginning in 1985, all births were included as part of the file. Prior to 1985, only a random sample of
births were included for some states. The final dataset includes all births conceived 1985-1998. However,
we needed to use natality data from 1999 to calculate the total number of children that were conceived in
1998.
9 An example of a single group or cell would be all births to single white mothers age 20-29 in Montana in
1990.


                                                    - 14 -
In the above equation CSE refers to the average annual expenditures in the state in the

three years prior to the year of conception. We do this because we believe that the effects

of increased child support enforcement are not immediate but are lagged, and also to

further limit the potential for policy-endogeneity bias. Single is an indicator equal to one

if the birth mother is single (representing the treatment group). Thus the coefficient on

the term lnCSE*single (β2) represents the within state difference-in-differences estimate:

the impact of the child support enforcement on single women relative to married women

in states that experience large increases in CSE relative to those in states with small

changes in CSE. The vector Race includes the dummy variables for the race of the

mother (black, white, Hispanic, Asian, and other is the omitted group), the vector Age

includes dummies for the age of the mother (teen, age 20-29, age 30-39, and age 40-55 is

the omitted group) and Education includes the educational status of the mother (less than

HS, HS, HS+). For this analysis, we dropped college educated mothers as single college

educated mothers are quite rare and unrepresentative. Recall that because the data are

aggregated to the cell level based on state, year, race, marital status, age and education,

only binary indicators for these measures, not continuous variables, can be included.

         As noted previously, the inclusion of state*year fixed effects subsumes individual

state and year fixed effects, so they are not included separately in the analysis (in other

words, they are included in the state*year fixed effects).10 Including state*year fixed

effects also controls for all factors that may vary within states over time, such as


10 State*year fixed effects include individual state and year fixed effects. This is can be shown with the
following short example. Consider two years and two states. If state*year fixed effects are included, there
would be three dummies included: state1*year1, state1*year2 and state2*year1 (state2*year2 is the omitted
or reference category) which is the equivalent of two main effects and an interaction (we are grateful to the
editor for suggesting this illustrative example).

unemployment rates and AFDC benefits that may be correlated with both the state’s child

support policies and birth outcomes as well as any other factors that vary within state

over time that affect the whole population.11 In addition, the vector of state*year fixed

effects subsumes the main CSE term (since it varies by state and year) but not the term

ln(CSE)*single – enabling identification of the impact of CSE on birth outcomes.

        The outcomes (Y) are the 1) log of the number of births, 2) the proportion of

mothers in the cell who initiated prenatal care in the first trimester, 3) the average number

of prenatal visits, and 4) the proportion of low birth weight (LBW) births. For the first of

these, we also include the log of the number of women in the cell (the denominator) as a

covariate and weight by the size of the denominator.12 For the second, third and fourth,

we weight by the number of births in the cell.



B.      Results

        Estimates of the impact of CSE on the number of births are presented in Table 1.

The first column displays estimates of the impact of stricter CSE on the number of births.

Consistent with previous work, we find that stricter child support enforcement leads to a

significant decline in births to single women relative to married women. The estimated

coefficient β2 (-0.033) can be interpreted as the elasticity of the birth rate with respect to

changes in child support expenditures. That is, a one percent increase in expenditures

leads to a decline in single (non-marital) fertility relative to marital fertility of 0.03



11 Expansions in the Medicaid program represent a change in policy that might be of particular concern
with respect to improvement in birth outcomes over this period. Since Medicaid expansions were all
implemented by 1986 we run the regressions a second time for the period 1987-1998 and get the same
results.
12 The denominator (the number of women of a given race, education level, age and marital status in a
given state) was calculated from the 1990 Census.

percent. In the next three columns of Table 1, we examine whether stricter CSE

differentially affects the fertility of some single women more than others, thereby

potentially altering the average underlying characteristics of single mothers and their

children. We previously predicted that the fertility of those single mothers most likely to

use the AFDC program would decline relative to others. Though we do not have an exact

measure of a woman’s propensity to use welfare, we do have measures of maternal

education, which is highly negatively correlated with welfare use. In columns 2-4 we

present the results stratified by maternal education. Consistent with our prediction,

stricter CSE appears to have the greatest negative impact on the fertility of the women

who have the least education and therefore are most likely to use welfare. The estimated

elasticity is -0.094 for women without a high school degree and -0.039 for women with a

high school degree. In contrast, for women with some college, the elasticity is slightly

positive (0.023).

       In Table 2 we present estimates of the impact of stricter CSE on two measure of

prenatal investments of mothers – early initiation of prenatal care and the number of

prenatal visits. Column 1 presents estimates of the impact of increasing child support

expenditures on the proportion of single mothers in the state that initiate care in the first

trimester, controlling for age, education and race. We find that single women in states

with stricter child support enforcement are more likely to initiate care in the first

trimester. Over the period 1984-1998 the share of single women initiating care in the

first trimester increased from 0.548 to 0.708 (see Appendix Table 2). Given that CSE

increased on average 300 percent over this period, the estimated coefficient of 0.018

suggests that half of this increase can be attributed to the increase in child support




                                              - 17 -
enforcement.13 Similarly in column two we present results which suggest that the

increase in child support enforcement also led to a positive and significant increase in the

number of prenatal visits among single women and was responsible for 6 percent of the

observed increase in prenatal visits over this period. Finally, in column three, we present

results for LBW. The proportion of single women with LBW babies declined from 0.112

to 0.099 over this period. The results suggest that the increase in child support

enforcement over this period explains 13 percent of this decline.

        In Table 3, we present estimates of the impact of stricter child support

enforcement on fertility, prenatal investment and birth outcomes stratified by race. For

non-black mothers (columns 1-4), increasing expenditures on child support leads to a

reduction in the number of births, an increase in the proportion of women initiating early

prenatal care and the number of visits, and a decline in the proportion of LBW births.

For black mothers, however, while the number of births decline and the proportion

initiating prenatal care early increases as does the number of prenatal visits, birth

outcomes do not appear to improve. For black mothers, we find no significant effect of

child support enforcement on LBW.

        To provide additional evidence in support of this finding, we also estimate a

discrete time duration model of the impact of CSE on time until first birth, using data on

individual women from the NLSY79. The NLSY79 consists of a nationally representative

sample of 12,686 young men and women age 14-22 in 1979 interviewed annually from

1979 to 1994 and then biennially until 2000. The NLSY includes 6,283 women of

whom 5,762 are included in this analysis (521 are excluded because they already had at

(roughly 300 percent) on the increase in prenatal care as a percent of the total increase in prenatal care
observed over this period.

least one child by 1979). Individual data allow us to include additional controls that

might affect fertility such as AFQT score (the score on the Armed Forces Qualifying

Exam, a measure of cognitive ability), whether her mother worked when she was 14

years old and the highest grade completed by her mother.

        Though sample sizes prevent us from obtaining precise estimates, the hazard

models do suggest that the probability that single women will have a child in a given

year, conditional on not having had a child to date, is lower in states that spend more on

child support enforcement. Increasing expenditures on child support enforcement two

standard deviations around the mean decreases the probability of birth for a single

woman from 4.5 to 1.7 percent.14 We also find that though the likelihood of having a

child decreases for single women when child support enforcement increases, it does so at

a slower rate for those with more education. This is consistent with our findings based on

aggregate birth certificate data: stricter child support enforcement has the greatest

negative impact on the fertility of women most likely to use AFDC – those with the least

education.

        Our choice of expenditures as the measure of child support enforcement is subject

to the criticism that it might be confounded with efficiency or with the difficulty of the

caseload of delinquent fathers. If, for example, expenditures were confounded with

                                                      - 19 -
efficiency, that is, greater expenditures in states with less efficient child support

collection systems, then the results would be biased downward. Similarly, if

expenditures were confounded with caseload difficulty, (that is, states that increase their

expenditures are those that already collect from those least reluctant to contribute and are

attempting to collect child support from more reluctant fathers) this might also bias our

estimates downwards. On the other hand, if states with more efficient or less difficult

caseloads spend more because the marginal benefit of expenditures is greater, then our

results would be biased upward.

        As a check, we estimate the impact of an alternative measure of child support

enforcement – an indicator for enactment of a law that automatically withholds child

support payments from the wages of absent fathers. While the withhold represents an

alternative measure, it is still positively correlated with child support expenditures (as are

other child support laws). We find that, for example, adoption of the automatic withhold

would explain 36 percent of the increase in first trimester prenatal care (less than the 50

percent explained by the increase in child support enforcement expenditures). While the

results are qualitatively similar, they suggest a possible small upward bias to the results

based on child support expenditures.



IV.     Child Support and Prenatal Investments: Evidence from the Fragile Families

Study

        In this section we investigate potential mechanisms behind our finding that

increased child support enforcement leads to an increase in prenatal investment. In

particular, we wish to know whether this increase is due to positive selection as we




                                               - 20 -
hypothesize or some alternative mechanism. Two possible alternative mechanisms

include: 1) increases in paternal income transfers during the prenatal period (in

anticipation of future support obligations), and 2) increases in mother’s ability to borrow

against future child support payments during the prenatal period (as a result of a positive

permanent income effect). We use data from the Fragile Families Study to determine to

what extent the increase may be attributed to either of these two alternative mechanisms.

Lack of evidence for either of these mechanisms would provide yet further support for

our hypothesis of positive selection.



A.     The Fragile Families Data

       The Fragile Families and Child Well Being Study interviews approximately 3700

new unwed couples residing in 20 cities in 15 states shortly after the birth of their child.

Parents are interviewed again when the child is between 12 and 18 months old. About

1900 of these parents were not co-habiting at the time of the follow-up interview and

therefore were eligible for child support and inclusion in our sample. A unique aspect of

the Fragile Families data is the extensive information (taken from both maternal and

paternal surveys) on non co-habiting fathers.

       These data include information on whether a formal or informal child support

agreement exists at 12-18 months (34 percent). These data also include information on

child investments during the prenatal period: the date when the mother initiated prenatal

care and whether the father provided financial assistance to her during this period.

Lastly, the data contain information on whether the mothers can borrow money (at least

$200) if they need to – a measure of their credit constraint.




                                              - 21 -
B.     Results from Fragile Families

        In the first two columns of Table 4 we present evidence regarding the impact of

future child support receipt and prenatal transfers on prenatal investments. In the first

column we explore the relationship between future child support receipt and early

initiation of prenatal care. We find that those mothers who receive future child support

are more likely to initiate prenatal care early (0.085), as expected. Even when we control

for whether prenatal transfers were received from the father in column 2, the positive

effect of future child support receipt remains (0.080), suggesting that the receipt of

prenatal transfers cannot explain the positive impact of future child support receipt on

prenatal investments. In results not presented, we find that the same pattern emerges for

LBW: future child support receipt leads to a decline in LBW and the effect remains even

when we control for prenatal transfers, but the effects are imprecisely estimated, most

likely due to small sample sizes.

       To rule out the possibility that in anticipation of future child support payments,

mothers are able to borrow additional money during the prenatal period (a permanent

income effect), we stratify the sample based on whether the mother is credit constrained

using the above-mentioned measure of credit constraint. The results are presented in

columns 3 and 4. If it were the case that future child support receipt positively affects

maternal prenatal investment because the mother is able to borrow against future child

support payments, then the positive impact of future child support receipt would be

limited to (or at least stronger for) mothers who are not credit constrained. The empirical

evidence from the Fragile Families does not support this, but rather rules out the idea that




                                             - 22 -
the empirical findings based on the birth certificate data were simply due to increased

resources, not positive selection.



V.     Discussion

       This paper is the first to examine how the composition of mothers changes in

response to an increase in the probability of future child support payments brought about

by stricter state child support enforcement. We find that the average education of

mothers increases, as does the level of maternal investments in children (as measured by

early investment in prenatal care), with stronger child support enforcement. What is

notable about these results is that the increase in maternal investment occurs prior to the

receipt of any child support payments, suggesting that stricter child support enforcement,

in addition to increasing the material resources available to children, may benefit children

through a birth selection process. That is, stricter child support enforcement reduces

fertility, especially among mothers who are less likely to invest in their children,

regardless of actual child support receipt. As a result, we might expect current policies of

child support enforcement to affect both current and future child outcomes. Existing

research on the impact of child support receipt on child outcomes has not considered this

mechanism. To fully understand the impact of any changes in state policies affecting

child support enforcement on child outcomes, it is necessary to understand how policies

might affect both the birth selection process as well as the receipt of financial resources,

conditional on the birth of the child.
