Long-Term Declines in Disability Among Older Men: Medical Care,
Public Health, and Occupational Change

JEL No. I12, N31
                                           ABSTRACT

       Functional disability (difficulty in walking , difficulty in bending, paralysis, blindness in at
least one eye, and deafness in at least one ear) in the United States has fallen at an average annual
rate of 0.6 percent among men age 50 to 74 from the early twentieth century to the early 1990s.
Twenty-four to 41 percent of this decline is attributable to innovations in medical care, 37 percent
to reduced chronic disease rates, and the remainder is unexplained. The portion due to reduced
chronic disease rates can be subdivided into the 9 percent accounted for by reduced infectious
disease rates (particularly rheumatic fever, malaria, typhoid, and acute respiratory infections), the
7 percent accounted for by occupational shifts away from manual labor and to white collar jobs, and
the 21 percent that is unexplained.

1 Introduction

Functional disability among older men in the United States has improved greatly since the

beginning of the twentieth century. Among men age 60 to 74 at the beginning of the century 50

percent had difficulty bending, 31 percent difficulty walking, 4 percent were partially paralyzed,

4 percent were blind in at least one eye, and 4 percent deaf in at least one ear. In contrast, among

men in the same age group in the early 1990s, only 16 percent had difficulty bending, 11 percent

had difficulty walking, 3 percent were partially paralyzed, 3 percent were blind in at least one eye,

and 3 percent were deaf in at least one ear. The decline in disability in this time period among

men age 50 to 64 is of a similar order of magnitude.1

              Two main factors could account for long-term declines in functional disability at older

ages. One factor is the increased efficacy of medical care. Even with no decline in chronic disease

rates, functional disability may have improved because medical technology allows both for short-

term symptom relief and for long-term control of chronic conditions. Since the late 1960s there

has been a remarkable increase in therapies targetted at the elderly population. Non-steroid

anti-inflammatory drugs, gold compounds, hydroxycholoquine, sulfasalasize, corticosteroids,

and cytotoxic and immuno-suppressive drugs all alleviate rheumatoid arthritis. Cataracts was

previously one of the main causes of blindness at older ages (Costa 1998: 64), but today cataract

extraction and implantation of a plastic or silicone lens is a common outpatient procedure. Such

surgeries as cardiac catheritization, bypass, angioplasty, and installation of pacemakers and such

drugs as -blockers, Ca-channel blockers, vasodilators, ACE inhibitors, and thrombolytics control

cardiac conditions. Chronic obstructive airway disorders such as asthma and chronic obstructive

pulmonary disease are controlled by bronchodilator drugs (e.g.            -agonists, anticholigeneric

drugs, theophylline, and corticosteriods) and by antibiotics when exacerbated by viral infections.

           The second explanation for the decline in functional disability at older ages is the decline

in chronic disease rates. The average decline in such chronic conditions as respiratory problems,

valvular heart disease, arteriosclerosis, and joint and back problems was about 66 percent from the

early 1900s to the 1970s and 1980s (Costa forthcoming). Several explanations could account for

this decrease, including a decline in the use of salt and wood smoke as food preservatives, increases

in nutritional intake during the growing years (including in utero), declines in infectious disease,

and reductions in occupational injuries (Barker 1992, 1994; Fogel and Costa 1997; Manton,

Stallard, and Corder 1997b; Elo and Preston 1992). In previous work (Costa forthcoming) I

estimate that roughly 29 percent of the decline in chronic conditions at older ages from the early

1900s to the 1970s and 1980s could be accounted for by occupational shifts from manual to

white collar occupations and 18 percent by the decline in infectious disease rates. The decline in

infectious disease rates in turn could be explained by public health investments in water filtration,

vaccination, and sewage systems that were carried out in the United States by the 1930s.

           This paper documents the decline in functional disability among men age 50 to 64

and 60 to 74 in the United States between the early 1900s and the early 1990s.2 It examines

whether these declines can be explained by the increased efficacy of medical care, the decline

in infectious disease rates, or the shift from manual to white collar occupations. The paper uses

a longitudinal data set on Union Army veterans of the American Civil War (1861-1865). These

men represent the first cohort to reach age 65 in the twentieth century. Because medical care in the

past was ineffective at best, I can examine the impact of untreated chronic disease on functional

disability. Because these men were exposed to a variety of infectious diseases while in the army

as young adults, I can investigate the impact of exposure to disease at young adult ages on later


   2
     Riley has argued that while incidence rates for specific conditions may have fallen, conditional on having
a disease those with the disease may now be more disabled than they were one hundred years ago. See Costa
(forthcoming) for a contrary view.

life outcomes. Because the data are longitudinal, I can also investigate the impact of occupation

during both young adult and older ages on disability at older ages.

          The findings will help us understand why the health of different cohorts has been

changing in the United States. Improvements in elderly health both from the early 1900s to the

1980s (Costa forthcoming) and during the 1980s (Cutler and Richardson 1997; Manton, Corder,

and Stallard 1997a) suggest that aging is “plastic.” The plasticity of aging has implications both

for policies that propose to postpone the age at which full Social Security retirement benefits

can be collected and for the fiscal solvency of Medicare. It also has implications for investment

in biomedical research areas and assessments of the benefits of medical technology as a whole.

Many researchers (e.g. Chassin et al. 1987; Greenspan et al. 1988; Winslow et al. 1988;

Newhouse 1993) have focused on the low productivity of the medical system and implicitly

argued that limiting overall medical spending would improve welfare. But, studies of the overall

costs and benefits of medical care since the 1970s suggest that the benefits far outweigh the costs

(e.g. Cutler, McClellan, and Newhouse 1998; Cutler and Richardson 1997).

          The findings will also help us target resources in developing countries. Many of the

infectious diseases that were prevalent in the United States in the nineteenth century are still

common, and as deadly, in many developing countries today. A large percentage of the labor

force of developing countries works in manual occupations. But, developing countries have

access to modern medicine.

          The paper begins with a description of the data. Section 3 discusses trends in functional

disability (difficulty in walking, difficulty in bending, paralysis, blindness in at least one eye,

and deafness in at least one ear). Section 4 explains how declines in functional disability can be

decomposed into the portions attributable to increased efficacy of medical care, reduced exposure

to infectious disease, and occupational shifts. Section 5 presents the long-term trend in chronic

disease rates and discusses diagnoses. Section 6 decomposes the decline in functional disability


                                                3
into the fractions accounted for by innovations in medical care and by reduced chronic disease

rates. Section 7 decomposes the decline in chronic disease rates and in functional disability

into the proportions attributable to reduced infectious disease rates and occupational shifts. The

relationship between specific chronic conditions and infectious disease and manual occupations

is investigated in this section as well.



2 Data

The data used in this paper are drawn from the records of the Union Army pension program (see

the Data Appendix for a description). This pension program was the most widespread form of

assistance to the elderly prior to Social Security, covering 85 percent of all Union Army veterans

by 1900 and 90 percent by 1910 (Costa 1998: 160). The program was established in 1862 to

provide pensions to both regular and volunteer recruits who were severely disabled as a direct

result of military service. By 1890 the program became a universal disability program for veterans

and by 1904 it officially became a universal old-age pension program. The dataset that uses these

records contains detailed medical examinations both for men whose pension application or bid

for a pension increase was rejected and for men whose applications were accepted; occupational

information from the 1900 and 1910 censuses and from enlistment records; and medical histories

on such illnesses as measles, diarrhea, tuberculosis, typhoid, acute respiratory infections, malaria,

smallpox, cholera, and stomach problems while these men were in the Army.

          The records of the examining surgeons noted such functional disabilities as difficulty

in walking, difficulty in bending, paralysis, blindness in at least one eye, and deafness in at

least one ear. The surgeons also described specific chronic conditions in great detail. Thus for

heart disease conditions the physician described pulse rate characteristics; whether a murmur

was present and its timing, type, and location and which valves were involved; whether the


                                                 4
murmur was accompanied by a thrill; whether there was enlargement, edema, cyanosis, dyspnea,

arteriosclerosis, or impaired circulation. The physician also described such circulatory disorders

as varicose veins and hemorrhoids. Respiratory examinations included reports of respiratory

sounds such as murmurs, rales, crepitus, vocal fremitus, and ronchae and reports of decreased

breath sounds. Descriptions of rheumatism included where the rheumatism was located and

whether pain, tenderness, swelling, or crepitation was associated with the joint. Disease and

disability rates are based upon an examining surgeon ever having noted a condition. Prevalence

rates for 1910 may be underestimated because men who qualified for a pension on the basis of

age alone, as many did in 1910, have fewer surgeons’ exams than their counterparts who qualified

on the basis of health.

           I compare the Union Army data with a random sample of the American non-institutionalized,

white population drawn from the 1988-1994 National Health and Nutritional Examination Sur-

vey (NHANES) and the 1994 and 1995 National Health Interview Surveys (NHIS).3 NHANES

includes measures of functional disabilities (difficulty in walking, difficulty in bending, and paral-

ysis) as assessed by a physician and self-reported measures of functional disability (difficulty in

walking, difficulty in bending, blindness in at least one eye, and deafness in at least one ear). NHIS

includes some self-reported disability measures (difficulty in walking and difficulty in bending).

NHANES also includes a medical exam which in some cases yields descriptions and diagnoses

that can be compared with those of physicians working under contract from the Pension Bureau

because these did not require any diagnostic equipment that was unavailable to late nineteenth

century physicians. In addition, NHANES includes self-reports of whether a respondent ever had

cataracts, stroke, congestive heart failure, or arthritis. NHIS includes self-reports of whether a

respondent had a chronic condition within the last 12 months. The specific chronic conditions that

I will examine are adventitious sounds, decreased breath sounds, back problems, joint problems,

murmurs, congestive heart failure, stroke, and irregular pulse in the Union Army sample and

in NHANES and murmurs, varicose veins, hemorrhoids, poor circulation, arteriosclerosis, and

tachycardia in the Union Army sample and in NHIS.4



3 Disability Trends

Table 1 gives disability rates as measured by difficulty in walking, difficulty in bending, paralysis,

blindness in at least one eye, and deafness in at least one ear among men age 50-64 and 60-74 in

the Union Army sample, NHANES, and NHIS. For comparison results are also presented from

the 1978 Survey of Disability and Work (SDW). Three sets of results are presented for the Union

Army sample. These include results for the entire sample and for veterans with a surgeons’

exam. Veterans with a surgeons’ exam were on average more disabled. Because I know disability

and chronic disease rates only for men with a surgeons’ exam (in calculating rates for the entire

sample I am assuming that men without a surgeons’ exam had no functional disabilities), I use

the values for men with a surgeons’ exam in the decomposition.

              How representative of the health of the general population are the disability rates

calculated for the entire Union Army sample? Because all Union Army veterans survived to

young adult ages without any substantial physical handicaps and because of high infectious rates

at young ages (e.g. scarlett fever or congenital rubella), the prevalence of blindness and deafness

was probably higher in the general population. The prevalence of difficulty in walking or in


   4
       Of course some of these conditions (adventitious sounds, dyspnea, and tachycardia) may not be chronic.



                                                          6
bending may have been higher in the general population as well. Disability may also have

been higher in the general population because the proportion of immigrants was higher in the

general population and these men experienced a worse disease and nutritional environment in

early childhood. Although I cannot compare the health of veterans and non-veterans after the war,

I can estimate the extent to which veterans’ wartime experience contributed to their ill-health.

The third measure that I present for Union Army veterans therefore includes predicted values

for the entire sample from a probit regression in which the dependent variable is the measure

of functional disability and the independent variables are age, dummy variables for occupation,

dummy variables indicating what disease a veteran had while in the army, and dummies for

whether the veteran had ever been wounded in the war, had ever been discharged for disability, or

had ever been a POW. The latter three dummy variables are set equal to 0 to obtain predictions.

These predicted values suggest that while the war did have an effect on such measures of disability

as difficulty in walking or bending, the average annual rate of decline in disability obtained from

using predicted disability is similar to that obtained from using actual disability rates for the entire

sample.

          Several measures of difficulty in walking and in bending are given in Table 1. The

Union Army physicians noted gait abnormalities (e.g. “lame,” “shuffles”, “leg drags”), general

difficulties in walking (“locomotion impaired,” “crippled,” “cannot walk”), and general difficulties

in bending (“cannot touch floor”, “cannot straighten”). Difficulty in walking (including gait

abnormalities) is compared to three different measures in NHANES. The first of these is physican

evaluated lameness, gait abnormalites, and limb paralysis. The second is physician evaluated

difficulty (could not be done, moderate difficulty) in walking one quarter of a mile. The third

of these is self-evaluated difficulty (could not be done, moderate difficulty, some difficulty) in

walking 10 steps without rest. The difficulty in walking variable in NHIS is a yes/no response

to the question of whether the individual had difficulty in walking. In SDW, an individual is

Note. UA=Union Army, SDW=Survey of Disability and Work, NHANES=National Health and Nutrition Ex-
amination Survey, NHIS=National Health Interview Survey. Sample weights were used for SDW, NHANES,
and NHIS. Evaluations of walking and bending difficulties do not include mild difficulties, e.g. walking
several miles. Results from “Predicted UA” are predictions from a probit regression in which the controls
were age, dummies indicating wartime diseases, occupational dummies, and dummies indicating whether
the veteran has ever been wounded during the war, had been discharged for disability, or had been a POW.
These last three dummies were set equal to 0 to obtain predicted values. Results from “Surgeons’ UA” are
means obtained from the UA sample restricted to men who had a surgeons’ exam. Two different indicators
are presented for difficulty in walking in NHANES. The first is based upon indications of lameness, shuffling,
gait abnormalities, or leg paralysis. The second is based upon difficulty in walking a quarter of a mile.




                                                      8
considered to have difficulty in walking if he reported a lot of trouble using stairs or an incline.

Difficulty in bending is compared to two different measures in NHANES. The first of these is

the physician’s evaluation of difficulty in bending (could not be done, moderate difficulty) and

the second the individual’s own assessment of difficulty in stooping, crouching, kneeling (could

not be done, moderate difficulty). The variable in NHIS is a yes/no response to the question of

whether the individual had difficulty in bending. The variable in SDW is a positive response to

whether an individual had a lot of trouble in stooping, crouching, or kneeling.

          How can the different measures of difficulty in walking and in bending be compared

with the Union Army data? In the case of difficulty in walking, I use both the physician indicator

of lameness and gait abnormalities and also self-assessed difficulties in walking ten steps in

NHANES and present a range of estimates. These two measures are more comparable to the

judgements of the Union Army examining surgeons, who noted lameness and gait abnormalities

and observed difficulties in walking in the examining room but made no judgement about difficulty

in walking a quarter of a mile. The physician indicator of difficulty in walking a quarter of a

mile yields a very low percentage estimate for men age 50-64, but is somewhat more comparable

to the lameness and gait abnormality measure for men age 60-74. I use the physician indicator

of difficulty in bending in NHANES rather than self-assessed difficulty in bending, crouching,

and stooping because the physician indicator of difficulty in bending is more comparable to both

the measure in the Union Army sample and to the measure in NHIS (both of which were based

on difficulty in bending only). The self-evaluated and physician evaluated measures of difficulty

in bending in NHANES yield very similar numbers for men age 50-64, but for men age 60-74

the physician evaluated measure suggests a higher rate of disability for 60-74 year olds than the

self-evaluated measure.

          Table 1 shows that although functional disability declined substantially over the course of

the twentieth century, the decline was sharper in recent decades. Among men age 50-64 physician


                                                 9
assessed difficulty in walking and in bending and paralysis declined by 0.8 to 0.9 percent per

year from 1900 to 1991 (the midpoint of NHANES). During these same years blindness in at

least one eye and deafness in at least one ear declined by 0.6 percent per year. Among men

age 60-74 the declines in difficulty in walking and in bending and in paralysis were 0.7 to 0.8

percent per year between 1910 and 1991. In this time span blindness in at least one eye and

deafness in at least one ear declined by 0.2 to 0.3 percent per year. Among both age groups a

comparison of difficulty in walking in the Union Army sample with self-assessed difficulty in

walking in NHANES implies that the annual rate of decline was 0.6 percent. In contrast between

1978 and 1991 (using NHANES) or 1994 (using NHIS) declines among men age 50-64 were on

the order of 2.8 to 3.8 percent per year in difficulty in bending, 1.0 to 2.0 percent per year in

difficulty in walking, and 2.4 percent per year in paralysis. The average decline between 1910

and 1991 (0.6 percent per year) is lower than the 0.5 to 1.0 percent per year observed by Cutler

and Richardson (1997) between 1980 to 1990, the 0.9 to 2.3 percent per year found by Freedman

and Martin (1998) between 1984 and 1993, the 0.9 percent per year observed by Crimmins, Saito,

and Reynolds (1997) between 1982 and 1993, and the yearly 1.1 percent and 1.5 percent between

1982 and 1989 and 1989 and 1994, respectively, found by Manton, Corder, and Stallard (1997a).5

one eye, and deafness in at least one ear) can be related to chronic conditions through probit


    5
      There may be cycles in health since the 1970s. Although clinician reports document continuous improvements
in health since the 1970s (Waidmann, Bound, and Schoebaum 1995), self-reported health declined during the 1970s
(Chirikos 1986; Colvez and Blanchet 1981; Crimmins 1990; Poterba and Summers 1987; Verbrugge 1984).

where D is an indicator variable that is equal to one if an individual had a specific functional

disability, the matrix X includes dummy variables for specific chronic conditions, a dummy

variable for whether a veteran had ever been wounded in the war (for the UA sample specification),

a dummy variable indicating whether an individual was an amputee (unavailable in the NHIS

specification), and age, and U is an error term. Because specific chronic conditions and functional

disability for men in 1900 and 1910 are known only for those with a surgeons’ exam, the

Union Army sample is restricted to men with a surgeons’ exam. Two different specifications

are used for the Union Army sample. In the first specification the dummy variables for specific

chronic conditions are dummies for adventitious sounds, decreased breath sounds, back problems,

joint problems, murmurs, congestive heart failure, stroke, irregular pulse, and cataracts. This

specification contains chronic conditions that can be compared with those found in NHANES. The

second specification uses chronic condition dummies for murmurs, varicose veins, hemorrhoids,

poor circulation, arteriosclerosis, and tachycardia. This specification can be compared with that

used for NHIS.6

            Declines in functional disability can be decomposed into the proportions attributable

to the increased efficacy of medical care and to reduced chronic disease rates. The difference in

     Althought the assumption in this paper is that a condition that leads to greater functional disability is worse, some
arrythmias may cause few or no symptoms but are associated with an adverse prognosis whereas other arrythmias,
although symptomatic, are benign.

functional disability between the Union Army sample and NHANES and NHIS can be written as


             DUA , DNHANES          =   [XUA     , XNHANES UA] +

                                        [UUA , UNHIS ] ;                                           (5)


where for each equation the first term in square brackets represents the difference attributable

to changes in chronic disease rates (the X’s), the second term in square brackets represents the

differences due to changes in functional form (the s), and the third term in square brackets the

differences due to unobservables (the U’s). These unobservables include uncontrolled disease

states, differences in diagnostic capabilities, and nutritional and environmental changes. Changes

in functional form will in turn depend upon the increased efficacy of medical care, definitional

differences in chronic conditions, differences in the severity of chronic conditions, and changes

in frailty. The change attributable to the s, however, represents an upper bound estimate of the

effect of medical care on disability under the assumption that there is no omitted variable bias.

Predicted values for the Union Army sample are calculated by setting whether a veteran was ever

wounded during the war or was an amputee equal to 0 so that the terms in brackets will reflect

differences attributable either to differences in chronic disease rates or to differences in functional

form.

          The fall in chronic disease rates can in turn be decomposed into the decline attributable to

public health measures (reduced infectious disease rates); that attributable to occupational shifts

from manual to white collar work; and an unexplained portion (due to unobserved infectious


                                                  12
disease or occupational hazards, improvements in nutritional intake during the growing years,

the decreased use of wood smoke and salt as preservatives, better health habits, and preventive

medicine, among other factors). I begin by estimating probit regressions of the form


                                        C   =   X    +U                                         (6)


for the Union Army sample, where C is an indicator variable for whether an individual had a

specific chronic condition (adventitious sounds, decreased breath sounds, back problems, joint

problems, murmurs, congestive heart failure, irregular pulse, varicose veins, hemorrhoids, poor

circulation, arteriosclerosis, and tachycardia). The matrix X includes dummies for whether a

veteran was ever wounded in the war, ever discharged for disability, or was ever a POW; dummy

variables indicating whether a veteran ever had specific illnesses while in the army (cholera, di-

arrhea, malaria, respiratory problems, measles, smallpox, tuberculosis, typhoid, scurvy, rheuma-

tism, stomach problems, or syphilis); dummy variables indicating occupational class circa 1900

or 1910 (farmer, professional or proprietor I, professional or proprietor II, artisan, laborer I,

laborer II); dummy variables indicating occupational class at enlistment (farmer, professional or

proprietor, artisan, laborer, none/unknown); dummy variables indicating whether the examining

surgeons ever noted that an individual had typhoid, malaria, or another infectious disease or fever

either while in the army or later in life; dummy variables for size of city of enlistment; and age.

The vector U is an error term. Regressions are estimated separately for men age 50 to 64 in 1900

and men age 60 to 74 in 1910. Regressions are not estimated for stroke or cataracts because too

many of the independent variables were perfect predictors of the dependent variable.

          I investigate the role of reduced infectious disease rates and of occupational shifts in

the decline in functional disability among older men from the early 1900s to the 1990s by using

predicted values for chronic disease rates derived from Equation 6 together with the regressions



                                                    13
relating functional disability in the Union Army sample to chronic disease (Equation 1). I first

use the chronic disease probit regressions to obtain two different sets of predictions of chronic

disease rates. To obtain the first set of predictions, I set all illnesses while in the army equal to

0 and I set the dummy variables for whether the examining surgeons noted typhoid, malaria, or

another infectious disease or fever equal to 0. Because men in NHANES probably did experience

infectious disease when they were young, this procedure will lead me to overestimate the impact

of public health measures on chronic disease rates. I will underestimate the impact of public

health measures on chronic disease rates because I cannot observe infectious disease experience

prior to military service and between military service and the first surgeons’ exam. To obtain

the second set of predictions, I set the values of the occupational variables for 1900/1910 equal

to their values in 1990 and the values of occupation at enlistment variables equal to their 1940

variables. I then use the predicted values of specific chronic conditions to obtain predictions of

functional disability.



5 Chronic Disease Trends

Before decomposing the decline in disability into the fractions attributable to medical innovations

and to reduced chronic disease rates, I first establish the trend in chronic disease rates and discuss

diagnoses. Table 2 shows that chronic disease rates were high among men age 50-64 in 1900

and among men age 60-74 ten years later. It also shows point prevalence rates and chronic

disease rates for white men in the same age groups for ever diagnosed conditions in NHANES

and prevalence rates for conditions an individual had in the last 12 months in NHIS. Note that the

prevalence of most conditions has declined sharply. The prevalence of decreased breath sounds

declined by about 0.6 percent per annum and that of adventitious sounds by about 0.9 to 1.1

percent per year. The annual rate of decline for back problems was 0.2 to 0.4 percent and for


                                                 14
joint problems 0.4 to 0.5 percent. The high prevalence of joint and back problems observed in

1900 and 1910 are consistent with analyses of skeletal remains from the American frontier which

report a high prevalence of degenerative joint disease (osteoarthritis), nonarthritic joint changes

resulting from habitual postures, and fractures arising from traumas (e.g. Larsen et al. 1995).

              The largest declines in prevalence rates are observed in heart and circulatory conditions.

The prevalence of heart murmurs, irregular pulse, and tachycardia declined by 0.9 to 1.0 percent per

year from the beginning of the century to the beginning of the 1990s. The prevalence of varicose

veins and poor circulation declined by 0.7 to 0.9 percent per annum and that of hemorrhoids by

0.8 to 1.0 percent. Some of this decline may reflect the more careful examinations of surgeons

accustomed to direct observation as well as to looser definitions of murmurs, irregular pulse, or

tachycardia. However, the high prevalence rates for irregular pulse, tachycardia, poor circulation,

and varicose veins are consistent with the high prevalence rate of valvular heart disease (39 percent

among men age 60-74 in 1910).7

              The time trend in other conditions over the course of the twentieth century is harder to

pinpoint. The prevalence of cataracts declined among men age 50 to 64 but rose among those

age 60 to 74. Examining surgeons may have been more likely to note the final condition (loss of

vision) than the underlying cause. The same may be true for stroke. Furthermore, a much smaller

percentage of stroke victims survived before the ability to maintain adequate oxygen, nutritional,

and fluid intake after the initial stroke and the availability of anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs

to prevent subsequent strokes. Stroke was one of the primary causes of death in the past. Among

Union Army veterans, 11 percent of men who were age 50-64 in 1900 died of cerebrovascular

disease.8 Stroke today is commonly associated with atherosclerosis or hypertension. Rates of

pulse or tachycardia.

       The other major killers were heart disease (25 percent) and urinary problems (13 percent). Cause of death rates

Note. UA=Union Army, NHANES=National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, NHIS=National

in the NHIS if the person had the condition in the last 12 months. A self-reported chronic condition is noted
in NHANES if it was ever diagnosed. Symptoms and signs were noted in physician examinations. In UA a
chronic condition is noted if it was ever mentioned in an exam.




                                                    16
hypertension are high in recent data (at least 36 percent among men age 60-74). We do not know

rates of hypertension in the past because examining surgeons lacked the technology to diagnose

hypertension in Union Army veterans.

           The increasing specificity of diagnoses may make the time trend of certain cardiac and

circulatory conditions hard to pinpoint. Arteriosclerosis was lower among Union Army veterans

age 50 to 64 in 1900 than among men of the same age in 1994, but by 1910 rates were higher among

Union Army veterans. Modern methods of diagnosing atherosclerosis are quite different. The

examining surgeons’ use of hard arteries as a detection criterion provides evidence of peripheral

arteriosclerosis which may be evidence of either atherosclerosis (cholesterol and fatty plaques in

the blood) or of such other disease states as diabetes mellitus or systemic or local inflammation.

Prevalence rates of atherosclerosis may be relatively lower in the NHIS than in the Union Army

data set because modern diagnoses are more specific. But, they might also be relatively higher

because of the increased detection of atherosclerosis. Defining congestive heart failure using

edema, cyanosis, and dyspnea as the diagnostic criteria suggests that the prevalence of congestive

heart failure increased among men age 50 to 64 but fell by 0.3 percent per annum among men

age 60 to 74. A more precise diagnosis of congestive heart failure which might include not only

edema, cyanosis, and dyspnea, but also cardiomegaly and exclude co-existing conditions and

asthma lowers the prevalence rates of congestive heart failure and implies that rates of congestive

heart failure may have risen even among men age 60 to 74.

           Cumulative prevalence rates calculated from the Union Army sample are not strictly

comparable to the point prevalence rates estimated from NHANES both because a condition

would be more likely to be noticed in multiple exams and because men would be more likely to

develop a condition between the time of the last exam and either 1900 or 1910. However, if the


were calculated excluding men who died during the influenza epidemic.



                                                      17
latter is true then prevalence rates in the Union Army sample will be underestimated, but even

if the former were true, it seems unlikely that such a large decline in prevalence rates could be

explained by definitional biases alone.



6 Medical Care and Functional Disability

Tables 3 and 4 show that in the past chronic conditions had a larger impact on difficulty in walking

or in bending. Adventitious sounds were significant predictors of both difficulty in walking and

in bending among men 60-74 in the Union Army sample but not in NHANES. Irregular pulse

and varicose veins were also more likely to be significant predictors of difficulty in walking and

in bending in the Union Army data than in NHANES or NHIS. Congestive heart failure was a

significant predictor of difficulty in walking and in bending in the Union Army sample and of

self-assessed difficulty in walking in NHANES, but not of difficulty in bending. Murmurs were

significant predictors of difficulty in walking and in bending when the second specification is

used in the Union Army data (but not when the first specification is used) and were not significant

predictors in either NHANES or NHIS. Arteriosclerosis was a significant predictor of difficulty

in walking in both the Union Army data and in NHANES but was a significant predictor of

difficulty in bending only in the Union Army data. Tachycardia was a significant predictor of

difficulty in walking and in bending among men 50-64 only in the Union Army data (though

the point estimates are substantial in NHIS) and was a significant predictor both of difficulty

in walking and in bending among men age 60 to 74 in the Union Army sample and NHIS.

Poor circulation affected mainly difficulty in walking in the Union Army data and in NHIS,

with larger point estimates in the NHIS. The results for stroke are mixed but suggest that stroke

was a significant predictor both in the Union Army data and in NHANES. Back problems were

significant predictors of these functional disabilities in the Union Army data but in NHANES were


                                                18
only significant predictors of self-assessed difficulty in walking. Joint problems are consistently

significant predictors of difficulty in walking and in bending both in the Union Army data and in

NHANES; the point estimate is larger in the Union Army data.

          Differences in the etiology of heart and circulatory conditions may explain why these

conditions tended to predict difficulty in walking and in bending in the Union Army data, but

generally only difficulty in walking in the more recent data. As will be shown later, rheumatic fever

and rheumatic athropathies while in the army predicted heart and circulatory conditions at older

ages. Heart and circulatory conditions may therefore have been accompanied by athropathies

resulting from rheumatic fever. Indeed, the correlation between heart and circulatory problems

was very high. More than 80 percent of men who had arterosclerosis or congestive heart failure

in 1900 also had joint problems. Seventy percent of men with murmurs or tachycardia in 1900

also had joint problems.

          In the case of paralysis and blindness, the main predictors in the Union Army data and

in NHANES were similar (stroke and cataracts), but the point estimates were larger in the Union

Army data (see Table 5). Results for deafness are not presented because in neither the Union

Army data nor in NHANES was any of the chronic conditions a significant predictor. However,

in 1900 a surgeons’ report of an infectious disease other than malaria or typhoid was a significant

predictor of deafness.

          Using the regression results presented in Tables 3, 4, and 5 to decompose changes

in functional disability between the Union Army data and NHANES into the fractions due to

reduced chronic disease rates and to innovations in medical care shows that changes in functional

form (and therefore innovations in medical care) are more important than changes in disease rates

(see Table 6). Among men age 50 to 64 the increased efficacy of medical care may account for

11 to 43 percent of the decline in difficulty in walking observed between the Union Army data

and NHANES, 41 percent of the decline in difficulty in bending, 61 percent of the decline in

  Note. UA=Union Army, NHANES=National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, NHIS=National
  Health Interview Survey, 1994 and 1995. The first NHANES difficulty in walking specification uses physi-
  cian evaluated gait abnormalities and the second uses self-assessed difficulty in walking. Coefficients are
  derivatives from a probit regression in which the dependent variable was whether the individual had difficulty
  in walking or difficulty in bending and where additional independent variables included age and dummy
  variables indicating whether the Union Army veteran had ever been wounded in the war, whether the individ-
  ual was an amputee, or whether the individual ever had cataracts. In specification 2, hemorrhoids perfectly
  predicted a 0 outcome for difficulty in bending. Derivates represent discrete changes from 0 to 1. The symbols
  z, y, and  represent significance at the 1 percent, 5 percent, and 10 percent level, respectively.

  Note. UA=Union Army, NHANES=National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, NHIS=National
  Health Interview Survey Coefficients are derivatives from a probit regression in which the dependent variable
  was whether the individual had paralysis, blindness in at least one eye, or deafness in at least one year.
  Independent variables in all regressions included age and dummy variables indicating whether the Union Army
  veteran has ever been wounded in the war and whether the individual was an amputee, and dummy variables
  for adventitious sounds, decreased breath sounds, back problems, joint problems, murmurs, arrhymias,
  congestive heart failure, stroke, and cataracts. Only coefficients that were statistically significant in at least
  one regression are presented. Decreased breath sounds perfectly predicted paralysis in NHANES. Derivates
  represent discrete changes from 0 to 1. The symbols z, y, and  represent significance at the 1 percent, 5
  percent, and 10 percent level, respectively.           22
paralysis, and 23 percent of the decline in blindness. The figures attributable to reduced chronic

disease rates are 21 to 26 percent, 40 percent, 4 percent, and 36 percent, respectively. Among

men age 60 to 74 changes in chronic disease rates are more important than changes in functional

forms. Nine to 28 percent of the difference in difficulty in walking is explained by changes in

the s and 34 to 47 percent by changes in chronic disease rates. Fifty-one percent of difficulty

in bending is explained by changes in chronic disease rates and 33 percent by changes in the s.

Sixty-nine percent of the decline in paralysis is explained by changes in the s and more than all

of the decline in blindness. Averaging over both age groups and over 5 measures of functional

disability (including deafness) implies that 28 to 42 percent of the decline in functional disability

can be explained by improved medical care.9 Averaging over difficulty in walking and in bending

alone, the increased efficacy of medical care explains at most 24 to 41 percent of the decline in

functional disablity in these two measures. Another 37 percent was explained by reduced chronic

disease rates and the remaining 22 to 39 percent was unexplained.

              The increased efficacy of medical care also explains a substantial fraction of the dif-

ferences in functional disability between the Union Army sample and NHIS. Improved medical

care may explain up to 57 percent of the decline in difficulty in bending between the Union Army

data and NHIS and reduced chronic disease rates only 22 percent of the decline. The increased

efficacy of medical care accounts for a smaller fraction of the decline in difficulty in walking

between the Union Army and NHIS (at most 26 percent); lower chronic disease rates account for

25 percent of the decline. On average, innovations in medical care explain up to 42 percent of the

decline in functional disability between the Union Army data and NHIS as measured by difficulty

in walking and in bending. Reduced chronic disease explain 24 percent of the decline, with the

remaining 34 percent unexplained.


   9
       I assume that the increased efficacy of medical care explains 0 percent of the decline in deafness.

  wounded in the war was set equal to 0, that of the dummy variable indicator for whether the veteran was
  an amputee was set equal to the NHANES value, and age was set equal to the median age in the NHANES
  sample. Predicted disability in the Union Army sample is based upon men with a surgeons’ exam only.

7 Disease, Occupation, and Disability

The decline in functional disability between the Union Army sample and NHANES and NHIS

can be further decomposed into the proportions attributable to reduced infectious disease rates

and to occupational shifts by decomposing the change in chronic conditions (the X’s) into these

two factors. I first relate chronic conditions in the Union Army data to illnesses during wartime

service, infectious disease reported by the examining surgeons, occupational group at enlistment,

and occupational class circa 1900 or 1910 using probit regressions and obtain predicted values

under the assumptions that infectious disease rates were zero and that the occupational distribution

resembled the recent one. I then use the predicted values of chronic disease rates obtained from

these probits together with the regressions from section 6 for the Union Army sample to predict

functional disability. Selected derivatives from the probit regressions relating chronic disease to

infectious disease and to occupation are shown in Tables 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12.

           Table 7 shows that both illnesses and occupation are important predictors of later life

respiratory problems. Respiratory problems, measles, smallpox, and tuberculosis while in the

army were large and significant predictors of adventitious sounds and decreased breath sounds at

age 50 to 64 and 60 to 74. Typhoid fever was a strong predictor of both adventitious sounds and

decreased breath sounds at age 50 to 64. Malaria was a significant predictor at all ages, as was

other infectious/fever. A manual occupation at enlistment, many of which included exposure to

dust (both organic and inorganic), fumes, or gases, was a predictor of adventitious sounds but not

of decreased breath sound.10

           The relations between infectious disease and respiratory distress observed in Table 7

are consistent with the medical literature. Tuberculosis may lead to respiratory abnormalities.


  10
    Laborers I were significantly less likely to have adventitous sounds in 1900, but this results was only true for
watchmen and to a lesser extent drivers. These men were in occupations with little exposure to either occupational
hazards or to individuals who might be disease carriers.

Among typhoid patients today, one third of them also suffer from cough, suggesting that typhoid

fever may be a likely candidate for respiratory distress problems later in life (Stein 1990). The

same may be true for malaria which is sometimes associated with pulmonary disease as the result

of a systemic inflammatory response (Kemper 1997). Among Civil War soldiers measles was

followed by such complications as chronic bronchitis, pneumonia, and pleurisy (Cliff, Haggett,

and Smallman-Raynor 1993: 105) and these may have had an independent effect on respiratory

function. Measles could also have exerted a direct effect. Measles bronchopneumonia results in

bronchiolar obstruction, airways distension, and a thickening of the peri-bronchial walls (Jean et al.

1981). Pneumonia in the nineteenth and early twentieth century may also have had lasting effects;

follow-ups of disadvantaged children in South Africa revealed that lung function abnormalities

persisted years after the contraction of pneumonia (Wesley 1991).

          Illnesses and occupation also played a role in later life musculoskeletal problems (see

Table 8). Rheumatism while in the army and malaria or another infectious disease or fever as noted

by an examining surgeon were important predictors of both back and joint problems. Rheumatism

while in the army may be indicative of either an underlying chronic condition, traumatic arthritis,

or of a viral infection accompanied by rheumatic symptoms. Reports submitted by camp doctors

to the Surgeon General suggest that 40 percent of all cases of rheumatism were acute and caused

mainly by rheumatic fever (Bollet 1991). Musculoskeletal symptoms are common with many

viral infections, including malaria, and could conceivably lead to permanent joint damage. The

other main predictors of musculoskeletal problems were manual occupations, which in 1900 and

in 1910 were only partially mechanized.

          Infectious disease is an important predictor of cardiac and circulatory problems in

later life (see Table 9, 10, 11, 12). Rheumatism while in the army was a large and significant

predictor of murmurs, congestive heart failure, irregular pulse, and tachycardia at all ages and of

arteriosclerosis at ages 60-74. Diarrhea and stomach problems while in the army were predictors of


                                                 32
hemorrhoids. A white collar occupation was a positive predictor of hemorrhoids. Malaria as noted

by an examining surgeon was a predictor of murmurs, irregular pulse, tachycardia, arteriosclerosis,

hemorrhoids, and poor circulation. Typhoid fever either as noted by the examining surgeons or

in the army was a predictor of murmurs and irregular pulse at all ages and of arteriosclerosis,

varicose veins, and poor circulation among men 50-64. Other fever and infectious disease was

a predictor of murmurs, irregular pulse, and tachycardia among men in all age groups and of

varicose veins among men 50-64. Laborers I were at significantly lower risk of tachycardia and

arteriosclerosis, but it was only those in the more physically demanding occupations, suggesting

that this result may be due to selection.

          The relationship between infectious disease and murmurs, irregular pulse, tachycardia,

and congestive heart failure should come as no surprise. Acute rheumatic fever results in damage

to heart valves which in turn could manifest itself as murmurs, irregular pulse, tachycardia, and

congestive heart failure. Wilson et al. (1998) find that among Civil War veterans valvular heart

disease preceeded congestive heart failure 60 percent of the time. Electrocardiogram assessments

of typhoid fever patients show cardiac involvement (Khosla 1981; Olowu and Taino 1990).

Cardiac involvement is also possible with malaria, resulting either from malarial changes in the

myocardium or myocardiopathy arising from malarial chronic anemia (Charles and Bertrand

1982).

          The etiology of hemorrhoids and atherosclerosis is still controversial. There is, how-

ever, evidence that is consistent with the findings from the Union Army data. Diarrheal diseases

(including ulcerative colitis, noninfectious gastroenteritis, and functional diarrhea) have been

identified as pathogenic risk factors for hemorrhoids (Johanson 1997). In recent data hemor-

rhoids is also positively correlated with higher socioeconomic status (Johanson and Sonnenberg

1990). Infectious disease and atherosclerosis may be linked either through chlamydia pneumo-

niae infections, through infection induced changes in lipid metabolism, or through damage and


                                                33
inflammation in the vascular endothelium caused by infections in the presence of hypercholes-

terolemia (see reviews by Lindholt et al. 1999; Valtonen 1991; Wong, Gallagher, and Ward 1999).

Because atherosclerosis is a form of arteriosclerosis, the latter two channels might explain the

link between typhoid and malaria and arteriosclerosis in the Union Army data.

           Table 13 summarizes the relative impact of infectious disease and of occupation on

chronic disease rates by comparing actual disease rates with two different predicted values, one

of which is calculated under the assumption that there is no exposure to infectious disease and

the second of which is calculated using the modern occupational distribution. Averaging within

respiratory, musculoskeletal, and heart and circulatory conditions, Table 13 suggests that declines

in infectious disease played a more important role than occupational shifts in explaining the

decline in respiratory and heart and circulatory problems but that occupational shifts played a

more important role in explaining the decline in musculoskeletal problems.11 I find that the 23

percent of the decline in respiratory disorders between 1900/1910 and NHANES/NHIS could

be explained by reduced infectious disease rates and 11 percent by occupational shifts; 17

percent of the decline in musculoskeletal conditions by reduced infectious disease rates and 21

percent by occupational shifts; 17 percent of the decline in reduced infectious disease rates and

7 percent in occupational shifts. On average, 19 percent of the decline in chronic disease rates

can be accounted for by reduced infectious disease rates and 13 percent by occupational shifts. 12

Because I cannot observe all bouts of infectious disease and because I do not account for reduced

job hazards within occupation group, these figures probably underestimate the importance of

    Costa (forthcoming) finds that occupational shifts played a larger role in reductions in chronic disease rates
than reduced exposure to infectious disease. However, note that this conclusion is specific to the chronic conditions
examined.
  12
     I assume assumes that the percentage decline in specific chronic disease rates due to reduced infectious disease
rates and occupational shifts was the same overall as for men with a surgeons’ exam. I average over both age groups
and within disease groups.

reduced infectious disease rates and occupational hazards in lowering chronic disease rates.

          Table 14 summarizes the relative impact of infectious disease and occupation on func-

tional disability. (Results for paralysis and blindness are not presented because change in func-

tional form, not changes in prevalence rates were more important determinants of declines in

these measures of functional disability.) Because Table 14 cannot account for unobserved infec-

tious disease episodes or occupational hazards, it probably underestimates the role of reduced

infectious disease rates and occupational risks in lowering functional disability. On average,

Table 14 shows that 9 percent of the decline in difficulty in walking and in bending between

the Union Army data and NHANES is accounted for by reduced infectious disease rates and 7

percent by occupational shifts. These figures are probably underestimates because of unobserved

infectious disease episodes and reduced job risk within occupation group. Occupational shifts

explain roughly 9 percent of the decline in difficulty in walking and reduced infectious disease

rates roughly 8 percent. Occupational shifts account for 8 percent of the decline in difficulty in

bending between 1910 and NHANES and lower infectious disease rates for 7 percent. Between

1900 and NHANES occupational shifts account for only 2 percent of the decline in difficulty

in bending and reductions in infectious disease for 12 percent. Table 14 also shows the relative

importance of occupational shifts and infectious disease reductions in accounting for differences

between the Union Army sample and NHIS. Because the independent disease variables in the

NHIS specification did not include musculoskeletal conditions, infectious disease plays a more

important role in disability declines than occupational shifts.

This paper has shown that functional disability as measured by difficulty in walking, difficulty

in bending, paralysis, blindness in at least one eye, and deafness in at least one ear has fallen at

an average rate of 0.6 percent per year among men age 50 to 64 and age 60 to 74 from the early

twentieth century to the early 1990s. This rate of decline is not as pronounced as that in the 1980s

and early 1990s (Crimmins, Saito, and Reynolds 1997; Cutler and Richardson 1997; Freedman

and Martin 1998; Manton, Corder, and Stallard 1997a), suggesting that a large proportion of the

decline in disablity at older ages has occurred only recently.

difficulty in walking and in bending from the early 1900s to the early 1990s to the increased

efficacy of medical care and 37 percent to reduced chronic disease rates. The remaining 22 to 39

percent was unexplained. Of the 37 percent atttributable to reduced chronic disease rates, 9 percent

could be accounted for by reduced infectious disease rates and 7 percent by occupational shifts

away from manual labor and to white collar jobs. The remaining 21 percent was unexplained.

The sizable proportion attributable to medical care is consistent with the larger improvements

in functional disability experienced by recent cohorts relative to past cohorts and suggests that

investments in medical care targetted at the elderly population have had substantial payoffs.

          This paper has also shown that chronic disease rates (as measured by respiratory dis-

orders, musculoskeletal problems, and heart and circulatory problems) among men age 50 to

64 and 60 to 74 fell by 0.7 percent per year between the early 1900s and the early 1990s, with

19 percent of the decline accounted for by reduced infectious disease rates, 13 percent by oc-

cupational shifts, and the remainder unexplained. Rheumatic fever, typhoid, malaria, and acute

respiratory infections were the major predictors of chronic conditions. These infectious diseases

were widespread in the United States in the nineteenth and early twentieth century and were

brought on by crowding, poor sanitation and unfiltered and unchlorinated water, and migration to

mosquito-producing wetlands (common in the Midwest). Public health measures, rising incomes,

swamp drainage, and the depopulation of rural areas may therefore have played a role in reduced

chronic disease rates. The 68 percent of the decline in chronic conditions that is unexplained


                                                38
may be accounted for by unobserved bouts of infectious disease, reduced job hazards within

occupation groups, improvements in nutritional intake during the growing years, the decreased

use of wood smoke and salt as food preservatives, or improved knowledge of health habits and of

preventive medicine.

          Are functional disability and chronic disease rates likely to continue to decline? Be-

cause infectious disease mortality declined throughout the first half of the century and because of

the continuing shift to white collar work, the full benefit of these changes may not be seen until

2035 or later, when the baby boomers will begin to reach age 90. The importance of the increased

efficacy of medical care in explaining the long-run decline suggests that current investments in

biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, and surgical procedures will lead to continued declines in func-

tional disability. These innovations in medical care are likely to become increasingly important

predictors of declines in functional disability for those generations born after 1950 because by

then many public health and workplace safety investments were already firmly in place.

          This paper has emphasized the benefits of medical technology as a whole and not its

costs. But, as medical care becomes increasingly effective in reducing disability and if it becomes

the main determinant of disability declines, costs are likely to continue to rise. Although healthier

people require less medical care, innovations in medical care, while improving outcomes for ill

patients and improving them by more than per person spending on medical care has risen, have

historically increased costs (Cutler, McClellan, and Newhouse 1998; Cutler and Richardson 1997).

Cutler and Sheiner (forthcoming) predict that if technological change in medicine continues at its

historic rate, then even if disability rates continue to fall at their recent rates, medical costs will

still rise. The financing of medical care will continue to remain an issue well into the future.

Data Appendix

The Union Army data set is comprised of three different data sets: the military service and pension

data, the records of the examining surgeons, and the census data. The military service and pension

data and the census data are available from the Interuniversity Consortium on Political and Social

Science Research (ICPSR) as Aging of Veterans of the Union Army: Military, Pension, and

Medical Records, 1820-1940 (ICPSR 6837) and as Aging of Veterans of the Union Army: United

States Federal Census Records, 1850, 1860, 1900, 1910 (ICPSR 6836). The principal investigator

is Robert Fogel. The records of the examining surgeons are expected to be available at ICPSR

sometime in the year 2000. More information can be obtained from http://www.cpe.uchicago.edu.

          The records used in this paper represent a 58 percent sample of the final sample that

will be available. By 1900, approximately 10 percent of veterans were not collecting a pension,

either because their applications had been rejected or because they had not yet applied for a

pension. A surgeons’ exam is available for 90 percent of all men who had a pension in 1900.

Veterans had every incentive to undergo a complete medical examination because those with a

severe chronic condition, particularly if it could be traced to war-time experience, were eligible for

larger pensions. The surgeons rated the severity of specific conditions using detailed guidelines

provided by the Pension Bureau. Men for whom a surgeons’ exam is missing tended to be men

who entered at a late age and received a pension on the basis of age. In estimating prevalence rates

for the sample as a whole, I assume that these men did not have the specific functional disability

or chronic disease that I examine. In estimating the relationship between functional disability and

chronic conditions (Equation 1) I restrict the sample to men with a surgeons’ exam. In estimating

the relationship between chronic conditions and infectious disease and occupation (Equation 6) I

further restrict the sample to men found in either the 1900 or 1910 census.

          Men who entered the Union Army were probably healthier than the population as a



                                                 40
whole. An examination of men who were rejected for military serviced suggests that mean height

for the population was about 0.18 inches less than the mean of the recruits. Once men entered

the service, rural farmers, who were the better nourished segment of society, were more likely to

die because they lacked immunities to such common camp diseases as measles and typhoid (Lee

1997). However, men who survived the war (regardless of occupation) were only 0.02 inches

shorter than all recruits at enlistment, suggesting that the war itself induced minimal survivorship

bias.

          Although little is known about the experience of Union Army veterans from the time

they left the service until they appear on the pension rolls, several tests indicate that this sample

is representative of the general population in terms of wealth and circa 1900 in terms of mortality

experience. Among all adult males age 20 and over in the households to which recruits were

linked in the 1860 census, mean wealth was similar to that found in a random sample, suggesting

that military service was not very selective of men of lower socioeconomic status. In fact, 95

percent of the sample consisted of volunteers. Cohort life expectancies of veterans who reached

age 60 between 1901 and 1910 resemble cohort life expectancies found in genealogies and the

distribution of deaths from specific causes for all veterans who died between 1905 and 1915 does

not differ significantly from the distribution of expected number of deaths from those causes in

the death registration states in 1910 (Costa 1998: 197-212).
