The Mortality Effects of Retirement: Evidence from Social Security Eligibility at Age 62

                                         ABSTRACT

Social Security eligibility begins at age 62, and approximately one third of Americans
immediately claim at that age. We examine whether age 62 is associated with a discontinuous
change in aggregate mortality, a key measure of population health. Using mortality data that
covers the entire U.S. population and includes exact dates of birth and death, we document a
robust two percent increase in male mortality immediately after age 62. The change in female
mortality is smaller and imprecisely estimated. Additional analysis suggests that the increase in
male mortality is connected to retirement from the labor force and associated lifestyle changes.

1. Introduction
         We examine whether there is a change in aggregate mortality in the United States at age
62. This is when most Americans become eligible for Social Security Retirement Insurance
(“Social Security”), the primary source of income support for most seniors. Age 62 therefore rep-
resents one of the most important age-related policy thresholds in the U.S., and is associated with
major changes in work activity and lifestyle.
         Many Americans choose to claim Social Security as soon as possible. Figure 1 shows the
fraction of males and females between ages 59 and 67 who have ever claimed any type of Social
Security; some claiming occurs before age 62 because the data include those claiming Disability
Insurance or Survivors Insurance, the two Social Security programs available at earlier ages. 1
The most striking feature is the large increase in new claims at 62: approximately 31 percent of
all Americans begin claiming Social Security in their first month of eligibility, with males and
females doing so at similar rates.
         Using a regression discontinuity (RD) design, we document a discontinuous increase in
the age-mortality relationship at age 62. We use restricted-use versions of the National Center for
Health Statistics’ Multiple Cause of Death (MCOD) data, which are compiled from all death cer-
tificates in the U.S. and include exact dates of birth and death. We show that aggregate mortality
increases by 1.5 percent in the month individuals turn 62. This is driven by a two percent in-
crease in male mortality that is statistically significant, robust to a wide variety of specification
choices, and substantially greater than at nearby ages with known policy discontinuities (e.g.,
ages 60 and 65). Importantly, using earlier mortality data, we do not find any increase in mortali-
ty at age 62 when it was not the Social Security eligibility threshold. We estimate that there is a
one percent increase in mortality for females in the month they turn 62; however; it is neither
robust nor larger than mortality estimates at nearby ages.
         We interpret these increases in mortality at age 62 as the intent-to-treat effects of Social
Security eligibility for those on the margin of retiring once eligible for benefits. Our approach
follows other studies using age-based eligibility thresholds to understand the intent-to-treat im-
pact of policies on health outcomes (e.g., Card, Dobkin and Maestas, 2008, 2009; Carpenter and
Dobkin, 2009, 2015, 2017; Anderson, Dobkin and Gross, 2012, 2014). The focus on mortality

1
 Figure 1 uses data from a one percent extract of administrative data that covers the full population. Data are for the 1921-
1948 birth cohorts. Including all types of Social Security avoids mechanical jumps when claims are converted to Retire-
ment Insurance at the Full Retirement Age. We explain more about these data in the next section and in a data appendix.

means we cannot restrict our analysis to the subpopulation who will retire upon claiming Social
Security at age 62, as we do not know the claiming intentions of those who die before age 62. 2
         We examine the changes in retirement and related outcomes at age 62 in order to under-
stand what causes this increase in male mortality. Using Health and Retirement Study (HRS) da-
ta, we first show that the increase in claiming leads to an immediate increase in retirement: ap-
proximately one-tenth of males retire from the labor force in the month they turn 62. We then
document that the demographic subgroups with the largest increases in mortality at age 62 are
also the ones with the largest increases in retirement from work at that age. In contrast, the
change in mortality is only weakly related to Social Security receipt itself, or changes in health
insurance status and household income. If we scale the reduced-form mortality estimate for
males by their “first stage” change in male retirement at age 62, we estimate that induced retire-
ment increases their mortality by approximately 20 percent. We cannot rule out similarly sized
effects for females, as they experience only a small change in retirement at age 62. Moreover, we
cannot rule out that Social Security receipt, income and health insurance contribute to our re-
duced-form effects, although the evidence suggests their impact is likely to be minor.
         We contribute to the literature on retirement and health by documenting a clear link in the
U.S. between a widespread retirement incentive and an objective measure of health. Recent Eu-
ropean studies using mortality as an outcome have found mixed results: Hallberg, Johansson and
Josephson (2015) and Bloemen, Hochguertel and Zweerink (2017) find retirement reduces mor-
tality, Hernaes et al. (2013) find no mortality effects, and Kuhn et al. (2015) find higher mortality
after retirement. 3,4 Within the broader literature on how retirement affects health, the most con-
sistent relationship is that subjective health and wellbeing measures are improved by retirement.
However, many of these same studies find no effect of retirement on objective health outcomes
(e.g., Neuman, 2008; Coe and Zamarro, 2011). 5 Our study provides evidence that, for a large

2
  MCOD files have limited information, and no information on retirement intentions or outcomes. This type of limitation is
common in such studies: e.g., Card et al. (2009) face similar issues when examining if mortality changes with Medicare
eligibility at 65, as do Carpenter and Dobkin (2009) when examining if mortality changes with legal alcohol access at 21.
3
  Bloemen et al. (2017) find that early retirement decreased the mortality of Dutch public sector workers, while Hallberg et
al. (2015) find a similar result for Swedish military officers induced to retire early. Hernaes et al. (2013) find no mortality
effects from an early retirement scheme in Norway. Kuhn et al. (2015) examine the effects of unemployment insurance
extensions that enabled older blue collar workers in Austria to retire early, finding it led to higher mortality among males.
4
  A related study by Snyder and Evans (2006) examines how income affects mortality using the “Social Security Notch,”
which reduced payments to beneficiaries born after 1916. The authors find that the lower income led to lower mortality.
They argue that increased part-time work is the likely reason for this result, which is consistent with our findings.
5
  Prominent studies include Charles (2004), who uses HRS data and age discontinuities in incentives to find that retirement
increases subjective wellbeing, and Coe and Lindeboom (2008), who use the HRS and workers subject to “early retirement

                                                              3
group of workers in the U.S., retirement may have an immediate, negative relationship on an im-
portant and objective health outcome. Our findings also contribute to the broader literature on the
economic determinants of mortality (Cutler, Deaton and Lleras-Muney, 2006). 6
         It is important to note that the RD design allows us to identify only the immediate, con-
temporaneous effect of retiring on mortality. Economic theories commonly model health as a
stock variable that is both susceptible to sudden shocks and dependent on long-term investments
and depreciation (e.g., Grossman 1972; Scholz and Seshardi, 2013; Yogo, 2016). As such, there
may be different effects of retirement on health in the short run (driven mostly by shocks) and
the long run (affected by the combination of investments, depreciation, and shocks accruing over
time). Understanding both is important for optimal retirement policy design, and the former –
which our results speak to – may be quite different to the latter.
         Our estimates apply to those claiming Social Security upon reaching 62, who differ from
later claimants in terms of their socioeconomic and health characteristics. For example, those
claiming at 62 are more likely to report being in poor health and retiring due to health-related
reasons. They are more likely to report having worked in a job that required physical activity,
and less likely to have had a job involving stress much of the time (Gustman and Steinmeier,
2005; Li, Hurd and Loughran, 2008). This may limit the generalizability of our findings to the
rest of the population. However, age-62 claimants represent approximately one third of the U.S.
population and a higher fraction of Social-Security-covered workers, so understanding their im-
mediate health effects is important in its own right. Age-62 claimants are also the group who
would be most directly affected by any changes to the Early Eligibility Age (EEA) of 62, which
– unlike the Full Retirement Age (FRA) – has not been changed to increase labor force participa-
tion and improve the fiscal outlook of Social Security. If there are also negative mortality effects

windows,” finding no detrimental effects on physical health and a temporary increase in self-reported wellbeing. Other
studies using the HRS include Neuman (2008), who finds retirement improves subjective wellbeing and has no change on
objective outcomes; Dave et al. (2008), who rely on individual fixed effects to conclude that retirement negatively affects
mental and physical health; and Insler (2014), who uses retirement expectations as instruments and finds that some ail-
ments decrease with retirement. Studies using European data include Bound and Waidmann (2007), who use public pen-
sion rules to examine the effect of retirement on subjective and objective health measures using the English Longitudinal
Survey on Aging (ELSA). They find no effects, except some results that suggest that males experience a small and tempo-
rary improvement in physical health. Behncke (2012), using pension rules and similar ELSA data to find that retirement
increases the probability of being diagnosed with a chronic condition. Coe and Zamarro (2011) use cross-country data
from the Survey of Health Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) and variation in retirement rules; they estimate a
small positive effect of retirement on self-reported health. In reviewing these and other studies, Eibich (2014) notes that
“existing empirical evidence is inconclusive” and that “the mechanisms behind these effects remain unclear” (p. 1).
6
  Interest in mortality determinants is especially strong because the mortality rates of some demographic groups – such as
middle-aged white males – have been rising (Case and Deaton, 2015). Our paper does not directly address these findings,
but in both cases there is suggestive evidence that declining labor force participation may lead to higher mortality.

of retiring and claiming Social Security in the longer term, then a higher EEA may increase life
expectancy, although more research is needed to determine whether this is likely to be the case.
         The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide background about
Social Security and claiming at age 62. In Section 3, we describe the data and sample. In Section
4, we analyze the change in mortality upon reaching age 62. In Section 5, we examine the rea-
sons for the increase in mortality at age 62. We conclude in Section 6.
2. Age 62 and Social Security Eligibility
         Social Security is available to workers with ten or more years of covered employment. 7
Social Security claiming at age 62 was introduced for women in 1956 and men in 1961; claiming
previously began at age 65. Age 65 then became the FRA, the age at which workers would re-
ceive the full “Primary Insurance Amount” (PIA) due under the Social Security earnings-
payment formula. Benefits were reduced by 5/9 of one percent for each month before the FRA
that an individual began claiming Social Security, so that workers claiming in the month they
turn 62 received 80 percent of their PIA. Cohorts born after 1942 have a FRA of 66 and receive
75 percent of their PIA if they claim immediately upon reaching age 62. 8
         Social Security is also available to qualifying workers’ dependents and survivors. These
are most commonly a worker’s spouse, divorced spouse, or widow(er). 9 Dependents’ base level
of benefits is up to 50 percent of the worker’s PIA. Spouses (or former spouses) can receive So-
cial Security benefits at age 62, when they receive 70-75 percent of their PIA-based benefits (de-
pending on their FRA). Widow(er)s can receive benefits from age 60; again, there are reductions
for claiming early. For our identification strategy, it is important to emphasize that only the
claimant’s age matters for benefit collection, not the age of the person upon whose record the
benefit is being claimed. Therefore, there is no incentive to remain alive until age 62 so that
one’s spouse and/or dependents can collect benefits.
         Individuals can file an application for with the Social Security Administration (SSA) sev-
eral months before turning age 62, and become eligible for benefits either in the month they turn



7

  Starting with the 1938 cohort, the FRA increased in two month increments, so the 1938 cohort has a FRA of 65 and 2
months, the 1939 cohort has a FRA of 65 and 4 months, etc. There is now an early claiming penalty of 5/9 of one percent
per month for the first 36 months of early claiming and 5/12 of one percent for each additional month. There are also “De-
layed Retirement Credits” for delaying Social Security claiming up to age 70.
9
  Other dependents include children, adult children disabled before age 22, and parents who are reliant on the worker for
income support. These groups are more commonly dependents of Social Security Disability Insurance beneficiaries.

62 or the following month. 10 As shown in Figure 1, many people claim Social Security at the
first possible opportunity. These are population-level rates, so the rates among workers with suf-
ficient covered employment and their dependents are even higher. Men and women claim at sim-
ilar rates at age 62, although women are more likely to claim as dependents and have an average
monthly benefit that is 25 percent lower than male age-62 claimants (SSA, 2012).
         Social Security beneficiaries are not required to stop working, although they are subject
to a “Retirement Earnings Test” until they reach the FRA. It reduces benefits by one dollar for
every two dollars of earnings above a threshold, which is currently close to $17,000 per annum.
Even though beneficiaries later receive the benefits that are withheld, many beneficiaries appear
to view the Retirement Earnings Test as a tax and reduce their labor force participation as a re-
sult (Gelber, Jones and Sacks, 2013). Most individuals do substantially decrease their employ-
ment after claiming Social Security at age 62, and also report immediate changes in retirement
status, income and health insurance (Rust and Phelan, 1997; Gustman and Steinmeier, 2005; Li
et al., 2008). We examine those changes in Section 5.
         Payments to Social Security beneficiaries cease the month after death. Family members,
funeral homes and government agencies report deaths to SSA, and there are limited opportunities
to delay reporting. Dependents can receive a lump-sum death benefit of $255 if they live with the
beneficiary or receive benefits from the beneficiary’s record (SSA, 2012). Any change driven by
such incentives should be most pronounced for married decedents. (In Section 4.4, we show that
non-married males have a larger change in mortality when they reach 62 than married males.)
         Any change in mortality can be attributed to Social Security eligibility only if there are
no other concurrent policy rules that affect health. To our knowledge, no other federal programs
or pension policies have rules that change discontinuously at age 62. Private sector employers
have largely switched to defined contribution pensions that provide little incentive to retire at a
specific age (Dushi, Iams, and Lichtenstein, 2011). For the defined benefit programs used in the
public sector, pension eligibility is typically based on years of service (Friedberg, 2011). Alt-
hough there may be some state-level policies with specific rules at age 62 in Section 4.4, we
show our mortality estimates do not depend on a particular state or region.
3. Data and Sample Characteristics


10
  Individuals born on the 1st or 2nd of the month are eligible in the month they turn 62, while other individuals are eligible
in the month after they turn 62. See Olson (1999) and Evans and Moore (2011) for more details.

                                                              6
         We use restricted-use versions of the National Center for Health Statistics’ Multiple
Cause of Death (MCOD) files for 1979 to 2012. MCOD files are based on death certificates
compiled by state registries. They include decedents’ dates of birth and death; demographic in-
formation, including age, sex, marital status and education (since 1989); and cause and place of
death. Sex and race in these data closely match survey data (Sorlie, Rogot and Johnson, 1992),
while education levels are slightly higher than reported in other data (Sorlie and Johnson, 1996).
Cause of death is based on the International Classification of Disease (Versions 9 and 10).
         Dates of birth and death are reported to the exact day. There is no odd heaping in the dis-
tributions of these dates, suggesting that any patterns in mortality counts based on age at death
should not reflect reporting differences related to data collection. Such heaping in data is im-
portant to consider before implementing a RD design (Barreca, Lindo and Waddell, 2016).
         There may be a concern that the measurement of mortality in the MCOD files changes
with the receipt of Social Security, thereby introducing bias into our analysis. Two reasons sug-
gest this type of measurement error is not present in the MCOD data. First, the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention (CDC) regard MCOD data as having universal coverage because
state laws require death certificates for the disposition of bodies and certificates are needed for
legal purposes (e.g., estate settlement) (CDC, 1989). Second, the MCOD files are not derived
from SSA information; in fact, SSA pays states’ vital statistics bureaus – the source of MCOD
data – to provide it with death records in order to manage SSA program payments. 11
         In order to have sufficient bandwidth and the opportunity to conduct placebo tests at
nearby ages, we focus on individuals born between 1921 and 1948 (i.e., turning 62 between 1983
and 2010). In Table 1, we show the number and composition of deaths in this group at ages 61
and 62 for all decedents, and separately for males and females. There are 65,489 deaths per
month at age 61 and 70,727 deaths per month at age 62. Males account for approximately 60
percent of the deaths at both ages, well above their proportion of the population at these ages.
         To supplement our main analysis, we use four other datasets. We briefly describe them
here; more details are provided in a data appendix. First, we use the HRS to describe the charac-
teristics of older Americans and document retirement-related changes at age 62. The HRS is a


11
   SSA also receives death reports from other sources (e.g., family members, funeral homes). The Social Security Act stip-
ulates that SSA can only share its full mortality data with benefit-paying federal agencies (see 42 U.S.C. § 405(r)(3)).
There is no evidence that the Social Security Master Death File, the public file, is used by state vital statistics bureaus or
the NCHS. See Hill and Rosenwaike (2002) and the General Accountability Office (2013) for more information.

                                                              7
nationally representative panel survey of Americans aged 50 and older that contains information
on demographic characteristics, employment, retirement plans, income and health outcomes. We
use the RAND HRS File (Version N), a compilation that contains data from 1992 to 2012 on co-
horts born between 1924 and 1959 (Chien et al., 2014).
         Appendix Table A1 shows the summary statistics for HRS sample respondents aged 61
and 62. Apart from the disproportionate fraction of decedents who are male, the biggest differ-
ences between the composition of the HRS sample and the characteristics of MCOD decedents
reported in Table 1 are in terms of marital status and educational attainment. High school drop-
outs account for 17 percent of 61 and 62 year olds in the HRS sample, but close to 27 percent of
all deaths at ages 61 and 62. Non-married people represent 29 percent of 61 and 62 year olds in
the HRS sample, but make up 40 percent of those who die at ages 61 and 62. These differences
are in line with previous research showing that higher mortality at relatively young ages is corre-
lated with characteristics related to low socioeconomic status, including not completing high
school and not being married (Sickles and Taubman, 1997).
         We also use the Social Security Death Master File (SSDMF), a database of deaths report-
ed to SSA since 1962 that includes dates of birth and death. 12 The most common sources of this
information are relatives of deceased individuals, funeral directors, financial institutions and
postal authorities. The SSDMF provides incomplete coverage of deaths in the U.S., and the
probability a death is included may vary with Social Security eligibility (Hill and Rosenwaike,
2002; Government Accounting Office, 2013). This does create a potential bias in mortality
counts at age 62 due to measurement error. There are also a smaller number of deaths in the
SSDMF with dates of death from before 1962. 13 This is before men had an EEA of 62, so these
deaths should not be subject to systematic measurement error at age 62.
         There are two additional datasets. One is the one percent extract of SSA claiming data,
used to create Figure 1. The other is accelerometer data from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003-2006, a survey that measures the health of the civilian
population via interviews and physical examinations. See the data appendix for more details.

12
   Another possible source of mortality data is the Numident File. The Numident consists of the SSDMF data and adds
records from 33 state vital statistics agencies. However, the extra data from the vital statistics agencies is exactly what is
contained in the MCOD, except the MCOD has it for all 50 states and DC. In other words, the SSDMF is a subset of the
Numident, which is in turn a subset of the MCOD. Therefore, using the Numident, we would expect to find an increase in
mortality at age 62 that is somewhere between what we find using the SSDMF and what we find using the MCOD data.
13
   These are generally individuals whose Social Security accounts were active in 1962 (e.g., a deceased husband’s account
may be active because his wife receives benefits on the basis of it). About 95 percent of these earlier records are of males.

                                                              8
4. Assessing the Change in Mortality at Age 62
         To estimate the mortality effects due to Social Security eligibility, we use a RD design to
compare the number of deaths of individuals aged just older than 62 to slightly younger individ-
uals. In this context, the ideal experiment would be to randomly assign some workers to retire
and others to remain employed, and then compare the mortality of the two groups. Such an ex-
periment is infeasible, especially as large sample sizes are required to estimate mortality effects.
         We therefore use exogenous rules regarding Social Security eligibility to compare the
deaths of those newly eligible to those who are nearly eligible. 14 We follow other studies using
age-based RD designs by seeking to estimate the effect of an anticipated change in program eli-
gibility in an intent-to-treat framework. 15 Comparing deaths above and below age 62 will gener-
ate estimates of the average treatment effect of Social Security eligibility on mortality as long as
other factors affecting mortality do not change discontinuously when individuals turn 62. Since
the people whose decisions are most influenced by Social Security eligibility are different from
the broader population, our estimate is specific to that population. We estimate the immediate
intent-to-treat effect of Social Security eligibility on mortality.
4.1 Graphical Evidence
         We show the number of deaths for each month of age in Figure 2. We include counts for
12 months on each side of age 62 (i.e., ages 61 years, 0 months to 62 years, 11 months). Overall
mortality counts are shown in Panel A. There is a large increase in mortality in the month indi-
viduals turn 62, with 1,580 more deaths in the month after turning 62 than the month before (a
2.4 percent increase). By comparison, the next largest difference in month-on-month mortality is
less than one half of this magnitude. We also show lines estimated for each side of the age-62
cutoff using quadratic polynomials. These indicate a discontinuous increase in mortality at 62;
we formally test for such an increase in the next section. In the other panels of Figure 2, we show
that this increase in monthly mortality occurs at age 62 for both males (Panel B) and females
(Panel C), although there is a clearer and larger increase in mortality for males than females.



14
   We are not the first to consider using Social Security eligibility at age 62 for a RD design: Angrist and Pischke (2014)
open their RD chapter with three examples, including: “The Social Security Administration won’t pay you a penny in re-
tirement benefits until you’ve reached age 62” (p.147). Ayyagari (2016) also uses the age 62 threshold for Social Security
as an instrument to examine the link between retirement and smoking.

            It is possible that this change in mortality is related to having a birthday or generally be-
coming one year older. To check this, Appendix Figure A1 shows the same age-in-months mor-
tality counts in relation to ages 61 and 63. We are not aware of any important age-based policy
rules at these ages. There are no obvious changes in mortality at either of these ages, either for
the full sample or for separate subsamples of males and females.
4.2 Regression Estimates
            We implement several global parametric and local nonparametric RD specifications to
assess the results under different assumptions about the data generating process. The parametric
regressions contain polynomials that control for the underlying age-mortality relationship and a
dummy variable to estimate the mortality change at age 62. The basic form of the regression is:
                                     log(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑎𝑎 ) = 𝑓𝑓(𝑎𝑎) + 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃62𝑎𝑎 𝛽𝛽 + 𝜀𝜀𝑎𝑎       (1)
The dependent variable is the natural log of mortality counts for age at death a, so the change in
mortality is measured in percentage terms. We use monthly counts, which is the level of aggre-
gation suggested by RD tests of excess smoothing (Lee and Lemieux, 2010). The function 𝑓𝑓(𝑎𝑎)
represents the polynomials used to control for the age-mortality relationship. We separately use
quadratic, cubic and quartic polynomials, as there is a debate about the correct polynomial length
(Lee and Lemieux, 2010; Gelman and Imbens, 2014). The dummy variable 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃62𝑎𝑎 is equal to
one above age 62 and zero otherwise, and the coefficient β gives the percentage change in mor-
tality at age 62 (our coefficient of interest). We allow the relationship between age and mortality
to vary on either side of the discontinuity by interacting 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃62𝑎𝑎 with all of the polynomial
terms. The error term is 𝜀𝜀𝑎𝑎 . We use robust standard errors clustered on age of death.
            In column 1 of Table 2, we present the estimated change in mortality at age 62. Using a
bandwidth of 12 months, the point estimates for the different specifications are 1.35 percent
(quadratic), 1.97 percent (cubic) and 1.93 percent (quartic). All are statistically significant at the
one percent level. The underlying relationship between age and log mortality increases slightly
after age 62, although the relevant coefficients are not large or precisely estimated. 16
            We also use local nonparametric specifications to relax the functional form assumptions
and place more weight on observations near the cutoff. We use the local linear and quadratic
specifications of Calonico, Cattaneo and Titiunik (CCT) (2014a, 2014b), whose “data driven”
bandwidth selection procedure is based on minimizing the mean square error of the point esti-

16
     The full set of coefficients from the quadratic specification is presented in Appendix Table A2.

                                                                10
mate. We start with 24 months of data on either side of age 62, as policies that take effect at age
60 could separately affect mortality. We report estimates that use a triangular kernel, CCT’s pro-
cedures to correct for bias due to bandwidth choice, and plug-in residuals for standard error esti-
mation, which are equivalent to Huber-White robust standard errors in the parametric context.
       The results from these regressions are also presented in the first column of Table 2, to-
gether with the bandwidths used. The estimates are similar to the parametrically generated re-
sults, with point estimates of 1.42 percent (local linear) and 1.94 percent (local quadratic) that are
statistically significant at the one percent level. Across the five specifications, and in accord with
the visual evidence, we find a statistically significant increase in mortality at age 62.
       In Table 2, we also present estimates of the change in mortality in the month individuals
turn 62 separately for males (in column 2) and females (in column 3) using the three global par-
ametric and two local nonparametric specifications. For males, the estimated increase in mortali-
ty is between 1.85 and 2.43 percent and always statistically significant at the one percent level.
For females, the estimated increase in mortality is between 0.58 and 1.38 percent. All except the
quadratic estimate are statistically significant at the one percent level; the quadratic estimate of
0.58 percent is not statistically different from zero at conventional levels. The results are in line
with the visual evidence of a larger and clearer change in mortality for males than for females.
       We verify that the estimates are robust to additional regression controls and other choices
(Appendix Table A3). First, we show that the global parametric estimates are similar when year-
of-birth or month-of-death fixed effects are included. Second, we show that the estimates are
similar using daily or weekly mortality counts. Third, we present estimates where the cutoff is
defined by the precise Social Security eligibility rules. These rules grant individuals born on the
1st or the 2nd of the month eligibility in the month they turn 62, while others become eligible the
following month (Olson, 1999). Our estimates are qualitatively similar throughout.
       We next assess the robustness of the estimates to different bandwidths by using band-
widths of between six and 24 months. Having established that the results are generally similar
with and without higher-order terms, in this and following exercises we focus on the local linear
and global quadratic specifications. Appendix Figure A2 shows the estimates and 95 percent
confidence intervals from both of these specifications for the full sample, for males and for fe-
males. For the full sample and for males, the local linear and global quadratic estimates are be-
tween 1.5 and 2.4 percent and statistically significant for all bandwidth values. The results for


                                                  11
females are more sensitive to the choice of bandwidth. The estimated change in mortality de-
clines as the bandwidth increases and loses statistical significance at the five percent level at 11
months in the local linear regression and 12 months in the global quadratic regression. At larger
bandwidths, the estimates for females are smaller and imprecisely estimated.
         There could be a concern that the change in male mortality is spurious and equally sized
estimates could be found at nearby ages. We first deal with this via a permutation test based on
randomization inference. We generate “placebo” estimates at monthly intervals for 60 months
before and after age 62 (i.e., from age 57 to 67). Note that this range includes ages at which there
are policy eligibility thresholds that could affect mortality, such as ages 60 and 65. In Figure 3,
we compare the estimate for the month males turn 62 to the empirical cumulative distribution
functions of the placebo estimates using the local linear (Panel A) and global quadratic (Panel B)
specifications. Despite including estimates possibly not from true placebo locations, for both
specifications the largest estimate is for the month males turn 62. In contrast, as shown in Ap-
pendix Figure A3, our age-62 estimates for females are not distinct from other estimates: approx-
imately one quarter of the local linear estimates and one half of the global quadratic estimates are
larger in absolute value than the estimate for the month females turn 62. A second approach,
based on comparing overall model fit in the month individuals turn 62 to nearby ages, reinforces
that there is something distinct about the age-62 change in mortality for males, but not females. 17
         The estimated increase in male mortality is extremely robust. The results suggest there a
substantial number of “excess” deaths for males after age 62. For example, the 2.15 percent local
linear estimate translates into 10,746 additional male deaths in the 12 months after turning 62
and 22,029 additional male deaths in the 24 months after turning 62 (relative to a counterfactual
of no discontinuous change at age 62). These translate into averages of 384 and 787 extra deaths
per cohort, respectively.
         The results for females are smaller in magnitude and sensitive to bandwidth and specifi-
cation choice. There could be various reasons for this. First, as we show below, although men
and women have similar patterns of claiming Social Security at age 62, estimates of the changes
in women’s labor supply are much smaller and less precise than for men. Second, the effect we
estimate is local to those near the margin of death at age 62. The marginal relationship between

17
   We compare R-squared when the discontinuity is at age 62 to placebo locations. Using the global quadratic specification
and 12 months of data on each side of age 62, we show that the R-squared value is maximized at age 62 for males but not
for females (where it is fourth-largest in the 24-month window). The results are presented in Appendix Figure A4.

                                                           12
age and death differs by sex: many more men than women die at age 62, and the life expectancy
of women conditional on reaching 62 is much higher than for men (Arias, 2014). While this may
account for the differences across men and women, the imprecision of the female labor supply
estimates means that we cannot rule out a similar link between retirement and mortality for both
women and men. More generally, we hesitate to place too much weight on the results for wom-
en, or the differences between men and women, because the results for women are noisy and
therefore difficult to interpret. Henceforth, we focus on the increase in male mortality.
       Apart from varying the bandwidth over a range with no other policy discontinuities, it is
difficult to determine how “local” this effect is. In particular, some might wonder if the visual
evidence in Figure 2 suggests a dip in mortality just before age 62 and a corresponding increase
just after age 62. We conduct three additional exercises to assess this. First, we test whether the
underlying age-mortality relationship changes at age 62. In Appendix Table A2, which shows the
coefficients for the quadratic specification, we provide p-values from the joint hypothesis test
that the linear and quadratic terms interacted with the age-62 dummy are equal to zero. The p-
value is 0.65 for males, suggesting that the underlying mortality trend does not change at age 62.
       Second, we add dummy variables to the global quadratic regression to understand the ex-
tent to which the results are driven by observations close to age 62. If we add individual dummy
variables to the three months before reaching age 62 and the three months after, the coefficient
(standard error) is 0.0247 (0.0145). This is equivalent to a so-called “donut hole” RD where three
months on either side of the age 62 discontinuity are dropped. If we drop the observations in-
stead of use dummy variables, the coefficient (standard error) is 0.0247 (0.0126).
       Third, we use weekly counts and more dummy variables to provide finer information
about the changes in mortality close to age 62. We do find some evidence of an additional in-
crease in male mortality in the first week after turning 62. However, even with these additional
controls and using the quadratic, cubic or quartic specifications, the overall change in male mor-
tality at age 62 remains approximately two percent. (These results are shown in Appendix Table
A4.) In combination with the stability of the estimates to bandwidth choice, these results suggest
that the increase in male mortality persists for some time after males turn age 62.
4.3 Estimates and Placebo Tests using the Social Security Death Master File
       We now use the SSDMF, a file of deaths reported to SSA. As already discussed, the
SSDMF provides limited insight into how much mortality changes at age 62 because the proba-


                                                 13
bility a death is included may vary with Social Security eligibility. However, it is useful for two
reasons. First, the measurement bias favors finding an increase in mortality at age 62, so finding
no increase would raise some doubt about the analysis using the MCOD data. Second, and more
importantly, the SSDMF contains deaths from before men could claim Social Security at age 62.
Evidence that deaths in this sample increase at age 62 would suggest that the increase in mortali-
ty at age 62 is not related to Social Security and retirement.
         To assess whether there is an increase in mortality when Social Security eligibility occurs
at age 62, we use a sample of decedents born between 1930 and 1948. 18 Figure 4 shows the
number of deaths by age for the 12 months on each side of age 62 for all deaths (in Panel A) and
male deaths (in Panel B). Both show a large increase in mortality when individuals turn 62.
There is also a large increase in females’ mortality at 62, as shown in Appendix Figure A5.
         We estimate the changes in mortality at age 62 using RD specifications, focusing on the
estimates from the local linear regression with a CCT bandwidth and global quadratic regression
using a bandwidth of 12 months. Results are presented in Appendix Table A5. Column 1 shows
the results using all mortality counts. The estimated increases are 4.3 percent using the local lin-
ear regression and 4.7 percent using the global quadratic regression; both are statistically signifi-
cant at the one percent level. The results for males and females are shown in columns 2 and 3,
respectively. The respective local linear and global quadratic estimates are slightly higher for
males (5.5 and 5.0 percent, both p<0.01) than females (3.5 and 4.0 percent, both p<0.05).
         It is difficult to interpret the magnitudes of these estimates, as they likely combine chang-
es in underlying mortality and measurement differences that occur as individuals begin to receive
Social Security. Larger increases than in the main analysis and statistically significant increases
for females are consistent with the direction of the bias due to reporting differences. Importantly,
the results are not inconsistent with the previous analysis.
         We next use the SSDMF for placebo tests. First, we check whether the SSDMF has me-
chanical jumps in mortality related to birthdays by showing the changes in mortality at ages 61
and 63 in Panels A and B of Appendix Figure A6, respectively. There is no obvious change in




18
  Exact dates are generally not available for deaths that occurred before 1988, which prevents us from using the exact
same set of birth cohorts as in the MCOD analysis (i.e., 1921-1948). See the data appendix for more details.

                                                            14
mortality at either age. This is confirmed by the regression estimates, shown in columns 4 and 5
of Appendix Table A5. 19 These results are consistent with our results using the MCOD data.
          Second, we use deaths occurring before the male EEA was introduced in 1962. These are
generally from Social Security accounts that were active when the SSDMF data collection began
in 1962 (e.g., a widow claiming on her deceased husband’s earnings record). We use deaths oc-
curring between 1940 and 1961; approximately 95 percent are males. While this is a small and
selected sample of deaths over this period, there is no reason to expect selection to change at age
62. Day of death is not available, so age of death is based on month and year information.
          For this sample, the mortality counts around age 62 are shown in Panel C of Figure 4.
There is no visually apparent change in mortality at age 62. This is also the case for male mortal-
ity counts, which are shown in Panel D. The regression results for these samples are presented,
respectively, in columns 6 and 7 of Appendix Table A5. The coefficients are small and statisti-
cally insignificant at conventional levels, suggesting that there was no increase in mortality at
age 62 before it was the EEA. The absence of day-of-death information adds measurement error
to these placebo estimates: to assess the importance of this, we estimate regressions for the 1930-
1948 cohorts without using day of death. 20 We show these estimates in columns 8 and 9 of Ap-
pendix Table A5. For all deaths, the local linear and global quadratic estimates are 4.1 and 4.0
percent, respectively (both p<0.05). For male deaths, the respective estimates are 4.2 and 5.1
percent (both p<0.01). Estimates of the mortality change are slightly attenuated without day of
death, but we still detect statistically significant increases at age 62. In summary, these results
support the analysis using the MCOD files.
4.4 Heterogeneity of Mortality Effects
          We now return to the main MCOD sample and analyze heterogeneity across demographic
subgroups. We continue to focus on estimates produced from the local linear regression with
CCT bandwidth and global quadratic regression using a bandwidth of 12 months. Note that any
difference across these groups could reflect differences in Social Security claiming or labor force
participation, or how such changes affect mortality through, for example, healthy behaviors or
access to health insurance. We will discuss the heterogeneity in the mortality effects in this sec-
tion, and then seek to understand the likely cause of the observed differences in the next.

19
   The global quadratic estimate for age 61 of -1.5 percent is statistically significant at the ten percent level. However, the
local linear estimate is not statistically significant at any level and there is no visual evidence of a change at age 61 (or 63).
20
   Day of month is now not needed, which adds 12 percent to the overall number of deaths and six percent to male deaths.

                                                               15
        We first check if the increase in male mortality is driven by a specific state or region by
omitting observations from, in turn, each of the four Census Regions of the United States. These
results are presented in Appendix Table A6. For each of the samples, the coefficients are similar
to the main estimates and statistically significant at least at the five percent level. These results
rule out state- or region-specific factors accounting the change in male mortality at age 62.
        We next examine the effects across cohorts. Recall that the change in the FRA from 65 to
66 years increased the penalty due to claiming at age 62 from 20 to 25 percent, lowering average
Social Security payments. However, as shown in Appendix Table A7, there is no discernible dif-
ference in the estimates across cohorts with different FRAs. This also shows that the increase in
male mortality at age 62 is a persistent phenomenon that remains present in recent years.
        We next consider demographic characteristics, presenting these results in Table 3. In ad-
dition to the local linear and global quadratic estimates, we also report the fraction of total deaths
that each group represents. Marital status is presented first. Given that 65 percent of male dece-
dents were married, we initially divide the sample into married and non-married males. For mar-
ried males, the local linear estimate is 1.30 percent (p<0.05) and the global quadratic estimate is
an imprecise 0.81 percent (p≥0.05). In contrast, estimates for non-married males are substantially
larger, with a local linear estimate of 4.15 percent (p<0.01) and a global quadratic estimate of
3.77 percent (p<0.01). We can reject the null hypothesis that the coefficients for married and
non-married males are the same (p<0.05). We examine the non-married group in further detail by
looking separately at single, divorced and widowed males. The local linear and global quadratic
point estimates for single males are the largest (5.14 and 5.58 percent), followed by divorced
(3.05 and 3.37 percent) and widowed males (2.62 and 3.30 percent). Estimates for single and di-
vorced males are statistically significant (at least) at the five percent level, but not for widowed
males, although they only account for 6.2 percent of the sample. The only statistically significant
difference between coefficients is between the single and married male coefficients (p<0.01).
        We next present results based on differences in educational attainment. Note that the
sample is smaller because educational attainment has only been available in the MCOD file since
1989. The increase in mortality upon turning 62 is largest for males who did not complete high
school, with a local linear estimate of 3.03 percent (p<0.01) and a global quadratic estimate of
2.75 percent (p<0.05). The estimates for those who completed high school and those who com-
pleted college are smaller and not statistically significant at any level, although the standard er-


                                                  16
rors for college males are large and 95 percent confidence intervals do not rule out large increas-
es in mortality at age 62. We cannot reject the null hypothesis that the coefficients are the same.
       Race is defined broadly as either white or non-white, as non-white males only account for
16.5 percent of the sample. For white males, the estimates are large (2.09 and 2.37 percent) and
statistically significant (both p<0.01). For non-white males, the estimates are smaller (0.68 and
0.78 percent) and not statistically significant; however, the confidence intervals are wide and do
not rule out a similar increase in mortality as for white males.
       We examine if there are differences by place of death, using three categories: in-hospital
deaths; deaths in nursing homes/institutions; and other deaths (including deaths classified as
“dead on arrival” at hospital). The largest increase upon turning 62 occurs for deaths outside of
hospitals/institutions, with estimates of 3.23 and 3.39 percent (both p<0.01). Deaths in hospitals
are estimated to increase by 1.24 and 1.30 percent (both p≥0.05), while deaths in nursing homes
and other institutions change by -0.22 and -0.79 percent (both p≥0.05). The lack of any change in
mortality in long-term care facilities is comforting, as an increase in this group would have sug-
gested a mechanism unrelated to changes in Social Security.
       The heterogeneity across demographic groups may represent underlying differences in
Social Security claiming or associated changes in individuals’ work, income and health insur-
ance coverage. We next combine the mortality evidence with information on retirement-related
changes to understand why mortality increases once males turn 62.
5. Why Does Male Mortality Increase at Age 62?
       Claiming Social Security is not an isolated event; many other changes commonly occur at
the same time. First, individuals frequently stop working or reduce work levels. Second, health
insurance status can change as – upon stopping employment – employer-sponsored health insur-
ance ceases or is more expensive under continuing-coverage mandates. (Medicare is unavailable
until age 65.) Third, income can change at age 62 due to the arrival of Social Security income
and the reduction in earnings. Each change potentially has detrimental health consequences.
       Given the lack of direct information in the MCOD data, we use complementary data
sources and previous literature to provide descriptive evidence as to which of these are likely to
be important in explaining the rise in mortality at age 62. Our analysis proceeds in three steps.
First, we document the retirement-related changes that occur at age 62. Second, using the hetero-
geneity in the mortality estimates across demographic subgroups, we examine which of these


                                                 17
retirement-related changes at age 62 are most strongly correlated to changes in mortality. As a
result of these exercises, decreasing labor force participation emerges as the most likely reason
mortality rises at age 62. Finally, we examine cause-of-death results and information on health
behaviors and show it is plausible that labor force exit could explain our mortality results.
5.1 What Changes at Age 62 as a Result of Social Security Claiming?
         We examine retirement-related changes using the HRS, which is focused on aging and re-
tirement information. We first establish what changes occur at age 62 by plotting various out-
comes in Figure 5. Age is measured in quarters and rates are calculated using person-specific
sample weights. Claiming is self-reported and retrospective. In Panel A and B, we show the re-
spective Social Security claiming rates for male and females. As for the mortality data, we show
lines estimated for each side of the age-62 cutoff using quadratic polynomials. We also show the
coefficient (standard error) from the global quadratic RD regression used previously, which is
0.206 (0.007) for males and 0.204 (0.009) for females. If we estimate the change using the SSA
data for Figure 1, we find similar, albeit slightly higher discontinuities in overall Social Security
claiming for males and females. 21
         We present other outcomes in the rest of Figure 5. We show the fraction of males and
females retired in Panel C and D, respectively, where retirement is defined by labor force status
(i.e., not working due to retirement). Male retirement is estimated to increase discontinuously at
age 62 by 10.9 p.p. (p<0.01), compared to 4.7 p.p. for females (p≥0.05). Two other employment
outcomes are shown: labor force participation (in Panels E and F) and the fraction working for
pay (in Panels G and H). Male labor force participation is estimated to change discontinuously at
age 62 by -8.2 p.p. (p<0.01), while there is no change in female labor force participation (-0.5
p.p., p≥0.05). The fraction of males working for pay is estimated to change discontinuously at
age 62 by -8.2 p.p. (p<0.01) and remain unchanged for females (-0.9 p.p., p≥0.05). For all three
measures of labor supply, males experience large and statistically significant changes upon turn-
ing 62, while the estimated changes for females are small and imprecisely estimated.
         We examine changes in health insurance coverage at age 62 in Panels I and J of Figure 5.
For both males and females, the fraction with health insurance is steady and the estimated chang-
es are statistically insignificant estimates of -1.4 and -1.7 p.p., respectively. Finally, we present

21
   Using the SSA data, the estimated discontinuities in claiming at age 62 for males and females are, respectively, 23.3 and
25.1 percentage points. It is not surprising that there is some measurement error in self-reported Social Security claiming
rates in the HRS; it is unlikely this differs by sex. We also use alternate measures of claiming in the demographic analysis.

                                                             18
annual household income in Panel K and L of Figure 5. HRS respondents are asked about their
income in the prior calendar year, so we cannot examine it on a quarterly basis. We convert in-
come to 2014 dollars using the CPI-U and plot it in terms of the respondents’ age in the previous
year (e.g., 63 year old respondents have their income for the previous year assigned to age 62
using CPI for that previous year). There is no change in household income trends at age 62 or at
63, the first full year that Social Security is a major income source for those claiming at age 62. 22
         The increases in claiming Social Security at age 62 are similar for males and females,
making it unlikely to be the reason why there is a large and robust increase in male mortality.
However, males reduce their labor force participation more than females, making it a possible
explanation for why males’ mortality increases upon turning 62.
5.2 The Relationship between Changes at Age 62 and the Mortality Effects
         We make use of demographic information common to both MCOD and HRS data to fur-
ther explore the role of Social-Security-related changes at age 62. In Section 4.4, we estimated
male mortality for subgroups based on marital status (married, single, divorced and widowed),
educational attainment (completed less than high school, high school graduate and college grad-
uate) and race (white and nonwhite). Using these characteristics, we create 13 distinct male sub-
groups with reasonable sample sizes in both the MCOD and HRS files. 23 For 14 groups (females
plus 13 male groups), we compare the changes in retirement-related outcomes upon turning 62 to
changes in mortality. We use the global quadratic RD specification.
         In Figure 6, we examine the relationship between the mortality estimates and the same
six retirement-related outcomes used in Figure 5: Social Security claiming, fraction retired, frac-
tion in labor force, fraction working for pay, fraction with health insurance and average house-
hold income. For each of the 14 groups, the mortality coefficients are plotted in relation to the
horizontal axis and the estimated changes in the retirement-related outcomes are plotted in rela-
tion to the vertical axis. The linear relationship between the coefficients is also plotted.


22
   The timing of income can affect mortality, although it is unlikely to plays a role here. While Evans and Moore (2011)
find that there a short-term increase in mortality following income receipt (including for Social Security income), it is pri-
marily present in the first week after receipt and largely offset by declines in mortality three or four weeks afterwards. Our
use of monthly counts should smooth out fluctuations in deaths due to income receipt, as well as any short-term variation
in mortality due to the within-month mortality cycle (Evans and Moore, 2012).
23
   While the combination of these characteristics provides a possible 24 male subgroups (4 marital x 3 education x 2 race
types), sample sizes in some subgroups are very small. Instead, we aggregate some of these groups so there at least 200
HRS respondents within 24 months of age 62. This is achieved by creating six married subgroups (split by both education
and race), three subgroups each for single and divorced males (split by education only), and a widower subgroup.

                                                             19
         The strongest correlations are between the size of the mortality estimates and the three
work-related outcomes. Mortality changes are positively correlated with the changes in retire-
ment and negatively correlated with changes in labor force participation and working for pay.
We assess the strength of these relationships by separately regressing the mortality estimates on
each of these outcomes. We do this with and without weighting by the average number of deaths
in each group to reflect their contribution to the aggregate mortality effects (Solon, Haider and
Wooldridge, 2015). Weighting also deals with the potential influence of outliers, which tend to
be due to small subgroups. As shown in Appendix Table A8, the coefficients are similar with and
without weighting, and all are statistically significant at the five percent level. The results sug-
gest that decreases in labor force participation are correlated with increases in mortality. The
point estimates suggest that a one percentage point decrease in the three employment outcomes
raise mortality by approximately 0.07-0.1 percent.
         In contrast, the relationship between the changes in Social Security claiming and mortali-
ty at age 62 appears weak visually and is not statistically significant at conventional levels in ei-
ther regression. To ensure this is not due to the specific way claiming is measured in the HRS, as
alternate measures we consider mean differences in claiming rates between ages 61 and 62 and
the receipt of Social Security payments. 24 As shown in Appendix Table A8, there is no relation-
ship between the mortality estimates and either of these Social Security measures.
         We also consider the role of changes in health insurance and income, which are shown
respectively in Panels E and F of Figure 6. They suggest there is no relationship between these
outcomes and the mortality estimates. 25 This is unsurprising given that, as was shown in Figure
5, these outcomes do not change at age 62. In the regression analysis in Appendix Table A8, we
also show that there is no relationship with alternate measures, including the number of health
insurance plans a respondent has and household income when it is restricted to respondents in-
terviewed between January and March (whose calendar income will more closely match their
age-related income). Finally, we jointly assess the relationship between mortality and the various
retirement-related changes by regressing the mortality estimates against the combined estimates

24
   There is measurement error in the HRS in self-reported Social Security claiming; the increase at 62 observed in the SSA
data is spread slightly over nearby months. As a result, as can be observed in Panel A of Figure 6, the estimated disconti-
nuities for the 14 groups are smaller than might be estimated if administrative data had been available. As an alternative,
the difference in the average claiming rates at ages 61 and 62 overstates the change immediate after turning 62, but yields
similar results. The receipt of Social Security payments is another, albeit coarse measure that is available in the HRS.
25
   Annual income data means it is not possible to use the RD specification, so we report the average percentage change in
income between ages 61 and 63 on the vertical axis.

                                                            20
of each type of change (i.e., retirement, Social Security claiming, health insurance and income).
These regressions, which are designed to account for the correlations between the different
changes that occur at age 62, are presented in Appendix Table A9. The results do not change
once we account for such correlations: the various measures of retirement retain a statistically
significant relationship to the mortality results, while all of the other measures continue to have a
weak relationship with them.
       Another way to consider the potential role of health insurance and household income is to
calculate the effect sizes needed to explain the rise in male mortality at age 62 and compare them
to estimates from previous studies. For health insurance, the point estimate for the change in
males’ health insurance at age 62 is -1.4 p.p., so losing health insurance would need to elevate
males’ mortality by approximately 140 percent to explain the overall increase. Studies find the
mortality of uninsured individuals is as much as 43 percent higher than individuals with health
insurance (McWilliams et al., 2004). However, Black et al. (2017) argue that this overestimate
the size of the effects. For income, the change in male mortality with respect to household in-
come would need to be -3 to -4 as an elasticity in order to explain the increased male mortality.
Estimates have generally been much closer to zero than this, even for poor and unhealthy indi-
viduals like old-age pensioners in Russia (-0.94 in Jensen and Richter, 2004) and Union Army
veterans in the early 1900s (-0.57 in Salm, 2011). Synder and Evans (2006) find a mortality-
income relationship for U.S. Social Security beneficiaries going in the other direction that trans-
lates into an elasticity of approximately 0.60. The available evidence suggests it is unlikely that
health insurance and income account for a large part of the increase in mortality at age 62.
       Retirement from work is therefore the most likely driver of the mortality increases at age
62. However, there are several caveats. First, the evidence is descriptive and not causal in nature.
Second, we cannot rule out some role for other retirement-related changes, even if any single al-
ternate channel is unlikely to solely explain the change in mortality. Third, there may be changes
we do not observe that affect mortality. For example, there might be a change in health insurance
quality as people move from employment to retirement. Fourth, interactions in retirement-related
changes at the individual level may be important (e.g., stopping work may matter more if you
also lose health insurance than if you do not). Although we think there is supporting evidence for
the hypothesis that our mortality results are driven by shifts in labor supply, the evidence is far
from conclusive. As a final step in considering the plausibility of our estimates and the likely


                                                 21
reasons for higher mortality at age 62, we now consider what causes of death increase at 62 and
their consistency with other studies on the work-mortality relationship.
5.3 Underlying Causes of Death and Changes in Health Behaviors
        To further examine the plausibility of retirement leading to higher mortality, we examine
which causes of death increase when males turn 62 and consider the connection between those
and decreased labor force participation. We use underlying causes of death across International
Classification of Disease Versions 9 and 10, defining four groups and examining subgroups as
sample sizes allow. The groups are: (i) heart and lung conditions; (ii) cancers; (iii) external caus-
es; and (iv) all other causes. More details about this classification are provided in the data appen-
dix. Results are provided in Appendix Table A10.
        For heart and lung conditions, the local linear and global quadratic RD estimates are 1.35
and 2.50 percent, with the latter statistically significant (p<0.05). This group consists of heart
attacks, other heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and strokes. When it
is separated into heart attacks, COPD and other heart/lung causes, what is striking is the increase
for COPD (4.96 and 6.96 percent, p<0.05 and p<0.01 respectively). In contrast, the point esti-
mates for heart attacks and other heart/lung causes are smaller and not statistically significant.
        For cancers, there is a large, statistically significant increase (2.62 and 2.63 percent,
p<0.01 for both specifications). While it may seem strange that there is a discontinuous change
in cancer at age 62, there can be many other causes of death in addition to the primary cause.
When we restrict the sample to cases where cancer was the only identified cause of death, the
estimated change is smaller and not statistically significant (0.69 and 1.78 percent, both p≥0.05).
Once we separately estimate the change for lung cancer and other cancers (whether or not they
were the only identified cause), it is clear that the increase at age 62 is due to a large increase in
lung cancer deaths (5.10 and 5.31 percent, both p<0.01). In contrast, the estimated increase in
other cancers is 0.99 and 1.06 percent (both p≥0.05).
        External causes, which consists of accidents, murders, and suicides, increase at age 62
(3.14 and 3.99 percent, p<0.01 and p<0.05 respectively). This is due to a large, statistically sig-
nificant increase in motor vehicle fatalities (14.21 and 15.26 percent, both p<0.01). However, it
is important to note that this group accounts for 1.3 percent of all male deaths at these ages, so
that traffic fatalities account for no more than 10 percent of the overall increase in male mortality
at age 62. There is no increase in non-motor-vehicle external cause deaths (-0.88 and 0.07 per-


                                                  22
cent, both p≥0.05). Finally, other deaths (i.e., not classified as heart-/lung-related, cancers or ex-
ternal causes) account for 22 percent of all deaths. There is a small, statistically insignificant in-
crease in deaths at age 62 within this group (1.09 and 1.13 percent, both p≥0.05).
         The coefficient estimates and fraction of deaths suggest that the three causes with statisti-
cally significant increases in the month males turn 62 – COPD, lung cancer and traffic accidents
– account for slightly less than half of the overall increase in male mortality at age 62. Increases
in COPD and lung cancer suggest that males’ respiratory-related mortality risks change at age
62. 26 As with the initial mortality analysis, there is a question as to whether there is a transitory
or longer-term increase. To understand this, in Appendix Figure A7 we plot male mortality at the
weekly level around age 62 for all causes (Panel A); for deaths where the primary cause is
COPD or lung cancer (Panel B); for traffic fatalities (Panel C); and for deaths where the primary
cause is not COPD, lung cancer or a traffic accident (Panel D). 27 An increase in the level of
COPD plus lung cancer deaths appears immediately after age 62. Moreover, the underlying mor-
tality trend remains similar: the quadratic best-fit lines are similar on either side of the age-62
discontinuity, and the coefficients on the linear and quadratic terms interacted with the age-62
dummy are not jointly statistically significant at conventional levels. However, the increase in
traffic fatalities may be a short-term phenomenon, as there are statistically significant differences
in the age-mortality relationship on either side of age 62.
         Important risks for respiratory conditions include smoking (Godtfredsen et al., 2008) and
a lack of physical activity (Lee et al., 1999); these can affect mortality immediately, even among
those who already have the condition (Young et al., 2009; Waschki et al., 2011). There is some
evidence that these risk factors change with retirement. For smoking, a directly relevant study is
Ayyagari (2016), who uses HRS data and Social Security eligibility at age 62 to estimate the ef-
fect of retirement on smoking. She finds smoking increases at 62 among those who had ever
smoked, although the results are sensitive to the specification used. The increase is largest among
those working before age 62, which is consistent with labor force participation being a relevant
change at age 62. Furthermore, Falba et al. (2005) and Black, Devereux, and Salvanes (2015)



26
   COPD and lung cancer have many common risks, and their presence is highly correlated; 50–70 percent of patients di-
agnosed with lung cancer suffer from COPD, and COPD often precedes a lung cancer diagnosis (Young et al., 2009).
27
   Weekly counts produce similar estimates of the mortality change at age 62. The local linear and global quadratic esti-
mates are: for COPD, 8.5 and 5.4 percent (p<0.01 and p<0.05); for lung cancer, 4.6 and 4.1 percent (both p<0.05); and for
traffic, 14.9 and 11.9 percent (both p<0.01). The estimates for COPD + lung cancer are 4.8 and 5.2 percent (both p<0.01).

                                                           23
show that smoking increases after job loss, providing further evidence that smoking behavior is
related to labor force participation.
         Evidence on how physical activity changes after retirement is mixed, although a con-
sistent result is that retirees become more sedentary, often watching more television (Evenson et
al., 2002; Barnett et al., 2014). Time being sedentary is positively correlated with mortality, even
when accounting for exercise levels (Koster et al., 2012, Matthews et al., 2012). In Appendix
Figure A8, we show that males increase the time they are sedentary during work hours increases
by approximately 15 percent at age 62 (while there is no change in sedentariness of females). 28
         Our findings are consistent with evidence that job loss increases respiratory-related mor-
tality and traffic fatalities. 29 Eliason and Storrie (2009a) use administrative data to examine the
mortality effects of large layoffs in Sweden. They find that male mortality, but not female mor-
tality, increases after job loss. The largest increases are for lung cancer, external causes, and
heart conditions. While they do not examine traffic fatalities, in related work on hospitalizations
they find traffic-related hospitalizations rise among males who lost their job (Eliason and Storrie,
2009b). Browning and Heinesen (2012), using Danish administrative data, find that male mortal-
ity increase after large layoffs. The largest increases are for traffic fatalities, circulatory condi-
tions and suicides, but not cancers. Bloemen et al. (2017) find that, in the Netherlands, males laid
off due to plant closures have a higher probability of dying within five years as a result of rises in
cardiovascular diseases and smoking-related cancers. Among the studies investigating the mor-
tality effects of retirement, only Kuhn et al. (2015) find differences by cause of death. They find
that increases in male mortality resulting from unemployment-insurance-related retirements in
Austria are due to increases in heart attacks, traffic fatalities, and diseases related to excessive
alcohol use and smoking. In combination, these studies show that the causes of death that change
discontinuously at age 62 are similar to those that increase when males lose their jobs.
5.4 Evaluating the Mortality Effects of Retirement at Age 62




28
   We use accelerometer data on the intensity of physical activity from NHANES 2003-2006. Males were sedentary 59 and
60 percent of the time at ages 60 and 61, respectively, then 67 and 65 percent at ages 62 and 63. If we focus on 8am-6pm
Monday to Friday (i.e., standard work times) the fraction of time males are sedentary increases by 15 percent at age 62,
compared to changes of one and five percent at ages 61 and 63. There is no change at age 62 for males out of these hours,
or in the fraction of time females are sedentary. A caveat is that the sample sizes are small (92 males and 87 females).
29
   Some relevant studies, such as Snyder and Evans (2006) and Sullivan and von Wachter (2009), either do not examine
different causes of death or do not have precise estimates by cause of death.

                                                           24
         Supporting evidence suggests decreased labor force participation at 62 is a key factor in a
rise in male mortality, although it is not possible to establish causality or rule out other factors. 30
If decreased labor force participation is the reason, then it is important to adjust our estimates to
account for the fact that only some males stop work at age 62. The aggregate mortality results are
intent-to-treat estimates; we now use observed changes in work to estimate the treatment effect
of retirement on mortality at age 62. We do so by dividing the RD estimate for the percentage
change in male mortality upon turning 62 by equivalent RD estimates of the percentage point
change in work activity. We use the global quadratic RD specification as before and calculate
standard errors for these ratios using the delta method (e.g., similar to Anderson et al., 2014).
         As with our previous analysis, we use the HRS to estimate the change in retirement, labor
force participation and working for pay at age 62. Results are reported in Appendix Table A11. If
the 1.9 percent increase in overall male mortality is attributed to the 11 percentage point increase
in retirement, then this discontinuous change in retirement results in a 17 percent increase in
mortality. Similarly, males have an 8.2 percentage point decline in both labor force participation
and the fraction working for pay at age 62. Attributing the increase in aggregate male mortality
to either of these measures suggests that stopping work elevates mortality by 23 percent. All
three of these estimates are statistically significant at the one percent level.
         We estimate similar ratios for females. The estimated changes in females’ retirement, la-
bor force participation and the number working for pay when they turn 62 are, respectively, 4.2, -
0.1 and -0.8 percentage points. Attributing the 0.6 percent rise in overall female mortality to
these measures leads to imprecise estimates of the increase in mortality of 14 percent (for retire-
ment), 402 percent (for labor force exit) and 72 percent (for stopping work). The standard errors
on these estimates are extremely large; it is possible there is no relationship between these work
activity measures and female mortality, but it is also possible the relationships are of a similar
size to what we precisely estimate for males. The availability of Social Security at age 62 does
not generate a “first stage” effect on females’ employment, making it impossible to say whether
or not the connection between retirement and mortality is specific to males.



30
   There are other ways that exiting the workforce could affect health. For example, social isolation can increase upon re-
tiring and has been shown to be correlated with higher mortality (Pantell et al., 2013). The relatively large increase in the
mortality of non-married males is certainly consistent with this type of change, although social connections are not the
only difference between married and non-married males (e.g., Ayyagari (2016) finds that smoking at age 62 increases
more among non-married than married HRS respondents).

                                                              25
         Results for the different work-related outcomes suggest that retirement in this setting in-
creases males’ mortality risks by approximately 20 percent. This is comparable to related studies.
For example, among Austrian blue collar UI recipients in their late 50s, Kuhn et al. (2015) esti-
mate that labor force exit elevates mortality by 13 percent. Sullivan and von Wachter (2009) ex-
amine the mortality effects of involuntary unemployment on males using plant closures in Penn-
sylvania. They estimate that mortality risks increase by over 50 percent in the year following a
layoff, and are 10-15 percent higher even 20 years after displacement. The studies examining
involuntary job loss in Europe that were discussed in the previous section find mortality increas-
es of 30-80 percent in the first year after job loss, and persistent effects in subsequent years. 31
We do not expect exactly the same estimates, as these studies generally examine involuntary job
loss over a longer period of time, whereas we consider the immediate effects of voluntary exit
induced by Social Security eligibility. However, these studies demonstrate that large and imme-
diate changes in mortality are possible when there are abrupt changes in labor force participation.
6. Conclusion
         Mortality is an important, well-measured, objective health outcome. The availability of
detailed administrative data on the entire U.S. population and a strong claiming response to So-
cial Security eligibility provides an opportunity to examine how retirement-related behaviors af-
fect an objective health outcome. We present evidence of a two percent increase in overall male
mortality at age 62. This change is statistically significant and robust to different modeling
choices, including the range of mortality data used.
         The estimated increase is largest for unmarried males and males with low education lev-
els. While these demographic groups do not necessarily experience the largest rates of claiming
Social Security at age 62, they do have the largest changes in terms of labor force exit. The caus-
es of death with the clearest increases at age 62 are traffic accidents and two lung-related condi-
tions: COPD and lung cancer. These causes of death have previously been found to be related to
job loss, and there is also suggestive evidence that males engage in more unhealthy behaviors
once they retire. In combination, the results suggest decreased labor force participation upon




31
   Browning and Heinesen (2012) estimate that the mortality of Danish males laid off increases by 80 percent in the first
year and is 10 percent higher over a 20-year span. Eliason and Storrie (2009a) estimate that males laid off in Sweden in-
creases their mortality by 44 percent over the first four years, and nothing thereafter. Bloemen et al. (2017) find that males
laid off in the Netherlands have a 34 percent higher probability of dying within five years.

                                                             26
turning 62 as a key reason for a discontinuous increase in male mortality, although other factors
may also play a role.
       More research will be required to understand why there is not a marked change in female
mortality at age 62. It may be that women have different risk factors or retirement-related life-
style changes than men, although the imprecision of the female labor supply estimates means
that we cannot rule out the same link between retirement and mortality for both women and men.
Perhaps this puzzle will be resolved as future research is able to examine this question using up-
coming cohorts of women with higher labor force attachment, as their responses to retirement
incentives at age 62 may be more similar to current responses by men.
       Some limitations are important to keep in mind when interpreting the results. First, it is
important to reiterate that age 62 is a well-understood eligibility threshold, and therefore we are
estimating changes in mortality from a policy that is anticipated. As a result, our estimates are of
the effects on mortality net of any anticipatory changes in health investments. Second, it is not
possible to establish whether the mortality effects estimated here would apply to individuals
claiming Social Security at later ages, especially as age-62 claimants are less healthy, on aver-
age, than later claimants. Third, the structure of the empirical approach means that we are esti-
mating an immediate change that is difficult to extrapolate too far from age 62. It is not possible
to establish whether age-62 Social Security claimants have elevated mortality over the longer
term while they are receiving Social Security or if the health effects compound over time, alt-
hough the estimates are stable over the range of data we use and evidence from the literature on
the mortality effects of involuntary job loss show that persistent effects are possible. Fourth, the
increases in mortality may not translate into broader health changes. While there is typically a
strong correlation between mortality and other objective health measures (Idler and Benyamini,
1997), factors that mediate the relationship between health and mortality may also change at re-
tirement. For example, as a result of social isolation, retirees could have similar health but be less
able to get medical assistance in an emergency (Pantell et al., 2013). Finally, any welfare losses
related to heightened mortality risks may be offset by the utility gains related to stopping work. It
is therefore not possible to know the optimal timing of retirement without knowing the relative
values and weights that should be placed on increased mortality and utility gains from retire-
ment, and even whether workers correctly anticipate and understand such effects. Further re-
search will be required to understand the importance of these issues.

Notes: We use birth cohorts from 1921 to 1948 and include claims by both workers and dependents for all components of
Social Security (i.e., Disability, Retirement and Survivors Insurance). Claims data is from a one percent extract of SSA’s
Master Beneficiary Record and Numident File. Claiming numbers are converted to rates based on population estimates
from the Current Population Survey.

Notes: Data are from the RAND Health and Retirement Study Data File (Version N). The variables are described in the
appendix. Average household income is shifted back one year, as HRS respondents are asked about income in the previous
year (e.g., the income response when interviewed at age 63 is assigned as age 62 income). Income is converted to 2014
dollars using the CPI-U. In Panels A-J, the best-fit lines are quadratic polynomials fitted on each side of age 62. We do
not fit lines in Panels K and L because the number of points is too small to accurately do so.

Notes: These coefficients come from the global quadratic RD regression. Each panel shows the mortality coefficients plot-
ted for 14 distinct demographic subgroups in relation to the horizontal axis and the estimated changes in the retirement-
related outcomes for the same 14 groups plotted in relation to the vertical axis. For the non-mortality outcomes, we use
data from the RAND Health and Retirement Study Data File (Version N); these variables are described in the appendix.
Average household income is shifted back one year, as HRS respondents are asked about income in the previous year
(e.g., the income response when interviewed at age 63 is assigned as age 62 income). Income is converted to 2014 dollars
using the CPI-U.

Notes: Data is from restricted-use versions of the Multiple Cause of Death data held at the National Center for Health Sta-
tistics, including the 1921 to 1948 cohorts. The sample includes all deaths for cohorts born between 1921 and 1948. Mari-
tal status is missing in 0.9 percent of cases and place of death is missing in 0.7 percent of cases. As educational attainment
is only available after 1989, it is available for 69.1 percent of all cases. The category “Residence or other location” in-
cludes those classified as “Dead on arrival” at the hospital.

 include the 1921 to 1948 birth cohorts. The global parametric regressions allow for the polynomial to vary either side of the
 discontinuity and we report robust standard errors. The nonparametric regressions are estimated using the “robust data-
 driven” procedures of Calonico, Cattaneo and Titiunik (2014a; 2014b). We use a triangular kernel, robust standard errors,
 and their bandwidth selection and bias correction procedures. See text for more details.

DATA APPENDIX
A1. Cause of Death Categories in the MCOD Files
       The MCOD files are explained in Section 3. Here we provide more details about how we
create consistent cause-of-death categories across the 9th and 10th Versions of the International
Classification of Disease (ICD-9 and ICD-10). We use the classification of Evans and Moore
(2012) that was developed using epidemiological studies and cause-of-death recodes. For under-
lying cause of death, there is a 34-cause recode for ICD-9 (“Recode34”) and a 39-cause recode
for ICD-10 (“Recode39”). Underlying causes of death are categorized as follows:
   •   Heart and lung conditions: Heart attacks (ICD-9: 410; ICD-10: I21); COPD (ICD-9: 490-
       496; ICD-10: J40-J43, J44.0-J44.7, J44.9, J45-J48); Other heart and lung conditions
       (ICD-9: 390-398, 402, 404, 411-439; ICD-10: I00-I09, I11, I13, I20, I22-I51, I60-I69);
   •   Cancers: Lung cancer (ICD-9: 162.2-162.5, 162.8-162.9; ICD-10: C34); Other cancers
       (ICD-9: Recode34 = 4, 5, 8, 9 or 11 and not assigned to lung cancer; ICD-10: Recode39
       = 4-7, 10-13 or 15 and not assigned to lung cancer);
   •   External causes: Traffic fatalities (ICD-9: Recode34 = 33, Recode39 = 38); Other exter-
       nal causes (ICD-9: Recode34 = 34-36, Recode39 = 39-41).
All other causes of death are included in the “other” category. This accounts for approximately
22 percent of all deaths during the sample period.
A2. Social Security Administrative Data Extract
       We use two datasets drawn from SSA program management systems. The Master Bene-
ficiary Record is used to manage Social Security activity. Birth date is taken from the Numident
File, which contains vital statistics information for the entire population and is used to manage
Social Security Numbers. We use a one percent extract of these datasets that are based on the last
two digits of Social Security Numbers, which are essentially randomly assigned.
       We focus on the first date that a beneficiary is eligible to receive Social Security and
whether the claim is made on their own record (i.e., as a worker beneficiary) or someone else’s
record (i.e., as a dependent). Date of birth is used to calculate the age of claiming, and year of
birth is used to restrict the sample to those born between 1921 and 1948 (the same sample avail-

                                                 41
                                                 For Online Publication


able in the MCOD Files). We combine claiming for Disability Insurance or Retirement and Sur-
vivors’ Insurance in our figures, as individuals can apply for both simultaneously and commonly
transition from one program to another. However, we do confirm that the spike at 62 is due to
new Retirement and Survivors’ Insurance claims.
         To convert this information into rates, we use monthly extracts of the Current Population
Survey to calculate the sex- and age-specific population numbers for these cohorts. While we
could use mortality information from the Numident File to calculate these numbers, we use sur-
vey estimates as a review by the Social Security Administration Office of the Inspector General
(2012) suggests that the Numident mortality numbers are subject to measurement error.
A3. Social Security Death Master File (SSDMF) Data
         The SSDMF is a dataset of people whose deaths were reported to SSA since 1962. The
most common sources of information are relatives of deceased individuals, funeral directors, fi-
nancial institutions and postal authorities. It was first made available in 1988. Variables in the
SSDMF include decedents’ name and dates of birth and death, although for deaths prior to 1988
only month and year are generally provided for these dates (Hill and Rosenwaike, 2002).
         We use a version of the SSDMF that contains deaths through 2012. Decedents’ first
names are used to determine their likely sex. We do so by combining the SSDMF with data on
the frequency of first names for boys and girls that come from Social Security card applications. 1
For our main analysis we use deaths from 1988, as few deaths prior to 1988 include information
on exact dates of birth and death. Therefore, our main sample is for decedents born between
1930 and 1948, which results in a consistent sample for two years either side of the age-62 dis-
continuity. Approximately 87 percent of deaths have the necessary date information; of those, we
can use first name to assign sex for approximately 95 percent of decedents. 2
         The SSDMF contains approximately 675,000 deaths before 1962. Nearly all occur after
the introduction of Social Security benefits in 1940. Day of death is generally not available for
these deaths, so age of death is based on the month and year information.


1
  Counts of names used at least five times in a year are at https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html. We use birth
cohorts from 1880 (the earliest cohort) to 1948 (the youngest cohort used in our main analysis). For names used for both
boys and girls, we assign the name to the sex that most commonly use it. This type of overlap is not a major concern, as
names are assigned to the wrong sex for less than two percent of individuals.
2
  A high number of deaths are listed as occurring on the 15th of the month: six percent are on that date, which is more than
double the fraction on other days of the month. This spike is not evident in the MCOD Files, so is likely that it is due to it
being assigned when day of death is missing. We exclude deaths on the 15th, as well as days with missing day or month of
birth or death (representing another seven percent of deaths).

A4. Health and Retirement Study (HRS) Data
       The HRS provides comprehensive information on Americans in households aged 50 and
older, including their demographic characteristics, employment, retirement plans, income
sources, health insurance and health outcomes. It began in 1992 with a nationally representative
sample of individuals living in households who were born between 1931 and 1941, who have
since been interviewed every two years. Older and younger cohorts have since been added and
subsequently interviewed very two years. We use the RAND HRS File (Version N), which con-
tains data through 2012 and cohorts born between 1924 and 1959 (Chien et al., 2014). In the
RAND HRS File, variables are created that are internally consistent and consistent across waves.
       Age at interview is calculated using date of birth and final date of interview, and re-
spondent-specific sample weights are used throughout. The work-related variables are: retired
(based on labor force status, where respondents defined as retired mention retirement and cur-
rently are not working and or looking for work); currently in labor force (using the variable that
follows the Bureau of Labor Statistics definition); and working for pay (if respondent is currently
working for pay). Household income and Social Security income are from the previous calendar
year and converted to 2014 values using the CPI-U. For these variables, age is calculated for the
previous year (i.e., the year the income was earned). The health insurance variables are: has
health insurance coverage (if has government health insurance or a health insurance plan); and
the number of health insurance plans a respondent reports.
       For these variables, we aggregate the different waves and use the fraction of respondents
or average response at each age of interview. In the two years before age 62 (i.e., age 60 to 63),
we have a sample of 12,632 males and 14,119 females. For Social Security claiming, age of first
claiming is retrospective and does not vary across waves. We therefore use a slightly different
sample that omits respondents who have not yet reached an age where they eligible for Social
Security or who are less likely to accurately recall their exact claiming date. We use respondents
whose highest age at interview is between 63 and 80. In this sample, we have a sample of 6,897
males and 7,462 females, with the smaller sample due to not having repeated observations from
the same respondents.
A5. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) Data
       NHANES measures the health status of the American civilian population via both inter-
views and physical examinations. A subset of participants in the NHANES 2003/04 and 2005/06


                                                43

cycles were asked to wear Actigraph accelerometers on their right hip for seven days during
waking hours except when it could get wet (e.g., bathing). Data was recorded in one minute in-
crements. By calibrating accelerometer readings to different activity levels, researchers have
used these data to examine sedentary behavior and physical activity levels (e.g., Matthews et al,
2008; Healy et al, 2011).
        We examine the fraction of time that participants were sedentary, and follow previous
studies by defining being sedentary as whenever activity falls below 100 counts per minute. We
focus on NHANES participants aged 60 to 63 years. We include them if they had data judged to
be valid between 8am and 6pm on weekdays. This restriction matters because not all participants
consistently wore their accelerometers. Following previous studies, we assume an accelerometer
is being worn when there was at least two minutes of activity in an hour (Matthews et al., 2008;
Troiano et al., 2008). Like these studies, we also exclude data where the device was found to be
not calibrated (upon its return) or the data was classified by NHANES as unreliable. There are
179 observations (92 males, 87 females). For the ages that we are interested in, there are not
marked differences in non-wear times by age.
        We provide evidence that at age 62 there is an increase in the fraction of time that males
are sedentary. It is difficult to link that directly to Social Security claiming, as the focus of the
NHANES is on health-related outcomes. There is no information on whether people are receiv-
ing Social Security. Information about work and retirement is extremely limited, although the
fraction of all respondents who are not working because of retirement does go up by 14 percent-
age points at age 62.

ured in months. The best-fit lines are quadratic polynomials fitted on each side of age 62.

Notes: The figures show the coefficient estimates and 95 percent confidence intervals at different bandwidths between six
months and two years. Data is from restricted-use versions of the Multiple Cause of Death data held at the National Center
for Health Statistics, including the 1921 to 1948 cohorts. The local linear regressions are estimated using the “robust data-
driven” procedures of Calonico, Cattaneo and Titiunik (2014a; 2014b). We use a triangular kernel, robust standard errors,
and their bias correction procedures. The global parametric regressions allow for the polynomial to vary either side of the
discontinuity and we report robust standard errors. The estimates are stable and statistically significant for the full sample
and for males, but not for females.

Notes: Data is from restricted-use versions of the Multiple Cause of Death data held at the National Center for Health Sta-
tistics including the 1921 to 1948 cohorts. The figures show the conditional density functions of point estimates using
each month +/- 60 months before and after age 62 as placebos. The red diamond represents the regression discontinuity
estimate at age 62; the values of these estimates are shown in the figures.

                                                                     47

Notes: We compare R-squared when the discontinuity is at age 62 to when it is placed at other locations in a 24-month
window around age 62. We use the global quadratic specification and data from restricted-use versions of the Multiple
Cause of Death data held at the National Center for Health Statistics, which include deaths for the 1921 to 1948 cohorts.
The figures show the R-squared statistics as a measure of model fit when the discontinuity is at each age, in months. The
dashed line shows the regression discontinuity estimate at age 62.

Notes: Data are from the SSDMF, and include deaths for the 1930-1948 birth cohorts. The figures show the number of
deaths by age measured in months. Sex is sometimes unknown, so the counts in this figure and Panel B of Figure 4 do not
sum to the counts in Panel A of Figure 4. Best-fit lines are quadratic polynomials fitted on each side of age 62.

Notes: Data are from the SSDMF. Panel A shows reported mortality counts at age 61 using the 1931-1948 birth cohorts
and Panel B shows reported mortality counts at age 63 using the 1929-1948 birth cohorts; these samples reflect exact date
of birth generally not being available prior to 1988. Both figures show the number of deaths by age measured in months.

Notes: These figures are based on Actigraph accelerometer data collected from National Health and Nutritional Examina-
tion Survey (NHANES) 2003/04 and 2005/06 participants. Sedentary is defined as less than 100 counts per minute and
outcome measured is the fraction of sedentary time when the accelerometer was worn. Participants are included if they
were aged 60 to 63 and wore their accelerometer between 8am and 6pm Monday and Friday. The sample consists of 92
males and 87 females.

Notes: Data are from the RAND HRS Data File (Version N), a compilation that contains data from respondents inter-
viewed between1992 and 2012. The variables are described in the data appendix. Average household income is shifted
back one year, as HRS respondents are asked about income in the previous year (e.g., the income response when inter-
viewed at age 63 is assigned as age 62 income). Income is converted to 2014 dollars using the CPI-U.

Notes: ** denotes p<0.05, *** denotes p<0.01. Data is from restricted-use versions of the Multiple Cause of Death data
held at the National Center for Health Statistics. The regressions allow for the polynomial to vary either side of the discon-
tinuity and we report robust standard errors. Mortality is measured at the monthly level. In order to test whether the age-
mortality relationship changes after age 62, we provide the p-value from the joint hypothesis test that the linear and quad-
ratic terms that are interacted with the age-62 dummy are zero (i.e., Post62 x AgeDeath = Post62 x AgeDeath2 = 0). See
Table 2 and the text for more details.

 Notes: * denotes p<0.10, ** denotes p<0.05, *** denotes p<0.01. The global parametric regressions use a bandwidth of 12 months
 or equivalent (i.e., 52 weeks, 365 days) and polynomials that vary on either side of the discontinuity. The nonparametric regressions
 are estimated using the “robust data-driven” procedures of Calonico, Cattaneo and Titiunik (2014a; 2014b). We use a triangular
 kernel, robust standard errors, and their bandwidth selection and bias correction procedures. See Table 2 and the text for more
 details.

Notes: * denotes p<0.10, ** denotes p<0.05, *** denotes p<0.01. Data are from the SSDMF. Data are reported monthly mortality
counts: columns 1-5 are based on exact date of death, while columns 6-9 are based on month and year of death. The global parametric
regressions allow for the polynomial to vary either side of the discontinuity, and we report robust standard errors. The nonparametric
regressions are estimated using the “robust data-driven” procedures of Calonico, Cattaneo and Titiunik (2014a; 2014b). We use a
triangular kernel, robust standard errors, and their bandwidth selection and bias correction procedures. Columns 1 to 3 use mortality
counts for the 1930-1948 birth cohorts, and show that there is a statistically significant increase in reported mortality at age 62. Note that
the counts in column 1 are not equal to those in column 2 and 3 as sex is identified using names and cannot be identified for all
decedents. Column 4 displays results at age 61 using the 1931-1948 birth cohorts and column 5 displays results at age 63 using the 1929-
1948 birth cohorts; the samples reflect exact date of birth generally not being included prior to 1988. There is no change in mortality at
these ages. Columns 6 and 7 use reported mortality counts for deaths from 1940 to 1961, and show there was no increase in mortality at
age 62 in this placebo sample. As a comparison of these results, columns 8 and 9 show that there is a statistically significant increase in
mortality at age 62 for the 1930-1948 cohorts even when exact day of death is not used. See text for more details.

 Notes: ** denotes p<0.05, *** denotes p<0.01. Data is from restricted-use versions of the Multiple Cause of Death data
 held at the National Center for Health Statistics. The global parametric regressions allow for the polynomial to vary either
 side of the discontinuity and we report robust standard errors. The nonparametric regressions are estimated using the “ro-
 bust data-driven” procedures of Calonico, Cattaneo and Titiunik (2014a; 2014b). We use a triangular kernel, robust stand-
 ard errors, and their bandwidth selection and bias correction procedures. See text for more details.

Notes: ** denotes p<0.05, *** denotes p<0.01. We show coefficients and standard errors for local linear (using bandwidths selected based
on the procedures of Calonico, Cattaneo, Titiunik (2014a; 2014b)) and global quadratic regressions (using a 12-month bandwidth).
Fraction of deaths is for male deaths at age 61 and 62. See Table 2 and the text for more details.

     Notes: ** denotes p<0.05, *** denotes p<0.01. The first row shows coefficients and standard errors for the estimated change
     in mortality at age 62 using the global quadratic RD specification. These are from Table 2. The second row shows the coeffi-
     cients and standard errors for the percentage point changes in employment outcomes at age 62, which are calculated from the
     HRS using the global quadratic specification. The third row shows the estimated percentage increase in mortality if it is
     attributed to one of three measures of work levels: fraction retired, labor force participation, and fraction working for pay. It
     is calculated as the ratio of the first two rows, with the standard errors calculated using the delta method.
