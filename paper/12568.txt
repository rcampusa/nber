                                             ABSTRACT

On Aug. 8, 2005, President Bush signed the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (PL 109-58). This was the
first major piece of energy legislation enacted since 1992 following five years of Congressional efforts
to pass energy legislation. Among other things, the law contains tax incentives worth over $14 billion
between 2005 and 2015. These incentives represent both pre-existing initiatives that the law extends
as well as new initiatives. In this paper I survey federal tax energy policy focusing both on programs
that affect energy supply and demand. I briefly discuss the distributional and incentive impacts of
many of these incentives. In particular, I make a rough calculation of the impact of tax incentives
for domestic oil production on world oil supply and prices and find that the incentives for domestic
production have negligible impact on world supply or prices despite the United States being the third
largest oil producing country in the world. Finally, I present results from a model of electricity pricing
to assess the impact of the federal tax incentives directed at electricity generation. I find that nuclear
power and renewable electricity sources benefit substantially from accelerated depreciation and that
the production and investment tax credits make clean coal technologies cost competitive with pulverized
coal and wind and biomass cost competitive with natural gas.

I.       Introduction

         On Aug. 8, 2005, President Bush signed the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (PL 109-

58). This was the first major piece of energy legislation since 1992 and culminated five

years of efforts to pass energy legislation by the Bush Administration. Among other

things, the law contains tax incentives worth over $14 billion between 2005 and 2015.

These incentives represent both pre-existing initiatives that the law extends as well as

new initiatives. In this paper I review federal tax energy policy focusing both on

programs that affect energy supply and demand.

         In the next section, I discuss an economic rationale for energy tax incentives.

Next, I review current energy taxes in section III. In the following section, I summarize

the various energy incentives in the tax code.1 These include accelerated depreciation of

various types as well as production and investment tax credits. In addition, special

incentives are targeted towards electric utilities and the transportation sector. In section

V, I briefly discuss the distributional and incentive impacts of many of these tax

incentives. I also conduct a levelized cost analysis of various electricity generation

technologies to assess the impact of the production and investment tax incentives directed

at electricity generation.

         In summary, the energy taxes or tax incentives currently in effect are difficult to

justify on the basis of economic theory. Energy taxes totaled $36.1 billion in fiscal year

2004 with the vast bulk of the revenues coming from motor vehicle fuel taxes. The most

1
  The list is naturally incomplete given the complexity of the tax code. In particular I do not focus on how
the tax treatment of foreign income earned by multinational corporations bears on energy production. This
is potentially a major issue. For example, prior to the nationalization of oil production in the major oil
producing countries, the major U.S. oil producers paid taxes to host countries that were termed income
taxes but were in reality excise taxes. Standard tax treatment would provide for a deduction on the U.S.
corporate income tax for those foreign tax payments. Instead, the U.S. companies were allowed a foreign
tax credit for the "income" taxes paid to host countries, a preference lobbied for by – among others – the
State Department. See Adelman (1995), pp. 50 – 55 for more on this point.
pressing case for taxation – externalities – suggests direct pollution or driving charges

rather than a gasoline tax. The other motor vehicle related tax, the Gas Guzzler Tax,

suffers from the defect of excluding light trucks and Sport Utility Vehicles (SUVs) from

the tax. These make up the majority of motor vehicles currently sold.

       With the passage of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT), energy tax

preferences are worth roughly $6.7 billion in fiscal year 2006. The production and

investment tax credits have been effective at making certain renewable energy sources

(mainly wind and biomass) competitive with natural gas in electricity generation. I note,

however, that tax credits are a socially costly way of making these renewable sources

competitive with fossil fuel sources.

       Finally, while fossil fuel and nuclear power continue to receive the majority of

benefits from tax incentives, the tilt towards these fuels is not as large as it once was.

Percentage depletion and expensing of intangible drilling costs, for example, have been

scaled back relative to the situation in the 1950s and 1960s. And the investment tax

credits for solar generated electricity combined with generous depreciation tax treatment

contribute to negative effective tax rates on solar generated electricity.

II.    Rationale for Government Energy Tax Incentives

       Why should the federal government have an energy policy? More particularly,

why should the tax code be used as an instrument of an energy policy? To help evaluate

the various provisions of the tax code that affect energy supply and demand, I briefly

review four major arguments for government intervention in energy markets: energy

externalities, national security, market failures and barriers in energy conservation




                                                                                             2
markets, and rent expropriation. For a more in-depth review, see Newbery (2005) or

Lazzari (2005).

         A broad array of externalities are associated with our consumption of energy.

Burning fossil fuels contributes to air pollution (sulfur dioxides, nitrogen oxides,

particulates) and generates greenhouse gases. In addition, our use of petroleum in

transportation contributes to roadway congestion, accident externalities, and other traffic

related market failures (see Parry and Small (2005) for a fuller discussion of driving

related externalities). Economic theory suggests that we should tax externalities directly

rather than a proxy for the externality (here, motor vehicle fuels). Road congestion

suggests the use of congestion or time-of-day pricing on highways. Tailpipe emissions

from vehicles call for emissions pricing if technologically feasible.2 Accident

externalities call for changes in automobile insurance pricing. None of these externalities

suggest a policy of taxing motor vehicle fuels directly. The one externality that might

suggest a motor fuels tax is global warming arising from burning fossil fuels given the

tight relationship between petroleum consumed and carbon emitted.3 But even here a

stronger case could be made for a comprehensive tax on the carbon content of all energy

sources rather than a specific tax on motor vehicle fuels.4

         Positive spill-overs from research and development are frequently cited as an

argument for tax incentives for particular technologies. Supporters of production tax

  See Feng et al. (2005) for a discussion and evaluation of feasible alternatives to direct emission taxes for
motor vehicles.
3
  Two-thirds of petroleum is used in the transportation sector (U.S. Energy Information Administration
(2005)).
4
  Partial policies can raise the cost of carbon emission reductions considerably. Pizer et al. (2006) present
model results showing that focusing climate change policies only on the transportation and electricity
sectors doubles the cost of a given carbon emissions reduction. Note too that the motor vehicle fuels tax is
sometimes justified as a use charge for highways. To the extent this is true, the motor vehicle fuels tax is
even less effective as a proxy tax for externalities.


                                                                                                             3
credits for renewable fuels, for example, argue that experience in the marketplace and

learning by doing will bring about cost savings that support the initial subsidies. The

difficulty with such an argument, of course, is that all research and development

spending has elements of non-appropriability leading to a policy prescription of support

for general R&D rather than sector or technology specific R&D support.

         A second broad rationale for government intervention in energy markets is

national security concerns. Here the argument is that our dependence on imported

energy, oil in particular, makes us vulnerable to economic coercion from foreign owners

of energy resources. In 2004, the United States imported over 60 percent of the 20.5

million barrels per day of petroleum that it consumed (Energy Information

Administration (2005)). The need to protect a stable source of energy imports, it is

argued, requires increased spending on defense and national security and has made the

country more vulnerable to unstable governments in the Middle East and other oil rich

regions. Oil import tariffs are a proposed solution to this problem. By reducing our

dependence on foreign oil, it is argued, the United States reduces its vulnerability to

political and economic instability elsewhere. The difficulty with this argument is that oil

is a commodity priced on world markets. Even if the United States were to produce all

the oil it consumes, it would still be vulnerable to oil price fluctuations. A supply

reduction in the Middle East would raise prices of domestic oil just as readily as it raises

prices of imported oil.5



5
  That the source of the oil the United States consumes is irrelevant for oil price stability should be made
clear by the fact that the United States is the third largest oil producer in the world, with production only
exceeded by the Russian Federation and Saudi Arabia. The United States produced 8.5 percent of the
world's oil in 2004. It is also the second largest producer of natural gas after the Russian Federation with a
world production share of 19 percent. See BP (2006) for data.


                                                                                                             4
       A third argument for government intervention in energy markets is the existence

of market barriers to energy efficient capital investment. A long-standing "energy

paradox" claims that consumers need very high rates of return on energy efficient capital

(appliances, housing improvements, lighting, etc.) and a variety of market barriers have

been proposed to explain this paradox and to motivate market interventions. I critique

the market barriers literature elsewhere (Metcalf (2006)) and simply note two relevant

issues here that support possible market interventions. First, many have argued that

consumers are poorly informed about the potential for energy savings (as well as the

value of the savings) associated with new more expensive technologies. This is a

reasonable point given the public good nature of information acquisition and suggests the

value of government information programs. Programs such as energy efficiency labeling

on new appliances can help overcome information failures at low cost. Second,

principal-agent problems may deter energy efficient investments. A good example is the

provision of energy efficient appliances and housing in rental housing. Tenants may

desire more energy efficient housing and appliances but landlords may be reluctant to

make the investments out of concern that they may be unable to recoup their incremental

investment through higher rents. In addition, many apartment buildings are not easily

converted to allow for tenant control over and payment for energy consumption

(especially heating services) in individual units. This removes incentives for tenants to

conserve energy. Landlords, meanwhile, may be reluctant to invest in energy

conservation capital if the effectiveness of the investment depends on tenant use

characteristics (installing additional insulation is likely not cost-effective if tenants open

windows during the winter when apartments become overheated). The appropriate policy




                                                                                                 5
response in this situation is to provide a subsidy to tenants (or landlords) for investments

in energy conservation capital.

        Finally, a number of authors (Newbery (1976), Bergstrom (1982), Karp and

Newbery (1991)) have noted that an oil import tariff can expropriate some portion of the

Hotelling rents associated with oil. The intuition is straightforward if all consuming

countries could act in collusion. Since potential oil supply from known oil fields is fixed,

a tax that doesn't alter the relative scarcity rents of oil over time will not affect the time

profile of extraction. Thus, we can collapse the analysis to that of a tax on an

inelastically supplied product. Since the entire burden of such a tax is on the supplier, the

result follows.6 Newbery (2005) estimates that the optimal oil import tariff for the EU

and the United States ranges between $3.10 and $15.60 per barrel in 2002.

        Summing up, we shall see that the arguments for using the tax code to affect

energy supply and demand are poorly related to existing energy tax policy. The most

compelling case can be made for energy taxes related to carbon emissions and for an oil

import fee to transfer some of the Hotelling rents from oil suppliers to the United States.

I turn next to an discussion of current energy tax provisions at the federal level.

III.    Federal Energy Taxes

        Table 1 lists federal taxes that are specifically linked to energy production or

consumption. By far the largest are the excise taxes on gasoline and diesel fuels that are

dedicated to the Highway Trust Fund accounting for over 95 percent of federal energy

excise tax collections in FY 2004. The federal excise tax rate on gasoline is 18.4¢ per

gallon. Of that, 0.1¢ is dedicated to the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund


6
 Karp and Newbery (1991) provide a more sophisticated analysis to resolve a dynamic inconsistency
problem with simple oil tariff expropriation stories. But the basic result holds.


                                                                                                    6
and the remaining 18.3¢ to the Highway Trust Fund.7 Of that 18.3¢ per gallon, 2.86¢ is

dedicated to the Mass Transit Account and the remaining 15.44¢ to the Highway

Account. In fiscal year 2004, this tax raised $35.1 billion. In comparison, total outlays

for grants to state and local governments from the highway and urban mass transit

programs in fiscal year 2004 were $30.0 billion. Non-trust fund aid to sub-federal

governments for highways and urban mass transit totaled an additional $7.8 billion with

nearly all of that designated to urban mass transit.

        Because the federal motor fuels gas tax is an excise tax, its ad valorem equivalent

rate fluctuates with gas prices. Figure 1 shows how the rate has changed between 1978

and 2005. With the decline of gasoline prices in the late 1980s, the tax peaked at 27

percent of the refiner price of finished motor gasoline to end users in 1998 and has fallen

since then to 10 percent in 2005.

        The United States has the lowest tax rate on unleaded gasoline among all the

OECD countries (see Figure 2). Its tax rate per litre ($.104) in the fourth quarter of 2005

was less than half that of the next closest country and compares to an OECD average rate

of $.789 per litre. Returning to the importance of motor fuels taxes in total energy tax

collections, consider the United Kingdom. Its tax on gasoline is the third highest among

OECD countries (see Figure 2). Yet the UK tax on hydrocarbons is only 90 percent of its

total energy tax collections.8

  The tax was most recently raised to 18.3¢ per gallon for gasoline on Oct. 1, 1993. See Jackson (2006) for
a history of changes to this tax.

  In fiscal year 2004, the UK collected £832 million in its Climate Change Levy, approximately £1,614
million in VAT on energy related sales, and £22,786 in its hydrocarbons tax. Data are from excise tax
sheets published by HM Revenue & Customs and available at http://www.uktradeinfo.com.

        The Gas Guzzler Tax was enacted as part of the Energy Tax Act of 1978. It

levies a tax on automobiles that obtain fuel mileage below 22.5 miles per gallon.9 Tax

rates range from $1,000 to $7,700 per vehicle. In 2004 the tax collected $141 million.

The gas guzzler tax explicitly excludes sport utility vehicles, minivans, and pickup

trucks, which represent 54 percent of the new vehicle sales in 2004 (U.S. Census Bureau

(2006), Table 1027). The light truck category (comprising SUVs, minivans, and pickup

trucks) is the fastest growing segment of the new vehicle market, growing at an annual

rate of 5.5 percent between 1990 and 2004. In contrast, new car sales are falling at an

annual rate of 1.6 percent. Unofficial Congressional estimates suggest that phasing out

the SUV loophole over four years would raise roughly $700 million annually once the

phase-out was complete.

 The mileage rating is calculated approximately as 55 percent of the EPA city mileage rating and 45
percent of the highway rating.

         The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT) resurrected the Oil Spill Liability Trust

Fund tax at the original rate of 5¢ per barrel. This tax had previously been in effect from

1990 through 1994. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that this tax will raise

$1.25 billion between 2005 and 2010. The tax is imposed on crude oil received at U.S.

refineries as well as imported petroleum products. Domestic crude oil for export is also

subject to the tax if the tax had not been previously paid.



                                                                                                                 9
        The coal excise tax funds the Black Lung Disability Fund. It is levied on coal

mined in the United States at a rate of 4.4 percent of the sales price up to a limit of $1.10

per ton of underground coal and $.55 per ton of surface mined coal. This tax raised $566

million in 2004.

        Gasoline sold for sport motorboats is taxed at the same rate as highway gasoline

and diesel fuel and the funds allocated to the Aquatic Resources Trust Fund (subject to an

annual cap on transfers that effectively reduces the share of tax on motorboat fuels shifted

to this trust fund). Finally the Inland Waterways Fuels Tax levies a tax of 22.4¢ per

gallon of fuel sold to commercial vessels using the Inland Waterway System (barges for

the most part).

IV.     Energy Incentives in the Corporate and Personal Income Tax

        The President's FY2007 Budget Submission lists over $20 billion of tax

expenditures (for the fiscal years 2007-2011) associated with energy.10 Table 2 lists these

tax expenditures sorted from highest to lowest cost (over the five year budget window).

Both the number of tax provisions and the revenue cost have increased as a result of

2005's energy legislation. The General Accounting Office (2005) listed nine income tax

preferences totaling $4.2 billion in revenue loss in fiscal year 2003.11 In fiscal year 2006,

the Administration's budget lists 29 preferences totaling $6.7 billion for that year.

        The single largest tax expenditure is associated with alcohol fuels. Most of this

revenue loss arises from the reduction in motor vehicle fuel tax revenues ($12,500

million) with the remainder arising from the $.51 per gallon income tax credit for this

10
   I have not included tax expenditures associated with transportation (e.g. exclusion from income for
employer reimbursed parking). Nor do I consider state or local energy tax incentives in this paper.
11
    As GAO points out, one cannot simply add tax expenditures given the interactions among different
provisions of the tax code. But the summation indicates the relative importance of the provisions when
making comparisons across time.


                                                                                                         10
fuel.12 After alcohol fuels is the tax expenditure for investment and production tax

credits for new energy technologies. Investment tax credits range from 20 to 30 percent

depending on the technology and production tax credits exist, primarily for electricity

produced from renewable energy sources.

         Before turning to a discussion of the current code, it may be useful to provide

some historical perspective on the federal tax treatment of energy.13 Prior to the first oil

embargo in 1973 the federal government's tax policy was designed to encourage fossil

fuel exploration and production. Expensing of intangible drilling costs was introduced in

1916 and percentage depletion in 1926. Percentage depletion for oil and gas was

particularly generous with a rate of 27.5 percent (relative to the current rate of 15 percent)

for oil and gas and was available to all companies, not simply independent producers as

at present.

         During the 1970s the sharp increase in the price of oil combined with growing

environmental concerns associated with oil and gas drilling as well as a rising federal

budget deficit led to a curtailment of the preferential treatment for fossil fuels. The

percentage depletion rate, for example, was reduced to 15 percent for oil and gas and

restricted to independent producers (i.e. producers without refining or retailing

operations). The Energy Tax Act of 1978 introduced the Gas Guzzler Tax, tax subsidies

for gasohol, and investment tax credits for conservation and renewable energy

production. This was followed by the Windfall Profits Tax which, in addition to its

efforts to tax profits on old oil, enacted the section 29 production tax credits for non-

conventional oil.

12
   It is unclear whether this tax expenditure has any incentive effect now that ethanol use is mandated in
motor fuels by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. I thank John McLelland for pointing this out.
13
    This brief description draws on an excellent overview by Lazzari (2006).


                                                                                                             11
         The election of Ronald Reagan in 1980 ushered in an new era in the federal

government's tax treatment of energy. According to Lazzari (2006), Reagan brought a

free-market approach to energy policy. As such, he worked to eliminate the Windfall

Profits Tax (largely repealed in 1988) and to end federal tax credits for energy production

or investment. By 1988 all that remained of the federal tax credits for energy were the

section 48 investment tax credits for solar and geothermal power.

         The post-Reagan era saw a number of changes to the tax code with the most

significant being the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (PL 102-486). This law enacted the

section 45 production tax credits for wind and closed loop biomass generated electricity.

As discussed below, this credit was gradually expanded to cover other renewable sources

and remains in effect today.14 Other laws passed during the post-Reagan era generally

extended existing production and investment tax credits and raised the gasoline tax.15

         The most recent change is the Energy Policy Act of 2005 which extended and

expanded coverage of the section 45 production and section 48 investment tax credits

among a variety of other provisions. I discuss the current tax code's various provisions in

the next section.16




14
    The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (PL 108-357) provided a major expansion of the production
tax credits.
15
    The production tax credit for wind and biomass briefly expired in 2003. According to the American
Wind Energy Association, wind power capacity additions fell from 1,687 MW in 2003 to 389 MW
following the temporary lapse of this tax provision.
16
   In general I do not discuss energy tax incentives that have expired. See Edwards et al. (1998) for some
discussion of energy tax incentives related to global warming that existed prior to 1998. This includes the
major incentives that have expired. I also generally do not provide information about sunset provisions for
the various incentives since historically sunset dates have been extended for most energy-related tax
incentives.

A.       Depreciation

         Depreciation is the wearing out of an asset over time and is properly recognized

as a cost of doing business. Economic depreciation refers to the actual wearing out of the

asset as reflected in changes in the asset's value over time. A pure income tax would

allow a deduction for economic depreciation. Because of the difficulties involved in

measuring economic depreciation, the tax code groups assets into broad categories and

mandates depreciation schedules for assets in each category. Tax depreciation may bear

some resemblance to economic depreciation but it should be stressed that tax depreciation

is a policy tool that may be used to encourage or discourage certain types of investment at

the expense of other types. Accelerated depreciation refers to a depreciation schedule that

allows for more rapid tax depreciation than economic depreciation. The limit of

accelerated depreciation is expensing, an immediate deduction for the entire cost of the

asset.

         Expensing an asset reduces the effective tax rate on this asset to zero. To see this

consider an asset worth $100 that generates additional net profits of $20 per year. In the

absence of taxation, this asset produces a net return of 20 percent. Now impose a 35

percent tax with expensing. In the first year, the firm takes a deduction for the cost of the

machine and enjoys a reduction in taxes of $35 (35% times $100). The after-tax cost of

the machine has been reduced to $65. In subsequent years, the firm obtains additional

after-tax profits of $13. The net return on this investment is still 20 percent ($13/$65).

         Under the current tax code, capital assets are depreciated according to the

Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS) with recovery periods ranging




                                                                                             14
from 3 to 39 years under the General Depreciation System (GDS).17 Most capital is

depreciated using a declining balance method at either 200 percent (3, 5, 7, and 10 year

property) or 150 percent (15 and 20 year property). Table 3 shows the recovery period

for various types of energy related capital. Most electric generating capital is depreciated

over twenty years with the major exception being nuclear power plants (15 years) and

renewable energy generating capital (5 years). High voltage electricity transmission

lines received a 15 year recovery period in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. That act also

clarified the depreciation of natural gas gathering (7 years) and reduced the recovery

period of distribution pipelines from 20 to 15 years. In addition, the new law also

contains a provision allowing partial expensing for new refinery capacity placed in

service before 2012. The provision allows for 50 percent expensing with the remainder

deducted as under current law.

        Below, I provide some analysis of the impact of accelerated depreciation (as well

as other tax provisions) on the cost of capital for various types of electricity generating

property and show that nuclear power and electricity generated from renewable sources

receive particularly generous tax treatment from accelerated depreciation.




17
  The recovery period is the number of years over which an asset may be depreciated for tax purposes.
Certain assets must be depreciated under the Alternative Depreciation System (ADS). See U.S. Internal
Revenue Service (2006) for more information.

        Oil drilling receives an additional depreciation benefit from the ability to expense

dry holes. One can view dry holes as part of the cost of drilling a successful well. This

tax provision raises the effective value of the depreciation deductions for oil rigs.

Technology, however, has reduced the percentage of dry holes. In 1960, forty percent of

all wells drilled were dry holes. By 2004, that percentage had fallen to twelve percent

reducing the tax advantage of dry hole expensing.18

        While not energy capital explicitly, motor vehicles have a significant impact on

energy consumption and depreciation rules treat different types of motor vehicles very

18
  Exploratory wells continue to have high failure rates. In 2003, 55 percent of exploratory wells were dry
holes and 9 percent of development wells were dry holes. But less than 2,700 exploratory wells were
drilled that year compared to over 32,200 development wells. Roughly the same number of development
wells were drilled in 1960 but with a dry hole rate of 25 percent. However, 11,700 exploratory wells were
drilled with over 80 percent of them being dry holes. See tables 4.5-4.7 in U.S. Energy Information
Administration (2005).


                                                                                                        16
differently. Clean fuel vehicles may be expensed up to limits (ranging from $50,000 for

trucks or vans with gross vehicle weight exceeding 26,000 pounds to $2,000 for motor

vehicles weighing less than 10,000 pounds). Clean fuel vehicles include vehicles that

burn natural gas, LNG, LPG, hydrogen, electricity, gasohol (if at least 85 percent

alcohol), and certain hybrid electric vehicles.

        Passenger cars, SUVs, and pickup trucks used in a small business can have very

different depreciation treatment. Small businesses are allowed a section 179 deduction of

up to $100,000 per year in capital expenses (subject to phase-out rules). The section 179

deduction is limited for motor vehicles in certain ways. First, passenger vehicles and

light trucks with a gross vehicle weight of 6,000 pounds or less are treated as listed

property and subject to annual depreciation deduction limits arising from luxury

passenger car rules written in the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (PL 98-369). These

vehicles must be depreciated over a five year period with specified annual depreciation

caps.19 The luxury vehicle limits are such that any passenger car costing more than

$13,860 and any light truck costing more than $15,360 will have a recovery period longer

than the standard five year recovery period for motor vehicles. Second, small businesses

purchasing SUVs weighing more than 6,000 pounds (but not more than 14,000 pounds)

can expense $25,000 and depreciate the balance over five years using double-declining

balance rules. Table 4 illustrates how the various depreciation rules affect the after-tax

price for a small business owner in the top personal income tax bracket choosing among

three new 2005 vehicles each costing $30,000. The passenger car must be written off


19
  The caps for 2005 were $2,960 in the first year, $4,700 in the second year, $2,850 in the third year, and
$1,675 in subsequent years for passenger cars. For light trucks weighing less than 6,000 pounds (including
minivans, SUVs, and pickup trucks) the limits are $3,260 in the first year, $5,200 in the second year,
$3,150 in the third year, and $1,875 in subsequent years.


                                                                                                        17
over 21 years as opposed to 19 years for the light SUV and 6 years for the heavy SUV.

The differences in depreciation treatment raise the price of the passenger car and light

SUV by 13 and 10 percent respectively relative to the heavy SUV.

B.      Tax Treatment Specific to Fossil Fuel Production

        Traditionally, fossil fuels have received preferential tax treatment. Percentage

depletion and the expensing of intangible drilling costs are the most well known. While

not as generously treated as in the past, the tax preferences for fossil fuel production are

still important.

        As natural resources are extracted from booked reserves, the value of those

reserves is diminished. This is a legitimate cost of business and a Haig-Simons income

tax would allow a deduction for the value of the resource extracted. Rather than take

deductions for the value of the extracted resource, oil, gas, and coal producers have

historically been allowed a deduction based on percentage depletion. Percentage

depletion allows the firm to deduct a fraction of the revenue arising from sale of the

resource. Historic percentage depletion rates have been as high as 27.5 percent.

Currently percentage depletion is allowed for independent producers at a 15 percent rate



                                                                                                       18
for oil and gas and 10 percent for coal.20 Percentage depletion is allowed on production

up to 1,000 barrels of average daily production of oil (or its equivalent for natural gas).

In addition, the depletion allowance cannot exceed 100 percent of taxable income from

the property (50 percent for coal) and 65 percent of taxable income from all sources.21

Despite the curtailed availability of percentage depletion, it continues to be a significant

energy tax expenditure, costing $3.2 billion over five years in the federal budget (see

Table 2).

        The following example illustrates the tax benefits of percentage depletion over

cost depletion. John Doe purchases an interest in a property for $300,000 that contains

reserves of 50,000 barrels of oil. He produces 10,000 barrels of oil in the first year which

he sells for $630,000. Under cost depletion, he would be allowed to deduct $60,000 for

                               10,000
the reduction in reserves             x$300,000 . Percentage depletion allows him to
                               50,000

deduct $94,500 (.15 x $630,000). Note that percentage depletion can exceed the basis in

the asset. Continuing to assume a first purchase price of $63 per barrel, the total value of

oil extracted would be $3.15 million and the percentage depletion deduction would be

$472,500.22 Obviously the benefit of percentage depletion would be considerably higher

at the historic depletion rate of 27.5 percent.

        The second major tax benefit available to oil and gas producers is the ability to

expense intangible drilling expenses (labor and material costs associated with drilling

20
   Independent producers are defined as producers who do not engage in refining or retail operations.
EPACT increased the amount of oil a company could refine before it was deemed to engage in refining for
this purpose from 50,000 to 75,000 barrels per day.
21
   Amounts in excess of the 65 percent rule can be carried forward to subsequent tax years. The net income
limitation has been suspended in years past but the suspension lapsed as of this year.
22
   This example presumes that the net income from the first year's operation exceeds $94,500. If not, the
deduction would be reduced accordingly. For purposes of computing the net income limitation, costs are
computed without any depletion deduction considered.


                                                                                                       19
wells). Normally the non-capital expenses associated with oil exploration and drilling

would be capitalized and the costs allocated as income is earned from the well over its

useful life. Instead firms may deduct these expenses in the first year. Corporations may

only deduct 70 percent of the costs and must depreciate the remaining 30 percent over

five years. Additionally, geological and geophysical costs associated with exploration

can be amortized over a two year period.23 As noted in Table 2, this is the third largest

energy tax expenditure in the federal budget totaling $3.2 billion over five years.

        In addition to the tax preferences described above, I note two additional

significant tax preferences. First, owners of coal mining rights who lease their land for

mining receive royalties for coal extracted from their property. Owners who are

individuals may elect to treat those royalty payments as capital income in lieu of taking

percentage depletion on the property. Second, owners of working interests in oil and gas

properties are exempt from passive loss limitations for income from these properties.

C.      Production and Investment Tax Credits

        The federal tax code includes a number of production and investment tax credits

on fossil, alternative, nuclear, and renewable fuels. Those credits include the following:

1.      Section 29 Non-Conventional Oil Production Credit24

        The 1980 Windfall Profits Tax (PL 96-223) was a failed effort to simultaneously

capture profits on old oil as a result of oil price increases in the 1970s and encourage

exploration for and production of new oil. The law was repealed in 1988.25 One part of

that law that was retained was the section 29 Alternative Fuel Production Credit for


23
   EPACT set the recovery period at two years but the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of
2005 (PL 109-222) extended the period to five years for the major integrated oil companies.
24
   Section 29 is relabeled as section 45K by EPACT.
25
   For an overview and analysis of the Windfall Profit Tax, see Lazzari (1990).


                                                                                                      20
production of non-conventional oil (e.g. shale oil, synthetic fuel oils from coal). The

section provides for a $3.00 per barrel of oil-equivalent production tax credit (indexed in

1979 dollars and worth $6.79 in 2005). The 2005 energy act adds coke and coke gas to

the list of qualified fuels and makes the credit part of the general business credit.26 The

credit phases out for oil prices above $23.50 in 1979 dollars ($53.20 in 2005).27

         The tax expenditure for this credit is estimated to be $3.4 billion between FY

2007 and 2011 and is the second largest energy tax expenditure in the federal budget.

The main beneficiary of the credit is coalbed methane, natural gas that is extracted from

tight seams in coal mines. Traditionally this gas was vented to reduce safety problems in

mines. But with higher gas prices, the credit, and advances in technology, it has become

economic to recover this gas. This is not an non-conventional fuel per se but its

extraction method might be viewed as non-conventional.

2.       Section 45 Production Tax Credits

         Section 45 of the IRS code, enacted in the Energy Policy Act of 1992, provided

for a production tax credit of 1.5¢ per kWh (indexed) of electricity generated from wind

and closed-loop biomass systems.28 The tax credit has been extended and expanded over

time and currently is available for wind, closed-loop biomass, poultry waste, solar,

geothermal and other renewable sources at a current rate of 1.9¢ per kWh.29 Firms may

take the credit for ten years. Refined coal is also eligible for a section 45 production


26
   Most energy tax credits were part of the general business credit. Prior to EPACT, the section 29 credits
were an exception and so any unused credits were lost. As part of the general business credit, excess
credits can be carried backward one year and forward twenty years.
27
   The reference price for oil in 2005 was $50.26 and so the full credit could be taken. The credit amount
and reference price are published annually in the Federal Register. With the reference oil price currently at
$62.51 (April 2006 crude oil domestic first purchase price), it is unlikely that firms will be able to take the
full section 29 credit in 2006.
28
   A closed-loop biomass is plant material grown specifically for use in a biomass generator.
29
   Open-loop biomass is eligible for a 0.75¢ in 1992 dollars per kWh.


                                                                                                            21
credit at the current rate of $5.481 per ton.30 EPACT added new hydropower and Indian

coal with the latter receiving a credit of $1.50 per ton for the first four years and $2.00

per ton for three additional years. While EPACT extended the section 45 tax credits for

two additional years (through 2007), it did not extend the credit for solar generated

electricity beyond 2005.

         Finally, EPACT allowed for the issuance of $800 million in Clean Renewable

Energy Bonds (CREBs) to finance projects eligible for section 45 production tax credits

(with the exception of Indian coal). CREBs do not pay interest. Rather the holder of a

CREB on its credit allowance date is entitled to a tax credit to be determined by the

Treasury Department so that the bond may be sold at par.31

3.       Other Production Tax Credits

         EPACT provided a production tax credit for electricity produced at nuclear power

plants (section 45J). Qualifying plants are eligible for a 1.8¢ per kWh production tax

credit up to an annual limit of $125 million per 1,000 megawatts of installed capacity.

This limit will be binding for a nuclear power plant with a capacity factor of 80 percent

or higher. The law places an aggregate limit of 6,000 megawatts of capacity eligible for

this credit.

         The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (PL 108-357) created a production

credit (section 45I) for marginal oil and gas producers of $3.00 per barrel of oil ($.50 per

mcf of natural gas) in year 2005 dollars. The full credit is available when oil (gas) prices

fall below $15 per barrel ($1.67 per mcf) and phases out when prices reach $18 per barrel



30
   Refined coal is a synthetic fuel produced from coal with lower emissions of certain pollutants.
31
  State and local tax exempt financing is also available for qualified energy facilities. These bonds are
subject to a state's private-activity volume cap.


                                                                                                            22
($2.00 per mcf).32 Marginal wells produce on average 15 or less barrels of oil (or oil

equivalent) per day.

            This same law provided for small refinery expensing of 75 percent of capital costs

associated with low sulfur diesel fuel production and a 5¢ per gallon small refiner's credit

for the remaining 25 percent of qualified capital costs for the production of low sulfur

diesel fuel. The 2005 Energy Policy Act allowed a pass through of this credit to owners

of cooperatives.

            The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 contained a provision for a 15

percent credit (section 43) for expenditures on enhanced oil recovery tangible property

and intangible drilling and development costs and other related capital expenditures. The

credit is phased out as the section 29 reference oil price exceeds $28 in 1990 dollars

($37.44 for 2005). At current prices, producers cannot take this credit.

4.          Section 48 Investment Tax Credits

            Nonrefundable investment tax credits for alternative energy were initially put in

place in the Energy Tax Act of 1978 (PL 95-618) at a rate of 10 percent for solar and

geothermal property. That law provided a number of investment tax credits including a

credit for residential energy conservation investments. This latter credit expired in 1982.

EPACT increased the investment tax credit for solar to 30 percent. In addition the 30

percent tax credit applies to fuel cells used to produce electricity while the 10 percent

credit is available for qualifying microturbine power plants.

            The section 48 investment tax credits for renewable energy production were

extended by EPACT to apply to investments in certain clean coal facilities. Integrated

gasification combined cycle (IGCC) plants are eligible for a 20 percent credit (up to a
32
     The section 29 reference price is used to determine eligibility for this credit.


                                                                                                23
maximum of $800 million in credits); other advanced coal-based projects are eligible for

a 15 percent credit (up to a maximum of $500 million in credits); and certified

gasification projects are also eligible for a 20 percent credit (maximum of $350 million in

credits). The section 45 and 48 credits combined are the single largest energy tax

expenditure in the federal budget worth $4.1 billion over a five year period.

6.        Section 40 Alcohol and Biodiesel Fuels Credit

          The Energy Policy Act of 1978 included an exemption from the motor fuels

excise tax for alcohol and alcohol blended fuels, generically known as gasohol.33 The

Windfall Profits Tax allowed an immediate tax credit in lieu of the exemption.34 The

credit was set at a rate to be equivalent to the tax exemption. The alcohol fuel mixture

credit is currently $.51 per gallon of ethanol in gasohol and $.60 for other alcohol based

fuels (excluding petroleum based alcohol fuels). In addition small producers may take a

credit of $.10 per gallon. The 2005 Energy Policy Act increased the small producer

production capacity limit from 30 million to 60 million gallons per year.

          The American Jobs Creation Act also added section 40A of the code to provide an

income tax credit for biodiesel fuels at a rate of $.50 per gallon of bio-diesel (other than

agri-biodiesel) and $1.00 for agri-biodiesel. Like the alcohol fuel tax credit, it is first

applied to motor fuel excise tax payments with the excess added to the general business

credit.




33
   Originally, the law provided a full exemption from the then $.04 per gallon tax. As the motor fuels
excise tax was raised over time, the exemption did not keep pace with the excise tax rate. See General
Accounting Office (1997) for an early chronology of events related to this tax exemption.
34
   The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 subsequently eliminated the tax exemption in favor of the tax
credit.


                                                                                                      24
Other Issues Bearing on Production and Investment Tax Credits

         Firms or individuals may not receive the full value of the production and

investment tax credits (along with other energy related tax incentives) described above

depending on the taxpayer's alternative minimum tax (AMT) status. All of these credits

are part of the general business credit. Credits included in the general business credit

may be used to the extent that they do not reduce the taxpayer's after-credit liability

below the tentative minimum tax. Note that this limitation may occur even if the

taxpayer pays no alternative minimum tax.35 According to Carlson (2005), 70 percent of

firms in the mining industry in 2002 were either in a loss or an AMT status and so unable

to avail themselves of many if not all of their tax credits.36 It is unclear how the

limitation on the use of credits under the general business credit affects investment.

D.       Tax Incentives for Electric Utilities

         Many of the tax incentives that affect the electric utility industry have to do with

accelerated depreciation and are discussed above. EPACT provided for several

additional incentives. First, electric utilities are allowed to carry back net operating

losses (NOLs) for five years (as opposed to the standard two year carry back) for an NOL

occurring in tax years 2003-2005. The NOL must be used before January 1, 2009 and the

tax refund arising from the use of the NOL is limited in any year to 20 percent of the




35
   This would occur if the taxpayer's regular tax liability after foreign tax credits but before other tax credits
exceeded the tentative minimum tax but its regular tax liability after tax credits was less than the tentative
minimum tax. Foreign tax credits are included in the tentative minimum tax and thus not subject to AMT
limitations.
36
    In addition to the AMT's impact on tax credits, the AMT treats mining exploration and development
costs, depletion including percentage depletion (unless an independent producer), and intangible drilling
costs as AMT preferences.


                                                                                                               25
utility's prior year investment in electric transmission equipment rated at 69 kV or higher

and specified pollution control equipment.37

           Second, owners of nuclear power plants are required to make contributions to a

decommissioning fund for the plant. The Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 allowed those

contributions to be tax deductible at the time of contribution if those contributions were

funded as part of the cost of service to ratepayers of regulated utilities. The cost of

service rules were repealed in EPACT so that all taxpayers, including unregulated

utilities, could deduct their contributions to decommissioning funds.

           Finally, EPACT extends a current provision allowing electric utilities who

dispose of certain transmission property to implement FERC restructuring policy to

recognize the gain over an eight year period rather than in the current year. Proceeds

from the sale must be reinvested in other utility property.

E.         Transportation

           The Energy Policy Act of 1992 allowed a 10 percent credit (up to $4,000) for the

purchase of an electric vehicle. After 2005, the maximum credit falls to $1,000 and the

credit terminates as of the end of 2006. Hybrid clean-fuel vehicles and other clean-fuel

vehicles were allowed a $2,000 deduction. These deductions and credits were replaced

by the Alternative Motor Vehicle Credit (sec. 30B) as enacted in EPACT. Section 30B

of the tax code provides a credit for fuel cell vehicles, alternate fuel vehicles (natural gas,

LNG, LPG, hydrogen, and 85 percent methanol fuel vehicles), and hybrids. The credit

depends on different vehicle attributes depending on the type of vehicle. Table 4 lists the

credit information for different fuel types.



37
     The equipment need not be placed in service in that year.


                                                                                             26

       EPACT also replaced a deduction for installing clean-fuel vehicle refueling

property with a 30 percent tax credit for property placed in service before Jan. 1, 2008.

F.     Energy Efficiency

       Prior to the passage of last year's energy legislation, the only remaining tax

incentive pertaining to energy conservation was section 136 of the tax code enacted in the

Energy Policy Act of 1992. Section 136 provides an exclusion from gross income of any

subsidies provided by an electric utility for the purchase or installation of any energy

conservation measure. EPACT provided a number of new incentives. First, the law

allows a 30 percent personal income tax credit not to exceed $2,000 for photovoltaic and

solar water heating property (excluding equipment for heating swimming pools and hot

tubs) installed at residential properties. Fuel cell power plants are also eligible for the 30

percent credit not to exceed $500 per 0.5 kW of capacity. Second, the law provides a 10

percent personal income tax credit for insulation materials, energy saving windows and

doors, and energy conserving metal roofs. In addition, taxpayers may take a credit for

specific energy efficiency appliances such as advanced main air circulating fans ($50),

furnace and hot water boilers ($150), and qualifying energy efficient property (e.g.



                                                                                            27
designated heat pumps and air conditioners) ($300) with a maximum credit per home of

$500 no more than $200 of which may be for windows. Third, contractors may take a tax

credit of $1,000 ($2,000) for new home construction that is certified to obtain a 30

percent (50 percent) reduction in energy usage.

        Fourth, commercial property energy conservation expenditures are eligible for a

deduction of costs up to $1.80 per square foot if the spending effects a 50 percent or more

reduction in energy usage. For buildings that do not achieve a 50 percent reduction, a

partial allowance is allowed based on guidelines for specific technologies to be

established by the Secretary of the Treasury. Finally, appliance manufacturers are

provided a production credit for energy-efficient dishwashers, clothes washers, and

refrigerators. The maximum credit is $100 for dishwashers, $200 for clothes washers,

and $175 for refrigerators.

V.      Incentive and Distributional Effects of Energy Tax Incentives

        Who benefits from the various taxes and tax incentives described in Sections III

and IV? And what are the impacts on energy demand and supply? In this section, I

discuss the incidence and behavioral impacts of various tax provisions.

A.      Motor Fuels Excise and Gas-Guzzler Taxes

        Consider first the incidence impact of the federal excise tax on motor fuels.

Doyle and Samphantharak (2006) find that roughly 80 percent of increases in state sales

taxes on gasoline are passed forward to consumers. This is consistent with other studies

and likely underestimates the shifting of federal excise taxes to consumers given state-

level competition.38 Gasoline taxes are generally viewed as regressive. This view is


38
  Doyle and Samphanthark report other studies showing complete forward shifting of federal motor fuel
taxes.


                                                                                                        28
confirmed by Poterba (1991) when households are ranked by annual income. But when

ranked by current expenditures as a proxy for lifetime income, Poterba finds that gasoline

taxes are much less regressive.

         Assessing the gas guzzler tax is more difficult. Surprisingly few studies of the

gas guzzler tax have been carried out that take the light truck loophole into account.

Greene et al. (2005) undertake simulations of a gas-guzzler tax and find that removing

the exemption for light trucks increases mileage for these vehicles as manufacturers

cluster vehicles (both passenger cars and light trucks) just above the miles per gallon

cutoff for the tax. Their study hold all characteristics other than fuel economy and price

constant. Thus, the recent phenomenon of using engine improvements to obtain higher

power and performance at the expense of fuel efficiency cannot be modeled in their

analysis.

B.       Oil and Natural Gas Production Incentives

         Turning to production and investment tax incentives, consider first oil and natural

gas production. The favorable treatment accorded oil producers and refiners lowers the

cost of oil and could affect prices of final petroleum products. But since oil is priced in

world markets and to a great extent is a homogenous product, it is not clear that the

domestic tax incentives would have a large impact on the price of gasoline or other

petroleum products.39 In this case, the benefits largely accrue to producers in the form of

higher wages for specialized workers in oil production and refining and higher dividends

to shareholders.




39
  Oil differs in its transportation costs as well as product characteristics (sulfur content, viscosity, etc.) In
the long run, however, these cost and characteristic differences have little impact on the final product costs.


                                                                                                              29
        It may be, however, that the U.S. supply incentives have an impact on worldwide

supply and price given the magnitude of U.S. oil production. As noted in footnote 5, the

United States is the third largest producer of oil with 8.5 percent of the world's

production in 2004. A simple rough calculation suggests however that the U.S. supply

incentives are unlikely to have a large impact on world oil prices or supply. Let QS* be

the world supply of oil, and QS the U.S. supply (with analogous variables defined for oil

demand). Also let ps and p̂ s be the price received by U.S. oil suppliers and oil suppliers

in the rest of the world, respectively. Finally, let p D = pˆ s = p s − s be the worldwide

demand price and s the subsidy arising from tax incentives provided to domestic oil

suppliers. Setting world oil supply equal to demand and differentiating, we obtain the

The tax incentives for oil (percentage depletion and expensing of IDCs) are most

valuable for small producers. Taking the oil industry as a group, let us say that the value

The supply response ranges from zero to 0.3 percent with 0.2 percent the response

associated with the central parameter value assumptions. Table 6 shows that the price

response is also small:

The price decline ranges from 0.1 percent to 0.7 percent with a central parameter

response of 0.4 percent.

        To some extent, a similar story can be made for natural gas. Natural gas is not as

easily transportable as oil and regional price differences can persist over time.




41
  This is a high estimate. The GAO estimates for FY2003 tax preferences for the section 29 and enhanced
oil recovery credits, the excess of percentage over cost depletion, expensing of IDCs, and the rules on
passive loss limitations equal just over 2 percent of the value of domestic crude oil and natural gas
production in that year.


                                                                                                     31
Improvements in transportation and the increase in LNG shipping, however, are breaking

down these regional barriers.42

        This analysis is consistent with a recent analysis of a precursor bill to the Energy

Policy Act of 2005 done by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (2004). This

report reviewed section 29 and 45 tax credits along with other production incentive tax

provisions and concluded that with the exception of the section 29 credits, the provisions

did little to increase domestic production of gas or oil. Section 29 credits would increase

domestic natural gas from non-conventional sources (coalbed methane for the most part).

Ultimately, domestic consumption would be unaffected by these provisions.

        Recall the discussion of national security as a rationale for an energy tax policy.

The analysis in this section suggests that the production and investment tax credits

embodied in current law will have little effect on world production or on efforts to

stabilize domestic energy prices. Where a policy to encourage domestic production of

energy may be effective is to increase the proportion of energy that is not subject to

supply disruptions due to political upheaval. But here the rationale is a bit murky. Many

of the tax incentives encourage the production of electricity from nuclear or renewable

sources. But currently only 3 percent of oil is used for electricity production. It may well

be that concerns about natural gas disruptions motivate these policies (natural gas

accounts for 24 percent of electricity production). Natural gas however is more subject to

price spikes arising from bottlenecks in production and distribution than from political

shocks. A concern with oil supply disruptions would suggest a focus on reducing

  Natural gas imports as a percentage of total U.S. consumption have risen from 4.7 percent in 1980 to
15.3 percent in 2004 (U.S. Energy Information Administration (2005)).

C.       Electric Generation from Alternative and Renewable Fuels

         The production and investment credits for renewable and alternative fuels can

have a large impact on whether various electric generation technologies are cost

competitive in the marketplace. With the shift from regulated utilities to an environment

in which electricity generation is increasingly unregulated, cost considerations become

increasingly important for firms contemplating constructing merchant power plants. In

this section, I present estimates of the levelized cost for different sources of electricity

under varying assumptions about the availability of federal tax incentives.

         The levelized cost analysis is similar in spirit to the Hall-Jorgenson cost of capital

framework. It asks what price must be received for electricity sold by a generator to

cover fixed and variable costs of providing the electricity including the required return

for equity owners.43 This approach has been used in a variety of studies of electric power

generation (e.g. Deutch and Moniz (2003), Tolley and Jones (2004), and Sekar et al.

(2005)). The steps to constructing an estimate of levelized cost are:

     •   Compute the present discounted value of costs in each year over life of a project.
         This includes all capital and operating costs net of tax deductions.
     •   Sum all costs over life of project. This is the present discounted value of the
         project’s overall costs.
     •   Compute the amount of constant real before-tax revenue required each year that
         will equal the total present discounted value of costs over the life of the project.
     •   Divide this required revenue value by total kilowatt-hours produced by plant to
         obtain a cost per kWh.




43
  The price is a constant real price received over the life of the plant to cover lifetime fixed and variable
costs.


                                                                                                                33
         I estimate the levelized cost for the following eight electricity generation sources:

nuclear, conventional (pulverized) coal, clean coal using an integrated gasification

combined cycle (IGCC) process, natural gas combined cycle, biomass, wind, solar

thermal, and photovoltaics. The first three technologies are generally used as baseload

generators and the latter are either shoulder or peaking generators.

         Table 7 provides key parameter value choices for the eight different

technologies.44 The capacity factor describes what fraction of the time a plant is

operating. Nuclear power plants are designed to operate continuously but are shut down

for routine and unexpected maintenance. The capacity factor for nuclear power is taken

from Deutch and Moniz (2003). I've chosen capacity factors for coal and natural gas to

be comparable to nuclear. The capacity factors for the renewable resources are for the

most part taken from the Energy Information Administration's National Energy Modeling

System (NEMS).45

         The overnight cost is the total capital construction cost of the plant in year 2004

dollars. Construction costs are covered with short-term debt financing until the plant

goes into service. At that point, ten year bonds are issued and equity financing raised to

cover those costs. I've assumed 60 percent debt financing on all projects except nuclear.

I assume a lower debt financing rate of 50 percent to acknowledge the greater perceived

risk of nuclear financing in the marketplace. The economic life of these assets varies and

they have a MACRS recovery period of five to fifteen years. Finally, I assume that the



44
   See Appendix A for a complete listing of parameter values and additional detail about the calculations.
These parameter values should be viewed with some caution. A degree of uncertainty underlies many of
the values. The overnight cost for nuclear power, for example, is highly uncertain given the limited recent
experience with construction in the United States and the uncertainties of the regulatory process.
45
   I have not adjusted the wind and solar capacity factors to account for the intermittency of these power
sources.

Source: See Appendix

               Table 8 reports levelized costs of electricity in cents per kWh (year 2004 dollars).

      I assume that the plant will be placed in service after Jan. 1, 2006 so that solar power is

      not eligible for a production tax credit but does obtain the more generous 30 percent

      section 48 investment tax credit.46 The first column provides the levelized cost under

      current law. Coal has the lowest levelized cost with the cost of IGCC comparable to that

      of a conventional pulverized coal plant given the new investment tax incentive for IGCC

      enacted in EPACT. Nuclear and natural gas are the next most expensive followed by

      biomass and wind.47 Either of the solar generating plants are considerably more

      expensive than other electricity sources with photovoltaics (PV) over four times the cost

      of natural gas. Note that wind and solar are intermittent power sources and so require


      46
        I have not assumed any limitations on credits from the Alternative Minimum Tax in Table 8.
      47
        Given the cost differential between coal and nuclear, the current interest in nuclear power reflects in part
      a bet that a U.S. carbon policy will eventually raise the cost of coal power plants.

that the requirement for stand-by power raised the cost of onshore wind power by nearly

50 percent. I have not factored such costs into this analysis.

        kWh at year 2004 prices.

         Comparing the first two columns, eliminating the section 45 production tax credit

only modestly raises the cost of biomass and wind (4 percent cost increase) but raises the

cost of nuclear by nearly 30 percent. Next, eliminating the section 48 investment tax

credits raises the cost of the IGCC plant by 15 percent and the cost of solar by over 35

percent.

         Column 4 reports levelized costs assuming the various production and investment

tax credits but replacing the accelerated depreciation with economic depreciation

(modeled as straight-line depreciation) over the asset's life.48 Accelerated depreciation is


48
   I've also modeled economic depreciation for the assets according to the depreciation rates estimated by
Fraumeni (1997) in a modified one-hoss-shay model. I assume geometric depreciation using Fraumeni's
rates over the life of the asset with all remaining basis depreciated in the final year. The levelized costs
under this approach are very similar to those calculated when economic depreciation is modeled as straight-
line.


                                                                                                         36
most generous to wind and solar generated electricity. Replacing accelerated

depreciation with economic depreciation would raise the cost of wind and solar thermal

by 13 percent and PV by 15 percent. For the other fuel sources, replacing accelerated

depreciation with economic depreciation would raise the cost of nuclear by 9 percent,

biomass by 8 percent, coal by 7 percent and natural gas by 2 percent.

       Column 5 reports levelized costs assuming a tax system that provides a level

playing field. This scenario assumes economic depreciation and no production or

investment tax credits. In terms of the impact on levelized cost, conventional coal and

natural gas receive the fewest tax preferences. Leveling the playing field raises the cost

of biomass by 11 percent with the bulk of the benefit arising from accelerated

depreciation (based on a comparison of columns 2 through 4 with 5). The cost of wind is

higher by 16 percent with the majority of the benefit arising from accelerated

depreciation. The cost of IGCC is higher by 23 percent with roughly two-thirds of the

benefit arising from the investment tax credit. The cost of nuclear is higher by 38 percent

with the production tax credit providing the bulk of the benefits. Finally, the cost of solar

is by over 50 to 60 percent higher with about two-thirds of the benefit arising from the

production tax credits.

       In the final column, I compute levelized costs assuming zero taxes. While the

levelized cost of most technologies falls, the cost of nuclear and solar rises indicating that

these technologies face a negative effective average tax rate. Eliminating taxes raises the

cost of nuclear by 6 percent and solar by 13 to 16 percent.

       From a social welfare perspective, the production and investment tax credits are

costly ways to encourage renewable electricity generation since the subsidies must be




                                                                                           37
financed by raising distortionary taxes. An alternative approach to encouraging

renewable electricity generation would be to place a tax on traditional fuels.49 As a final

calculation, I computed the levelized cost of biomass and wind assuming no investment

or production tax credits. In this case, the levelized costs of biomass and wind are 5.56¢

and 5.91¢ per kWh respectively. A tax on carbon dioxide of $12 per metric ton would

raise the price of natural gas sufficiently to make biomass and wind cost-competitive with

natural gas. Unlike the subsidies, however, the tax would raise revenue which could

finance reductions in other distortionary taxes.50 In units perhaps more familiar to most

readers, a carbon tax of this magnitude would raise the price of gasoline by ten cents if it

were fully passed forward to consumers.

         Summing up, relative to a world with no taxes the current tax code provides net

subsidies to nuclear and solar power. Relative to a tax system with a level playing field,

conventional technologies receive very modest subsidies while subsidies for nuclear and

clean coal are substantial and the subsidies for solar very substantial. The subsidies are

most effective (in the sense of making electricity competitive from this source) for IGCC

plants which become competitive with conventional coal and for biomass and wind

which become competitive with natural gas.

(2005) argue that portfolio standards are more cost effective at achieving given renewable shares in
electricity generation than production tax credits given the social cost of raising revenue to finance the
subsidies. Note too the different incidence of production tax credits and renewable portfolio standards.
The former are borne by taxpayers while the latter are borne by electricity consumers in the form of higher
electricity prices.
50
   Metcalf (2005) discusses how a carbon tax could be used to finance corporate tax integration. The
advantage of taxes over subsidies for clean power extend beyond the distortionary cost of financing the
subsidies. The subsidies lower the cost of electricity and so encourage increased consumption.

D.       Energy Efficiency

         The energy efficiency incentives contained in EPACT are similar in many ways to

energy tax credits contained in the Energy Tax Act of 1978, including a 15 percent tax

credit (up to $300) for residential energy conservation improvements. Analyzing a panel

of federal tax returns between 1979 and 1985 when the residential conservation credit

expired, Hassett and Metcalf (1995) found that the credit significantly raised the

probability of a household installing energy conservation capital in their home.

Somewhat surprisingly, the authors found that the credit was much more successful at

raising investment levels than a comparable energy price increase. They speculated that

the credit program may have publicity effects that spur investment that the energy price

increase does not have. The study was not able to determine to what extent credit takers

were inframarginal investors, that is homeowners who would have made conservation

investments in the absence of the tax credit.51

VI.      Conclusion

         Tax incentives are a major part of the federal government's energy tax policy and

increasingly so with the passage of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. A number of points

emerge from this analysis. First, the focus of energy incentives contained in the tax code

has shifted over the years from focusing almost entirely on traditional fossil fuel

production to an increasing emphasis on alternative and renewable technologies. Second,

those incentives are difficult to rationalize on the basis of economic efficiency or

distributional goals. Production and investment tax credits, in particular, may be very

costly ways to encourage the development of renewable energy technology.

51
  In the energy conservation literature, this is referred to as free-riding. See Metcalf (2006) for a
discussion of behavioral responses to energy conservation initiatives and the difficulty in assessing the
cost-effectiveness of these programs.


                                                                                                            39
       Third, incentives for the oil and natural gas industry are unlikely to have an

appreciable impact on world energy prices despite the United States being the third

largest oil producer in the world (and second largest natural gas producer). Fourth,

current tax incentives are making wind and biomass cost competitive with natural gas

electricity production. The 20 percent investment tax credit for IGCC in EPACT is likely

to make this technology cost competitive with conventional coal generated electricity.

Solar generated electricity continues to be very expensive.

       Fifth, the limited evidence suggests that the energy efficiency incentives enacted

by EPACT should increase conservation investment activity. It is difficult to say,

however, how much of this investment will be new investment as opposed to investment

that would have taken place in the absence of the incentive programs. To the extent that

inframarginal investment is a significant fraction of total investment, the cost-

effectiveness of this incentive is driven down. But of course this is true for all of the

energy incentives described in this paper and suggests the importance of further research

on the behavioral impacts of energy tax incentives.

       Appendix.        Calculating the Levelized Cost of Electric Power Generating Plants

               The levelized cost of a electricity generating power plant is the price per kWh that

       the plant must receive for electricity sold that will cover all costs of production including

       a return to equity holders. I construct levelized costs for various technologies for a

       hypothetical power plant with a 1,000 MW capacity.52 Table A1 provides a full list of

       the plant-specific parameters used in the analysis.

       In addition, I assumed an inflation rate of 3 percent, a combined federal and state tax rate

       of 40 percent, a nominal bond return of 8 percent and a nominal return to equity of 15

       percent.

               Most plant-specific parameter values are taken from the U.S. Energy Information

       Administration (2006) Annual Energy Outlook (AEO). Fuel costs are based on projected

       52
         Many renewable plants are built at considerably smaller capacity. The cost assumptions used here are
       based on a plant of optimal size. My approach follows that of Sekar, et al. (2005).


                                                                                                                41
fuel costs from the AEO which assumes real growth in fuel prices over the forty year

expected life of all power plants. The debt-equity ratio for nuclear and coal is based on

assumptions in Deutch and Moniz (2003) and I assume the same ratio for renewables as

for coal. Periodic capital spending is required for all technologies for capital additions

and upgrades. AEO assumes increased capital upgrade spending in the last ten years of

the plant's life. For simplicity I treat these expenditures as operating expenditures rather

than capitalize them over the remaining life of the plant. The economic life of the

various plants is taken from The Royal Academy of Engineering (2004). I also use this

source for the capacity factor for wind based on its analysis of wind production in

Europe.

The steps required for this calculation are:

   1. Compute the present discounted value of costs in each year over life of a project.
      This includes all capital and operating costs net of tax deductions.
   2. Sum all costs over life of project. This is the present discounted value of the
      project’s costs.
   3. Compute the amount of constant real before-tax revenue required each year that
      will equal the total present discounted value of costs over the life of the project.
   4. Divide this required revenue value by total kilowatt-hours produced by plant to
      obtain a cost per kWh.
       Construction time differs across the technologies. I assume construction costs

follow a sinusoidal pattern (increasing, peaking, and then declining) over the time period

with plant construction beginning in 2005. To illustrate how construction costs are

handled, consider a nuclear power plant built over six years. Table A2 provides the data

for an overnight cost of $2,014 per kW.




                                                                                             42

                            Total 2014      1872          2484

The overnight cost for the plant is distributed over the six year construction period with

construction costs peaking mid-way through the construction period. Spending is

converted to nominal dollars using the last year of construction as the base year.

Nominal cash flows are discounted using the firm's discount rate (column 3). These

discounted numbers enter the summation in step 2. Once the plant begins operation fixed

and operating costs (including fuel costs, maintenance, nuclear decommissioning costs,

capital increments, bond interest payments, and taxes) are summed and the discounted to

year zero values. Depreciation and bond interest costs are allowed as a tax deduction and

so reduce the costs by the value of the tax shield (tax rate times deduction).

       The sum of the present discounted costs is converted to a real levelized cost that is

a constant real annual payment by the firm to cover all costs. For the nuclear power

plant, the constant real annual before-tax revenue required to match the sum of the

present discounted costs (including the value of the tax shields) over the life of the plant

is $321 million per year.

       Finally in step 4 this is converted to a cost per kWh. Total annual production for

the plant is the number of hours in the year times its capacity factor. Dividing this into



                                                                                             43
the annual levelized cost yields a cost per kWh. Based on a capacity factor of 85 percent,

the annual $321 million cost translates to a real levelized cost of 4.31¢ per kWh.
