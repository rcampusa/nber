                                         ABSTRACT

In this paper, we compute conditional measures of lead-lag relationships between GDP growth
and industry-level cash-flow growth in the US. Our results show that firms in leading industries
pay an average annualized return 4% higher than that of firms in lagging industries. Using both
time series and cross sectional tests, we estimate an annual timing premium ranging from 1.5% to
2%. This finding can be rationalized in a model in which (a) agents price growth news shocks,
and (b) leading industries provide valuable resolution of uncertainty about the growth prospects
of lagging industries.

1       Introduction

Different macroeconomic aggregates go through economic cycles with different timings (see,
among others, Stock and Watson 1989, 2002; and Estrella and Mishkin 1998). Variables
that respond promptly to exogenous shocks are denoted as “leading,” whereas variables that
adjust with delay are called “lagging.”1 Thus far, the empirical macroeconomic literature
has focused mainly on leads and lags of aggregate indicators. Little is yet known about leads
and lags across firms operating in different segments of the economy.
    In this paper, we document the existence of a significant lead-lag structure in fundamen-
tal cash flows across industries. This structure is relevant to the explanation of the cross
section of stock returns, as leading industries pay a higher average stock return than lagging
industries, in the order of about 4% per year. After controlling for heterogenous exposure to
a large number of aggregate risk factors, we obtain an estimate of the pure timing premium,
i.e., the premium on advance information (Ai and Bansal, 2018), ranging from 1.5% to 2%
per year.2
    Specifically, we construct a risk factor by considering a zero-dollar investment strategy
long in a portfolio of leading industries and short in a portfolio of lagging industries. We
denote the returns of this portfolio as the LL factor. Formal tests show that LL is a relevant
factor both in the time series and in many cross sections of equity returns, including that of
industry portfolio returns (in contrast to the factors considered by, e.g., Fama and French
1997). This result holds after controlling for many other aggregate factors (see, e.g., Gomes
et al. 2009) and suggests that leads and lags in the diffusion of fundamental shocks across
industries are an important dimension of equity pricing. Equivalently, the information timing
premium appears sizeable.
    More broadly, our results provide additional and independent empirical evidence in favor
    1
      For example, both bond yields and the stock market index tend to be leading indicators with respect
to domestic output, as they forecast future recessions and booms. Unemployment, in contrast, is a lagging
indicator.

      Consider a risk factor Ft , a leading firm (or sector) with cash flow growth ∆dLead
                                                                                      t    = µ + λLead Ft , and
                                                            Lag           Lag
a lagging firm (or industry) with cash flow growth ∆dt          = µ + λ Ft−LL . The leading premium is a
convolution of heterogeneous timing of exposure, LL, and heterogenous exposure λLag 6= λLead . We control
for heterogenous exposure by considering several cycle-related risk factors and refer to the residual difference
in the cost of equity of the two stocks, or sectors, as the (pure) timing premium.

of the relevance of advance information in the spirit of Ai and Bansal (2018). Consistent
with this observation, we show that our findings are an anomaly in a model with time-
additive preferences, whereas a model with news shocks and preferences for early resolution
of uncertainty explains our cross-sectional results. This is because leading industries pro-
vide valuable anticipated resolution of uncertainty for industries that go through aggregate
economic fluctuations with delay. As a result, lagging firms bear less conditional cash-flow
uncertainty and, by no arbitrage, ceteris paribus have a higher price (or, equivalently, a lower
yield). Leading firms, in contrast, play the role of early indicators like canaries in a coal
mine and pay a higher equity yield.
  More specifically, we compute rolling-window correlations between US output growth and
leads and lags of operating income growth at an industry level. Data are quarterly and span
the period 1972–2012. We consider 17,000 firms, which we aggregate to industries using the
industry classification scheme obtained from Kenneth French’s website.3 In each quarter, we
compute cross-correlagrams and aggregate leads and lags in three different ways as described
below in Section 2. We then assign the corresponding lead/lag indicator to the industry of
interest. Note that this approach uses only past data to compute the cross-correlograms,
and hence it can be used to construct an implementable investment strategy in real-time.
  This procedure gives us a panel of quarterly leading-lagging indicators spanning 41 years
of data. In each sample period, we find sizable heterogeneity in these indicators across our
industries. Focusing on individual industries, we also observe considerable fluctuations in
the time series of their lead and lag indicators, i.e., an industry may be leading in a specific
period, but lagging in another. As an example, the firms leading during an IT boom do not
necessarily lead during a financial crisis. We formalize this idea in a multisector economy
in which cash flows are affected by infrequently arriving shocks that slowly diffuse across all
sectors and turn into aggregate cash flow growth shocks.
  We then sort our firms according to their industry-level lead-lag indicator and form three
portfolios, which are dynamically updated at a quarterly frequency. In each quarter, we

                                               2
make sure that the extreme portfolios have a market capitalization share of at least 15%,
so that our results are not driven by a subset of small and illiquid firms. According to this
standard procedure, we find a monotonic positive relation between the average returns and
the leading indicators of our portfolios. Our LL factor has an annualized average return
of 4%, which remains sizeable and significant in the time-series after controlling for a large
number of aggregate factors.
  Furthermore, we show that our findings are statistically significant after double-sorting on
LL exposure and either the book-to-market ratio or size, implying that the LL premium is a
broad phenomenon in the cross section. We also show that our risk factor is not subsumed
by other cyclical factors such as investment minus consumption (Kogan and Papanikolaou
2014), durability (Gomes et al. 2009), industry-momentum (Moskowitz and Grinblatt 1999),
industry betting-against-beta (Asness et al. 2014), the five factors suggested by Fama and
French 2015, the q-Factors (Hou et al. 2015a, b), and momentum (Carhart 1997).
  A simple no arbitrage argument shows that our leading premium should be related to
the forward equity yield on leading industry dividends (Binsbergen et al. 2013). This result
is important because it suggests that models that produce a substantial positive spread
between bond and zero-coupon equity yields may rationalize the portion of the leading
premium driven by the timing premium. Since our empirical evidence shows that lagging
firms tend to have smoother long-run dividend growth, we choose a setting sensitive to
growth news shocks (Bansal and Yaron 2004).
  We acknowledge that lagging firms can learn from the fundamentals of leading firms and
adjust their investment decisions to endogenously alter their pay outs (see, among others,
Albuquerque and Miao 2014). For the sake of tractability, however, we abstract away from
investment decisions and consider the endowment economy of Bansal et al. (2005), in which
stocks are allowed to have heterogenous exposure to long-run shocks. Consistent with our
empirical evidence, we allow lagging stocks to be less exposed to growth news shocks. We
use this model to price a cross section of cash flows that differ from each other also in their
lead-lag structure, with the goal of quantifying how much of both our timing and leading



                                              3
premiums we can explain.
   The relevance of this step is twofold. On the one hand, we identify the lead-lag structure of
cash flows and better characterize the composition of the representative agent’s information
set, that is, we identify how much advance information the agent can obtain from the leading
cash flows. On the other hand, this procedure shows that a substantial part of our measured
timing and leading premiums may be explained by our equilibrium model.
   We conclude our analysis with a counterfactual experiment designed to quantify the wel-
fare value of the advance information provided by the leading industries. Specifically, we
look at an economy calibrated as in our benchmark case, where we simply remove future
long-run consumption growth news from the information set of the agent. Put differently,
we retain the same amount of consumption long-run risk, but we pretend that there is no
leading portfolio providing advance information about it. We find that the welfare benefits
of the information stemming from our cross section of industries are worth 6% of life-time
consumption. In order to correctly interpret this result, we run the Lucas (1987) experiment
in our economy and find that the welfare benefits of removing all uncertainty are in the
order of 65%.4 Therefore, the advance information that we identify in the cross section of
industries represents less than 10% of the maximum attainable welfare benefits.
   Epstein et al. (2014) point out that in the Bansal and Yaron (2004) model, the Lucas
welfare benefits originate mainly from full resolution of uncertainty, not from the removal
of deterministic fluctuations. Our computations show that early resolution of uncertainty in
the cross section of industries is simultaneously valuable but limited, as it carries a strong
market price of risk but reveals future long-run consumption dynamics over a relatively short
horizon.


Related literature. As mentioned above, prior papers have already documented that
heterogeneous exposure to contemporaneous news shocks can explain many cross sections
of equity returns (see, among others, Bansal et al. 2005). We differ from prior studies by
  4
     This figure is much smaller than that in Ai (2007) and Croce (2013), as our consumption process is
calibrated according to post-1972 data, i.e., its volatility is moderate.

showing that heterogeneous timing of exposure to news shocks explains a substantial share
of the leading premium.
  Kadan and Manela (2016) estimate the value of information using options. We empir-
ically quantify the relevance of heterogeneity in the timing of exposure of cash flows to
aggregate shocks for the cross section of equity returns. Our results are significant beyond
announcement events (Patton and Verado 2012, Savor and Wilson 2013, 2016).
  Koijen et al. (2017) show that the Cochrane and Piazzesi (2005) factor is a strong pre-
dictor of economic activity, with a lead of up to 10 quarters relative to GDP growth. They
provide evidence suggesting that book-to-market-sorted stocks contain information about
future growth. Similarly to them, we show that the price-dividend ratio of leading firms
forecasts economic activity, even after controlling for other common predictors.
  Hong et al. (2007) investigate whether high-frequency industry returns can forecast excess
returns on the CRSP market index. They find evidence of predictability, but only on very
short horizons of one or two months. In contrast to previous studies, our empirical investi-
gation is based on cash-flow fundamentals and focuses on longer time horizons. As a result,
we are silent about the speed at which prices fully embody available information (Hou 2007,
Cohen and Frazzini 2008). In our model, our endogenous cross section of returns features no
lead-lag structure, that is, all returns move simultaneously, but with different endogenous
sensitivities. On the other side, our attention on leads and lags across industry-level cash
flows is broad and does not hinge on specific network links, like for example customer-to-
supplier (Cohen and Frazzini 2008) or intermediate-to-final-producer (Gofman et al. 2017).
  By no-arbitrage, the portion of the leading premium driven by the timing premium de-
pends on the spread between the equity and the risk-free bond yield curve. Richer settings
like those suggested by Lettau and Wachter (2007, 2011), and Belo et al. (2014) are consis-
tent with the empirical evidence in Binsbergen et al. (2012), Binsbergen et al. (2013), and
Binsbergen and Koijen (2017), but they would produce similar insights about the nature of
the leading premium.
  In the next section we provide intuition on our way to think of leads and lags across



                                             5
sectors. We present the setup and results of our empirical analysis in section 3. In Section
4 we describe our model. Section 5 concludes.



2     Measuring Leads and Lags

In this section, we discuss the measures that we adopt to identify leading and lagging indus-
tries. Since these measures are quite common in the macroeconomic literature, the readers
familiar with cross-correlograms may want to go directly to the next section.
    Consider the cash flow growth of industry i, ∆CF i , and allow it to have a possibly time-
varying lead-lag relation with output growth, ∆GDP . One way to identify the lead-lag link
between aggregate output and the cash flow of this industry is to compute the following
cross-correlogram over J periods


                                       [ρit,−J ...ρit,0 ...ρit,+J ]


where
                              ρit,j = corr{t−T →t} (∆GDPt , ∆CFt−j
                                                                i
                                                                   )

is computed on a rolling window with T > J observations. Since the cross-correlogram is of
dimension 1 + 2J, we use the following three ways to collapse it to a scalar, so that stocks
can be easily sorted on it.


Maximum cross-correlation. Our first way to define our lead/lag indicator (LL) is


                                      LLit = arg max |ρit,j |,
                                                −J≤j≤J



i.e., the lead or lag for which the cross-correlation between cash flow and GDP growth peaks
in absolute value. As an example, assume that (i) ∆GDPt follows an AR(1) with persistence
                        i
0 < ρ < 1, and (ii) ∆CFt−5 = −∆GDPt , so that GDP lags by a fixed delay and with opposite
sign. In this case, ρit,j = −ρ|j−5| and LLit = +5, that is, our indicator detects that the cash



                                                    6
flow is leading aggregate output by 5 periods. This measure is consistent with the lead/lag
assumptions in our simple asset pricing model in section 4.


Industry-level weighted average of leads and lags. When cash-flows and GDP do not
follow AR(1) processes, the previous measure may not be appropriate as it may disregard
information contained in the the whole cross-correlogram. One way to resolve this problem
is to have an indicator that takes into account all possible leads and lags and gives more
weight to the ones for which the cross-correlation is stronger in absolute value:

                                            J
                                            X           |ρit,j |
                                 LLit   =          PJ         i
                                                                        · j.
                                            j=−J       j=−J |ρt,j |



Cross-industry weighted index of leads and lags. Another possible concern about the
maximum correlation approach is that it does not adjust by the different predictive power
that different industries may have. As an extreme example, one industry may lead GDP by
four periods with a cross-correlation of 0.90 and be a much better predictor of GDP than
an industry leading by four periods with a cross-correlation of 0.40. In order to address this
concern, we also compute
                                             J
                                             X          |ρit,j |
                                 LLit   =          PN                   · j,
                                            j=−J       k=1   |ρkt,j |

where the weight assigned to lead/lag j of industry i depends on the cross-correlation of all
of the other industries for the same lead/lag.


2.1    Intuition in a Simple Diffusion Model

Before proceeding with our empirical investigation, we introduce a simple diffusion model to
provide intuition about our our way to identify conditionally leading and lagging industries.
This model is stylized in many dimensions and is not meant to perfectly describe the data.
Rather, our goal is to show that our cross-correlations have the potential to identify leading
and lagging sectors when shocks diffuse across sectors connected in a network.
  Consider an economy with i = 1, ..., N ≥ 3 industries. In each industry, the cash flow



                                                   7
growth rate is subject to both economy-wide short-run shocks, c,t ∼ N (0, σsr ), and a per-
sistent industry-specific growth component:


                                                   Sti = ρSt−1
                                                           i
                                                               + ix,t .

Consistent the simple example depicted in Figure 1(a), f (i, j) is the index of a sector which
is j units of distance (positive or negative) away from sector i. The sole purpose of the
structure for f (i, j) shown above is to make sure that the circle is actually closed, i.e., that
sector N is to the immediate left of sector 1. We assume that a shock to sector i propagates
symmetrically to the sectors located to both the right and the left of sector i with a certain
delay. This means that it takes j periods for a shock originated in either location f (i, −j)
or f (i, j) to reach sector i.
   Given this notation, we specify the growth rate of the cash-flow of firm i as follows:

        (a) Diffusion Example                                (b) Simulation from Diffusion Model

                                  Fig. 1: A Simple Diffusion Model
This figure depicts a quarterly simulation from the diffusion model described in Section 2.1. The
lead-lag (LL) indicator indicator is computed in two steps. First, for each sector, in each quarter we
compute the ±5-quarter cross-correlation between industry-level output growth and the domestic
output growth using 40-quarter rolling windows (ρit,t−l , l = −5, ..., 5). Second, we compute the
following weighted average of the leads and lags using the absolute value of the cross-correlations:
                                             +5
                                             X          |ρit,t+j |

A positive (negative) LL indicator denotes an industry whose output growth leads (lags) GDP
growth. Grey bars denote periods following a substantial shock to either sector 1 or 11.


and define aggregate GDP as:
                                                         N
                                                         X
                                                  Yt =         Dti .
                                                         i=1

We choose our parameters in order to replicate key properties of US GDP. Specifically, the
quarterly drift µ is set to 0.50% to have a 2% annual growth. We choose ρ = .90 as in our
equilibrium model. To be consistent with our baseline cross section of industries, we choose
N = 31. We set q = 5% so only a minority of our industries receive long-run shocks in a
given period and lead future GDP expected growth. The parameters σsr and J are jointly
chosen to match an annualized volatility of GDP growth of 2.3% and an autocorrelation of
0.21.
   We show a representative quarterly simulation of this model in Figure 1(b). We focus on



                                                         9
both aggregate output and the cash flows of industry 1 and 11, that is, industries that are
affected by long-run growth shocks with a time difference of 10 periods.
  For illustrative purposes only, we assume that industry 1 is affected by a pronounced
positive shock at time 20 and that industry 11 is affected by a pronounced negative shock
at time 80. This allows us to know exactly which industry will leading, even if we are
simulating a wide cross section with a total of 31 sectorial shocks. Equivalently, we think of
these shocks as a way to depict impulse responses away from the regular simulation paths.
In the graphs we use shaded areas to highlight the twenty quarters following the arrival of
these two special shocks.
  In the top-left panel of Figure 1(b) we show the path of output growth. Over the quarterly
frequency, it is mainly driven by short-run shocks and it barely simultaneously responds to
individual sectorial shocks. Expected output growth, instead, is quite sensitive to sectorial
long-run growth dynamics as they diffuse across sectors (top-right panel). Since the diffusion
of shocks through the economy is slow, the full response of aggregate expected growth mani-
fests itself with a significant lag. As an example, consider the positive (negative) shock given
to industry 1 (industry 11) at time 20 (time 80). The growth rate of industry 1 (industry
11) leads the peak (trough) of aggregate growth by (N − 1)/2 = 15 quarters. The cash flow
of industry 11 (industry 1) lags that of industry 1 (industry 11) by 10 periods.
  As shown in the bottom panels of Figure 1(b), our LL indicator is able to correctly pick up
leading cash flows. Although with some noise due to the small data window that we employ,
the LL indicator of industry 1 starts to increase within a few quarters from the realization
of our positive shocks. For about 20 quarters, industry 1 is correctly identified as strongly
leading GDP growth. The same holds with industry 11, since it is identified as leading the
recession episode occurring after period 80. Simultaneously, during this recession industry 1
is classified as lagging industry because its LL indicator declines.
  Summarizing, even though all industries are all ex-ante identical, in our network they are
ex-post either lagging or leading the growth cycle. Our lead-lag indicators can capture this
feature in a very parsimonious and flexible way. We acknowledge that in very long samples



                                              10
a vector autoregression with time-varying coefficients may convey all of the relevant network
information dynamics. In relatively short samples with a large cross section, however, esti-
mating such a high-dimensional VAR with sufficient precision appears extremely challenging.
We think of cross-correlograms as a useful non-parametric alternative tool.



3     Empirical Investigation

Data sources. In our empirical analysis, we use monthly stock returns from CRSP as well
as the corresponding quarterly data from COMPUSTAT for the period from from 1972:01
to 2012:12. The quarterly data coverage in COMPUSTAT prior to 1972 is too limited
for our investigation. We group firms into 30 industries following the classification scheme
available on Kenneth French’s website. We start by computing industry-level output by
aggregating firms’ operating income before depreciation and net of interest expenses, income
taxes, and dividends (as in Acharya et al. (2014)). We also employ alternative measures
in our robustness exercises, which we will describe in detail in the next sections. We use
dummy variables to remove seasonality. We gather aggregate US consumption and output
data from the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA). All variables are seasonally
adjusted and in real units. Inflation is computed using the Consumer Price Index (CPI).


LL indicators. For each industry, in each quarter we compute the ±4-quarter cross-
correlation between industry-level output growth and the domestic output growth using
20-quarter rolling windows. According to the methods described in the previous section,
we then compute conditional quarterly lead-lag measures for each industry. This procedure
generates a panel of industry-level lead-lag (LL) indicators spanning 41 years.
    To provide economic guidance about our measure, in Figure 2 we report our industry-level
weighted average LL indicators for the IT, the real estate, and the finance industries starting
from 1995. We focus on these industries because they have been important drivers of the
last two main economic cycles in the US, and hence they represent a natural reference point
for our methodology.

                 Fig. 2: Lead-Lag Indicator for Selected Industries
This figure depicts the lead-lag (LL) indicator for three major industries. The LL indicator is
computed in two steps. First, for each industry, in each quarter we compute the ±4-quarter cross-
correlation between industry-level output growth and the domestic output growth using 20-quarter
rolling windows. Second, we compute the industry-level weighted average of leads and lags and
assign it to the corresponding industry as its LL indicator. A positive (negative) LL indicator
denotes an industry whose output growth leads (lags) GDP growth. Quarterly growth rates are
adjusted for inflation and seasonality. Grey bars denote NBER recession periods.


  We find it reassuring that our methodology detects several well-known economic patterns.
For example, the IT industry became progressively more leading in the 1995-2000 subsample,
that is, during the IT boom. The boom of the early 2000, instead, was led by real estate,
with finance becoming progressively more leading after 2005 and during the Great Recession.
We provide other interesting facts about our LL indicators in Appendix A and focus next
on our time-series analysis.


3.1    Time-Series Analysis

Portfolio sorting and the LL factor. We start with the Fama-French 30-industry cross
section. In each quarter, we sort firms grouped in our 30 industries according to their
maximum correlation LL indicator value and divide them into three portfolios. Our lead
(lag) portfolio contains the top 20% of leading (lagging) industries. In each quarter, each
of these two portfolios represents at least 15% of total market capitalization, implying that
our results are not driven by a fraction of small and potentially illiquid firms.

Notes: This table provides real annualized value-weighted returns of portfolios of firms sorted
according to their industry-level lead-lag (LL) indicator. First, for each industry, in each quarter we
compute the ±4-quarter cross-correlation between industry-level output growth and the domestic
output growth using 20-quarter rolling windows. Second, we identify the lead or lag for which the
maximum absolute cross-correlation is attained and assign it to the corresponding industry as its LL
indicator. A positive (negative) LL indicator denotes an industry whose output growth leads (lags)
GDP growth. Our Lead (Lag) portfolio contains the top (bottom) 20% of our leading industries.
These portfolios represent at least 15% of the total market value in each quarter. All other firms
are assigned to the middle (Mid) portfolio. The LL portfolio reflects a zero-dollar strategy long
in Lead and short in Lag. In each portfolio, we identify the industries with the absolute value
of correlation above the portfolio’s median and group them in a subportfolio denoted as ‘Strong’.
The LL Strong portfolio represents a zero-dollar trading strategy long in Lead Strong and short
in Lag Strong. Return data are monthly over the sample 1972:01–2012:12. Industry definitions
are from Kenneth French’s website. CAPM α (FF3 α) denotes average excess returns unexplained
by the CAPM (Fama-French three-factor model). The numbers in parentheses are standard errors
adjusted according to Newey and West (1987). One, two, and three asterisks denote significance
at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.


   For each portfolio, we compute value-weighted monthly returns and highlight the following
relevant facts. First, we construct a lead-lag (LL) factor by considering the returns of a
zero-dollar investment strategy long in the leading and short in the lagging portfolio. This
strategy pays an average annualized excess return of 4.2%, which remains significant and
sizeable even after adjusting the returns for either the CAPM or the FF3 factors (see the
implied alphas in Table 1). In Appendix B, we show that these results continue to hold
also when we consider different quantiles (with respect to the minimum share of market
capitalization) for the formation of the lead and lag portfolios (see Table B1).
   Second, within each portfolio we identify the industries whose absolute value of correlation
with output is above the median. We group the above-median industries in subportfolios
denoted as ‘Strong’, given that they feature a stronger and less noisy lead/lag connection
with aggregate output. We then study the return of a zero-dollar investment strategy long

This table provides real annualized value-weighted returns for a zero-dollar strategy long in
Lead and short in Lag industries across three different ways to compute the lead-lag indicator.
Turnover measures the percentage of industries entering or exiting from a portfolio. Industry
migration measure the median number of times an industry moves across portfolios in a year.
Return data are monthly over the sample 1972:01–2012:12. Industry definitions are from
Kenneth French’s website. CAPM α (FF3 α) denotes average excess returns unexplained
by the CAPM (Fama-French three-factor model). The numbers in parentheses are standard
errors adjusted according to Newey and West (1987). One, two, and three asterisks denote
significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

in Lead-Strong and short in Lag-Strong. We obtain even stronger results (see Table 1,
right-most column). Untabulated results confirm that these empirical patterns are present
also when we focus on equally weighted returns.
   Third, these results are confirmed across our three ways to compute the LL indicator (see
Table 2). The LL factor has a Sharpe ratio ranging from 0.25 to 0.35 and its alpha ranges
from 3% to 4% after adjusting for either the CAPM or the FF3 factors. The average quar-
terly turnover is stable and very moderate at about 10%.5 According to our methodology,
industries move across portfolios at most once a year.


Granularity. We explore the role of granularity and report key results on the leading
premium in Table 3. Specifically, we adopt our sorting procedure after grouping firms into
38 and 49 industries, respectively. We point out the existence of a relevant tension between
number of industries and precision of our ranking. On the one hand, considering more
   5
    In each quarter, we compute the market value of the firms that either exit or enter a given portfolio.
We divide this number by two and report it as a fraction of the total market value. Expressing turnover
in market value terms prevents our measure from being driven by many small industries frequently moving
across portfolios.

Notes: This table provides real annualized value-weighted returns of portfolios of firms sorted
according to their industry-level lead-lag (LL) indicator. The formation of the portfolios is identical
to that described in the notes to table 1. In contrast to our benchmark specification that uses a
30-industry classification, this table documents results for 38 industries (Panel A) and 49 industries
(Panel B). The LL portfolio reflects a zero-dollar strategy long in Lead and short in Lag. In each
portfolio, we identify the industries with the absolute value of correlation above the portfolio’s
median and group them in a subportfolio denoted as ’Strong’. The LL Strong portfolio represents
a zero-dollar trading strategy long in Lead Strong and short in Lag Strong. Turnover measures
the percentage of industries entering or exiting from a portfolio. Return data are monthly over the
sample 1972:01–2012:12. Industry definitions are from Kenneth French’s website. CAPM α (FF3
α) denotes average excess returns unexplained by the CAPM (Fama-French three-factor model).

industries enables us to gain more power from the cross section. On the other, considering a
more granular definition of industries makes our estimation of industry-level leads and lags
more noisy and hence it makes our sorting less precise. We find it encouraging that our
results on the leading premium are confirmed when working with both 38 and 49 industries.
We present robustness analyses with respect to an alternative way to measure leads and lags
in the appendix in Table B2.


Size and Book-to-Market. We double-sort the firms belonging to our lead and lag port-
folios with respect to either their book-to-market (B/M) ratios, or their market capitalization
(Size). As in Fama and French (2012), we choose the 30th and 70th percentiles of the book-
to-market distribution as cutoff points to obtain low, medium, and high book-to-market
portfolios. We do the same with respect to size and report our main results in Table 4.
   Our leading premium is sizeable and statistically significant for both low and medium
B/M firms. Among value firms, the premium is positive but measured with noise. This may

Notes: This table provides two decompositions of the real annualized value-weighted returns of the
LL portfolio constructed as described in table 1. In panel A, we decompose the LL return by double-
sorting firms according to their book-to-market (B/M) ratio within the Lead and Lag portfolios.
Our cutoff points are the 30th and 70th percentiles of the B/M distribution within each portfolio.
Analogously, in panel B we decompose the LL return by double-sorting firms according to their
market capitalization (Size) within the Lead and Lag portfolios. Our cutoff points are the 30th and
70th percentiles of the Size distribution within each portfolio. Return data are monthly over the
sample 1972:01–2012:12. Industry definitions are from Kenneth French’s website. CAPM α (FF3
α) denotes average excess returns unexplained by the CAPM (Fama-French three-factor model).
The numbers in parentheses are standard errors adjusted according to Newey and West (1987).
One, two, and three asterisks denote significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.


be due to the fact that value firms in both the lead and lag portfolios count for just 2% of
total market value, a very small fraction. Our leading premium is a broad phenomenon in
the cross section of firms, as it applies to 80% of our firms that, in turn, represent between
28% and 38% of total market value. In a similar spirit, we note that our leading premium
is not driven by small-cap firms, since our lead-lag structure in the cross section of industry
cash-flows is mainly generated by large firms.
   All of these results hold regardless of whether we use fixed 30%-70% cutoff levels computed
from the full cross section of B/M and Size, or focus on the distribution of B/M and Size
within each LL-sorted portfolio.
   Given these results, it is natural to ask whether there is some fundamental difference across
leading and lagging industries. Table 5 addresses this question by looking at investment
intensity and dividend payouts. From a statistical point of view, firms in leading industries
have an average investment intensity comparable to that of lagging firms. Lagging firms,
however, adjust their investments more (as indicated by a higher standard deviation of
the ratio of investment to total assets, StD(I/A)), and their dividends are less exposed

Notes: This table provides statistics for both dividends growth and investmment intensity leading
and lagging industries identified using our benchmark strategy. We measure investments by capital
expenditures (CAPX) over total assets. Balance sheet data are quarterly over the sample 1972Q1–
2012Q4. Industry definitions are from Kenneth French’s website. The rightmost column ‘p-value’
reports the p-value for the test of difference between statistics for leading and lagging industries
with the null hypothesis being that the statistics across the groups are equal. The long-run exposure
coefficient refers to the following regression:

                                    ∆dt+1 = β0 + βX xt + residt ,

where xt is the expected component of consumption growth identified as described in section 4.


to consumption long-run risk (we detail the identification of consumption long-run risk in
Section 4). These results are broadly consistent with the idea that lagging firms have time
to process information about future fluctuations and use information to both revise their
investment plans and smooth their dividends for the long-run.6


LL’s additional informativeness. In an economy in which shocks diffuse immediately
across sectors, or, more broadly, the network of industries is not very relevant for the diffusion
of shocks, our lead-lag factor should not provide additional information once we control for
other aggregate factors. In this section, we use standard time-series tests to formalize further
the disconnect between our leading premium and other well-known risk factors. We interpret
these results as suggesting that existing risk factors are not enough to fully capture the role
of the many shocks that affect our granular cross section of industries.
   Henceforth, we denote the market, size, and value factors as, MKT, SMB, and HML,
respectively. We consider also other financial factors that may be related to cyclical economic
fluctuations, such as investment minus consumption proposed by Kogan and Papanikolaou

    We thank Laura Veldkamp for this insight. These results hold also when we exclude financial firms.
Dividends growth rates are seasonally adjusted and expressed as year-over-year quarterly rates.

constructed in the spirit of Moskowitz and Grinblatt (1999) (iMOM(6,6)), and industry
betting-against-beta as suggested by Asness et al. (2014) (iBAB).
   We show our estimates for the following regression:

                                        LLt = αLL + γFt + εt ,                                          (1)

where Ft comprises the factors mentioned above. Across all specifications, the intercept
remains statistically significant and sizable, and the implied adjusted R-squared are smaller
than 10%. All of these results confirm that (i) our leading premium is mostly unrelated to the
FF3 factors and durability; and (ii) our factor goes beyond the role played by investment
shocks, industry momentum, and industry-level betting against the beta.7 Untabulated
   7
    The negative beta assigned to the IMC factor is fully consistent with Figure A1, as industries producing
investment goods tend to lag the cycle.

Notes: This table reports the results from regressing the LL Strong factor constructed as detailed
in table 1 on Fama and French 5 factors (FF5), the Hou et al. (2015a, b) q-factors, and the
Carhart momentum factor (MOM). Newey-West adjusted standard errors are reported in paren-
theses. Monthly data start in 1972:01 and end in 2012:12. One, two, and three asterisks denote
significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively. Here, we perform one-sided test against
the hypothesis H0 : α < 0. For factors loadings the significance corresponds to the two-sided tests.


results confirm that these conclusions can be obtained also when considering more granular
cross sections with either 38 or 49 industries. Our results apply also when using different
holding and formation periods for the construction of iMOM (see Table B3 in the appendix).
Furthermore, our LL factor continues to have relevant information when we run our time-
series tests on principal components that are extracted from all of these factors and explain
up to 93% of their variation (see Tables B4 and B5).
   We deepen our analysis by exploring the connection between the leading factor, the q-
factors of Hou et al. (2015a, b), the FF5 factors of Fama and French (2015), and the Carhart
(1997) momentum factor. As shown in Table 7, the alpha associated to our leading factor
remains sizeable and significant across all cases considered. Even though our leading factor
is related to cyclical measures like ROE and RMW, it is mostly unexplained by them.
   We also include a dummy for NBER recessions and document that the leading premium
is not a recession-driven phenomenon (see Table B6 in the appendix). Hence our factor
is distinct from that in Lettau et al. (2014). In Table B7, we show that our results are


                                                19
not subsumed by either the announcement risk factor of Savor and Wilson (2016) or the
production network premium identified by Gofman et al. (2017). Our results continue to
hold also when we consider aggregate consumption growth as opposed to GDP growth (see
Table B8).


Predictability of macroeconomic aggregates. In order to test the economic signifi-
cance of our findings, we assess whether the aggregate valuation ratio of our leading firms has
predictive power on industrial production and unemployment in addition to that of classical
predictors. Specifically, we construct the price-dividend ratio for both the aggregate stock
market and our leading portfolio and use these two ratios in standard forecasting regressions.
  We report our findings in Table 8 and note two relevant results. First, our leading price-
dividends ratio exhibits significant predictive power for both industrial production and em-
ployment. This result obtains while controlling for other well-known predictive factors, such
as the aggregate price-dividends ratio, a measure for the aggregate credit spread, inflation,
and the federal funds rate. Second, the predictive power of the leading price-dividends ratio
is increasing in the horizon of our regressions in terms of both coefficient magnitude (γh ) and
contribution to the adjusted R2 . This contribution is measured by the difference between
the adjusted R2 values with and without the leading price-dividend ratio included in the
regression. We note that we do not focus on cumulative growth rates and hence we are
not exposed to the potential problems pointed out by Valkanov (2003). Our estimates are
adjusted for the Stambaugh (1986) bias, and our inference is based on a bootstrap procedure
that mitigates the issues pointed out by Torous et al. (2004).


3.2    Cross-Sectional Tests

The goal of this section is twofold. On the one hand, in the spirit of the empirical asset
pricing literature, we want to confirm that our new factor conveys additional information
for the cross-section of equity returns and is not just a ‘lucky factor’. On the other hand,
our cross-sectional investigation is necessary to better disentangle the portion of our leading
premium that is associated with advance information and cannot be attributed to exposure

where ∆gt+h is the h-quarter ahead one-period growth rate of industrial production and unemploy-
ment. In the regressions, we control for the (t − 1)-growth rate, ∆gt−1 . The set of controls includes
the default spread, inflation, and federal fund rate. Estimated coefficients have been adjusted with
the Stambaugh bias correction. Bootstrap standard errors are in parentheses. Adj R2 * denotes
adjusted R-squared for an equivalent regression where pdlead is excluded. The quarterly data start
in 1973:Q1 and end in 2012:Q4. One, two, and three asterisks denote significance at the 10%, 5%,

Pricing tests. We use GMM to estimate the following linear pricing model


                                           ex
                                          Ri,t = ai + βi · Ft + ui,t                                        (2)
                                         ex
                                      E[Ri,t ] = βi λ + vi ,                                                (3)


in which Rex denotes excess returns, i indexes the test assets, and the β and λ coefficients
measure the exposure of returns to and the market price of risk of our factors, Ft , respectively.
As in Cochrane (2005), we represent the discount factor as mt = m − bft , so that


                                              b = E(ft ft0 )−1 λ.                                           (4)


Efficient standard errors are corrected for autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity following
Newey and West (1987).8
   We first run a conventional analysis across many different cross sections of test assets
both for robustness and to address the criticism of Lewellen et al. (2010) related to the
strong factor structure of the size and book-to-market cross sections. In the ensuing analysis
individual stocks are sorted with respect to their conditional betas for the LL factor. In both
steps, we highlight the implied time premium.


Conventional test assets. In Table 9, we report our results for both the market prices of
risk and the implied stochastic discount factor loadings associated with our four factors, that
is, FF3 plus the LL factor. Since we take the concerns about spurious inference seriously,
we also report the cross sectional improvement in GLS R2 (GLS R2 +, see Lewellen et al.
(2010)) and the mean scaled intercept (SI, see Harvey and Liu (2018)) statistics.9

      We use a two-step procedure. In the first iteration, we set the weighting matrix for the moment conditions
equal to the identity matrix. In the second iteration, we use the optimal weighting matrix from our first
iteration.

      We follow Harvey and Liu (2018) in aggregating the results from 10,000 bootstrap samples of the entire
cross section with replacement.

     (2018). Associated p−values are in squared brackets. Our set of test assets consists of 30-, 38-, and 48-industry portfolios; portfolios sorted on
     book-to-market (BE/ME), market capitalization (Size), operating profits (OP), and investments (INV); double-sorted portfolios sorted on size
     and long-term (LT) reversal. Our monthly sample is 1:1972–12:2012. The numbers in parentheses are Newey and West (1987) standard errors.
     One, two, and three asterisks denote significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.
   We find that both the factor risk premium λLL and the pricing kernel loading bLL are
statistically significant at the 5% and often 1% level. The cross sectional R2 improvement is
sizeable and particularly so for the industry cross section. The p−value of the SI statistics
is always smaller or equal to 10%, implying that we can reject the null hypothesis that the
LL factor is a lucky factor.
   Hence, these tests confirm that our LL factor is both relevant and required when it comes
to pricing the cross sections equity returns, including those in which portfolios are sorted
with respect to investment (INV), operating profits (OP), long-term reversal (LT Reversal),
and momentum (MOM).10 In Appendix B, we show that these results are still significant,
albeit at a higher significance level, when we add either momentum or durability to set of
risk factors to study the cross section of industries (see Table B9).
   In Table 10, we report for each cross-section the maximum spread in the portfolio ex-
posures to the LL factor and a measure of the implied timing premium. On average, the
timing premium is about 1.5% per year, i.e., about 35% of our measured leading premium
(see table 1).


Portfolios sorted on firm-level LL-exposure. Computing cross-correlograms on firm-
level cash flows is impractical because cash flows are too noisy. Consistent with prior liter-
ature, we use the firm-level returns exposure to our return-based factor to proxy the extent
to which a firm leads/lags the cycle.
   Specifically, we start by taking our LL factor from our benchmark procedure that considers
30 industries. For each firm, we then compute its conditional exposure to the LL factor
(βLL,i,t ) over a rolling-window that includes the past 60 months. We control for the FF3
factors in the regression and sort firms according to their βLL,i,t into 30 portfolios that we
use as test assets. By grouping together all firms with strongly positive (negative) exposure,
this procedure bundles the most leading (lagging) firms in the economy across industries.
These portfolios are re-formed once a year.
  10
    Fama and French (1993) do not estimate market prices of risk as we do. We run the Fama-MacBeth
regressions replication code choosing our industry portfolios as test assets. In this cross section, we obtained
poorly identified, and often negative, market price of risk for both SMB and HML.

Notes: This table presents spreads in test assets’ exposures to the LL factor βLL , Max(βLL )-
Min(βLL ), together with the product of these spreads and the corresponding factor risk premia,
λLL (Max(βLL )-Min(βLL )). We employ the generalized method of moments (GMM) to estimate
the linear factor model stated in equations (2)–(3). All returns are monthly from January 1972
through December 2012. At the bottom of the table, we report sample mean and median of the
quantities.


   Our results are reported in Table 11 (top portion of each panel) and confirm what we had
found in our previous analysis, namely that the LL factor is priced and it enters the discount
factor in an independent and significant way. Furthermore, the implied size of the timing
premium is about 1.8% per year, as indicated by the values in the last column of Panel A.
   We then turn our attention to firm heterogeneity within industries. We focus on 38 (49)
industries and sort firms within each industry in 3 (2) portfolios according to their βLL,i,t
exposure.11 This procedure enables us to have a larger cross section of test assets and
confirms that the LL factor is still priced in the cross-section. To be conservative, we use the
top- and bottom-20% exposure coefficients from our cross sections to imputed the timing
premium. We confirm the timing premium ranges from 1.3% to 2% per year.
  11
    When we compute the βLL,i,t with 38 (49) industries we also use the benchmark LL factor that we
obtained working with 30 industries.

Notes: This table presents factor risk premia and the exposures of the pricing kernel to the FF3
factors (M KT , SM B, HM L) and our lead-lag factor (LL). We employ the generalized method of
moments (GMM) to estimate the linear factor model stated in equations (2)–(3). Using a linear
projection of the stochastic discount factor m on the factors (m = m−f 0 b), we determine the pricing
kernel coefficients as b = E[f f 0 ]−1 λ. We use portfolios based on the individual firms’ exposures to
the LL factor (βLL,i,t ) estimated over previous 60 months as our test portfolios. The top section
of each panel presents results for 30 lead-lag portfolios. In the middle (bottom) section the test
portfolios are constructed by sorting firms on their βLL,i,t within each of 38 (49) industries into
3 (2) subgroups. β LL (β LL ) denotes the top (bottom) quintile of the LL-betas distribution. Our
sample consists of monthly returns for test portfolios from January 1972 through December 2012.
The numbers in parentheses are standard errors adjusted according to Newey and West (1987).
One, two, and three asterisks denote significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.


3.3     Further Robustness Checks

In section B.1 of the appendix, we carry out several robustness tests relevant for our empirical
findings. We start by assessing alternative measures for our lead/lag indicator. We then
consider an alternative way to correct for seasonality and a sorting procedure based on
Granger causality. All results are reported in Table B10.


                                                  26
    We consider leads and lags of other cash-flows like, for example, dividends, operating
income, capital expenditures and asset growth and confirm that leading firms bear a higher
cost of equity. We also show that looking at leading and lagging firms is different from
sorting firms according to their past cash-flow growth and creating a winners-minus-losers
(WML) strategy. We show that our findings are robust to forming our lead-lag portfolio at
an annual frequency, but they vanish if we proceed with an unconditional sorting done over
the entire sample, consistent with the diffusion model presented in section 2.1 in which all
industries are ex-ante identical.



4     An Equilibrium Model for the Leading Premium

By no-arbitrage our leading premium is connected to the spread between the equity yield
curve and the bond yield curve (see appendix C). Equivalently, the leading premium is
partially a reflection of the timing premium. As a result, any equilibrium asset pricing
model able to deliver a substantial timing premium can produce our empirical findings.
Given our empirical evidence on long-run dividends growth from Section 3, we focus on an
equilibrium model featuring two main elements: (a) an information structure affected by
leads and lags of long-run cash flows growth; and (b) preferences sensitive to the timing of
information about future growth.
    Specifically, we assume that the representative agent has Epstein and Zin (1989) prefer-
ences, i.e.,

                             "                                               1

   According to this law of motion, the leading portfolio has predictive power for expected
consumption growth jc periods ahead, that is, Et [∆ct+1+jc ] = xt . For the lagged cash flows,
the time lag on the long-run component is denoted by jd . We also allow the agent to
have advance information with respect to the exposure of the lagged cash flow to short-run
consumption shocks over a maximum time horizon of jlag periods. We do this to be consistent
with the data, but it is not the main driver of our results.
   At this point, we must clarify that this exercise has the sole purpose to assess the potential
of this class of models to produce a substantial timing and leading premium. Since we are
completely abstracting from network connections across firms and we work with managed
portfolio cash flows, a good performance of our economy must be interpreted as an upper
bound on what this class of models could deliver in a fully fledged network model.
   The endogenous returns associated with this log-linear setting are reported in Appendix
E. In what follows, we focus on the procedure that we use to calibrate these portfolio cash
flows.



                                                     28
Calibration Strategy. Quarterly consumption data are from the BEA and include non-
durables and services. To identify xt−jc , we run a standard forecasting regression using the
thirteen factors formed by Jurado et al. (2015) and represent the estimated long-run risk
component as an AR(1) process, consistent with Equation (6).12 This procedure enables us
to identify both long-run (x,t ) and short-run (c,t ) consumption news.
   We compute the dividends paid out by both our lead and lag portfolios and aggregate them
to a quarterly frequency.13 We deflate them using quarterly US CPI and then regress the
growth rates of these cash flows on leads and lags of both short- and long-run consumption
news, consistent with Equations (7)–(8). We use adjusted R2 to optimally pin down the
maximum number of leading/lagging periods, as detailed in Appendix D. We set statistically
insignificant coefficients to zero.
   We summarize our main results in Table 12. The consumption long-run component lags
that of the leading cash flow by 27 quarters (jc = 81 months). The long-run component of
the cash flow of the lagged portfolio lags by 47 quarters (jd = 141 months). To be consistent
with the data, we also allow this cash flow to load on lagged short-run consumption shocks.
According to our results, anticipated information on these shocks plays a very marginal role
(the estimated φlag
                f coefficients can be found in Table D1 in the appendix).

   The data suggest that the dividends of the leading portfolio tend to be more exposed
to long-run growth news than those of the lagged portfolio. This fact is consistent with
the view that lagging firms may use advance information to smooth their long-run dividend
growth. Consistent with these results, we set φlead
                                               x    = 8.60 and φlag

this observation is twofold. First, we properly control for heterogeneous exposure to shocks,

                                                            cum    ex
                                         Dp,t    = Vp,t−1 (Rp,t − Rp,t )
                                                           ex
                                          Vp,t   = Vp,t−1 Rp,t ,

assuming Vp,0 = 1.

as suggested by Bansal et al. (2005). Second, after accounting for heterogeneity in exposure
we can isolate the role of heterogeneity in the timing of exposure, i.e., the relevance of the
pure timing premium.
   The properties of aggregate consumption growth are consistent with both prior findings
and our own estimation results. We set the monthly persistence of long-run risk to 0.9, a value
lower than that in Bansal and Yaron (2004) and consistent with our empirical confidence
interval.14 The volatility of the long-run news, σx , is calibrated to be consistent with the R2
that we obtain from estimating equation (5). The volatility of the consumption short-run
shock is calibrated to a low level, consistent with the fact that we use post-1972 data, i.e.,
observations from a period of great moderation.


Results. Under our benchmark calibration, we set the preference parameters as in Bansal
and Yaron (2004). Specifically, the relative risk aversion (γ) is set to 10; the intertemporal
elasticity of substitution (ψ) is 1.5; and the subjective discount rate (δ) is set to 0.99 to keep
the risk-free rate to a low level.
   Our benchmark model produces an annualized LL premium of 3.10%, a number consistent
with our empirical evidence. In order to look at the composition of the leading premium, we
remove advance information by setting jc = jd = 0 and hence determine the portion of the
premium solely driven by heterogeneous exposure (φlead
                                                  x    > φlag
                                                          x ). We find that heterogeneous

exposure generates a premium of 1.65%. Thus the pure timing premium is 1.45% per year,
a figure consistent with our estimates range.
   These results are mostly driven by information about long-run growth, as can be seen by
comparing our benchmark setting with the case in which we remove short-run risk exposure
from the cash flow of both the leading and the lagging portfolios (φpf = 0 for all f and
p ∈ {lead, lag}). In this case, our results are actually stronger, as the LL premium is even
closer to its empirical counterpart.
   We also compute the utility-consumption ratio associated with these scenarios. By com-
  14
    We estimate the quarterly persistence parameter ρ and report the inference for ρ1/3 . Standard errors
are computed using the delta method.




                                                   30
paring these ratios in log units, we can compute welfare benefits in terms of percentage
of lifetime consumption. Specifically, we find that advance information about the long-run
component of growth in the economy produces welfare benefits in the order of just 6% of
lifetime consumption.
   In order to correctly interpret this figure, we run the Lucas (1987) experiment in our
economy and obtain welfare benefits of removing all uncertainty in the order of 65%.15 As a
result, the advance information that we identify in the cross section of industries represents
less than 10% of the maximum attainable welfare benefits.
   Epstein et al. (2014) point out that in the Bansal and Yaron (2004) model, most of the
Lucas welfare benefits originate from full resolution of uncertainty, not from the removal of
deterministic fluctuations. Our computations show that the early resolution of uncertainty
in the cross section of industries is simultaneously valuable but limited, as it carries a strong
market price of risk, but reveals future long-run consumption dynamics over a relatively
short horizon.
   We also look at the aforementioned model configurations under the special case of time-
                                       1
additive preferences, i.e., when ψ =   γ
                                           = 0.1. Since in this case the representative agent does
not care about the timing of resolution of uncertainty, advance information is not priced. As
a result, the lead-lag expected return difference disappears, and our empirical findings take
the form of an anomaly. In Appendix E, the reader can find explicit derivations of the LL
premium in the context of simple lead-lag structures.


Link to our multifactor model. In order to investigate our model’s ability to reproduce
the cross-sectional pricing predictions found in the data, we construct a synthetic cross
section of redundant dividend claims that differ in their exposure to fundamental shocks and
in the timing of their exposure.

    This number is much smaller than that in Croce (2013), as our consumption process is calibrated
according to post-1972 data, i.e., its volatility is moderate.

     Notes: Panel A summarizes the benchmark monthly calibration of the cash-flow dynamics described in equations (5)–(8). The entries for the
     data are obtained from formal estimation procedures applied to quarterly consumption and dividend data. The long-run risk volatility σx is
     selected to align the V (xt )/V (∆c) ratio in the model to the R2 of our regressions in the data. For the leading portfolio, the annualized volatility
     of the dividend-specific shocks is set to 7%. For the lagged portfolio we use a figure twice as large, consistent with our estimation results. The
     exposures to short-run shocks are set as in appendix table D1. In panel B, we report key annualized moments in percentage terms. When we
     set jc = jd = 0, we remove all advance information about the long-run growth component in the economy. The column labeled ‘LRR Only’
     features advance information about the long-run component, but it removes exposure of dividends to short-run consumption risk at all horizons
     (φpf = 0, ∀f, p ∈ {lead, lag}). The rightmost three columns refer to the case in which we adopt CRRA preferences (ψ = γ −1 ). U/C denotes the
     average utility-consumption ratio. All standard errors are Newey-West adjusted.
   Specifically, we let the dividends for stock i follow the dynamics specified in equation (8)
with specific parameters jdi , φif , . . . . Since the effect of current and past short-run shocks on
risk premiums is modest, we focus only on exposure to contemporaneous short-run shocks,
i.e., we set φif = 0 for all f > 1. For consistency, we re-estimate the system of equations
(7)–(8) and report the new estimates in Table 13. We omit the long-run risk exposures φlead
                                                                                       x

and φlag
     x , because they remain unaffected.

   Our simulated cross section of cash flows consists of (a) a leading dividend claim which
depends on xt ; (b) a lagging asset that lags the leading claim by 141 months, i.e, it depends
on xt−141 ; and (c) fifteen additional lagging claims with specific lags jdi evenly spread out
between 0 and 141 months. Thus, some assets lead aggregate consumption (those with a
lagging period shorter than 81 months), whereas all other assets lag, as in the data.
   Additionally, our synthetic assets differ in both their exposure to the long-run shock (φix )
and their exposure to the short-run shock (φif ). For the sake of consistency with the data, we
also allow these cash flows to randomly differ in their idiosyncratic volatility (σdi , i = 1, .., 15).
This dimension is not crucial for our results.
   For each synthetic asset, we uniformly draw a triplet (φix , φif , σdi ) from our estimated
intervals. For example, the interval for the φif values is consistent with the results in Table
13. Since we draw these parameters independently from jdi , we are able to simulate a cross
section of returns in which heterogeneous exposure and heterogeneous timing of exposure to
shocks are distinct phenomena.
   We use many repetitions of small samples of simulated returns. In each sample, we
construct the model-implied LL factor by computing the difference between leading and
lagging claim returns, as in the data. We proxy the market factor (MKT ) by focusing on
the return of the claim to aggregate consumption. We then estimate the following linear
factor models:
                            E[Riex ] = βi,M KT λM KT + vi ,
                            E[Riex ] = βi,LL λLL + vi ,                                            (9)

                            E[Riex ] = βi,M KT λM KT + βi,LL λLL + vi ,

where Riex is mean excess return on a synthetic asset. For each sample, we compute the

Notes: This table presents estimated loadings of the leading and lagging dividends on the contem-
poraneous shock to the consumption growth, as specified in the system of equations (5)–(8). The

mean squared error (MSE) between simulated returns and returns predicted by these three
different factor-based models. We depict the implied distribution of MSEs across simulated
samples in Figure 3 along with the point estimates obtained from our empirical investigation.
   We highlight two important takeaways from this exercise. First, the cross section of our
synthetic returns can be explained by a two-factor linear model, where the market factor
picks up differences in exposure to risks, whereas the LL factor picks up heterogeneity in
the timing of exposure. For this reason, the LL factor systematically improves the MSE
by lowering its average and, more generally, by shifting more probability mass toward lower
MSE values.
   Second, under our benchmark calibration the model fit improvement

                                     p
                       MF I = 1 −        MSE(M KT + LL)/MSE(M KT ),


i.e., the relative improvement in MSE obtained by adding the LL factor, tends to be mod-
est compared to its empirical counterpart. According to our simulations, the probability of
observing our estimated M F I or a higher value is just 2%. The reason for this outcome
is related to the fact that volatilities are calibrated to modest values under the benchmark
calibration, and hence we do not have a sizeable heterogeneity across our relevant factors.
When we refine our calibration and increase our volatility parameters so that the volatility
of consumption growth is 2%, the improvement of fit associated with the LL factor becomes
more sizeable and our empirical estimate corresponds to the 70th percentile of our simu-
lated distribution. We find this result reassuring: under a refined calibration consistent

This figure examines the goodness of fit of the factor models described in the system of equations
(9). The entries from the model are obtained from repetitions of small samples. The entries from
the data are obtained from our estimates derived from post-1972 quarterly data. In the model,
we construct a cross section of synthetic assets whose cash flows lag to different extents the cash
flow of the leading claim. Assets also randomly differ in their exposure to short- and long-run
risk, as in the data. The LL factor is constructed as a spread in the returns of the most-leading
and most-lagging portfolios. In the model, the market return is proxied by the consumption claim
return. In the top panels, we depict the MSEs across simulated samples. In the bottom panels,
we depict the empirical distribution of the

LL factor to the MKT factor (MFI = 1 − MSE(M KT + LL)/MSE(M KT )). The point estimate
of MSE improvement in the data (using 30-industry portfolio returns) is represented by a vertical
dashed line. The right panels are obtained using a refined calibration in which the total volatility
of consumption growth is set to its 1929–2008 estimate of 2%.

Notes: This table provides average returns of the LL portfolio returns constructed by adopting
our empirical LL indicator on our simulated cross section of cash flows. Monthly cash flows are
simulated as described in section 4 and time-aggregated to the quarterly frequency. Under our
benchmark procedure, for each asset we compute the ±4-quarter (maximum lead/lag, ML) cross-
correlation between industry-level output growth and the output growth using 20-quarter rolling
windows (RW). Second, we identify the lead or lag for which the maximum absolute cross-correlation
is attained and assign it to the corresponding industry as its LL indicator. A positive (negative)
LL indicator denotes an industry whose output growth leads (lags) GDP growth. The LL portfolio
is a zero-investment strategy that is long in the top-3 leading assets and short in the top-3 lagging
assets. The results from the first column refer to the case in which we apply our benchmark
procedure to coincidental cash-flows (jd = jc = 0). In the rightmost two columns we alter RW and
ML. We report in parentheses both simple and Newey and West (1987)-adjusted standard errors
across small sample repetitions. The bottom portion of the table reports share of assets correctly
identified as leading/lagging for all assets (All leads/lags), and for the assets that belong to the
extreme Leading/Lagging portfolio. Each short sample contains 492 monthly observations. One,
two, and three asterisks denote significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.


down the LL indicator. Our main results are reported in Table 14. The first column confirms
that when the model cash flows are all coincidental (jc = jd = 0), our procedure produces
no leading premium. Thus concerns about spurious results are mitigated.
   When we instead have a proper lead/lag structure, our benchmark empirical procedure
captures a positive and significant leading premium. Not surprisingly, the magnitude of the
premium measured in the data is much smaller than the maximum spread implied by the
model because the accuracy of the LL indicator in the data is rather imperfect and hence
we are not identifying the most leading/lagging stocks with perfect accuracy. This result
suggests that our empirical estimates for the premium may be considered rather conservative.
   Most importantly, the next two column show that our LL indicator is consistent, meaning
that it correctly sorts cash flows when we increase the length of our rolling window and we


                                                 36
consider more leads and lags in the computation of our cross-correlograms. Increasing the
maximum lead/lag in our cross-correlogram from 4 to 29 quarters of course also requires us
to increase the length of our rolling window. When the rolling window length is set to 47
quarters, the accuracy of our LL indicator is enhanced and we recover most of the leading
premium. With a 70-quarter window, the identification of leading and lagging assets is
basically perfect.



5      Conclusion

In this study, we compute conditional leading/lagging indices for industry-level cash flows
with respect to US GDP. We find that leading industries, i.e., industries whose cash flows
contain information relevant for future aggregate growth, exhibit average returns that are
approximately 4% higher than those of lagging industries.
    This return difference remains sizeable and significant even after adjusting for a large
number of other risk factors both in the time series and in the cross section of equity returns.
After controlling for heterogenous exposure to risk, we find a pure annual timing premium
of about 1.5%.
    Our investigation implies at least two novel insights: (a) the cross section of industry
returns can be significantly explained by heterogeneity in the timing of exposure to shocks;
and (b) asset prices are sensitive to the timing of economic fluctuations.
    We provide a theoretical foundation for our findings in the context of a rational equilibrium
model in which agents have a preference for early resolution of uncertainty and hence price
advance information about future cash flows. Our setting explains our empirical findings
and suggests that advance information in the cross section of industry cash flows is valuable
but limited, as it results in moderate welfare benefits.
    Future work should extend our investigation by including other potentially valuable
sources of anticipated information. This task could be accomplished by considering other
classes of financial securities, such as domestic bonds, options, and international assets.

A      Other Examples of our LL Cross Section

To provide further economic guidance about our measure, in Figure A1 we report our maxi-
mum correlation LL indicators for the consumer goods, manufacturing, and business equip-
ment sectors. We focus on these large aggregates because their average lead-lag structure has
been documented in the literature (see, among others, Greenwood and Hercowitz (1991) and
Gomme et al. (2001)), and hence they represent a natural reference point for our methodol-
ogy.
  Consistent with prior studies, the unconditional average of the LL indicators in our sample
suggests that the consumer goods sector leads national output by a little more than a month
(a lead of 0.38 quarters), whereas manufacturing lags it slightly (a lag of around 0.6 quarters).
Business equipment, i.e., investment goods, lag consumer goods by almost three quarters,
as it takes time for firms to adjust their investment orders. Our LL indicators suggest that
the lead-lag structure across these sectors experiences fluctuations that are pronounced over
time but moderate in the cross section.
  Specifically, during recession periods both the consumer goods sector and the business
equipment sector tend to respond more promptly to shocks, as the former represents a
stronger leading indicator, and the latter lags national output just by a few weeks. During
booms, in contrast, both the consumer goods and the business equipment sectors lag the
cycle by a longer period of time. The difference in the LL indicators of the two sectors,
however, remains pretty stable, as it ranges from 2.13 quarters during recessions to 2.9
quarters during booms. In our main analysis with many industries, these cross sectional
fluctuations become more relevant.

                   Fig. A1: Lead-Lag Indicator for Selected Industries
This figure depicts the lead-lag (LL) indicator for three major industries. The LL indicator is
computed in two steps. First, for each industry, in each quarter we compute the ±4-quarter
cross-correlation between industry-level output growth and the domestic output growth using 20-
quarter rolling windows. Second, we identify the lead or lag for which the maximum absolute
cross-correlation is attained and assign it to the corresponding industry as its LL indicator. A
positive (negative) LL indicator denotes an industry whose output growth leads (lags) GDP growth.
Quarterly growth rates are adjusted for inflation and seasonality. In the top panel, grey bars denote
NBER recession periods. In the bottom panel, we report for each industry the average of the LL
indicator over our entire sample (denoted as “mean”), and its average value during booms and
recessions.

B      Data Sources and Additional Tables

In our empirical analysis, we use a cross section of monthly stock returns from the Center
for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) and corresponding quarterly firm-level data from
Standard & Poor’s COMPUSTAT for the period January 1972 through December 2012.
Prior to 1972, the quarterly data coverage is modest. All growth rates are in real terms and
seasonally adjusted. We retrieve macroeconomic data series for GDP, consumption, and CPI
from the website of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Industry definitions based on
SIC codes are taken from Kenneth French’s website.

Notes: This table provides average value-weighted returns of the LL portfolio, that is, a zero-dollar
strategy long in Lead and short in Lag industries as defined in section 3. We depart from our
benchmark portfolio construction by varying the minimal share of extreme portfolios in terms of
market capitalization. In the benchmark specification, both the Lead and Lag portfolios represent
at least 15% of the total market value in each quarter. Monthly return data start in 1972:01 and end
in 2012:12. Industry definitions are from Kenneth French’s website. The numbers in parentheses
are standard errors adjusted according to Newey and West (1987). One, two, and three asterisks
denote significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

Notes: This table provides real annualized value-weighted returns of portfolios of firms sorted ac-
cording to their cross-industry index of leads and lags (LL) as detailed in section 2. Our Lead
(Lag) portfolio contains the top (bottom) 20% of our leading industries. These portfolios represent
at least 15% of the total market value in each quarter. All other firms are assigned to the middle
(Mid) portfolio. The LL portfolio reflects a zero-dollar strategy long in Lead and short in Lag.
Return data are monthly over the sample 1972:01–2012:12. Industry definitions are from Kenneth
French’s website. CAPM α (FF3 α) denotes average excess returns unexplained by the CAPM
(Fama-French three-factor model). The numbers in parentheses are standard errors adjusted ac-
cording to Newey and West (1987). One, two, and three asterisks denote significance at the 10%,
5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

Notes - This table reports the results from regressing the benchamrk LL factor constructed from
the cross section of 30 industries on principal components extracted from Fama and French 5 fac-
tors, industry momentum (6,6) of Moskowitz and Grinblatt (1999), industry betting-against-beta,
investment-minus-consumption, durability, quality-minus-junk and 30-industry momentum factors.
Expl. Var. shows how much of the variation in the factors is explained by the selected principal
components. Newey-West adjusted standard errors are reported in in parentheses. Monthly data
start in 1972:01 and end in 2012:12. One, two, and three asterisks denote significance at the 10%,
5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

Notes: This table provides real annualized value-weighted returns of portfolios of firms sorted
according to their industry-level lead-lag (LL) indicator. We depart from our benchmark procedure
for computing the LL indicator by (i) using consumption growth instead of GDP growth, and (ii)
using Granger causality with a 40-quarter rolling window. A positive (negative) LL indicator
denotes an industry whose output growth leads (lags) GDP growth. Our Lead (Lag) portfolio
contains the top (bottom) 20% of our leading industries. These portfolios represent at least 15% of
the total market value in each quarter. All other firms are assigned to the middle (Mid) portfolio.
The LL indicator row refers to the average portfolio-level lead-lag indicators. Turnover measures
the percentage of industries entering or exiting from a portfolio. Return data are monthly over the
sample 1977:01–2012:12. Industry definitions are from Kenneth French’s website. CAPM α (FF3
α) denotes average excess returns unexplained by the CAPM (Fama-French three-factor model).
The numbers in parentheses are standard errors adjusted according to Newey and West (1987).
One, two, and three asterisks denote significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

factors (M KT , SM B, HM L), the Carhart (1997) momentum factor (M OM ), the Gomes et al.
(2009) durability factor (DU R) and our lead-lag factor (LL). We employ the generalized method
of moments (GMM) to estimate the linear factor model stated in equations (2)–(3). Using a
linear projection of the stochastic discount factor m on the factors (m = m − f 0 b), we determine
the pricing kernel coefficients as b = E[f f 0 ]−1 λ. Our sample consists of monthly returns for 49-
industry portfolios from January 1972 through December 2012. The numbers in parentheses are
standard errors adjusted according to Newey and West (1987). One, two, and three asterisks denote
significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

B.1        Further Robustness Checks

In this section, we carry out several robustness tests relevant for our empirical findings.
We start by assessing alternative measures for our lead/lag indicator. We then consider a
different way to correct for seasonality. Finally, we employ a sorting procedure based on
Granger causality. All results are reported in Table B10.


Alternative Measures of Our LL Indicator. First, we consider the cross-correlation
between quarterly GDP growth and industry cash flow growth within a larger 6-quarter
window (as opposed to a 4-quarter window in our base case analysis). Second, instead of
selecting the lead or lag for which the maximum absolute correlation is attained, we compute
an average lead-lag weighted by the absolute values of the cross-correlation coefficients.16 We
find that the average return of our LL portfolio still cannot be explained by the FF3 model.
These results suggest that our findings are not sensitive to the specific way in which we
assign a lead-lag indicator to an industry.


X11 Method. Aggregate data are adjusted for seasonality by applying the X11 method,
whereas our COMPUSTAT-based cash flow measures are seasonally-adjusted using dummy
variables. Using the X11 method on industry-level cash flows does not alter our main results
in a significant way.


Granger causality. In a variation of our benchmark approach we construct a lead-lag
measure that employs the Granger causality to establish leads and lags between industry
cash flow growth and GDP growth. In particular, we say that an industry is lagging GDP, if
GDP growth Granger-causes the cash flow growth of this industry. In the opposite direction,
an industry leads GDP if the industry cash flow growth Granger-causes GDP growth. In
the absence of any causality, we assign zero to the lead-lag measure. When both time series
Granger cause each other, we say that the lead-lag relation is undetermined and treat the
respective industry cash flow as contemporaneous to GDP.

      In this case, the LL indicator is computed as    i=−4   i·   P4
                                                                                |ρi |

                                                                    i=−4




                                                       52
   More specifically, we regress industry i’s cash flow growth, ∆gti , on a constant, its past
realizations, and past realizations of GDP growth, ∆g GDP , up to 4 lags each:

                                            4
                                            X                       4
                                                                    X
                               ∆gti   =c+              i
                                                  αj ∆gt−j      +              GDP
                                                                          γj ∆gt−j + eit .           (B.1)
                                            j=1                     j=1



We then test the null hypothesis γ1 = γ2 = γ3 = γ4 = 0. If we reject the null (i.e., if at
least one of the γ’s is not equal to zero), we argue that ∆g GDP Granger causes ∆g i , meaning
that industry i lags GDP. We identify the indicator value, that is, the corresponding lead,
either by selecting the γj with highest significance (based on the respective t-statistic), or by
computing the weighted average of all the γj coefficients using their t-statistics as weights
(Granger Causality VW). For the Granger causality tests, we increase the rolling window
to 40 quarters. We proceed in a similar way when looking at leads.17 Our main results are
robust to this alternative specification.


Alternative cash flow measures. A possible concern with respect to our analysis is that
our results are driven by the use of the Acharya et al. (2014) cash flow measure. Table B11
and B12 confirm our findings on the leading premium also when we use dividends, operative
income or investment-based measures of fundamental cash flows.




  17
       In particular, for each industry we estimate the following equation:
                                                  4
                                                  X                   4

If we fail to reject the null hypothesis, we conclude that cash flow growth of industry i Granger causes the
GDP growth and consequently industry i leads GDP.

     Notes: This table provides average value-weighted excess returns unexplained by the Fama-French three-factor model (FF3) of the LL and LL
     Strong portfolios. The benchmark construction of the LL indicator is described in section 3. We depart from the benchmark procedure by either
     (a) seasonally adjusting the industry cash flows using the BEA x11 procedure instead of seasonal dummies or (b) using the Granger causality
     methodology to determine leads/lags instead of cross correlation; or (c) determining lead/lags using Granger causality, where lead and lags are
     weighted by respective t-statistics. LL refers to a zero-dollar strategy long in Lead and short in Lag. Return data are monthly over the sample
     1972:01–2012:12. Industry definitions are from Kenneth French’s website. The numbers in parentheses are standard errors adjusted according
     to Newey and West (1987). One, two, and three asterisks denote significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

Notes: This table provides real annualized value-weighted returns of portfolios of firms sorted
according to their industry-level cash flow growth. First, in each quarter we compute the industry-
level cash flow growth over past quarter. Our Winners (Losers) portfolio contains the top (bottom)
20% of industries with the highest (lowest) cash flow growth. These portfolios represent at least 15%
of the total market value in each quarter. All other firms are assigned to the middle (Mid) portfolio.
The W-L portfolio reflects a zero-dollar strategy long in Winners and short in Losers. Return data
are monthly over the sample 1972:01–2012:12. Industry definitions are from Kenneth French’s
website. CAPM α (FF3 α) denotes average excess returns unexplained by the CAPM (Fama-
French three-factor model). The numbers in parentheses are standard errors adjusted according to
Newey and West (1987). One, two, and three asterisks denote significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1%
levels, respectively.


Cash flow growth momentum. Another concern regarding our interpretation of the
results is that they are possibly just the reflection of past cash flow growth momentum, rather
than a phenomenon related to advance information. In order to address this concern, we sort
firms according to the past growth rate of their industry-level cash flow. We form a winners-
minus-loosers investment strategy and look at the implied factor. We find no significant
spread, meaning that our lead-lag sorting is not a reflection of fundamental momentum.
Equivalently, our leading (lagging) firms are not systematically winners (losers).

are formed at the beginning of the sample and rebalanced quarterly with respect to their value
weights keeping the industry composition constant. The Initial Sorting row documents the aver-
age return of the LL portfolio (i) constructed at the beginning of the sample using our standard
procedure; and (ii) never reformed. Unconditional LL is based on a full-sample computation of
cross-correlations and an unconditional sorting. Newey-West adjusted standard errors are reported
in parentheses. Monthly data start in 1972:01 and end in 2012:12. Industry definitions are from
Kenneth French’s website. One, two, and three asterisks denote significance at the 10%, 5%, and

Formation frequency. Table B14 shows that our leading premium is mainly a conditional
phenomenon. There is no premium when we either retain the sorting based on the initial
estimate of the lead-lag indicator or when we estimate only one unconditional lead-lag indi-
cator using the whole sample. On the other hand, Table B15 shows that our results do not
hinge on high-frequency re-balancing and re-sorting. The leading premium can be captured
even when we form our portfolios once a year.

Notes: This table provides real annualized value-weighted returns of portfolios of firms sorted
according to their industry-level lead-lag (LL) indicator. The LL portfolio reflects a zero-dollar
strategy long in Lead and short in Lag. In each portfolio, we identify the industries with the
absolute value of correlation above the portfolio’s median and group them in a subportfolio denoted
as ‘Strong’. This table shows the results of the LL Strong portfolio which is a zero-dollar trading
strategy long in Lead Strong and short in Lag Strong. In our portfolio construction, we use 30
industries and three different frequencies of portfolio rebalancing: quarterly, semiannuallly and
annually. Returns data are monthly over the sample 1972:01–2012:12. Industry definitions are
from Kenneth French’s website. CAPM α (FF3 α) denotes average excess returns unexplained by
the CAPM (Fama-French three-factor model). The numbers in parentheses are standard errors
adjusted according to Newey and West (1987). One, two, and three asterisks denote significance
at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

C      Intuition based on no-arbitrage

Consider two stocks, denoted as leading and lagging. For the sake of simplicity, assume
that they both pay dividends only once, n periods from now. From a time-0 perspective,
the dividend of the leading firm, Dnlead , is assumed to be unknown and random because the
leading stock faces economic uncertainty. In order to abstract away from average growth,
we assume E0 [Dnlead ] = D0lead . Consistent with our empirical analysis, we assume that the
leading stock provides information about the future cash flow of the lagging firm. To make
the intuition as crisp as possible, assume that Dnlag = D0lead , that is, the future cash flow of
the lagging stock is perfectly forecastable given the current cash flow of the leading firm.
    Let y0 (n) be the yield of a bond with maturity n and v0 (n) be the dividend yield associated
with the cash flow Dnlead . Furthermore, assume for simplicity D0lead = D0lag ≡ D0 . By no
arbitrage, the dividend yield for the lagging firm must be equal to y0 (n), since its cash flow
is known at time 0, so that P0lag = D0 e−y0 (n)n . In contrast, the leading firm must offer a
yield of v0 (n), i.e., P0lead = D0 e−v0 (n)n . This implies that the following holds:

                                  P0lag       P0lead   pdlag

                                  D0           D0      pd0
                                                    = e(v0 (n)−y0 (n))n
                                                         E0 [Dnlead ]
                                                    =                 ,
                                                           F0,n

where F0,n is the future (or forward) price at time 0 for the dividend Dnlead to be paid at
time n, and pdi0 is the price-dividend ratio of claim i at time 0. This implies

i.e., the difference between the log valuation ratios of the lagging and the leading stock is
equal to the forward equity premium (in the terminology of Binsbergen et al. (2012)) for a
maturity of n periods.
    If investors are adverse to dividend uncertainty, we have F0,n < E0 [Dnlead ], and lagging

firms are more valuable than leading firms. Equivalently, an investment strategy long in the
leading and short in the lagging stock should pay the forward equity premium on leading
dividends.
   This result is important for two reasons. First, the forward equity premium features no
time-discounting, as it is determined by the difference between the expected dividend at
time n and the certain payoff F0,n paid at time n, i.e., it can be regarded as the price of a
static lottery. Hence this premium is a pure measure of the value of advance information on
n-period ahead cash flows.
   Second, the forward equity premium equals the difference between equity and bond yields
of the same maturity. Thus to obtain a positive leading premium we need a model that
produces a significant positive gap between the yield curve of zero-coupon equities and that
of bonds over the horizon for which leading industry cash flows predict lagging industry cash
flows.
   It is important to highlight that the existence of a leading premium depends on the spread
between the equity and the bond yield curve, not on the slope of the equity curve. In the
main text, we adopt an equilibrium model that delivers an upward sloping aggregate equity
yield curve for the sole sake of analytical tractability. Richer settings like those of Lettau
and Wachter (2007), Lettau and Wachter (2011), Croce et al. (2014), and Ai et al. (2017),
which are consistent with the empirical evidence in Binsbergen et al. (2012), Binsbergen
et al. (2013), and Binsbergen and Koijen (2017), would produce similar insights about the
nature of the leading premium.


Empirical support. The derivations described above suggest that lagging stocks should
behave more like bonds, whereas leading stocks should behave more like uncertain aggregate
equity. We provide further support to our analysis by estimating a quarterly VAR with
three variables: aggregate bond yield, aggregate equity yield, and then the yield of either
our lagging portfolio or our leading portfolio. The portfolio yields are computed in a standard
way by using the cum- and ex-dividends return of our stocks. The bond yield is from the
Fama-Bliss data set and is for a maturity of one year.

     Fig. C2: Variance Decomposition of Leading/Lagging Portfolio Yields
This figure depicts the variance decomposition of the forecast error of the leading and lagging
portfolio log yields estimated froma VAR(3). The variables in the model are: one-year bond yield;
aggregate equity market log price-dividend ratio; and either leading or lagging log price-dividend
ratio. The data is quarterly and spans the period 1972Q1:2012Q4.


   After imposing a lower-triangular structure on the covariance matrix of the shocks, we
can identify the role played by bond-specific and equity-specific shocks in determining the
variance of our lagging and leading dividend yields. Since our results do not change if we
rank the aggregate equity yield first and the bond yield second in our VAR, we do not need
to take a stand on causality of bond and equity shocks for the purpose of our exercise.
   In Figure C2, we show the variance decomposition for both our leading and lagging
portfolios. Not surprisingly, given the persistence of dividend yields, the leading (lagging)
yield-specific shock explains most of the variance of the leading (lagging) portfolio dividend
yield (right panel). Most importantly, consistent with our intuition bond-specific shocks
matter more than aggregate equity-specific shocks for our lagging portfolio (left panel). The
opposite is true for our leading portfolio (middle panel).

Notes: This table reports loadings of dividend claims on shocks to the consumption growth. Max-
imum lags j2,lead and j2,lag are chosen to maximize adjusted R-squared. Newey-West adjusted
standard errors are reported in in parentheses. The quarterly data start in 1972:Q1 and end in
2012:Q4. One, two, and three asterisks denote significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respec-
tively.


D       Cash Flow Dynamics

This section provides further details about the estimation of the cash flows described in
equations (5)–(8). Specifically, the values for the time-horizons jc , jd , jlag are selected in the
range of ±30 quarters for the long-run risk exposures and from 0 to 20 quarters for the
short-run risk exposures. Our objective is to choose these integers in order to maximize
the adjusted R2 . After determining the maximal lag for the short-run consumption shocks
(jlag ), we re-estimate the model, restricting all statistically insignificant lagged exposures to
be zero. Under our selected horizons, our regressions have an R2 of 14% and 38% for leading
and lagging dividend growth, respectively. We report the estimated loadings of leading and
lagging portfolio cash flows on short-run shocks in table D1.

The log-linearization of Campbell and Shiller (1988) implies

Given this result, we can recover the log return on the consumption claim rt+1 , the risk-free

   By evaluating the Euler equation for the consumption claim at st = 0, we obtain the
equation for κc :
                                                  1

   Similarly to Equation (E.1), the dividend growth dynamics in Equations (7) and (8) can
be represented as
                          ∆dt+1 = µ + Ad|s · st + Ad|εc εct+1 + Ad εdt+1 ,                     (E.7)

which implies that the price-dividend ratio and the dividend returns have the following
structure:
                              pdt = pd + Apd st
                              d
                             rt+1 = rd + κd pdt+1 − pdt + ∆dt+1 ,

where

                                                   65
   Consequently, in vector form the following holds:

                            d

By evaluating the Euler equation for the dividend claim at st = 0, we obtain the equation

E.1          Special Case I: Advance Information on Long-Run Risk Only

Consider a slightly modified version of the Bansal and Yaron (2004) economy in which
consumption growth depends on a past value of the long run risk process xt−jc , i.e., the
agent has advance information on the long-run component for jc periods:


                                   ∆ct+1 = µ + xt−jc + εct+1                                  (E.8)

                                    xt+1 = ρxt + εxt+1 .                                      (E.9)


The investor’s information set at time t consists of the realization xt−jc and shocks to long-
                             
run risk process up to date t εxt−jc +1 , . . . , εxt . Consequently, we can rewrite the dynamics of
the long-run component, using the state variables in the information set and the innovation
εxt+1 , as
                                                        jc
                                                        X
                                      jc +1
                             xt+1 = ρ         xt−jc +         ρi εxt+1−i + εxt+1 .           (E.10)
                                                        i=1

   Following the standard solution approach, we consider a claim to aggregate consumption
C, whose log price-to-cash flow ratio at time t is denoted by pct . One can show that pct is


                                                   66
given as follows:
                                                                  jc
                                                                  X
                                  pct = pc + Ax xjc −1 +                Ai εxt−jc+i ,
                                                                  i=1

where
                              1       1              (κc )i   1
                    Ax =                    , Ai =                  , i = 1, . . . , jc ,
                           1 − 1/ψ 1 − κc ρ        1 − 1/ψ 1 − κc ρ

and the constant κc solves Equation (E.6).
                                                                     c
  Given this, we can obtain the log return on the consumption claim rt+1 , the risk-free rate
rtf , and the stochastic discount factor mt+1 as follows:

                                                                               

                           rtf = rf + ψ1 xt−jc                                                       (E.11)
                                                                                   
                                                                                        κjcc +1 x

                                                                                ψ
                                                                                               ε .
                                                                                        1−κc ρ t+1



Note that (E.11) is equivalent to the solution of the Bansal and Yaron (2004) economy when
we set jc = 0.
  Up to a Jensen correction term the equity premium is:

                           ex,c                                   c          c

                                  = γσc2 +        (1−κc ρ)2
                                                                 σx .


Since κc < 1, the contribution of the long-run risk component to the expected excess return
on the consumption claim diminishes with the lag jc , i.e., the longer in advance information
is available, the lower the risk premium.
  Let us now introduce a redundant claim with dividend growth defined by


                                         ∆dt+1 = µ + φx xt + εdt+1 .


Relative to the consumption claim, this claim provides an investor with forward looking
information about long-run risk. The log return and expected excess return (in levels) on

                                                                                     1

intertemporal substitution ψ > 1, the expected excess return increases with jc , i.e., with
the amount of time the dividend claim is actually leading the consumption claim.18 With
increasing jc the dividend claim exhibits more and more information risk relative to the con-
sumption claim, which in turn generates an increasing information premium as a component
of the expected excess return.


E.2      Special Case II: Advance Information on Short-Run Risk Only

We now consider a different modification of the Bansal and Yaron (2004) setup in which
a dividend claim depends on past realizations of shocks to consumption. Specifically, we
assume that consumption growth depends on the long-run risk process as in the Bansal
and Yaron (2004) setup. This is equivalent to setting jc equal to 0. Next, we introduce
a redundant asset whose cash flows depend on past realization of shocks to consumption.
Thus, the cash flows in the economy can be represented as


                                ∆ct+1 = µ + xt + εct+1                                                  (E.13)

                                  xt+1 = ρxt + εxt+1                                                    (E.14)

                               ∆dt+1 = µ + φx xt + φf εct+1−f + εdt+1 ,                                 (E.15)
  18
    To see this point, consider two different lag values, jc and jc0 : jc0 < jc . The fix point that determines
the approximation constant for the dividends claim implies kd < kd0 < 1. Simultaneously, kc0 < kc , as more
advance information reduces consumption risk.




                                                      68
where f is a lag of the consumption shock and φf stands for the loading of dividend growth
on this shock.
  Since there is no advance information about consumption, we obtain the following stan-

dard expressions for the log return on the consumption claim rt+1 , the risk-free rate rtf , and

  Next, consider the dividend claim with cash flow dynamics specified in Equation (E.15).
Conjecturing that the price-dividend ratio is affine in the state variables and using the Euler
equation, we find that the return on this claim is given as follows:
                                                  
                                                 1
                                1        κd φx − ψ
                   d
                  rt+1 = rd +     xt +                 εxt+1 + φf κfd +1 ct+1 + εdt+1 .
                                ψ          1 − κd ρ

  Apart from a Jensen correction term, the expected excess return on the dividend claim is


                        ex,d                              d          d
                   Et [rt+1  ] = −cov(mt+1 − Et [mt+1 ], rt+1 − Et [rt+1 ])
                                                                    
                                             κc κd φx − ψ1      γ − ψ1
                                      f +1 2
                               = γφf κd σc +                              σx2 ,            (E.17)
                                                (1 − κc ρ)(1 − κd ρ)

implying that advance information on the short-run shock reduces the required risk premium,
although to a much more modest extent, because the market price of risk on short-run shocks
is not as large as that on long-run news shocks (as one can see from a comparison of the
expressions (E.12) and (E.17)).
