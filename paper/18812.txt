                                               ABSTRACT

One of the continuing areas of controversy surrounding higher education is affirmative action. The
Supreme Court has agreed to hear Fisher v. Texas, and their ruling may well influence universities’
diversity initiatives, especially if they overturn Grutter v. Bollinger and rule that diversity is no longer
a “compelling state interest.” But what lies behind a compelling state’s interest? One issue that continues
to require more information is estimating and understanding the gains for those attending colleges
and universities with greater diversity. Most existing studies are either based on evidence from one
institution, which has issues of both selectivity and limited “treatments,” or focus on selective institutions,
which also face issues of selection bias from college choice behaviors. In this research we use Wave
3 of Add Health, collected in 2001–02 of those then attending college. Add Health collected the IPEDS
number of each college and matched these to the racial/ethnic composition of the student body. We
convert these data into an index of diversity and then ask whether attending a college/university with
a more diverse student body influences a variety of outcomes at Wave 4 (2007–08), including years
of schooling completed, earnings, family income, composition of friends, and probability of voting.
Our results provide evidence of a positive link between attending a college with greater diversity and
higher earnings and family income, but not with more schooling or the probability of voting.

Introduction

One of the continuing areas of controversy surrounding higher education is affirmative action in

admissions. The Supreme Court’s acceptance to hear Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin

(2/21/2012) is one piece of evidence that the issue remains unresolved. The legal question seems

to focus on whether there is a “compelling state’s interest,” which was the key argument in the

University of Michigan’s Supreme Court case, Grutter v. Bollinger, 2003. But what lies behind

a compelling state’s interest? If there is a state interest, is it compelling enough to offset the issue

of discrimination in admissions?

        In April 2012 a federal appeals court upheld California’s ban on using race/ethnicity or

gender in admission to the state’s public universities and colleges. Six additional states also have

such a ban. If individual states, and indeed the nation, are to make such decisions, an important

question is what are the gains of diversity to university and college student bodies? That is, one

issue that continues to require more information is understanding the potential gains from

diversity for those attending colleges and universities with greater diversity.

        This paper attempts to provide a partial answer to that question. Our definition of

diversity in this paper is “the composition of an institution’s student body in terms of race, sex,

and ethnicity, where movements away from 100 percent of the student body matching the

student’s own characteristics is increased diversity.”2 We then ask whether individuals who

attend universities and colleges with greater diversity have different educational, labor market,




2
  One might of course think of diversity in broader terms including attitudes, sexual orientation,
geographic location, parental status, and life experiences. While all or some of these might be
important dimensions that would add to an individual’s human capital, we are unable to pursue
these with available data and so instead use a narrower definition.
and socioeconomic outcomes as adults than individuals who attend universities and colleges with

more limited diversity.



Background Context
The practice of affirmative action by public universities and colleges has shifted from an

argument based on civil rights, equal opportunity, or non-discrimination to one focusing more on

the advantages of diversity for their student bodies (Lipson, 2008). This has occurred as courts

limited the use of affirmative action or “corrective justice,” and groups within states moved to

create ballot initiatives to ban the use of race or ethnicity for admissions. The newer approach,

called utilitarian or diversity based, appeals instead to the gains from attending an institution of

higher learning in a global age, where students are expected to gain skills for working in a global

environment, calling for interacting with individuals from numerous countries and backgrounds.

Indeed major corporations, the Department of Defense, and others who have not been traditional

supporters of civil rights-based actions on college admissions have publicly supported diversity

in admissions on the basis of utilitarian arguments (Ibid. 692)

       Their support is based on arguments of economics and community stability rather than

correcting historical discrimination. The idea is that students at universities and colleges with

greater diversity will be more successful in the global marketplace and thus enhance the success

of corporations who hire them. In economists’ terms, a diverse student body can be thought of

as a direct argument of the human capital production function. That is, the diversity of the

student body of the schools and colleges a person attends would have a positive and significant

coefficient within a regression model of the determinants of human capital, perhaps as captured

by full-time earnings. Thus it would appear that corporations believe in the positive influence of
diversity, and this belief has led to a legitimation of a goal of diversity as in the self-interest of

students matriculating at the university level.

        Beyond the implicit evidence provided by corporate behavior on this front, there is only

limited empirical evidence of the influence of diversity on the student body, particularly on

human capital. After a brief review of the literature, we turn to our own analysis.



Relevant Literature
There are three core approaches that have been used to study the influence of diversity on human

capital: experiments, longitudinal studies conducted within a single institution, and analysis of

data on students attending a larger though limited set of colleges. Experiments have taken a

variety of forms but many are comparisons of outcomes of participation in a small group made

up of all Whites or a more diverse group in a single session (Phillips, Mannix, Neale, and

Gruenfeld, 2004; Sommers, 2006). The findings from these studies vary with a suggestion of

greater creativity in mixed race groups while other studies suggest there is more conflict within

diverse groups (De Dreu and Weingart, 2003). Durlauf (2008) reviewed the evidence on

experiments, largely based on a review by Sommers (2006), and pointed out several limitations

with the current evidence: (1) experiments are of often of short duration and (2) they often

include only carefully structured groups with experimenter-determined racial composition.

Thus, these groups are often quite different from repeated interactions and naturally forming

social networks (Durlauf, 2008).

        A second type of study, focusing on the longitudinal analysis of individuals from a single

institution or a limited set of selective institutions, also has limitations. Importantly, these

studies suffer from selection problems; that is, there is endogeneity both in who applies for
colleges with differing levels of diversity and possibly in the admission process. This may limit

the external (and also internal) validity of the findings.

       Early studies using the longitudinal approach focus on gains to minority students. For

example, Bowen and Bok (1998) found that minorities admitted to elite schools tended to benefit

in terms of probability of graduating; Datcher-Loury and Garman (1995) look at future earnings

of minorities attending elite colleges. Boisjoly et al. (2006) also use a single institution but one

that randomly assigned roommates. These findings suggest a more pro affirmative action

viewpoint among those assigned a Black roommate but the outcomes studied are very limited.

All of these single university studies suffer from endogeneity or self-selection problems. A

newer version of these longitudinal studies is the carefully conducted University of Michigan

Study. This study is longitudinal and attempts to measure both actual student contacts and

attitudes on a variety of issues including race/ethnicity over time. Unfortunately, however, it is

limited to one elite public university and so again suffers from endogeneity (selectivity) issues.

       Two papers use multiple universities and these are closer to the work we present here. An

unpublished paper by Peter Hinrichs (2010) uses data from the Beginning Postsecondary

Students Survey, on White non-Hispanic students who were included in the National

Postsecondary Student Aid Study of 1995 to 1996, who were re-interviewed in 1998 and 2001 in

an attempt to estimate the influence of attending a more racially diverse college on earnings and

civic behavior. Arcidiacono and Vigdor [AV] (2010) use data from 30 colleges (the Mellon

Foundation’s College and Beyond database) to also estimate the influence of attending a more

racially diverse college on earnings. The data for both of these studies are far richer than those

for one institution but Hinrichs uses only non-Hispanic Whites who initially attend a 4-year
institution, and data are only for 6 years post the beginning of college, while AV use a data set

who attend 30 selective colleges and so is limited as well.

       We take a somewhat different approach to exploring the gains from attending a college or

university with a diverse student body. We use a nationally representative data set, the National

Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), and follow those individuals who

attended college while the third wave was being conducted. Add Health collected the IPEDS

number of each college and university and matched these to the racial/ethnic composition of the

student body. We use these data, converting them into an index of diversity. We then first

address whether there appears to be selection into who attends a more diversified

college/university and then move on to study whether attending a more diversified university

influences a variety of outcomes approximately seven years later, using a broader set of

outcomes than other studies have been able to examine. These include the racial/ethnic

composition of friends, whether or not college/university was completed, earnings, and family

income. In these estimates we control for factors that appear to influence the selection of one’s

college or university in terms of its diversity and run these regressions both with and without the

diversity of one’s high school included in the model.



Conceptual Model
We begin our model by building on the claims of corporations that individuals who are exposed

during their college years to persons of varying backgrounds and cultures are likely to be more

productive in working for international corporations. Corporations appear to focus on targeted

minorities such as African Americans, Hispanics, and certain Asians when making this claim.

Thus we expect that going to a university or college that is more diverse should increase

employment opportunities and wages. Furthermore, since there is a higher probability of
marrying or partnering with someone who attends the same institution than others, we expect

both partners to have higher earnings and so also expect that family income will be higher. But

this same explanation leads us to expect a significant change in the probability of graduating

from college/university or going on for additional education. In fact one might believe that the

higher expected earnings from a four-year degree at a “diverse” college/university might reduce

the probability of obtaining additional (post-college) schooling.

       Moving beyond these socioeconomic (SES) outcomes, we expect that attending a more

diverse institution is likely to lead to greater diversity in friends after completing schooling. We

base this simply on opportunities to meet and befriend a more diverse group of individuals.

Finally, using this model of gains from diversity we do not expect other differences in outcomes

such as probability of marrying earlier (by the fourth wave), voting behavior, or other possible

outcomes.

       Thus the core of the model is as follows: attending college with a more diverse student

body increases productivity in the international or global market but not otherwise; it increases

an individual’s productivity but only in certain sectors of the economy such as those involved

with the global market or where one works with other team members where membership itself is

diverse. This leads us to expect higher wages and family income but a lower probability of

advanced education beyond a college degree. It also leads us to expect greater diversity among

friends.



Data
The data we use are based on Waves 1, 3, and 4 of Add Health. Add Health is a data set that

focuses on adolescents and began with an in-school questionnaire administered to a nationally

representative sample of students in grades 7 to 12 in 1994/5. Data was also gathered from
parents, siblings, fellow students, and school administrators. Other matched data provide

information about neighborhoods and communities.

        The Add Health collected two waves of survey data while the respondents were in high

school and then followed the students five years later for a third collection in 2000/2001 and

eight years later in 2008/9. While we utilize information in the first wave of data to capture

family and high school background characteristics, the primary data we focus on is the Wave 3

data, collected when individuals in the sample ranged in age from 18 to 27 years with a mean age

of slightly more than 20. This data wave contains the only information indicating colleges

attended. Thus, we restrict our sample to those who attended an institution of higher learning in

that year. For these individuals, the survey collected an IPEDS identifier for the institution

attended that we use to measure the type of institution and 12-month counts by race/ethnicity and

gender for all undergraduates at the institution. We use these data to create a Herfindahl index to

capture diversity.

        Table 1 shows the basic descriptive statistics for our analysis sample. There are 2,844

observations and 46 percent of them are male. Slightly more than 11 percent are Black, about 9

percent are Hispanic, about 5.5 percent report themselves as other, with the remainder White.

Most of those in this sample were in earlier grades in Wave 1: about 22 percent were in grade 8

with a similar percent in grade 9; about 16 percent were in grade 10 while about 11 percent were

in grade 11; but less than 2 percent were in 12th grade.3


Measure of Diversity:
In order to capture the diverse nature of an institution’s student body we use a Herfindahl index

defined as the share of group i in the population where i refers to the various possible
3
 Because the Wave 3 (2000–01) data collection occurred five or six years after Wave 1 (when respondents were in
grades 7-12), respondents in the older grades at Wave 1 could have completed college by Wave 3 and were not
asked information about previous colleges attended.
racial/ethnic groups. The index we use is 1- the sum of squared shares, including shares of those

Black, Hispanic, White, other, where the index increases as there is greater diversity. This is

adopted from Alesia and La Ferrara (2005), who used such a measure to link ethnic diversity to

economic performance. The idea of this measure is to create an “ethnolinguistic

fractionalization” or ELF index. The basic idea is to measure the probability that any two

randomly drawn students at an institution belong to different racial/ethnic groups. The

maximum value of this index equals one, which would indicate that every individual at the

institution comes from a unique and different racial/ethnic group.

       The average ELF for our sample is .388 with a standard deviation of .141 and a range of

0 to .745. We also estimated a similar measure to capture diversity of the individual’s high

school. The high school ELF we estimate, using the same formula as for colleges, has a mean of

.313–slightly below that of the colleges and universities attended and a greater SD of .231. The

range is identical to that we calculate for the college level.



Results
Table 2 reports our first set of results by exploring who attends a college of greater diversity. In

these estimates we include background information including parental education, income, age,

and parental marital status all at Wave 1, own grade at Wave 1, whether the high school attended

was public or private, own race and sex, and the ELF score measuring the high school diversity.

Then in additional specifications, we first add in information on academic grades in four subjects

as of Wave 1, the Peabody Picture Vocabulary test (a measure of verbal IQ), and responses to a

question on college expectations asked at Wave 1; and finally we add in type of college using the

Carnegie classification.
       There are only a few individual and family-level variables that are significantly tied to the

level of ELF at the college attended. We find that those who report themselves as Hispanics are

more likely to attend a more diverse college, as are those who report themselves as “other race.”

In two of the three estimates those who self-report as Black appear less likely to attend a diverse

college. Attending a high school that is more diverse appears highly predictive of attending a

college that is also more diverse. In terms of type of institution, those who attend a liberal arts

college are likely to attend a less diverse institution while those who attend a two-year associates

college or “other” are more likely to attend a more diverse institution. Thus diversity of high

school attended and own race are the variables that appear to influence “choice” of college

diversity rather than own SES background, grades, or public versus private high school.

       Now to turn to our main focus—whether attending a more diverse college influences the

education an individual obtains, his or her earnings, family income, and diversity of friends as a

young adult. In these estimates our focus is on ELF, our measure of diversity. Also included are

age at Wave 3, a set of race indicators, sex, parental background including maternal education,

and whether parents were married at Wave 1, family income at Wave 1 and parental age at Wave

1. The missing family indicator variable is included as indicator variables for grade at Wave 1

and whether the individual attended a public or private school. We also control for type of

college using the Carnegie index. Consistent with our findings in the results reported above, we

also control for the diversity of the individual’s high school (School ELF). We estimate three

models for each outcome where we modify only how we enter ELF: in the first model we enter

ELF alone; in the second we enter ELF interacted with a dummy for females (sex); and in the

third we interact ELF with race/ethnicity indicator variables.
       In Table 3 we present our findings, showing results for all variations of ELF, ELF of high

school attended, and whether or not the high school attended was a private school (full results are

available from the authors).

       Education: Our results suggest that attending an institution that is more diverse is not

associated with the probability of completing a four-year college degree. The coefficients on

ELF and its interactions are generally small and not statistically significant. The exception is an

interaction with Hispanic that suggests that for Hispanics, attending a more diverse college is

significantly tied to a higher probability of completing a four-year degree. To give a sense of the

importance of diversity, we use the coefficient on Hispanic times ELF with the SD of ELF.

Doing this suggests that for Hispanics, going to a more diverse institution would increase the

probability of graduation by about 7 percentage points.

       Turning to the probability of getting additional education beyond a bachelor’s degree, the

results suggest a slightly lower probability among those attending a more diverse college that is

concentrated among females. Again Hispanics show a different pattern, with a higher probability

of graduate school attendance if they attended a more diverse college. Interestingly the results

also suggest that those who attended a private high school are less likely to attend graduate

school and that those who attended a more diverse high school are somewhat more likely to go to

some form of graduate school. Thus our expectation that those who attend a more diverse

college would be somewhat less likely to attend graduate school (of any form) is only modestly

borne out in our estimates. In contrast for persons who report they are Hispanics, greater college

diversity appears linked to an increased probability of additional education beyond a four-year

degree; again using the SD of ELF, an increase of 8.5 percentage points.
       In terms of additional variables in these models, males appear less likely to graduate or to

go on for additional post-baccalaureate schooling; those with a mother with more schooling

themselves appear to obtain more schooling, as do those from families with higher incomes

(measured at Wave 1); and there is some suggestion that Black students have a modestly lower

probability of graduating with a bachelor’s degree. The type of institution also appears to matter;

compared with students attending Doctoral/Research I universities, students attending Master’s

level universities/college, Associates-level colleges, or colleges where no IPEDS information is

available to classify college-type have negative and statistically significant coefficients

throughout. No other control variables appear systematically tied to the probability of completing

a bachelor’s degree or going on for additional education beyond four years of college.

       We conduct one further test; we limit our analysis to those who attended a four-year

college and add a control for college quality in order to eliminate this additional source of

variance that might be tied to the outcomes we are studying. The sample is reduced by about

one-third in doing this. When we do this, the results on ELF for graduating from college and

attending graduate school are generally consistent with those for the entire sample; that is, they

show no significant tie but the sign of the coefficients on ELF are mostly negative. For this

subset, we do not find that Hispanics who attend a more diverse institution are significantly more

likely to graduate or attend graduate school though the coefficients are positive. This change

could be tied to the smaller sample size. (Results available from authors.)

       Earnings: Our results on earnings, which are measured at Wave 4 when these individuals

were 24 to 32 years old, finds, as predicted, that those who attended a more diverse college have

statistically and significantly higher earnings. The coefficient on ELF is slightly more than

$13,000 dollars. Again using the SD of ELF, we calculate that attending a more diverse college
(as measured by a one SD increase in ELF) is expected to increase earnings by about $1,900 or

slightly more than 5 percent. None of the terms interacted with ELF are statistically significant

at traditional levels, though the suggested pattern is one where the gain to men is greater than

that to women, and the gain to Whites is greater that that for Blacks or Hispanics. An alternative

specification using log earnings has similar findings including the insignificant findings of the

interaction terms. The results using only those who attended a four-year institution and which

includes an additional selectivity measure in the equation again shows that attending a more

diverse college is tied to higher earnings. In this case, as reported in Appendix Table 2, we see

that the coefficient on ELF is 11,148, suggesting an increase of about $1,600 or nearly 4.5

percent. The coefficient on selectivity is positive and significant in this specification. In this case

the interaction between ELF and Black is negative and significant but of about the same

magnitude as in the full sample equation. No other interaction terms are significant at standard

levels.

          Income: Consistent with our findings on earnings and our predictions, there is a positive

tie between attending a more diverse college and family income. Family income is also

measured at ages 24 to 32. In this case, the statistically significant coefficient is about $17,000,

which when taken times our SD of ELF, yields an approximate increase in family income of

nearly $2,500 or about 3.5 percent. In the case of family income, no ELF interaction terms are at

all significant though they are all positive in sign.

          In terms of other control variables that influence family earnings, these include sex where

males have higher incomes; race where Blacks have lower incomes; mother’s education, which

suggests having a mother with higher education is tied to own family income and family income

at Wave 1 (parent’s income), which is also positively associated with own family income at
Wave 4. The pattern for earnings is again very similar to that for income. And in both cases,

having attended an Associates Level college is tied to lower income and earnings, compared to a

Doctoral/Research university.

       When we limit our analysis to those who attended a four-year institution and add a

selectivity measure for that institution, we find a larger influence of diversity on income. In this

case the coefficient is 27,523 or nearly $4,000 or about 5.5 percent. In this case, the interaction

between ELF and Hispanic is significant and positive, suggesting an additional increment to

income of nearly $6,000 for a total increase of nearly $10,000 per annum to Hispanics who

attended a more diverse college as captured by a one SD of ELF.



       Friendship patterns: We expect individuals who attend a more diverse institution to have

a more diverse set of friends, and that is what we find; although the overall effect is only

statistically significant in some specifications and then only at the 10 percent level. However,

when we interact the ELF measure with the race indicator variables we find that, while the

positive association holds for Whites, it does not hold for Hispanics who appear to have a less

diverse set of friends if they attended a more diverse college. We find this surprising. In

contrast to the results for diversity of college, we find that having attended a high school with a

more diverse student body is positively and significantly predictive of having a diverse set of

friends. Other variables that are significantly tied are own race, where other race, Hispanics, and

Blacks (in that order) are more likely to have a more diverse set of friends, and students with

older parents are somewhat more likely to have a diverse set of friends. The results over only

those who attended a four-year college are fully consistent with the larger sample.
        We also explored if individuals who attended a more diverse college are more likely to

vote. The results suggest no and a possible tie to a lower probability of voting than those

attending college with a less diverse student body. The results for the four-year college attendees

are consistent with those for the overall sample.



Discussion and Caveats
This paper explored whether there is a tie between attending a college with a more diverse

student body versus a less diverse one and a set of adult socioeconomic outcomes. The only

individuals in this study are those who both attended a college, broadly defined, and did so at a

particular point in time. For most individuals in this sample, this means attending college

immediately following high school but for some, starting with a slight delay or taking more than

four years to complete a degree.

We found that attending a college with a more diverse student body does not appear tied to the

probability of completing a four-year college degree, except for Hispanics, who do appear

somewhat more likely to get a bachelor’s degree if their institution is more diverse. We also

found a slight reduction in the probability of continuing on in school beyond a bachelor’s degree

for those who attend a more diverse college, again with an exception for Hispanics. In contrast,

and consistent with the productivity model, we find that students who attend a more diverse

college both have significantly higher earnings and higher family incomes. Whether this is a true

productivity effect or only a signal to employers that fit their own views of a productivity effect

is not clear, but the size of the coefficient suggests that the effect is large. Our results are

somewhat stronger in terms of additional earnings and income when we limit our analysis to

only those who attended a four-year college, and for this group we find that Hispanics in

particular have higher family incomes. We did not find attending a more diverse college to be
tied to having a more diverse set of friends, though our findings were heterogeneous and suggest

an increase in diversity of friends for White individuals and a decrease for Black and Hispanic

individuals.

        Overall, we see these as strong results suggesting that among those who attend college,

broadly defined, productivity as captured by earnings is higher for those who attended an

institution with a more diverse student body. And family income is higher as well. These results

are consistent with a model that suggests that the experience of diversity is likely to make an

individual more comfortable with, and more productive, in a global setting, making them more

productive workers for international firms. As expected, when we add a measure of college

selectivity and focus only on those who attend a four-year college, we find that institutional

selectivity is positively tied to higher earnings selectivity but the results for greater diversity

remain strong.

        Several caveats are relevant here. The results we report are only for those who attended

postsecondary schools at a particular point in time and they include only those who acquire more

schooling after high school. Second, while the original Add Health sample was nationally

representative, this is only a subset. However, compared to others who have attempted to

address the question of gains from diversity, we see this as an important contribution as it is

national in scope, includes all types of postsecondary institutions, and uses a set of longer-term

outcomes as our measure of gains.4

        There are several main findings from our study. First, using a broad set of institutions of

higher learning, including two-year colleges and four-year colleges that range from small liberal

4
  Other panel data sets that could be useful are the Michigan Panel Study of Income Dynamics or
the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. Our initial exploration with them suggests that the
sample of individuals in college at any point in time is too small and we think there are clear
advantages to both a large sample in college at the same period of time and a recent time period.
arts colleges to major research institutions, we find evidence of positive ties between attending

an institution of higher learning that is more racially diverse in terms of earnings nearly a decade

after graduation and also higher family income. Higher family income results suggested this

held across all racial/ethnic groups while the earnings pattern may exist primarily for Whites and

Hispanics. Second, at the same time as we find gains in earnings and income, we find little

effect on a larger set of outcomes, suggesting little trade-off in terms of other outcomes that

might offset, in part, these positive ties to earnings and income. The findings also suggest that

legal limits to the ability of an institution of higher learning to attain a diverse student body may
