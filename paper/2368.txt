                 Returns to Seniority in Union and Nonunion Jobs:

                            A New Look at the Evidence




                                     ABSTRACT



        One of the most prominent features of U.S. unionism is the key role
  played by seniority. However, in cross—sectional data, the positive
  association between seniority and earnings is typically much stronger for
  nonunion workers than for union workers. This finding has puzzled previous
  researchers, since it seems inconsistent with the generalization that
  seniority is more important in the union sector than in the nonunion sector.
  We show that standard estimates of the return to seniority are likely to be
  biased upward and argue that the bias is likely to be larger in the nonunion
  sector than in the union sector. Corrected estimates imply that the return to
  seniority is, in fact, larger in the union sector than in the nonunion sector.

 I. Introduction

         A prominent feature of U.S. unionism is the key role played by

 seniority. As early as the 1920's and 1930's, replacing foreman's discretion

 with a seniority—based reward structure was an important focus of the emerging

 union movement.' Modern theories of union behavior emphasize the strength of

 senior workers' influence on union objectives (Farber, 1978; Blair and

 Crawford, 1984; Freeman and )ledoff, 1984; Farber, 1986). Recent evidence

 indicates that seniority is indeed substantially more important in both

layoffs and promotions under collective bargaining than in its absence

 (Abraham and Medoff, 1984, 1985). The major exception to the generalization

that seniority is more important in the union sector than in the nonunion

sector is the finding, replicated by a number of researchers using different

data sets, that the slope of the seniority—earnings profile in a cross—section

is steeper for nonunion workers than for union workers.2

         In this study, we challenge the finding that the returns to seniority

are greater among nonunion workers than among union workers. Elsewhere

(Abraham and Farber, 1987), we argue that standard cross—section estimates of

the returns to seniority are biased upwards, and we provide evidence that this

bias is quite important for nonunion workers.     Here, we argue that this bias

is larger for nonunion workers than for union workers and that the true

returns to seniority are larger among union workers than among nonunion

workers. In the next section we present a discussion of the sources of bias




    1. Slichter (1941) offers an insightful discussion of union attitudes
towards seniority rules. See also Gersuny (1981).
    2. Representative studies include Leigh (1978) , Borjas (1979), and
Pfeffer and Ross (1980), all using the National Longitudinal Survey of Mature
Men; Farber (1983) using the Quality of Employment Survey; Polachek (1983)
using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics; and Mellow (1983) using the May 1979
Current Population Survey. Many of these studies are summarized in Lewis
(1986)

in the standard estimates of the return to seniority, and we discuss why the

bias is expected to be larger for nonunion workers in section III.

     In section IV we develop two alternative approaches to deriving

consistent estimates of the return to seniority. Both approaches depend on a

measure of completed job duration that we construct using data from the

Michigan Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) based on the estimation of

separate Weibull proportional hazards models for the union and nonunion

sectors. The construction of these job duration measures is described in

Section V of the paper. Section VI contains the paper's central results

regarding the estimation of separate earnings functions for union and nonunion

males in blue—collar jobs from the PSID.

     The results are in line with our expectations. In standard cross

section earnings equations fit for samples of blue collar workers, the

estimated return to seniority is larger for the nonunion group than for the

union group. However, once the upward bias in these standard estimates is

taken into account, we find that the returns to seniority are larger for union

blue collar workers than for nonunion blue collar workers.



II. Bias in Cross-Section Earnings Functions

      We turn now to a simple model of the sources of bias in cross-section

estimates of the return to seniority. Such bias may arise from unmeasured

individual differences in earnings and/or from unmeasured job/match

differences in earnings. Individual heterogeneity will cause an upward bias

in the estimated return to seniority if more able individuals both earn higher

wages and stay longer on their jobs. Job/match heterogeneity will cause an

upward bias if workers on good jobs or in good matches both earn more and stay

longer on their jobs. The model illustrates the contribution of three factors

to the magnitude of the upward bias in the estimated return to seniority.
                                                     3




 These factors are 1) the degree to which ability is rewarded with higher pay,

 2) the variance in ability in the sample population, and 3) the variance in

 the job/match component in earnings.

             Suppose that the earnings of a particular worker on a particular job at

 a particular point in time can be written:

                             = A S.. + A EXP. . + &A, + ,

                                                                     ijt
 where

         V =       hourly     earnings,

         S =       current        seniority (tenure),
         EXP =     pre-job        experience,

         A =       individual        ability,
              =    a job specific error term representing the excess of earnings

                   received by this person on this job over and above the earnings

                   that could be expected on a randomly selected job,
              =    a person/job/time—period specific error term,

              =    index     of individuals,

         j    =    index     of jobs,

         t =       index     of years within jobs,

         A's =    returns      to seniority and to pre—job experience, and
         a =      returns      to unobserved ability.

For simplicity of exposition, other factors that might influence earnings are

omitted from the model and all variables are assumed to be measured as

deviations from their means. In this formulation, u,                 .
                                                                         captures   the net

influence of two unobservables on hourly earnings: unobserved job quality and

unobserved match quality. A. is assumed to be fixed over an individual's

lifetime and u. .       is   assumed to be fixed over the course of a job. A. may be

        In equation (1), 2 represents the returns to experience due to

accumulation of general human capital or simply to the passage of time in the

labor market. Earnings are also likely to grow with experience because more

experienced workers, having had more chances to search for and sample labor

market opportunities, typically end up in better jobs and/or better matches.4

This means that more experienced workers are likely to have higher ti's so

where   . is     the total return to seniority and                              +   u is the total return to

pre—job experience. The net return to seniority is appropriately defined as

the excess of growth in earnings on a given job over and above the total

returns to general labor market experience, or                                   —        +   c).
        In practice, earnings functions are usually estimated using cross—

section data where neither A nor                             are observable. The earnings function

as ordinarily implemented in a cross—section can be rewritten as:

                lnW.. =bS.. +bEXP.. +v..

where           is the estimating equation error. Note that both the person—

specific component of the error (BA.) and the job/match specific component of

the error (,..) are omitted from the equation.



    3. This model is a generalization of the model presented in Abraham and
Farber (1987)
    4. See and Topel (1985) and Abraham and Farber (1987).

        How does omitting these person and job/match error components from the

 earnings equation affect the estimated value of the net return to seniority,
    —     + a)? To answer this question, we need to impose more structure on

 the interrelationships among seniority, experience, job duration, A. and             ii...

 Suppose that the completed duration of jobs is positively related to both A.

 and ii.. and that the following relationship holds:

        (5)
                             1 i          2 ij           ij
 where D. .
         1)
              is     the completed length of the current job, A. and u. are as
                                                              1             1J
 defined above, and the 's are parameters that summarize the relationships of

D with A and Li.         The parameter 2. will be positive to the extent that more

able workers are on longer duration jobs, and the parameter                 will be

positive to the extent that workers in "good" jobs or good matches are on

longer duration jobs. The random component, E.., captures the variation in

completed job duration that cannot be linked to variation in worker quality or

to variation in the earnings advantage associated with job/match quality.5

Substituting from equation (2),

Holding initial experience constant, completed job duration is positively

where bEXp          is the coefficient obtained from a regression of EXP on S (which

is expected to be positive), DET1 is the determinant of the X'X matrix

containing cross—products of seniority and experience, and the other terms are

as previously defined. Thus, the estimated total return to seniority is

biased upwards and the estimated total return to experience is correspondingly

biased downwards. Both the upward bias in the estimated total return to

seniority and the downward bias in the estimated total return to experience

contribute to an upward bias in the estimated net return to seniority, b1 —


b2.
       The formal model, and in particular equations (9) and (10), highlight

several factors that may contribute to greater upward bias in the estimated

return to seniority, other things equal. First, assuming that                           is positive,

the bias will be larger where the variance in unobserved ability (var(A)) is

larger. Second, again assuming that                       is positive, the bias will be larger

where the reward to unobserved ability (&) is larger. Third, the bias will be

larger where the variance in the job/match component of earnings that is not

systematically related to pre—job experience (var(...)) is larger. Note that

       (11) var(.. .)       = var(ji. .) - oc2*var(EXP.        .).

  If cc2*var(EXp..) is similar across two samples, then the difference in the

 variance of • across the samples will be approximately equal to the difference

 I'•
       Available evidence pertaining to returns to ability, heterogeneity in

 ability, and heterogeneity in the job/match component of earnings among union

 versus nonunion workers provides grounds for believing that the union

 seniority coefficient is less seriously upward biased than the nonunion

 seniority coefficient.

       First, it is likely that the rewards to unobserved ability are lower in

 the union sector than in the nonunion sector. Numerous observers have noted

 the importance of single/standard rate policies and automatic progression

policies in union wage setting (for example, the Vebbs, l92O and Slichter,

Healy and Livernash, 1960). Using data from the Industry Wage Surveys carried

out by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), Freeman (1982) documents that

within—establishment wage dispersion is lower in the union segment than in the

nonunion segment of the industries for which data are available. He also

notes that explicit single rate and automatic progression policies account for

much of this difference in wage dispersion for union as compared to nonunion

establishments. Such policies leave little room to reward differences in

workers' ability. Numerous other studies (e.g., Bloch and Kuskin, 1976;

Lewis, 1986) using data on individuals have established that skill

differentials and educational d.ifferentials in wages are lower among unionized

workers than among nonunion workers. While these studies pertain only

indirectly to the rewards to unobservable differences in
                                                           ability, they suggest
strongly that the rewards ()   associated with these differences are lower
among union workers. To the extent that this is true, the bias in estimated
                                     8



seniority coefficients will be less for samples of union workers.

     Next, it is plausible that there is less heterogeneity in ability among

union workers than among nonunion workers. Abowd and Farber (1982) and Farber

(1983) develop and test a queuing model of union status determination. They

hypothesize that "more skilled workers would be less likely to desire a union

job while union employers would be more likely to want to hire more skilled

workers" (Abowd and Farber, 1982, p. 367), and their empirical findings are

generally supportive of the model. To the extent that unobserved ability is

an important factor in both worker selection and employer selection, the

dispersion of ability among union workers will be lower than the dispersion of

ability among nonunion workers. Assuming that more able workers are also more

stable, lower dispersion in ability (var(A1)) for union workers means less

upward bias in estimated seniority coefficients for samples of union workers.

      Finally, there is reason to suspect that the variation in the job/match

component of earnings will be lower across union jobs than across nonunion

jobs. Institutional labor economists have long recognized that unions strive

to standardize rates across establishments, at least within broad sectors (see

Slichter, Healy and Livernash (1960)). Freeman (1982) offers evidence that

dispersion in average wages across union establishments in an industry does

tend to be lower than the dispersion in wages across nonunion establishments

in the same industry. In addition, the same forces limiting employers' power

to reward higher ability workers would also limit their power to pay higher

wages to workers who are especially well suited to a particular job, thereby

reducing the importance of match—specific (as opposed to job—specific)

effects. To the extent that the variation in that part of the job/match

component of earnings not systematically related to experience (var(..)) is

lower across union jobs than across nonunion jobs, this too will contribute to

lower bias in the estimated return to seniority in cross—section earnings
                                             9



  equations fit for samples of union workers.

          Further evidence concordant with the above hypotheses is provided by the

 various studies which conclude that the dispersion of wages is lower in the

 union sector than in the nonunion sector, even after controlling for the

 influence of observable individual characteristics.6

         These arguments for why we might expect less bias in the estimated

 return to seniority for union workers than for nonunion workers assume that

 other things are equal across the two sectors. We have no a iori reason to

 expect that                    var(EXP), or the ratio of var(EXP) to
                                                                             DET1 should
 differ systematically between the union and the nonunion sectors. We cannot

 simply compute the relative biases in the estimated net returns to seniority

 in union and nonunion earnings functions
                                                 using equations (9) and (10) since
much of the information on unobservables that would be needed is unavailable.

However, we have developed methods for computing corrected estimates of the

seniority coefficients in cross—section earnings equations.



IV.   Corrected   Cross-section Estimates   of   the Return   to Seniority
        One approach to correcting the equation (4) estimates of the
                                                                     returns to
seniority and to experience is to find an appropriate instrument for the

seniority variable. Equation (8) suggests a suitable instrument:
                                                                 ijt' which
            — 1/2*D, ..
equals S.
        ijt             By construction, .
                                         ijt
                                             is correlated with seniority but
uncorrelated with completed duration and thence uncorrelated with the omitted

individual and job/match components in the earnings equation. The

instrumental variables estimator of b1 is a consistent estimator of             and the
instrumental variables estimator of b2 is a consistent estimator of             + .



      6. These studies include Hyclak (1979), Freeman
                                                      (1980) and Hirsch (1982).
                                              10


     The preceding assumes that the expected value of current seniority in a

cross—section is indeed just equal to half completed job duration. This

assumption is stronger than necessary and may not be precisely correct. For

example, in a growing population, there will likely be more people near the

start of their jobs than near the end. More generally, using the residual

from the regression of seniority on completed job duration as an instrument

for seniority yields consistent estimates of               and 2 +   .   By construction,

this residual is uncorrelated with completed duration and correlated with
             7
seniority.

      An appealing alternative approach to correcting the bias in the

estimated seniority coefficient in a cross—section earnings equation is to

control explicitly for the completed length of the job. We term this the

"augmented OLS" approach. The seniority coefficient in equation (4) is upward

biased only because both A. and               are related to how long a job ends up

lasting, and workers in jobs that end up lasting a long time tend to have

higher current seniority when we observe them in a cross—section. Augmenting

equation (4) by adding D.. as an explanatory variable yields the following

specification:

      (12) mW.. =bS.. +bEXP.. +bD..  +..

The seniority coefficient in equation (12), b,, is an unbiased estimator of

     The experience coefficient has expectation:

                 E(b2) = A2 +

  expected to be positive),
                              DET2 equals the determinant of the 2x2 matrix

  containing cross—products of EXP and D, and the other terms are as previously

  defined. So long as workers with more pre—job experience tend to stay longer

  in their positions, b2 is a downward biased estimate of
                                                                +   . This,   in
  turn, implies that b1   b2 is an upward biased estimate of the net return to

  seniority.8 The augmented OLS procedure has the advantage that it permits

  direct examination of the relationship between
                                                    completed job duration and
  earnings, both on average and over the course of the job.

       Using the identity that links total experience with pre—job experience

 and seniority (EX?..t = EXP.. +
                                   S..t)   and ignoring second order terms, valid
 inferences regarding the net return to seniority can be drawn from an earnings

 function specification that includes either pre—job experience or total

 experience along with seniority. Where pre—job experience is used, the net

 return to seniority (    —
                                +))   is calculated as the difference between the

 coefficient on seniority and the coefficient on pre—job experience. Where

 total experience is used, the net return to seniority is simply the

 coefficient on seniority. To facilitate discussion regarding the net return

 to seniority, we proceed from here using total experience.9

       In the empirical analysis that follows, we develop a measure of

completed job duration using longitudinal data and use this measure in the two



     8. In the samples we examine, the instrumental
                                                     variables procedure and
 the alternative procedure of adding completed job duration to the earnings
 equation yield almost identical estimates of the net return to seniority.
This implies that, in these samples, the bias in the estimated total return to
experience and the resulting bias in the estimated net return to seniority are
quite small. See Section VI.
     9. For the instrumental variables
                                       estimator, this requires the minor
modification that total experience (and its square, if included) must be
instrumented for along with seniority. The natural additional instruments are
pre—job experience (and its square). In a model without squared terms, the IV
estimator of the specification using pre—job experience and the IV estimator
using total experience with pre—job experience as an additional instrument
yield identical estimates of the underlying parameters.

ways just described to estimate "corrected" earnings functions for samples of

union and nonunion blue collar workers.



V.

      The first step in implementing the analysis just described is to derive
a measure of completed job duration. Clearly, a data set suitable for this

task must follow individual workers over time so that one can observe how long

the jobs they hold ultimately last. The data set should also have information

on the individual workers' characteristics, including their union status, and

their wages/earnings. The ?Iichigan Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID)

satisfies these requirements and is used in the empirical analysis.

Unfortunately, even in a long panel like the PSID, there are many jobs which

do not end by the date at which the individual is last observed. Some

procedure must be used to impute completed durations to these jobs.

      We take the approach of estimating a parametric model of job duration

that accounts for the censoring of duration in those jobs for which the end is

not observed. This model is then used to compute an estimate of the expected

completed job duration conditiona on the job lasting, at least as long as the

last observed seniority level. In the estimation of the earnings function,

this estimate is used as the measure of completed job duration for the

censored spells. The actual completed job duration is used for jobs for which

the end is observed. This procedure has the advantage of using all available

information on job duration.

A. The Jobs Sample

      All   of the subsequent analysis is performed using data for male
                                                              10

     10. Unfortunately, the design of the PSID precludes meaningful examination
                                        13


  observations from the random national sample portion of the PSID (the so—

  called Survey Research Center or SRC subsample). Persons who were retired,

 permanently disabled, self—employed, employed by the government or residents

 of Alaska or Hawaii were excluded from the sample. Because we were concerned

 that different processes might govern seniority attainment and earnings in

 different broad occupational
                                groups, we look exclusively at samples of blue
 collar workers.1' In what follows, we center our discussion on results for

 two samples of workers: unionized blue collar workers and nonunionjzed blue

 collar workers.12 In order to be clear in the identification of union and

 nonunion jobs, observations on jobs for which the worker changed union status

 during the course of the job do not appear in either sample.13   In each year
 from 1968 through 1980 in which those individuals satisfying our selection

 criteria were household heads, information was available on number of years

 they had held their current job, number of years they had worked prior to

 taking the current job, years of education, race, marital status, disability

status, occupation, industry, region and earnings.14



  of females for the purposes of this study. This is because complete
 information is available only for household heads, and, where households
 contain both male and female adults, the male is assumed to be the head by
 default.
      11. There were not enough white collar unionized workers to permit a
meaningful analysis of white collar workers.
      12. In some years unionization refers to union membership, and in other
years to coverage by a collective bargaining agreement. Where both were
available, collective bargaining agreement coverage was used.
     13. In 371 jobs workers were coded nonunion in some years and union in
others. If 1) at least two thirds of the observed years on one of these jobs
were coded nonunion, 2) there were no runs of three or more years coded union,
and 3) the first and last years observed on the job were coded nonunion, then
the entire job was considered a nonunion job and was included in the nonunion
sample. An analogous decision rule lead to the assignment of some mixed jobs
to the union sample. A total of 149 jobs could not be assigned to either
group and were deleted altogether.
     14.  Nore details on the data file used in the analysis, and in particular
on the construction of the seniority variable, can be found in Abraham and
Farber (1987). We are grateful to Joe Altonji for making his data extract
from the PSID available to us.

     There are 767 jobs held by 551 individuals represented in the union blue

collar sample and 1417 jobs held by 831 individuals represented in the

noflUfliOfl blue collar sample. Our concern at this point is with ascertaining

how long each of these jobs ultimately lasted.

      Various characteristics of the jobs in each of the two samples are

reported in Table 1. Variables that can change over time in an unpredictable

fashion (e.g., marital status, occupation) are assumed constant and measured

at the first point the job is observed in the sample.    The last observed

seniority on a job is always considered to be the seniority at the last date

the person is observed with an employer, whether or not the individual is
                                             15
still in a blue collar position at that date.

      In the union blue collar sample, we observe the actual completed

duration for 327 of 767 jobs, and in the nonunion blue collar sample, for 775

of 1417 jobs. Not surprisingly, a large proportion of the completed jobs are

relatively short: 71 percent of the completed jobs in the union blue collar

sample and 85 percent of those in the nonunion blue collar sample lasted no

more than three years. However, in both samples, there are a sizable number

of completed jobs lasting 3 to 10 years and over 10 years. Longer jobs are

more common among the still—in—progress jobs:     28 percent of the incomplete

jobs in the union blue collar sample and 22 percent of the incomplete jobs in

the nonunion blue collar sample had lasted more than 10 years as of the last

date they were observed.




     15. For example, if an individual 1) was observed on a single job for ten
 years running 2) reported being a blue collar worker for the first five years
 and a professional employee for the next five years; and 3) reported having 13
 years seniority in the last observed year, then the job would appear in our
 sample with a last observed seniority of 13 years.

B. SpecifiCapJ24i
        In   order to use completed job duration as an earnings equation control

variable, we need a method of determining the expected completed duration of

the incomplete jobs. We specify and estimate a parametric model of completed

job duration for each sector, and. then we use the estimated parameters to

predict the expected completed length of jobs still in progress as of the last

date we observe them.

        The proportional hazard Weibull specification serves as the basis of the

estimation reported here. In that specification, the probability that a job

has completed duration (D) greater than or equal to T is

        (14)     Pr(DT) =   exp[xTU]
where        is a positive parameter. The proportional hazard assumption is that

the baseline hazard is

        (15)     x=e —z.
where Z is a vector of observable individual characteristics hypothesized to

affect job duration and '      is   a vector of parameters. The separation hazard

associated with this distribution is:

        (16) H(t) =

        If    the parameters of a Weibull duration model are estimated, there is

some ambiguity in the interpretation of the estimate of u.        The obvious

interpretation is that the estimated value of         indicates "true" duration

dependence. An alternative interpretation is that the estimate of          is biased

downward by unmeasured heterogeneity across individuals, jobs and/or matches.

For the purposes of this study, we are not interested in distinguishing

between true and spurious duration dependence. We are simply interested in

estimating a parametric model of completed job duration that is flexible

enough to make allowance for both true duration dependence and unmeasured

heterogeneity in hazards. While we could specify a particular distribution
                                             16


  for the unobserved heterogeneity in the hazard along with the Weibull form of

  duration dependence, it is well known that there are problems with robustness

  of the estimates of heterogeneity and duration
                                                       dependence with regard to
  changes in the assumed distributions in models of this sort.16 We take the

  approach of estimating a simple Veibull model of completed job duration

  without any explicit representation for unmeasured heterogeneity.

        The contribution to the likelihood function
                                                            made by a completed job is
 the Probability—density that the job lasted exactly Sf years given that the

 job lasted at least
                       S0 years.'7 Given a Weibull distribution for duration,
 this is

       (17)     Pr(D=SfID>S0) =

 Similarly,   the contribution to the likelihood function made by a job with a

 censored duration is the probability that the job lasted more_than

     16. See Lancaster (1979) for a parametric approach to the problem of
estimating unmeasured heterogeneity in a WeibulJ. model of unemployment
duration. Heckman and Singer (1984) present a semi—parametric approach to
estimating duration models with unmeasured heterogeneity.
    17. It is important to condition on the length of the job as of the date
it is first observed because the
                                  sampling scheme is such that jobs will not be
observed unless they last long enough to make it to the start of the sample
period.
    18. Note that this specification of the
                                              likelihood function assumes that
unmeasured factors affecting completed job durations are independent across
spells. A more complete specification would recognize that we observe some
people on more than one job and allow explicitly for individual heterogeneity
in job changing propensity. Given the nonlinear nature of the model, we saw

C. Estimation of the Job Duration Model

      Column 1 and column 2 of Table 2 contain estimates of the Weibull job

duration model estimated over the subsamples of 767 union blue collar jobs and

1417 nonunion blue collar jobs, respectively. These estimates were derived by

maximizing the likelihood function defined above with respect to the

parameters   and       In interpreting the estimates of the determinants of

the baseline hazard (k),   recall   that the hazard rate was specified such that

         Thus, an increase in a variable with a positive coefficient reduces x

and increases the expected duration of the job. In both models the hypothesis

that the all of the coefficients () in the baseline hazard (x) with the

exception of the constant are zero can be rejected at any reasonable level of

significance.2° Thus, the variables included in the model have significant

explanatory power for job duration.

      The two sets of estimates are generally similar. In both the union and

the nonunion sample, years of experience prior to taking a job has a positive

effect on the completed duration of the job. Married workers' jobs tend to

last longer than those of otherwise similar workers. Education raises

predicted job duration for the nonunion sample, but has no statistically

significant effect on job duration for the union sample. Being a foreman or

craft worker has a stronger effect on the duration of union jobs than on the

duration of nonunion jobs.




no obvious appropriate and tractable way to do this.
    19. The algorithm described by Berndt, Hall, Hall, and Hausman (1974) was
used to find the maximum.
    20. The likeihood ratio statistic is 81.2 for the union model. This is
distributed as x with 21 degrees of freedom. The likelih9od ratio statistic
is 104.8 for the nonunion model. This is distributed as x with 22 degrees of
freedom.

       We used the parameter estimates from the appropriate column of Table

to predict the expected completed job duration of each of the incomplete jobs

in the two san'iples.21 This expectation is computed conditionally on the job

lasting longer than the last observed seniority (Sf years). Note that the job

duration model we have estimated is based on data for the pre—retirement

period. It will capture the net effects of quit and layoff processes on job

duration, but will not capture the effect of the competing retirement process

which comes into play for older workers. If we predicted job durations

without taking retirement into account, some would be implausibly long.        We

therefore assume that all jobs that are in progress when the worker reaches

age 65 end at that point.

        For an individual/job match with observable characteristics Z that has

lasted Sf years as of the last date we observe it, the conditional expected

completed job duration is:
                                          S                    Pr(DS

in a similar manner.

        Many of the union blue collar jobs were quite long of the 767 completed

  and incomplete jobs represented in the sample, 22 percent were predicted to

 have completed durations of 1 year or less, 9 percent to have completed

 durations of 1 to 3 years, 17 percent to have completed durations of 3 to 10

 years and 51 percent to have completed durations of more than ten years. More

 of the nonunion blue collar jobs were relatively short of the 1417 completed

 and incomplete jobs represented in the sample, 35 percent were predicted to

 have completed durations of 1 year or less, 16 percent to have completed

 durations of 1 to 3 years, 25 percent to have completed durations of 3 to 10

 years, and 24 percent to have completed durations of more than ten years.



 VI. Earnings Function Estimates

       Having derived an estimate of completed job duration we turn now to the

 question of the relative magnitude of the net returns to seniority in union

and nonunion jobs.

      Our starting point is to fit standard earnings functions of the form

       (22)
                   ijt ) =
               ln(V.         e       +   e    S.     +   e2 E.       +   e 3 E. + X,     + E.
                                 0           1 ijt             ijt          ijt    ijt      ljt
where ln(W) is the logarithm of real average hourly earnings,
                                                                                         5ijt is
seniority, E.   is total experience, X.
            ijt                                          ijt     is a vector of other individual

characteristics,   and Ejit represents unmeasured factors affecting earnings.

The coefficient        is the net return to seniority and corresponds to                           —

       in   the model of Section II. These earnings functions are fit using the

individual—year observations from the two jobs samples discussed in Section

III. There are 3084 individual—year observations for workers in union blue

collar jobs and 3554 individual—year observations for workers in nonunion blue

collar jobs.

               The first columns of tables 3a and 3b contain estimates of
                                     20



selected parameters of standard earnings functions.22 Each equation also

includes controls for education, race, marital status, disability, occupation,

industry, region, and time. These estimates imply that the returns to

seniority are larger for the nonunion blue collar sample than for the union

blue collar sample. Among union workers, each additional year of seniority is

associated with roughly a 1.0 percent increment to earnings; among nonunion

workers, each additional year of seniority is associated with earnings that

are 1.4 percent higher. The difference between the two estimated seniority

coefficients is significant at better than the 0.01 level.

      The instrumental variables estimates in the tables' second columns tell

a very different story. In these equations, the residual from the regression

of seniority on completed job duration is used as an instrument for seniority,

and pre—job experience and its square are used as instruments for total

experience and its square.23 The estimated return to seniority for the union

sample falls only slightly, from 1.0 percent per year to just over 0.7 percent

per year. The decline in the estimated return to seniority is much larger for

the nonunion sample, a drop of more than a full percentage point from 1.4

percent to 0.3 percent per year, and the corrected estimate is not

significantly different from zero. In contrast to the standard equations,

these equations imply that the return to seniority for union blue collar



    22. The stadard erors presented are the "simp1e standrd errors
computed from a (X'X)   for the OLS models and from   (Z'X)   for the IV
models. These standard errors are not strictly appropriate for the estimation
here because they do not account for the fact that the measure of completed
job duration is predicted for the observations on censored jobs. Standard
errors that are corrected both for this fact and for general
heteroskedasticity were computed for a number of specifications. These were
uniformly very close to the "simple" standard errors.
    23. in the regression of seniority on completed job duration fit for the
union sample, the constant term is —1.990 (standard error 0.206) and the job
duration coefficient is 0.500 (0.008). In the nonunion equation, the constant
term is —1.313 (0.097) and the job duration coefficient is 0.550 (0.005).

  aAll models also include controls for education, race, marital status,
disability, occupation, industry, region, and time. E(completed job duration)
is computed using the relevant estimates from Table 2. The IV estimates use
1) the residual from the regression of seniority on completed job duration, 2)
pre—job experience, and 3) the square of pre—job experience as instruments for
seniority, experience, and the square of experience. The numbers in
parentheses are standard errors. Sample size = 3554.

  workers is larger than the return for nonunion blue collar workers, a

  difference that is significant at better than the 0.01 level.

       As discussed earlier, an alternative estimate of the net return to

 seniority can be obtained by adding completed job duration to the standard

 earnings function. This is done in the column (3) models of tables 3a and 3b.

 The returns to seniority estimated using this alternative approach are

 virtually identical to those obtained using the IV approach. While the

 theoretical discussion in Section II implied that the augmented OLS estimates

 of the return to seniority reported in column (3) may be upward biased, the

 close correspondence between the IV and augmented OLS estimates indicates that

 any such bias is small.24

       These findings are in accord with some scattered earlier results.

 Mincer (1983) finds that controlling for prior nobility reduces the estimated

 return to seniority for nonunion workers, but not for union workers. Altonji

and Shakotko (1987) use an instrumental variables approach to dealing with the

bias in estimated returns to seniority. While union/nonunion differences are

not a central focus of their study, they do report that their correction

procedure reduces the estimated return to seniority more dramatically for

nonunion workers than for union workers.

      The other interesting implication of the column (3) estimates is that,

in both samples, those on long jobs earn substantially and significantly more

than those on short jobs. Among union blue collar workers, someone on a job

that will end up lasting twenty years earns 9.0 percent more in each year on

the job than someone on a job that will end up lasting only five years. Among

nonunion blue collar workers, someone on a twenty year job earns approximately




    24. In fact, in the nonunion sample, the augmented OLS estimate is
slightly, though not significantly, smaller than the IV estimate.
                                     22



18 percent more in each year on the job than someone on a five year job.

     In the column (4) models, we allow the effects of completed job duration

to vary with current seniority. The results confirm that those on long jobs

earn more at all points on the job, although the effect seems to be strongest

at the start of the job and somewhat weaker later on.

     The column (4) results contradict one possible alternative

interpretation of our central finding that, when completed job duration is

introduced into the earnings equation, it takes on a positive coefficient and

the estimated return to seniority falls. Specifically, it might be argued

that the returns to seniority are higher on long jobs than on short jobs and

that, because we do not allow for this possibility, completed job duration

enters with a positive coefficient and soaks up some of what are in fact

returns to seniority. If this interpretation were correct, when we allowed

the effects of completed job duration to vary with current seniority, we

should find that eventual completed job duration is only weakly associated

with earnings among workers with lower levels of seniority, and more strongly

associated with earnings among workers with higher levels of seniority. In

fact, the opposite appears to be true.

      Probably the most important question to be raised about the preceding

analysis is whether we have done a sufficiently good job of measuring

completed job duration. Using expected completed job duration in place of

actual completed job duration does not cause inconsistency in the earnings

equation parameter estimates, provided the correct job duration model has been

used in computing completed job duration. However, if the job duration model

itself is misspecified and this leads to random errors in the expected

completed job duration variable, both the instrumental variables estimate and
                                       23


  the augmented OLS estimate of the return to seniority are biased upwards.25

  In the present context, if we have done a less good job of predicting expected

  completed job duration for the union blue collar sample than for the nonunion

  blue collar sample, this could at least in part account for the higher

 estimated return to seniority for union workers than for nonunion workers in

 the IV and augmented OLS equations.

       In light of this concern, we have made an effort to assess the method

 used to compute completed job durations for the censored jobs. Since our

 measure of completed job duration for censored jobs is really a nonlinear

 transformation of the sorts of variables already included in the earnings

 function plus the last observed value of seniority, an obvious question is

 whether our measure completed job duration contains information beyond that

 contained in last observed seniority itself. The models in the first three

 columns of tables 4a and 4b indicate that, for both the union and the nonunion

 samples, this question can be answered "yes". For comparison, column (1)

repeats the augmented OLS euatjon that includes completed job duration and

its square. In column (2), last observed seniority and its square replace

completed job duration. The column (3) models include both completed job

duration and last observed seniority. In both samples, comparison of column

(2) and column (3) reveals that the inclusion of completed job duration and




    25. Taking the instrumental variables approach, the instrument for
seniority is constructed as the residual from the regression of seniority on
expected completed job duration. If there are random errors in the expected
completed job duration variable, its coefficient in this regression will be
biased downward. This means that the constructed residual will be positively
correlated with actual completed job duration and thence with omitted
individual or job/match quality. Using this residual as an instrument for
seniority in the earnings equation yields an upward biased estimate of the
return to seniority. In the augmented OLS earnings equation, random errors in
the expected completed job duration variable cause the job duration
coefficient to be biased towards zero and the estimated net return to
seniority to be biased upwards.

its square adds significantly to the model's explanatory power at the 0.05

level or better, even after controlling for last observed seniority. The

major difference between the two samples is that last observed seniority adds

significantly to the explanatory power of the union model even after completed

job duration has been controlled for, whereas it does not add significantly to

the explanatory power of the nonunion model.26   We have no explanation for

why last observed seniority should have an independent association with

earnings in the union sector.

      Another obvious question concerning our completed job duration variable

is whether the relationship between completed job duration and earnings

differs between the observations that come from jobs where actual completed

durations are observed and from jobs where completed durations are predicted.

To answer this question, we reestirnated the augmented OLS earnings functions

with two additional variables: the interaction between completed job duration

with a dummy variable that equals one if the job duration is uncensored and

equals zero otherwise, and the interaction of the square of completed job

duration with the same dummy variable. These estimates are contained in

column (4) of tables 4a and 4b. In the union sample, these interaction terms

add significantly to the explanatory power of the model; in the nonunion




    26. This is verified by F—tests of the general specification in column
(3) against the restricted specifications in column (1) and column (2). The
test statistics for the hypothesis that completed job duration and its square
have zero coefficients are 3.27 for union blue collar workers and 12.1 for
nonunion blue collar workers. The test statistics for the hypothesis that
last observed seniority and its square have zero coefficients are 6.22 for
union blue collar workers and 0.295 for nonunion blue collar workers. All the
test statistics are distributed as F with 2 and approximately 3000 degrees of
freedom. The critical values of this distribution are 3.00 at the 5 percent
level and 4.61 at the 1 percent level.
                                      25


 sample, they do not.27

       It is clear that our measure of completed job duration captures

 important variation in worker/job/match quality in both sectors. However, our

 procedures do seem to be somewhat more satisfactory for the nonunion sector

 than for the union sector. With regard to the estimated returns to seniority,

 the estimates in tables 4a and 4b imply roughly equal returns for union and

nonunion workers, but these estimates are based on specifications with no

obvious structural interpretation.




      In conclusion, our corrected estimates (in tables 3a and 3b) have the

clear implication that the return to seniority in the union sector is larger

than the return to seniority in the nonunion sector. This finding is

conditional on our measures of union and nonunion job durations, and we do

find some evidence that our union job duration measure is imperfect.     However,

even our explorations using less restrictive models (in tables 4a and 4b)

always yield estimated seniority coefficients in the union sector that are at

least as large as the estimated nonunion seniority coefficients. Thus, we

reject the standard finding that the return to seniority is smaller in the

union sector than in the nonunion sector.




    27. The test statistics are 6.22 for the union sample and 2.95 for the
nonunion sample, both distributed as F with 2 and just over 3000 degrees of
freedom. The critical values of this distribution are 3.00 at the 5 percent
level and 4.61 at the 1 percent level.
