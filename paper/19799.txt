                                           ABSTRACT

Equity overvaluation is thought to create the potential for managerial misbehavior, while monitoring
and corporate governance curb misbehavior. We combine these two insights from the literatures on
misvaluation and governance to ask 'when does governance matter?' Examining firms with standard
long-run measures of corporate governance as they are shocked by plausible misvaluation, we provide
consistent evidence that firm performance is impacted by governance when firms become overvalued
– overvaluation causes weaker performance in poorly governed firms. Our findings imply that firm
oversight is important during market booms, just when stock prices suggest all is well.

  At least since Keynes (1936) economists have argued that stocks can get irrationally

priced and that this divergence from fundamental value may impact managerial decisions.1

Overvaluation may help hide misbehavior, create the need to manipulate information, or

create the incentive to focus on the short run. Morck, Shleifer and Vishny (1990), Stein

(1996), Baker, Stein and Wurgler (2003), Gilchrist, Himmelberg and Huberman (2005),

Panageas (2005), Polk and Sapienza (2009), and Campello and Graham (2013), for ex-

ample, all explore managerial investment decisions in the presence of irrational market

prices. Rhodes-Kropf, Robinson and Viswanathan (2005), Shleifer and Vishny (2003) and

Rhodes-Kropf and Viswanathan (2004) consider the effect of overvaluation on merger ac-

tivity. Baker and Wurgler (2002), Welch (2004), and Khan, Kogan and Serafeim (2012)

examine the effect of valuation on equity issuance and capital structure. Chernenko, Fo-

ley and Greenwood (2012) propose that overvaluation allows firms with greater agency

costs to issue equity. Jensen (2005), Bolton, Scheinkman and Xiong (2006) and Bolton,

Scheinkman and Xiong (2005) argue that overvaluation is the root cause of much man-

agerial misbehavior.2 This body of work suggests that agency costs are procyclical, i.e.

higher at the top of the wave.

  In a separate literature researchers have theorized and presented evidence that corporate

governance can effectively reduce agency costs. In the classic works by Manne (1965) and

Scharfstein (1988), insulating managers from shareholders or from the takeover market

increases shirking, empire-building, and the extraction of private benefits. More recently

Gompers, Ishii and Metrick (2003) create a measure of external governance and document

powerful evidence of its impact on firm performance and stock returns.3 Following this

work many authors report evidence that firms’ external governance alters corporate de-

cisions and outcomes. For example, measures of better governance have been shown to

predict higher return on assets (Core, Guay and Rusticus, 2006), better firing decisions

(Huson, Malatesta and Parrino, 2004), better acquisitions (Masulis, Wang and Xie, 2007),

more cash reserves (Harford, Mansi and Maxwell, 2008; Yun, 2009), etc.

    If overvaluation leads to bad decisions and if strong governance curbs this behavior,

then governance should be particularly valuable in times of overvaluation. This simple yet

powerful notion has not been previously explored. In this paper we integrate the idea that

agency costs are time-varying with the traditional governance view to investigate for the

first time if misvaluation causes managerial problems that better governance can counter.

    We begin the paper with a simple extension of Holmstrom and Tirole (1997) to fix

ideas. In their model all managerial decisions are correct. However in our extension with

overvaluation, some managers choose to shirk (or take on a weak projects) in equilibrium.

Strong governance reduces the manager’s ability to exploit the firm and thus reduces this

behavior. Importantly, our extension demonstrates why undervaluation may not have

the opposite symmetric effect - with overvaluation the incentive compatibility constraint

is violated, while with undervaluation the constraint is simply slack. This implies that

the importance of governance should increase with overvaluation but not decrease with

undervaluation.4

    A direct empirical implication of our model is that weakly governed firms should perform

poorly only following periods of overvaluation. We take this idea to the data using mea-

sures of price deviations from long-run fundamentals (Rhodes-Kropf et al., 2005; Hoberg

and Phillips, 2010), as well as an alternative measure of misvaluation based on mutual

fund flows (Coval and Stafford, 2007; Khan et al., 2012).5

   4 This asymmetry does not arise in theories of misvaluation and managerial decisions that are not based on
agency problems. For example, Derrien, Kecsks and Thesmar (2012) find that the role of investor heterogeneity in
mitigating the effect of misvaluation on managerial decisions is symmetric for over- and undervalued firms.
   5 Measures similar to Rhodes-Kropf et al. (2005) have been used in much recent work (for examples, see Hertzel
                                    GOVERNING MISVALUED FIRMS                                3


  In the Compustat/CRSP universe of US publicly traded firms, we estimate deviations

of actual market values from those implied by historical pricing. Our main tests focus

on the interaction of this misvaluation measure with a measure of corporate governance

developed by Gompers et al. (2003) (the GIM-index). We use this governance measure

because previous literature (see, for example, Cremers and Ferrell (2012)) has shown

that the GIM-index was very stable during the time period we examine (1990-2006),

eliminating the concern that firms change their governance in response to overvaluation.6

Furthermore, it is important to note that this measure of governance is not correlated

with overvaluation. Thus, our empirical approach is to examine future performance of

firms with stable governance in response to overvaluation shocks. We also use plausibly

exogenous state law changes to provide increased confidence that the effects are caused by

governance differences.

  We find robust evidence that the positive correlation between governance and future

ROA is increasing in measures of overvaluation. In numerous different specification (in-

cluding firm fixed effects, quantile regressions, eliminating technology firms, alternative

valuation measures, etc) we find a strong positive relationship between the interaction of

valuation and governance and future ROA.

  One interpretation of this finding is that weak governance is particularly detrimental

to firms with high values due to unobservables such as growth options. We attempt

to distinguish our theory from this alternative in three different ways. First, we test

our theoretical prediction that overvalue and undervaluation should not have symmetric

effects. Second, we look for effects in portfolio returns since misvaluation implies an ability

to find positive alphas. Finally, we reexamine our results using an alternative measure of

misvaluation based on mutual fund flows (Coval and Stafford, 2007; Khan et al., 2012). In

and Li (2010), Campello and Graham (2013), and Hoberg and Phillips (2010)).
   6 And we can alternatively use the beginning of sample period governance measures.
4                                                                                             DECEMBER 2013


all three tests, detailed below, we find support for the idea that governance matters more

for overvalued rather than simply highly valued firms.

    Our first test is based on our theoretical prediction that overvaluation should cause

the bad behavior that governance can counter, but that undervaluation should not have

an oppositive symmetric effect. We find that future ROA is positively correlated with

corporate governance only after times when misvaluation is also high. Thus, when firms

are highly valued, those firms that already had strong governance outperform. On the

other hand, during undervalued or typical times we find no difference in performance

between firms with different governance measures. These results are consistent with our

model’s prediction that the role of governance is important during times that the firm is

overvalued.

    Our second approach is to examine stock market returns since misvaluation implies an

ability to find abnormal returns (alphas).7 Thus, for weakly governed firms, periods of

overvaluation should be followed not only by operating return underperformance, but also

by stock market return underperformance. In order to test this prediction, we examine

returns from portfolios sorted by our measure of misvaluation in addition to the governance

index. Our results show that the significant abnormal returns in the governance hedge

portfolio, i.e. the portfolio that is long well-governed “democracy” firms and short poorly-

governed “dictatorship” firms, are concentrated in firms that are overvalued according to

our misvaluation measure (a monthly alpha of 119 bp). By contrast, abnormal returns to

the governance hedge portfolio in times of normal or under-valuation are insignificantly

different from zero. These results are also consistent with our model where the effects

of misvaluation are asymmetric. Importantly, stock market underperformance is hard to

    7 In fact, a value-weighted portfolio that shorts firms that are overvalued according to our measure and longs
firms that are undervalued, earns a positive monthly alpha of 88 bp (94 bp for an equal-weighted portfolio) in our
sample. This suggests we are measuring misvaluation.

explain with an alternative view where our measure of misvaluation captures high valuation

rather than overvaluation: if investors valued equity correctly at all times and anticipated

differential performance by well-governed firms, governance may be associated with lower

ROA, but should not result in differential stock market performance.

  One important implication of our results is that abnormal returns to the governance

hedge portfolio should be time-varying and systematically related to misvaluation. In an

extension to Gompers et al. (2003), Core et al. (2006) demonstrate that the governance

hedge portfolio returns are no longer statistically positive when they extend the sample

to include the 2000-2004 time period – one hypothesis is that investors learned about the

benefits of good governance. When we extend our tests to this time period, we find that

among overvalued firms democracy minus dictatorship portfolio returns are still positive

and similar to other periods. However, fewer firms become overvalued during this period.

These results suggest an alternative explanation for why returns to the governance hedge

portfolio have declined after 1999 – this may be due to the limited number of overvalued

firms during that period.

  In an alternative approach, we re-run our tests using a plausibly exogenous firm-specific

measure of overvaluation. Khan et al. (2012) build on Coval and Stafford (2007) and

use mutual fund flows to measure stock overvaluation.8 They identify 1.5% of firms that

become overvalued when they are subject to substantial buying pressure by mutual funds

experiencing large capital inflows. They then show that these stocks experience a cu-

mulative decline in market adjusted returns of 10% over the next six quarters, as well

as a significantly higher probability of a seasoned equity offering, greater insider sales,

and higher likelihood of equity M&A. Our results also hold using this overvaluation mea-

sure. In particular, we find that firms that become overvalued according to this measure
   8 Khan et al. (2012) argue this measure is “exogenous to the firm since it is associated with who is buying–buyers
with excess liquidity–rather than with what is being bought.”
6                                                                               DECEMBER 2013


subsequently perform relatively better (ROA) if they have better governance, while the

performance of firms that are not overvalued is independent of governance. Furthermore,

buying the stocks of overvalued firms with good governance and selling the stock of over-

valued firms with poor governance produces significant positive alpha, while there is no

positive alpha from a long-short portfolio based on governance in the set of firms that are

not overvalued. Using this second measure of overvaluation provides significant support

for the idea that governance is most important when a firm becomes overvalued.

    To address the remaining potential endogeneity concern, that our results are driven

by some unobservable firm characteristic correlated with GIM, we follow Bertrand and

Mullainathan (2003) and exploit the passage of state business combination laws as a

source of exogenous variation in corporate governance. These laws, passed by states

at various times between 1984 and 1991, effectively weakened corporate governance in

these “treated” firms. This allows us to compare the impact of overvaluation on firms

operating in the same state that incorporated in different states and thus have plausibly

exogenous differences in corporate governance. Our results provide support for the idea

that governance matters most when firms become overvalued.

    In the last part of the paper we consider the channel through which governance may

affect firm performance in overvalued times. We find that both well- and poorly-governed

firms invest more and engage in more acquisition activity in overvalued times, but not

differentially so. However, when we examine the future operating efficiency of these firms,

we find that labor productivity, cost efficiency, and sales growth are all superior for well-

governed firms following overvalued times. Thus, there seems to be an effect of governance

during overvalued times on investment quality, but not on investment quantity.

    Overall, we find consistent evidence that the disciplining effect of governance is strongest

during times when firms seem overvalued. The extensive set of different tests we present
                              GOVERNING MISVALUED FIRMS                                   7


are remarkably consistent with theories related to misvaluation and governance and si-

multaneously difficult to reconcile with other stories.

  One drawback with our work, and all work that relies partly on GIM index, is that

it is difficult to know how these governance provisions affect firms. These provisions are

often thought to protect firms from the takeover market, allowing for the ‘quiet life’ and

poor performance. Our work would suggest this protection has its largest effect when the

firm is overvalued, rather than when the firm is under-performing as one might expect.

Potentially this is because the takeover market is most active when firms are highly valued

(Rhodes-Kropf et al., 2005), and so being relatively less overvalued is more dangerous

for a CEO than being undervalued? Alternatively, firms with more pressure from the

takeover market may hire/retain better CEOs (Huson et al., 2004). Potentially, a higher

quality CEO is more important during market booms? Our findings raise many interesting

questions and potential avenues for future work.

  The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section I presents an extension of

Holmstrom and Tirole (1997) to show the effects of overvaluation. Section II describes the

data and our empirical proxies for misvaluation. Section III demonstrates the empirical

relationship between governance, misvaluation, and firm performance. Section IV reports

how returns depend on the governance misvaluation-relationship. Section V reexamines

the main results using mutual fund flows to indicate overvalued firms, while section VI uses

state law business combination laws to “treat” firms with different governance. Section

VII considers potential mechanisms of action and investigates investment and operational

efficiency. Section VIII concludes.

                              I.   Misvaluation and Misbehavior


    In this section we present a simple variation on the classic model of Holmstrom and

Tirole (1997) to show how overvaluation and undervaluation can have asymmetric effects

on ‘misbehavior’ and furthermore, how better governance can reduce the misbehavior.

We do this not to argue that this is the only way in which overvaluation and governance

can interact, but rather to provide a framework for looking at the asymmetric effects of

misvaluation and governance in the data, as well as to demonstrate that the asymmetric

effects we find in the data stem naturally from a small extension to a classic model. All

proofs are in appendix A.


                                       A.   Standard Setup


    The economy consists of two types of agents: firms and investors. All agents are risk-

neutral and protected by limited liability.

    Each firm has an amount of capital A and one economically viable idea that requires

an investment of I > A > 0 in period 1. Thus, the firm needs I − A in external funds to

be able to invest. In period 2 an investment in the project generates a verifiable return

equaling either 0 (failure) or R (success). We can think of an economy or industry as

containing a continuum of firms with different amounts of capital, A, required investment,

I, and potential returns R.

    The probability that the project succeeds (and returns R) is either pH or pL (∆p =

pH − pL > 0) depending on the manager’s project choice (or equivalently effort choice).

Projects are run by managers who receive private benefits of 0, b or B where 0 < b < B.

Projects with a private benefit of b or B have a low success probability of pL while the

‘good’, high probability, pH , projects have no private benefits. This can be interpreted as

reduced effort providing a private benefit of b or B, and reduced effort in turn reducing the
                                       GOVERNING MISVALUED FIRMS                                                     9


probability of success, or as a managerial pet project with higher private benefits but lower

expected returns. Thus, without proper incentives managers will choose lower expected

return projects with higher private benefits. We will refer to managerial behavior that

generates private benefits at the expense of expected return as ‘misbehavior’.

  As is standard, we assume that investors require a return γ and that only the good

projects are economically viable, i.e., pH R−γI > 0 > pL R−γI +B. And better governance

is assumed to eliminate the highest private benefit project B. This is the same as assuming

that it reduces the private benefit from B to b.

  All assumptions above are identical to Holmstrom and Tirole (1997). Now we add the

possibility that uninformed investors may misperceive the probability of success or failure.


                                                B.    Misvaluation


  We assume managers know pH and pL . However, investors are uninformed in that they

do not know the true probabilities and instead perceive the probabilities to be p0H =

(1 + δ)pH and p0L = (1 + δ)pL conditional on the actions of the managers, where δ > 0

means projects are overvalued and δ < 0 means projects are undervalued.9

  If investors are rational then p0H = pH and p0L = pL on average (or in expectation). How-

ever, whether or not investors are rational, at any given moment in time for any particular

firm, sector or market investors may incorrectly judge the probability of success or failure.

A difference between the probabilities used by managers and those used by investors could

arise fully rationally due to asymmetric information as in Myers and Majluf (1984) (see

also Greenwald, Stiglitz and Weiss, 1984).10 And of course, any biases, irrationality, or

limited cognitive ability could also cause a misperception in the probability of success (see
    9 These probabilities are the expected value of the probabilities of the uninformed investors given all available
information including the known actions of the participants in the know, or alternatively simply the irrational beliefs
of the uninformed investors. An additive formulation p0H = δ + pH produces similar results.
   10 Kumar and Langberg (2009) and Goldman and Slezak (2006) also consider the possibility that informed insiders
strategically manipulate outside investors beliefs.
10                                                                            DECEMBER 2013


Barberis and Thaler (2003), Hirshleifer (2001), and Shleifer (2000) for summaries). In this

paper we take no stand on the source of the mistake only that it is possible for investors

to be mistaken.


     We assume that uninformed investors still require a return γ and have probability beliefs

such that only the good projects are economically viable, i.e.



                                p0H R − γI > 0 > p0L R − γI + B                            (1)



Given the setup, one optimal contract requires the firm to invest A, the uninformed

investors to invest the balance of I − A. The contract then pays everyone nothing if the

project fails and if the project succeeds divides the payoff R into Rf > 0 for the firm and

Ru > 0 for the uninformed investor, where Rf + Ru = R.


     Given equation (1) uninformed investors will only invest if they believe the manager will

choose the good project. Thus,



                                      p0H Rf ≥ p0L Rf + B                                  (2)



Therefore, the incentive compatible investor belief requires that the firm receive at least



                                          Rf ≥ B/∆p0                                       (3)



If this condition holds then uninformed investors will invest I − A if they expect to earn

γ on this investment. Thus, p0H Ru ≥ γ(I − A). This leaves investors with the perception

that there is at most Ru = R − B/∆p0 to compensate investors, so the maximum perceived

pledgable expected income is p0H [R − B/∆p0 ]. Therefore, we can conclude that only firms
                               GOVERNING MISVALUED FIRMS                             11


with enough assets, A, such that


                                                p0H
                              A > A(γ) = I −        [R − B/∆p0 ]                     (4)
                                                 γ


can finance their project, i.e. firms must have this minimum amount of cash in order to

attract outside finance.

  Given the required uninformed investor returns of γ on their investment of I − A, the

firm’s payoff if the project is successful is



                                   Rf = R − γ(I − A)/p0H .                           (5)



Given this, the manager will only choose the good project if



                     M anager IC        Rf = R − γ(I − A)/p0H ≥ B/∆p                 (6)



Note that the Manager IC and the investors’ beliefs about the manager IC, equation (3)

are different. As the following proposition shows, this will lead to equilibrium manager

misbehavior that comes as a surprise to investors.

PROPOSITION 1: When investors overvalue firms (δ > 0), firms with



                            B/∆p > R − γ(I − A)/p0H ≥ B/∆p0                          (7)



will receive investment and managers will choose the worse project in equilibrium. When

investors correctly value or undervalue firms (δ ≤ 0) then all managers will choose the

good project.

  The investors invest expecting the manager to choose the good project. However, be-
12                                                                                             DECEMBER 2013


cause investors have over estimated the probability of success they do not realize that

the manager is better off shirking and getting larger private benefits. Furthermore as the

following corollary shows, the more overvaluation there is the more misbehavior will occur.


COROLLARY 1: When investors overvalue firms (δ > 0), increased overvaluation (δ

increases) will cause more firms to receive investment and find their manager choose the

poor project. When investors correctly or undervalue firms (δ ≤ 0), decreased undervalua-

tion (δ decreases) will cause fewer firms to receive investment but no change in managerial

decisions.


     Thus, the proposition and corollary tell us that overvaluation leads to misbehavior and

more overvaluation leads to more misbehavior. At the same time undervaluation lowers

investment but no misbehavior occurs when firms are undervalued because the conditions

of proposition (1) cannot be met.11

     Even if investors know that misvaluation and misbehavior are possible, as long as they

cannot detect or screen for it ex-ante then they cannot prevent it and must simply raise

their return threshold to make up for the fraction with poor projects.


                                               C.    Governance


     When firms can be overvalued corporate governance potentially has an enhanced role

compared to the standard Holmstrom and Tirole (1997) setup. In the standard setup no

firms choose the bad project in equilibrium. This is because investors will only invest in

projects where the firm has enough capital, A, such that the manager can be incented

to choose the good project. In the standard set up, corporate governance lowers the

amount of capital a firm must have to attract investment but it does not alter equilibrium
   11 It is interesting to note that undervaluation ensures that the manager’s IC constraint is not binding for any
firm. Thus even if investors make small mistakes about other variables, such as underestimate the private benefits,
the manager will still choose the good project.

managerial behavior. The following proposition shows that with overvaluation corporate

governance actually mitigates the amount of shirking or poor project decisions.

PROPOSITION 2: Better corporate governance reduces the managerial decisions caused

by overvaluation that are bad for shareholders. However, better corporate governance does

not alter managerial decisions in undervalued firms.

  Intuitively, when private benefits are reduced the perceived IC and the true IC are closer,

so fewer CEOs choose the worse project in equilibrium. In undervalued firms the true IC

is always slack so increased governance has no effect.

  When prices do not reflect fundamentals correctly, better governance prevents invest-

ments in worse projects. With overvaluation, mechanisms that delegate (incentives/take-

over market/etc) do not work as well. Thus, the central idea we wish to demonstrate

with this simple model is that overvaluation increases poor managerial investment deci-

sions while governance provisions that enhance discipline on management decrease this

behavior. At the same time, undervaluation does not affect managerial decisions. This

asymmetry stems naturally from the simple addition of misvaluation to a classic model of

governance, and we will see, matches what we find in the data.


                                         II.   Data


  Proposition (2) forms the basis for the key empirical prediction of our model: weak

governance should be associated with poor operating performance only following periods

of overvaluation. We take this prediction to the data using the measures of misvaluation

developed in Rhodes-Kropf et al. (2005) (as extended in Hoberg and Phillips (2010)) and

a measure of corporate governance developed by Gompers et al. (2003) (the GIM-index).

This section details the construction of these measures and provides details on our main

dataset.
14                                                                                            DECEMBER 2013


     To measure corporate governance, we use the GIM-index which is a simple sum over

the 24 governance provisions in described in Gompers et al. (2003). While the GIM-index

captures only a certain aspect of corporate governance (the strength of shareholder rights)

and is by no means exhaustive, we find it attractive in our setting since it has remained

remarkably stable during our sample period (1990-2006). As argued in Gompers et al.

(2003) and documented in Cremers and Ferrell (2012), most provisions comprising the

index were adopted during the 1980s in response to the hostile takeover wave. By 1990,

there was a lot of variation across firms in these provisions. This variation remained in

place for the next two decades since firms did not dismantle antitakeover provisions even as

the takeover market subsided. In fact, during our sample period, most of the variation in

the GIM index is cross-sectional (86.5%), with only 13.5% of observations showing a change

of at least one in the GIM-index. Most of these changes happened due to institutional

investor and/or regulatory pressure. This reduces the concern that firms endogenously

alter their governance in response to market valuation conditions, which would be the

case with other popular measure of corporate governance such as institutional ownership

or managerial compensation. In fact, when we replace the standard GIM-Index with the

beginning of period score, we find very similar results.

     The data on the GIM-index is drawn from the ISS Riskmetrics governance data set which

collects information on a set of 24 governance provisions for about 2,500 unique firms most

of which are in the Standard & Poor’s 1500 over the 1990-2006 period.12 We use both

the continuous version of the index as well as a dummy variable that indicates whether

a firm uses only a few (“Democracy”) vs. many (“Dictatorship”) governance provisions.

Firms are considered Democracy Firms if they have 5 or fewer and Dictatorship if they

   12 IRRC volumes are published about every two years (1990, 1993, 1995, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006). We
follow Gompers et al. (2003) in assuming that a provision remains in effect between publication dates. A detailed
description of the 24 provisions can be found in Gompers et al. (2003), Appendix A.

have 14 or more governance provisions, respectively. The median firm in our sample has

9 governance provisions.

  In order to retrieve information on accounting variables, we match firm-year observations

from Riskmetrics to Compustat and retain those with non-missing book value of assets.

As is standard in the literature, we exclude dual class firms, financial firms (6000-6999

SIC range), and regulated utilities (4900-4999 SIC range). Finally, we exclude companies

with missing data on ROA and explanatory variables. This selection process results in a

final set of 15,046 firm-year observations for 2,023 firms from 1990 to 2006.

  Our first measure of relative valuation is based on the measures developed in Rhodes-

Kropf et al. (2005) and Hoberg and Phillips (2010). These measures are used in much

recent work examining misvaluation. We start with estimating total relative valuation

which is a measure of the difference between a firm’s actual valuation and one implied

by average industry pricing (using historical industry multiples). In particular, following

Rhodes-Kropf et al. (2005) and Hoberg and Phillips (2010), for each industry j and year

t, we first estimate a valuation model from the following industry-level regressions using

ten years of lagged data:13



             log Mijτ = a0jt + a1jt log Bijτ + a2jt log (N I)+                         +
                                                             ijτ + a3jt I(<0) log (N I)ijτ               (8)

                            + a4jt LEVijτ + εijτ ,

                      τ = t − 10, ..., t − 1



where i indexes firms, j indexes industries, and t indexes time. Mijt is the market value

of equity, computed by multiplying the common stock price at fiscal year-end (item 199)

by common shares outstanding (item 25). Bijt is the book value of equity, constructed as

 13 Note   that the valuation model is estimated using enitre CRSP/Compustat universe of public firms.

stockholders’ equity (Compustat item 216) plus balance sheet deferred taxes and invest-

ment tax credit (Compustat item 35) minus the book value of preferred stock (Compustat

item 56). N I is net income (Compustat Item 172). Since we estimate the regression in

logs, we set negative values of net income to zero and include an indicator function for

negative values of net income. LEVijt is the leverage ratio computed as the ratio of total

long-term debt (Compustat item 9) to total assets (item 6). In order to reduce the impact

of outliers, all variables are winsorized at the 1% level.

     To obtain a measure of total relative valuation, we use estimated αjt−1 ’s from our

empirical model (8) to predict the following year’s valuation for each firm i. We then

take, for each firm, the difference between its actual valuation in year t and its predicted

valuation. This is the estimated total relative valuation (Total RelVal) for each firm in

every year. The three-digit SIC industry average of firm total relative valuation (excluding

firm i) is our main measure of overvaluation, referred to as industry relative valuation

(Industry RelVal) throughout the paper (see also Hoberg and Phillips (2010) for a similar

measure).14 As in Hoberg and Phillips (2010), we only rely on historical data in the

construction of our relative valuation measure in order to avoid a look-ahead bias.

     We also explore robustness of our results to three alternative valuation models. The first

alternative model employs a richer valuation model where market-to-book is regressed on a

broader set of determinants than in (8) (as in Pastor and Veronesi (2009) and Hoberg and

Phillips (2010)). The second alternative model augments the valuation model in (8) with

the GIM index. As shown in Gompers et al. (2003), weak corporate governance can result

in lower valuation multiples. While there is no evidence to suggest that overvaluation

depends on corporate governance, we want to explore this possibility with this robustness

   14 We make limited use of the total misvaluation measure because it is correlated with firm-level variables such
as firm size. Thus, results using this measure may be driven by spurious correlation between the relative valuation
measure and firm characteristics. Industry RelVal, on the other hand, is free from this concern because it is not
correlated with firm characteristics.

check. Finally, the third model uses an entirely separate methodology based on mutual

fund flows. We describe the fund flow methodology in more detail in Section V. As

discussed later, all of our results are robust to these other valuation models.

  As in Rhodes-Kropf et al. (2005), we are careful to note that the above regressions

capture high relative valuation and not necessarily overvaluation. Almost certainly at

least some of the highly valued firms are valued that way for a reason. However, a value-

weighted portfolio that is long firms that are undervalued according to our measure and

short overvalued firms generates a statistically significant alpha of 88 bp per month (or, 94

bp per month in an equal-weighted portfolio).15 This suggests that our measure captures

some misvaluation. Furthermore, the Rhodes-Kropf et al. (2005) measure has had such

impact because firms with high relative valuation have behaved as would be expected if

their prices contained significant overvaluation, and in ways that are otherwise difficult

to explain. We will also use an alternative measure of overvaluation based on mutual

fund flows - this generates a more limited sample of overvalued firms but our results will

continue to hold in this sample. Overall, we will report findings by how they relate to high

relative valuation, but we will discuss them in relation to the misvaluation hypothesis, and

we will spend a significant part of the paper looking for evidence that our findings are due

to overvaluation.

  Panel A of Table I presents summary statistics for our sample. Appendix B provides

sources and detailed definitions of the control variables, which are standard. Sample mo-

ments for corporate governance measures and firm characteristics are in line with previous

governance studies that use the Riskmetrics sample (e.g., Gompers et al. (2003)). The

industry relative valuation measure is in line with Rhodes-Kropf et al. (2005) and Hoberg

   15 Specifically, we form portfolios based on terciles of the distribution of three-month lagged Industry RelVal:
overvalued firms are those in the top tercile of this distribution, while undervalued firms are those in the bottom
tercile.
18                                                                            DECEMBER 2013


and Phillips (2010). In particular, over our sample period, industry relative valuation is

on average slightly positive (0.04) with a standard deviation of 0.24.

     Panel B of Table I summarizes pairwise correlations between the industry relative val-

uation measure and all the other variables. The industry relative valuation is not corre-

lated with our corporate governance measures (the GIM index and indicator variables for

Democracy and Dictatorship firms). Moreover, the measure is not significantly correlated

with any of our firm-level controls.

     Finally, Panel C of Table I summarizes GIM index in subsamples formed by splitting

the entire sample into terciles by industry relative valuation. In all terciles, the mean

GIM-index is similar and the median GIM-index is identical, suggesting that there is no

systematic relation between the GIM index and our measure of relative valuation.


            III.   Corporate Governance, Misvaluation, and Firm Performance


     Our model implies that agency costs should be greater in times of overvaluation. We

start our empirical investigation by testing whether the relationship between corporate

governance and operating performance is stronger for highly valued firms. In particular,

if overvaluation leads to a worsening of agency problems and some of the high valuation

is measuring overvaluation, then we should see the difference in performance between

strongly and weakly governed firms to widen after period of high relative valuation.


                                       A.   Main Results


     In order to develop formal multivariate tests of the impact of misvaluation and gover-

nance on future operating performance, we use the following baseline model:



             ROAijt+k = bj + bt + b1 GIMijt + b2 GIMijt ∗ M isVijt + b3 Xijt + eijt     (9)
                               GOVERNING MISVALUED FIRMS                                     19


where ROAit+k is firm i’s industry (SIC3)-adjusted ROA in k periods ahead of time t with

k = 2 and industry indexed by j. The main explanatory variables are the firm’s index of

antitakeover provisions (GIMijt ) and its interaction with relative valuation proxy, M isVijt .

Xijt includes the level of relative valuation. In addition, as in Core et al. (2006), we control

for firm size, and also include year and industry fixed effects. Finally, to allow for potential

correlation of ROA in the same industry, we evaluate statistical significance using robust

clustered standard errors adjusted for non-independence of observations within industries

(see Wooldridge (2002), p. 275).

  The key variable of interest is the coefficient b2 on the interaction term. At the margin,

the total effect of corporate governance on future operating performance can be calcu-

lated by examining the partial derivative of ROAit+k with respect to the GIM index:
∂ROAijt+k
 ∂GIMijt    = b1 + b2 M isVijt . The null hypothesis is that b2 equals zero.

  Table II reports our estimates of baseline specification (9). The first column in the

table assumes b2 = 0, i.e. it does not allow for the interaction effect of governance with

relative valuation. The next two columns examine our main hypothesis that the negative

relation between operating performance and governance is magnified during periods of

overvaluation. Column (2) shows results from estimating (9) using Industry RelVal - our

main measure for misvaluation - as a proxy for M isVijt . Consistent with our model, the

coefficient on the interaction term is negative and statistically significant (t-statistic of

2.67). Quantitatively, the magnitude of the interaction effect is large. In particular, the

estimated coefficient on the interaction term implies that a one standard deviation increase

in industry relative valuation (0.24) makes each provision of the GIM index lower operating

performance by about 0.1%. Given that Dictatorship firms have about 10 more provisions

compared to Democracy firms, our results imply that the gap in operating performance

between weakly and strongly governed firms widens to about 1% per year following times
20                                                                                                   DECEMBER 2013


of high relative valuation, which is a sizable effect given the sample average ROA of about

5%.

     In Column (3), we report results from re-estimating (9) using total relative valuation

as a proxy for M isVijt . Consistent with our model and confirming results using industry

relative valuation measure in Column (2), the negative coefficient on the interaction term

is statistically (t-statistic of 2.12) and economically significant: a one standard deviation

increase in total relative valuation (0.63) makes each provision of the GIM index lower

operating performance by about 0.2%. However, a potential concern with using total

relative valuation measure is that it is correlated with some firm characteristics. Thus,

the estimated coefficient on the interaction term between the GIM index and total relative

valuation could reflect the presence of an interaction effect between corporate governance

and some firm characteristic on operating performance as opposed to a greater importance

of corporate governance in times of misvaluation.16 By contrast, the industry relative

valuation measure is computed excluding the firm itself and, as seen from Panel B in Table

I, is not correlated with firm-level variables. Thus, in the remainder of the paper, we will

only use the industry relative valuation measure as results obtained with this measure are

unlikely to be driven by spurious correlation with firm characteristics (although all results

also hold using total relative valuation). Essentially we are asking how firms with better

or worse governance react to an industry-wide valuation shock as this is part of a firm’s

overvaluation that is unrelated to firm specific characteristics.

     Finally, in Column (4) we restrict the sample to Democracy and Dictatorship firms

and use a Dictatorship dummy as a proxy for corporate governance. Core et al. (2006)

show that Democracy firms have superior operating performance compared to Dictator-

  16 For example, our total relative valuation measure is positively correlated with firm size. If larger firms’ operating
performance is more sensitive to corporate governance than that of smaller firms, then this could potentially explain
our results.

ship firms. We find an economically and statistically significant negative interaction effect

between the Dictatorship dummy and our measure of misvaluation, further corroborating

our interpretation of the result that weak corporate governance firms significantly under-

perform firms with strong corporate governance following times when firms are valued

above their industry or historical multiples.

  The results reported in Table II are obtained using continuous measures of relative

valuation. While estimates obtained from interactions with continuous measures have

the advantage of using the full available cross-sectional information in relative valuation,

they do not tell us from which part of the distribution of relative valuation the result is

coming. For example, the negative interaction effect that we find is consistent with both

a positive effect of weak governance on ROA in times of relatively low valuation and a

negative effect of weak governance on ROA in times of relatively high valuation. Only the

latter is consistent with our theory which makes a sharp prediction that there is scope

for managerial misbehavior only in times of overvaluation and, thus, poor performance in

weakly governed firms should be observed only following periods of overvaluation

  Our next set of results examines whether the negative interaction effect in Table II

indeed comes from underperformance of weakly governed firms against strongly governed

firms only after periods of high relative valuation, as predicted by the theory. In particular,

we estimate the effect of the GIM index on ROA within different subsamples based on

the empirical distribution of industry relative valuation. We start by defining subsamples

based on the upper and lower half (Columns (1)-(2)), the terciles (Columns (3)-(5)),

and the quartiles (Columns (6)-(9)) of sample industry relative valuation distribution.

Thus, lowest quantiles correspond to subsamples of firms that are valued relatively low

(“undervalued”), top quantiles correspond to subsamples of firms that are valued relatively

high (“overvalued”), and middle quantiles correspond to subsamples of relatively fairly
22                                                                                            DECEMBER 2013


valued firms. We then run our baseline ROA regression (9) separately in each of these

subsamples.17

     The results of the sample-split specification are reported in Table III. There is a negative

and statistically significant relation between the GIM index and operating performance

at the top of the distribution of industry relative valuation. Importantly, t-tests of the

difference of the estimated coefficients of GIM index across industry relative valuation

quantiles robustly confirm that, regardless of whether we use splits based on median,

terciles, or quartiles, there are always strongly statistically significant differences at the top

of the distribution of industry relative valuation, which is precisely where our model tells

us there are monitoring benefits from strong governance. Moreover, the negative effect

of weak governance in highly (relatively) valued industries is quantitatively significant.

For example, the coefficient estimates in Column 5 imply that for firms in the top tercile

of industry relative valuation (Panel A), each provision in the GIM index is associated

with a 0.2 percentage point lower operating performance. Thus, the gap in operating

performance between weakly and strongly governed firms is about 2% in times of high

relative valuation, or double the average effect of weak governance when we don’t take

overvaluation into account (Column (1) of Table II). Finally, consistent with scope for

misbehavior being smaller in periods of under- or fair valuation, the relation between the

GIM index and operating performance in bottom and middle quantiles of industry relative

valuation is weak, both economically and statistically.


                                               B.    Robustness


     Table IV reports results of six sets of robustness checks for our baseline estimates. We

estimate the same ROA regression (9) as in Table II, including controls for firm size, and
  17 Results for an alternative specification with the GIM index interacted with indicators for each subsample are
very similar.
                                      GOVERNING MISVALUED FIRMS                                                      23


year and industry fixed effects in the estimation. t-statistics based on robust standard

errors clustered at the industry level are in parentheses.

  We start by showing that our results are robust to changing the baseline specification.

First, Column (1) shows that the negative interaction between industry relative valuation

measures and the GIM index remains statistically and economically significant when we

use median regressions rather than OLS. This robustness check addresses the concern that

our results could be driven by outliers in ROA.

  Second, we explore the robustness of our results to inclusion of controls for industry

concentration and its interaction with the GIM-index. This control is important due to the

results in Giroud and Mueller (2011) and Kadyrzhanova and Rhodes-Kropf (2011) who find

that the effects of governance provisions depend on the level of industry concentration. If

misvaluation is more pronounced in concentrated industries, then our main result could be

driven by the substitutability of product market competition and governance mechanisms

instead of amplification of agency costs during times of overvaluation.18 Following Giroud

and Mueller (2011) and Kadyrzhanova and Rhodes-Kropf (2011), we measure industry

concentration with the sales-based Herfindahl index of all firms in Compustat in each

industry and year. Column (2) shows that our baseline estimates are little changed when

we control for industry concentration and its interaction with the GIM index.

  Third, in Column (3) we exclude “new economy” firms, as defined in Hand (2003). Here

we address the concern that our results could reflect a strongly negative relation between

weak corporate governance and operating performance among new economy (high tech)

firms rather than for firms with high relative valuation. In fact, Core et al. (2006) argue

that the results in Gompers et al. (2003) are partly due to mispricing of these firms in the

late 1990s. While the economic significance of the interaction term drops slightly (-0.003
  18 It should be noted that this interpretation of our results is inconsistent with the evidence in Hoberg and Phillips
(2010) that overvaluation occurs primarily in competitive, not concentrated, industries.
24                                                                             DECEMBER 2013


instead of -0.004 in Table II), it remains economically and statistically significant.

     Fourth, we verify robustness of our results to one additional specification. In Column

(4) we estimate the baseline ROA regression (9) with firm fixed effects instead of industry

fixed effects. This specification allows us to control for time-invariant determinants of

ROA. We find that the interaction between the GIM-index and our measure of relative

valuation remains reliably negative.

     The last two columns show that our results are robust to using two alternative measures

of relative valuation. First, Column (5) shows that our results is robust to using a more

elaborate valuation model where market-to-book is regressed on firm size, firm age, a divi-

dend dummy, firm leverage, ROE, and volatility of profitability (as in Pastor and Veronesi

(2009) and Hoberg and Phillips (2010)). Second, Column (6) shows that our baseline

results are virtually unchanged when we augment the basic valuation model (8) with the

GIM index. This robustness check addresses the concern that, as shown in Gompers et al.

(2003), weak corporate governance is related to valuation multiples. Overall, these results

show that our main results are not driven by any particular choice of a valuation model

nor by the failure to include relevant determinants into the valuation model.

     Overall, our results in this section offer evidence of a significant time-variation in the

agency costs of weak corporate governance. We find that firms with weak corporate

governance significantly underperform firms with strong corporate governance but only

following times when their industries are valued above their historical multiples. These

results are consistent with our theory that strong corporate governance is especially im-

portant during periods of overvaluation when agency costs are high and managers make

poor decisions. However, if our valuation measure has only captured highly but correctly

valued firms, then alternatively our findings suggest the need for a new theory of gover-

nance that accounts for the asymmetry – governance matters in high value times but not

in low value times.19


              IV.    Corporate Governance, Misvaluation, and Equity Returns



  We have shown evidence that weak governance is correlated with worse future operating

performance following periods of high relative valuation and not during periods of fair

or low relative valuation. These results are consistent with our theory that governance

counters the effects of overvaluation and has little effect on undervalued firms. If the

time-variation in agency costs we document is indeed driven by overvaluation and this

overvaluation is (by definition) unanticipated by the market, then we expect that periods

of overvaluation will be followed not only by operating return underperformance, but

also by stock market return underperformance of weakly governed firms relative to well-

governed firms.

  In order to test this hypothesis, we examine returns to trading strategies that are jointly

based on measures of corporate governance and our measures of relative valuation. In

particular, in Table V, we examine returns to portfolios sorted by our measure of relative

valuation in addition to governance proxies. As is standard in the literature, we compute

abnormal returns to such trading strategies using a four-factor calendar-time portfolio

method. The abnormal return is the intercept α of the following regression:



        Rt = α + β 1 × RM RFt + β 2 × SM Bt + β 3 × HM Lt + β 4 × U M Dt + εt ,



where Rt is the excess return on a given portfolio in month t, RM RFt is the return on the

market portfolio minus the risk-free rate, SM Bt is the size factor, HM Lt is the book-to-

   19 The asymmetry in our findings implies that poorly governed firms mean revert (in ROA terms) faster than well
governed firms after high value times but don’t mean revert faster after low value times. This is predicted by the
theory of misvaluation and governance, and shows that it is not the case the poorly governed firms simply have a
faster mean reverting ROA process.

market factor, and U M Dt is the momentum factor. All factors are from Kenneth French’s

web site.

     Gompers et al. (2003) show that a portfolio that is long in strong governance (Democ-

racy) firms and short in weak governance (Dictatorship) firms has generated a significant

abnormal return in the period between September 1990 and December 1999. To facilitate

comparison with these results, in Columns (1)-(4) we limit our analysis to the same time

period. We sort all sample firms first on governance (Democracy and Dictatorship) and

then on relative valuation (terciles of industry relative valuation measures), which gives

us a total of 2x3=6 portfolios: one Democracy portfolio and one Dictatorship portfolio for

each tercile of industry relative valuation. For each industry relative valuation tercile, we

then construct a value- and equal-weighted hedge portfolio, analogous to Gompers et al.

(2003), that is long in Democracy firms and short Dictatorship firms.20

     Note carefully that our portfolios are not long undervalued firms and short overvalued

firms. Rather, within the set of overvalued firms the portfolios are long better governed

and short worse governed firms.

     If corporate governance is indeed more important when firms are overvalued, then we

expect the significant abnormal returns in the governance hedge portfolio to be concen-

trated in the portfolio with firms with high industry relative valuation. In Column 1, we

present result for both value-weighted (Panel A) and equal-weighted (Panel B) portfolios.

We find economically and statistically significant abnormal returns for the value-weighted

governance hedge portfolio with average abnormal monthly returns of 67 basis points.21

   20 Analogous to Gompers et al. (2003), we rebalance all portfolios in September 1990, July 1993, July 1995, and
February 1998, which are the months after which new IRRC data became available. Following Giroud and Mueller
(2011), in the extended sample period we rebalance in November 1999, January 2002, January 2004, and January
2006. In addition, we rebalance all portfolios each July using industry relative valuation measure computed using
Compustat data in the previous year.
   21 This is comparable to 71 bp reported in Table V in Gompers et al. (2003). Note that because we use momentum
factor from Kenneth French’s website, our results on equal-weighted governance hedge portfolio are not directly
comparable to Table VI in Gompers et al. (2003). Instead, they should be compared to results in Row 2 in Table
IV in Giroud and Mueller (2011).
                             GOVERNING MISVALUED FIRMS                                27


  In Columns (2)-(4), we examine the returns to hedge portfolios by industry relative

valuation terciles. We find that the governance hedge portfolio generates statistically

and economically significant monthly abnormal returns only for firms with high industry

relative valuation (119 bp). Furthermore, a portfolio of firms with low or fair relative

valuation that is long well-governed and short poorly-governed firms does not generate

any significant abnormal returns. The results for equal-weighted portfolios are similar.

Thus, governance is associated with abnormal returns only within the highly-valued set

of firms.

  Next, we extend the sample period to December 2006 to examine whether our results

hold outside of the original Gompers et al. (2003) sample period (Columns (5)-(8)). The

literature that followed Gompers et al. (2003) documents that abnormal returns to the

governance hedge portfolio disappear when the sample period is extended to December

2004 (Core et al. (2006)) or December 2006 (Giroud and Mueller (2011)). In Column

(5), we replicate these findings: in our sample, abnormal returns to the governance hedge

portfolio over the September 1990 - December 2006 period are small and insignificant.

However, the alpha of the hedge portfolio in the highest industry relative valuation ter-

cile (Column (8)) is both statistically and economically significant. Quantitatively, the

magnitude of the estimated abnormal return is remarkably similar to what we found in

the original Gompers et al. (2003) sample period (108 bp vs 119 bp per month). Thus,

governance still seems to matter, one just has to focus on the overvalued firms.

  Previous literature had proposed several reasons why the abnormal returns to the gov-

ernance hedge portfolio in the full sample have disappeared: there is some evidence that

this is partly driven by “new economy” firms (Core et al. (2006)) and investors learning

about the role of governance (Bebchuk, Cohen and Wang (2012)). Our results suggest a

complementary explanation for why returns to the governance hedge portfolio have de-
28                                                                            DECEMBER 2013


clined after 1999 – very few firms became highly valued during this period, especially

between 2000 and 2002. In fact, in a typical year in our sample, the share of firms in

the governance hedge portfolio with industry relative valuation above zero is about 55%.

However, in these three years this share drops to only about 20%. Thus, the fact that the

overall effect of holding the democracy - dictatorship portfolio over the 1990-2006 period

is not different from zero may be due to the virtual absence of high misvaluation during

the 2000-2002 period. Consistent with this interpretation, we find that results in Columns

(6)-(8) become stronger when we exclude the 2000-2002 period: for example, in the top

tercile by industry relative valuation measure, the VW alpha goes up to 134bp (t=3.21)

and the EW alpha goes up to 64bp (t=2.09).


     Finally, we address the concern that the return to the governance hedge portfolio is

driven by some firm characteristics that are correlated with the GIM index but are not

captured in the four-factor model in Table V. We estimate Fama-MacBeth return regres-

sions that include the GIM index, our industry relative valuation measure, its interaction

with the GIM index, and an extensive set of control variables:



                rit = bt + b1 GIMit−1 + b2 GIMit−1 ∗ M isVit−1 + b3 Xit−1 + eit        (10)



where rit is the return on firm i’s stock in month t, GIMit is either the G-index or a

Dictatorship dummy, and M isVit is misvaluation proxy. Xit includes the level of industry

relative valuation in addition to the full set of control variables used in GIM: firm size,

book-to-market ratio, stock price, returns from months t - 3 to t - 2, from t - 6 to t -

4, and from t - 12 to t - 7, trading volume of NYSE or Amex stocks, trading volume of

NASDAQ stocks, a NASDAQ dummy, an S&P 500 dummy, dividend yield, sales growth

over the previous five years, and institutional ownership.

  Table VI reports the results. Consistent with our model, the coefficient on the interaction

term is negative and statistically significant for both the GIM index and the Dictatorship

dummy. These results show that our main finding of lower abnormal returns in weak

governance firms following period of high valuation is not likely to be driven by an omitted

variable bias.

  Overall, we find consistent evidence that shows that weak governance leads to stock

market return underperformance following times when firms are highly valued, consistent

with our model of time-varying managerial misbehavior. This evidence provides further

support for our theory of overvaluation and corporate governance as it is hard to explain

stock market underperformance with an alternative view where high relative valuation

is driven by growth options and not misvaluation. Indeed, if investors valued equity

correctly at all the times and anticipated differential performance by well-governed firms,

then governance could be associated with lower ROA, but should not result in differential

stock market performance.

  Our theory, on the other hand, can explain the existence of abnormal returns to the

governance hedge portfolio: to the extent that high valuation captures some overvaluation

then our results suggest that overvaluation is correlated with (and potentially causing)

poor managerial decisions and better governance is countering this behavior. Poor man-

agerial decisions eventually result in worse performance – both in ROA as well as in

stock market returns. More importantly, our story can explain why governance abnormal

returns are time-varying (as documented in Core et al. (2006), for example): since the

governance hedge portfolio outperforms only following period of overvaluation, we expect

it to outperform in the second half of the 1990s when misvaluation is high for many firms

in the sample, and to underperform in the subsequent years when average overvaluation

subsided. In fact, as we have shown, the governance hedge portfolio that contains only
30                                                                             DECEMBER 2013


those firms that are highly valued continues to outperform.

     To summarize, the relationship between high relative prices and governance, and firm

ROA and stock performance are all remarkably consistent with the theoretical idea that

misvaluation causes managerial misbehavior and better governance helps counter it.



                 V.   Measuring Misvaluation Through Mutual Fund Flows



     Industry relative valuation is plausibly exogenous to an individual firm’s valuation, but,

since our measure is derived from market multiples, it is possible that times when an in-

dustry is highly valued are times with greater industry-wide growth options, rather than

times of overvaluation. In the previous two sections, we challenge the idea that our results

are driven by growth options and not overvaluation by considering our theoretical predic-

tion of asymmetric effects for over and undervaluation, as well as by directly examining

trading strategies that should contain alpha if our measure indeed contains overvaluation.

In this section we take an alternative approach that uses a different measure of overvalu-

ation based on mutual fund flows rather than market multiples that follows the work of

Coval and Stafford (2007) and Khan et al. (2012).

     Coval and Stafford (2007) develop a method to identify misvalued stocks as stocks with

large fractions of trading volume from mutual funds experiencing severe outflows or inflows.

Severe flows are defined as those below the 10th percentile or above the 90th percentile

of incoming or outgoing assets. The authors complete a number of tests showing that

these stocks under or outperform over the next 12 months. The authors note that their

“empirical results provide considerable support for the view that concentrated mutual

fund sales forced by capital flows exert significant price pressure in equity markets, often

resulting in transactions prices far from fundamental value.”
                                   GOVERNING MISVALUED FIRMS                                              31


  Khan et al. (2012) build on this idea and distinguish between what they call inflow-driven

buying pressure (IBP) stocks indicating overvaluation, and widespread buying pressure

(WBP) stocks. The latter are experiencing significant purchases from a wide swath of

mutual funds that are not receiving large inflows, and so are unlikely to be overvalued.

More specifically, IBP stocks are defined as stocks subject to buying pressure by mutual

funds in the top flow decile, but not subject to buying pressure from mutual funds in

other flow deciles. WBP stocks are defined as stocks subject to buying pressure by all

mutual funds other than those in the top decile of capital flows. Khan et al. (2012) identify

about 1.5% of all mutual fund trades as IBP. They report that IBP stocks “experience

a cumulative decline in market-adjusted returns of 10% over the six quarters subsequent

to the buying pressure quarter.” In contrast, WBP stocks experience a slight market-

adjusted increase in value over the same period. The authors also find that IBP stocks

have a significantly higher probability of completing seasoned equity offerings, as well as

greater insider selling, and higher likelihood of equity M&A.

  Overall, these results suggests that IBP captures overvaluation, while highly valued

firms, potentially with high growth options, are more likely to be indicated by WBP.

Thus, if our results so far are driven by overvaluation, they should continue to hold when

we replace our industry relative valuation measure with IBP. Alternatively, if our results

so far reflect growth options, then they will hold if our misvaluation measure is replaced by

WBP, rather than IBP. Importantly, these measures are not derived from market multiples

and are based on something exogenous to the firm and its industry.22

  Table VII reports the results. In Panel A, we re-run our baseline operating performance

regression using the same model as Table II but replacing our measure of industry relative

  22 Both IBP and WBP are also uncorrelated with whether or not a firm’s GIM score makes it a Democracy or
a Dictatorship. Correlation of the Dictatorship dummy with IBP: -0.027 (p-value of 0.20) and with WBP: -0.002
(p-value of 0.92).
32                                                                                            DECEMBER 2013


valuation with a dummy for whether the firm’s stock was subject to either inflow-driven

(IBP) or widespread (WBP) buying pressure. IBP and WBP dummies are constructed

at quarterly frequency, so we convert them to annual observations by taking the sum of

respective dummies over the previous calendar year. Thus, this measure captures the in-

tensity of mutual fund buying pressure.23 By construction, the sample of firms with stocks

subject to IBP in a given year is quite small and results only in 526 firm-year observations

when merged with our governance dataset. Thus, in the baseline ROA regression, we use

a Dictatorship dummy as a proxy for corporate governance instead of the full GIM-index:



                ROAijt+k = bj + bt + b1 Dictijt + b2 Dictijt ∗ BP + b3 Xijt + eijt                         (11)



where ROAit+k is firm i’s industry (SIC3)-adjusted ROA in k periods ahead of time t with

k = 2 and industry indexed by j. The main explanatory variables are a dummy for whether

the firm’s GIM-index is above 14 (Dictijt ), and the interaction of this dummy with either

IBP (Column (2)) or WBP (Column (3)). Xijt includes the respective BP measure itself.

In addition, as in Table II, we control for firm size, and also include year and industry

fixed effects. Standard errors are adjusted for non-independence of observations within

industries.

     Column (2) shows results from estimating (11) using IBP as an indicator of overvalu-

ation. Consistent with our model, the coefficient on the interaction term is negative and

statistically significant (t-statistic of -2.15). Quantitatively, the estimated coefficient on

the interaction term implies that the gap in operating performance between weakly and

strongly governed firms widens to about 2.7% following times when these firms’ stock was

overvalued due to buying pressure by funds with severely high inflows (IBP). This is a

  23 Our results are robust to using an indicator for whether the firm’s stock was subject to IBP (WBP) in any of
the quarters of the preceding calendar year.

sizable effect given the sample average ROA of about 5%, and similar to the results from

using industry relative valuation in Table II. By contrast, as shown in Column (3), weak

governance does not lead to either economically or statistically significant underperfor-

mance following episodes when the firm’s stock was subject to widespread buying pressure

(WBP).

  In Panel B, we re-estimate portfolio returns from 1990-2006 as in Table V, but sort

based on IBP and WBP instead of our measure of industry valuation. We first consider

all firms and then look at four subsamples. Columns (2) and (3) look at overvalued

(IBP=1) and correctly valued (IBP=0) stocks, while columns (4) and (5) look at stocks

with high widespread buying pressure (WBP=1) and those without widespread buying

pressure (WBP=0). These subsamples are formed based on IBP and WBP in the pre-

vious quarter. Then, in each of these subsamples we construct portfolios that are long

strong governance (Democracy) firms and short weak governance (Dictatorship) firms,

both value- and equal-weighted portfolios. We find positive and statistically significant

alpha only in Column (2), i.e. in the sample of overvalued firms (IBP=1), for both value-

and equal-weighted portfolios. The size of the coefficients in Column (2) are quite large,

seemingly suggesting a monthly out performance of 3.72% to 5.31%. However, these

returns can only be earned in months when there are firms with IBP=1 and both Dicta-

torship (GIM≥14) and Democracy (GIM≤5) firms. This only occurs in 45 months over

the September 1990-December 2006 time frame (196 months) thus, assuming investors

earn zero alpha in the other months, the average monthly alpha over this period is about

a 1/4 of the reported coefficients.

  Overall, Table VII shows that firms that become overvalued due to mutual fund flows

subsequently have significantly better ROA if they have better governance, but better

governance does not correlate with future ROA in fairly valued firms. Furthermore, buying
34                                                                                                 DECEMBER 2013


the stocks of overvalued firms with good governance and selling the stock of overvalued

firms with poor governance produces significant positive alpha, while there is no positive

alpha from a long-short portfolio based on governance in the set of firms that are not

overvalued. This second measure of overvaluation is free from market value measurement

and provides significant support of the idea that governance is most important when a

firm becomes overvalued.


                 VI.    Measuring Governance Through Passage of State Laws


     In this section, we address the remaining potential endogeneity concern that our results

so far reflect the interaction effect of overvaluation and some unobservable firm charac-

teristic, such as managerial quality, rather than overvaluation and governance. We follow

Bertrand and Mullainathan (2003) and exploit the passage of state business combination

(BC) laws as a source of exogenous variation in corporate governance. These laws, passed

by states at various times between 1984 and 1991, adopted statutes that made it harder

to take over any firm incorporated in the legislating state, effectively weakening corporate

governance in these “treated” firms.24 Importantly, this quasi-natural experiment setting

addresses the omitted variable concern since passage of a BC law at the state level is

plausibly exogenous to any given firm’s characteristics.

     Based on Bertrand and Mullainathan (2003), we use a difference-in-differences approach

and adopt the following specification:



        ROAilt+k = bt + bi + b1 M isVilt + b2 BClt + b3 M isVilt ∗ BClt + b4 Xilt + eilt                          (12)
   24 As in previous literature, we only focus on the most restrictive types of antitakeover laws, the Business Combina-
tion laws. These laws impose a long-term (three to five year) moratorium on (hostile) change of control transactions,
such as mergers, divestitures, consolidations, and asset sales between the firm and a large shareholder who obtains
more than a specified percentage of the shares. A large empirical literature finds results consistent with increased
managerial entrenchment in firms subject to BC laws (see, for example, Bertrand and Mullainathan (1999), Bertrand
and Mullainathan (2003), Karpoff and Malatesta (1989), Easterbrook and Fischel (1991), Garvey and Hanka (1999),
Giroud and Mueller (2011), and Atanassov (2013)). For a list of states that passed BC laws and years of passage,
see Table I in Bertrand and Mullainathan (2003).
                               GOVERNING MISVALUED FIRMS                                   35


where ROAilt+k is firm i’s ROA in k periods ahead of time t with k = 2 and state of

incorporation indexed by l. BCjt is a dummy variable that equals one if a state BC law

was passed in state l by time t. Xijt includes controls for firm size and its squared term, as

well as controls for shocks at the state-year and industry-year level proxied by averages of

the dependent variable across all firms in the same industry and state of location in that

year, excluding the firm itself. Note that our specification includes year and firm fixed

effects and we cluster standard errors at the state of incorporation level.

  The innovation of our specification with respect to Bertrand and Mullainathan (2003)

is that equation (12) allows for an interaction of the indicator for BC laws with relative

valuation proxy, M isVijt . By doing so, we effectively implement a triple difference estima-

tor that allows us to examine whether the effect of misvaluation on operating performance

changes after a state passes BC laws. In particular, the interaction term M isVilt ∗ BClt

reflects the difference in the sensitivity of future ROA to misvaluation between firms in

the treated group, i.e. firms incorporated in states that passed the BC laws by time t, to

those in the control group that includes states that never passed a BC law by time t, i.e.

firms that never passed a BC law as well as firms that passed a BC law after time t. The

null hypothesis is that the coefficient on the interaction term, b3 , is zero.

  Our baseline estimates of (12), reported in Column (1) of Table VIII, show that overval-

uation predicts weak operating performance in the future, but only for firms incorporated

in states that have previously passed BC. In fact, the coefficient on the BC dummy is

close to zero and not statistically significant, suggesting that the passage of BC laws has

no effect on firms’ operating performance in normal or undervalued times. However, con-

sistent with all the results so far, the coefficient on the interaction term is negative and

statistically significant (t-statistic of -2.86). Quantitatively, the estimated coefficient on

the interaction term implies that following passage of BC laws, firms incorporated in these
36                                                                                              DECEMBER 2013


states tend to underperform firms in the control group by about 0.7%, or 15% of ROA

sample mean, when their stock gets overvalued. As state laws are plausibly exogenous to

firm characteristics, these results strongly suggest that our finding of the interaction effect

between overvaluation and corporate governance is not spurious, further supporting our

main hypothesis that governance is most important when a firm becomes overvalued.

     One common concern with this approach has to do with reverse causality, e.g. un-

derperforming firms potentially lobbying for the passage of the laws, especially firms in

undervalued industries. Evidence in Romano (1987) suggests that BC laws have been

typically adopted to protect a specific firm subject to a takeover threat, and were largely

exogenous to practically all firms in the legislating state except those very few. To further

address this concern, however, in Column (2) we follow Bertrand and Mullainathan (2003)

and estimate (12) replacing the BC dummy with a set of dummies designed to capture

dynamic effects around the passage of these laws: Bef ore(−1) is a dummy variable for

a firm incorporated in a state that will pass a BC law one year from now, Bef ore(0)

is a dummy variable for a firm incorporated in a state that passed a BC law that year,

Af ter(+1) is a dummy variable for a firm incorporated in a state that passed a BC law in

the previous year, and Af ter(+2) is a dummy variable for a firm incorporated in a state

that passed a BC law two or more years ago.25 The interaction term between Bef ore(−1)

and M isVilt allows for investigation of the possibility of reverse causality since a signifi-

cant coefficient would suggest that there was a more negative relation between operating

performance and misvaluation in the legislating states even before the laws were enacted.

Results in Column (2) show that the estimated coefficient on this term is economically

and statistically insignificant. Moreover, consistent with a causal interpretation of our

results, the estimated negative coefficient is strongest on the interaction of M isVilt with
  25 Note that since we are including an extensive set of leads and lags of the BC indicator on the right-hand side,
we modify (12) slightly to use ROA at time t as the dependent variable.

Af ter (+1) and Af ter (+2) dummies.

  Finally, one important source of identification in this setting is due to incomplete con-

gruence between a firm’s state of location and state of incorporation. In our sample, only

about 33% of firms are located in the same state in which they are incorporated. Since

BC laws apply to all firms in a given state of incorporation, regardless of their state of

location, we can exploit this lack of congruence to address the concern that local shocks

drive both the adoption of the law and the change in operating performance. To this end,

we next control for the effect of any such unobservable local shocks by including a full set

of state of location dummies each interacted with year dummies in the same specification

as in Column (2). Effectively, this setting restricts the control group to firms located in

the same state as firms in the treatment group, but incorporated in states that have not

yet passed a BC law. Results, reported in Column (3), show that our results are robust

to this concern.


             VII.   Corporate Governance, Misvaluation, and Investment


  Our results so far show that weak corporate governance firms tend to underperform

following periods of high relative valuation. Performance is the result of an array of

corporate decision making and thus provides compelling evidence of a difference between

well governed and poorly governed firms during good times. However, the results above

do not provide a channel through which governance affects performance. Gompers et

al. (2003) suggests that “some combination of inefficient investment, reduced operational

efficiency, or self-dealing” may result in lower performance in poorly governed firms. Our

findings on performance suggest that these actions mainly occur during overvalued times.

Our theory also proposes that managers make worse investment choices during overvalued

times. In this section, we directly examine whether weak corporate governance firms tend
38                                                                                                 DECEMBER 2013


to have different investment policies and operating efficiency than strong governance firms

during periods of high relative valuation.

     We start by studying whether the relation between weak governance and the amount of

investment activity is more or less pronounced during periods of high relative valuation.

Following Gompers et al. (2003), we examine capital expenditures (scaled by assets), the

likelihood of making an acquisition in a given year, and the total number of acquisitions in

a year. In addition, we examine investments in R&D since such investments can also affect

future performance. We use the same empirical specification as our baseline regression

(9) adding controls for lagged Tobin’s q and lagged cash flow as standard in the large em-

pirical literature on investment (see, for example, Fazzari, Hubbard and Petersen (1988)).

Following Gompers et al. (2003), we estimate median regressions for capital expenditures

and R&D, negative Poisson regressions for acquisition count, and probit regressions for

acquisition probability.

     Table IX reports the results. The coefficient on the non-interacted GIM term corre-

sponds to observations with relative valuation of zero, i.e. firms that are fairly valued.

Consistent with the results in Gompers et al. (2003), the point estimate on GIM index in

Columns (1)-(3) is positive and statistically significant suggesting that weak governance

firms on average have higher levels of capital expenditures and engage in more acquisitions.

The point estimate on the non-interacted GIM index in Column (4) (R&D) is negative

but not statistically significant, consistent with Giroud and Mueller (2011). Turning to

the interaction term, the point estimate is not statistically significant in any specification

except for acquisition count where it is significant only weakly at a 10% level. Thus, while

all types of investments increase in times of high relative valuation, they do so similarly

for both high and low GIM firms.26 These results imply that the underperformance of

     26 The   increase in acquisition additivity during good times matches the original findings of Rhodes-Kropf et al.

weak governance firms after periods of high relative valuation is not driven by under- or

over-investment. It does not seem like the agency costs of overvaluation relate to empire

building.

  We next examine operating efficiency. If periods of high relative valuation bring about

investment in inefficient projects (or other poor decisions) in weak governance firms, their

operating efficiency should diverge from that of strong governance firms during such pe-

riods. Our model suggests that overvaluation leads to an increase in managers choosing

lower value pet projects with higher private benefits. We measure operating efficiency

with proxies for productivity (labor productivity measured as the log of (deflated) sales

scaled by total employment) and cost inefficiency (cost of goods sold scaled by sales and

log of (deflated) wages scaled by total employment). In addition, we study cumulative

sales growth over the following two years. We estimate all these measures using panel

regressions analogous to (9) and same controls as in Table IX. All dependent variables are

trimmed at 5th and 95th percentile of their sample distribution to reduce the impact of

outliers.

  Table X reports the results. Across all measures of operating efficiency, higher values of

the GIM index are associated with lower efficiency: the coefficient on the non-interacted

GIM term suggests that, on average, weak governance firms have lower labor productivity,

greater cost inefficiency (COGS and wages), and lower sales growth. However, this relation

is statistically significant only in labor productivity regression. By contrast, the interaction

term between the GIM index and our industry relative valuation measure is significant in

all regressions except wages.27 The coefficients on the interaction term suggest that the


(2005)
   27 In fact, none of the regressors are significant in the wages regression. This is most probably due to the fact
that coverage of wage data in Compustat is very sparse making the sample substantially smaller (about 1200
observations). In addition, coverage is spotty across time even within reporting firms. Overall, the data on wages
is very noisy resulting in very imprecise estimates.

operating inefficiency of weak governance firms relative to strong governance firms tends

to worsen during periods of high relative valuation.

     Overall, the evidence in this section suggests that all firms tend to expand (increase their

investment in capital expenditures and R&D and make more acquisitions) in times of high

relative valuation. However, managers of firms with weak governance are more likely to

undertake inefficient projects that lead to lower sales growth, lower labor productivity,

greater cost inefficiency, and to eventual operating underperformance. These results are

consistent with our idea that strong corporate governance helps curb the tendency for

managers to behave poorly during periods of high relative valuation.


                                       VIII.   Conclusion


     Jensen (2005) and Bolton et al. (2006) and others argue that overvaluation is the root

cause of managerial misbehavior and thus agency costs are highest at the top of the cycle.

At the same time, we know from Manne (1965), Gompers et al. (2003), Bertrand and

Mullainathan (2003) and others that corporate governance is important in countering

managerial misbehavior. If overvaluation causes managerial misbehavior and governance

counters managerial misbehavior then governance should have a larger effect on firms when

they are overvalued. We test this simple yet powerful idea.

     Previous work has looked at the role of governance without controlling for valuation and

thus found results that blended times, industries or firms where governance was countering

overvaluation with those where it was not. Our findings suggests that governance may be

most important during times that the firm is valued too highly since that is when agency

costs are at their worst.

     Our empirical work implements joint tests of the perverse effects of overvaluation and

the ability of governance to counteract them. Our findings provide support for the ideas

from both literatures, suggesting that overvaluation may cause poor managerial decisions

and that governance may counter it. Our work suggests that boards and shareholders

looking to create long-run value need to increase vigilance and oversight during times

when the firm’s stock is outperforming.

  Overall this paper is the first we know of to examine when governance matters. The

time-varying nature of our results are remarkably strong and suggest the need to alter

how we think about the importance and impacts of governance.

                                          Table I: Summary Statistics

     This table displays summary statistics of all variables in the sample (Panel A), the correlations of these variables

with industry relative valuation measure (Panel B), and the joint distribution of the main governance proxy and the

relative valuation proxy (Panel C). To compute relative valuation, we start by estimating total relative valuation

(Total RelVal) measured as the difference between a firms actual (log) market value of equity in year t and one

implied a valuation model estimated by regressing market value of equity on book equity, net income, and leverage.

The valuation predictive regressions are run at the 3-digit SIC industry level every year using firm observations from

years t-10 to t-1 for all firms in the Compustat universe. The three-digit SIC industry average of these differences

(excluding firm i) is our measure of industry relative valuation (Industry RelVal). The governance measures are

based on the sample of 2,023 firms from the ISS Riskmetrics database in the 1990 to 2006 period. GIM-index is the

index of 24 provisions from Gompers et al. (2003). Dictatorship firms have values of the GIM index of at least 14.

Democracy firms have values of the GIM index of at most 5. ROA is operating income after depreciation scaled

by year-end total assets. It is industry-adjusted each year by subtracting median ROA in three-digit SIC industry.

Firm size is the logarithm of the book value of assets. Industry HHI is defined as the sum of the squares of the

individual company market shares for all the companies in the three-digit SIC industry. For additional details on

variable definitions and sources see Appendix B.

                                       Table II: Operating Performance

     This table reports results for OLS regressions of 2-year ahead industry (SIC3)-adjusted operating performance

(ROA) on governance and its interaction with measures of relative valuation. Governance is measured by the

shareholder rights index from Gompers et al. (2003) (GIM). In Column (1), the GIM index is not interacted with

relative valuation measures. In Columns (2) and (3), the GIM index is interacted with measures of industry and

total relative valuation, respectively. In Column (4), the sample is restricted Democracy (GIM≤5) and Dictatorship

(GIM≥14) firms and governance is measured by a dummy for Dictatorship firms. Controls for firm size (log of

the book value of assets), and year and industry fixed effects are included in all regressions. Coefficients on these

variables are omitted from the table for brevity and are available upon request. Variable definitions are in Table I

and Appendix B. t-statistics based on robust standard errors clustered at industry level are in parentheses. Levels

of significance are indicated by *, **, and *** for 10%, 5%, and 1% respectively.

This table reports results for OLS regressions of 2-year ahead industry (SIC3)-adjusted operating performance (ROA) on governance in subsamples split on industry

relative valuation. Governance is measured by the shareholder rights index from Gompers et al. (2003) (GIM). In Columns (1) and (2), we rank observations into

two groups based on the lower and upper half of the distribution of the relative valuation measure. In Columns (3)-(5), we rank observations into three groups based

on the lower, middle, and upper third of the distribution of the relative valuation measure. In Columns (6)-(9), we rank observations into four groups based on

the lower, mid-low, mid-high, and upper quarter of the distribution of the relative valuation measure. Controls for firm size (log of the book value of assets), and

year and industry fixed effects are included in all regressions. Coefficients on these variables are omitted from the table for brevity and are available upon request.

Variable definitions are in Table I and Appendix B. t-statistics based on robust standard errors clustered at industry level are in parentheses. Levels of significance

are indicated by *, **, and *** for 10%, 5%, and 1% respectively.

                This table reports results for OLS regressions of 2-year ahead industry (SIC3)-adjusted operating performance (ROA) on governance and its interaction with industry
                relative valuation measure. Governance is measured by the shareholder rights index from Gompers et al. (2003) (GIM). Column (1) reports results for median
                regression. In Column (2), we include industry concentration and its interaction with the GIM index as additional controls. Industry concentration is measured as the
                HHI index of the three-digit SIC industry. In Column (3), we exlude new economy firms defined as in Hand (2003). In Column (4), we use firm instead of industry
                fixed effects. Column (5) reports results for relative valuation measure based on a richer valuation model where market-to-book is regressed on a broader set of
                determinants as in Hoberg and Phillips (2010). Column (6) reports results for industry relative valuation measure based on a valuation model that includes the GIM
                index. Controls for firm size, and year and industry fixed effects are included in all regressions (except in Column (4) where we use firm fixed effects). Coefficients on
                these variables are omitted from the table for brevity and are available upon request. Variable definitions are in Table I and Appendix B. t-statistics based on robust
                standard errors clustered at industry level are in parentheses. Levels of significance are indicated by *, **, and *** for 10%, 5%, and 1% respectively.

This table reports the alphas from four-factor regressions of monthly returns of a value-weighted (Panel A) and equal-weighted (Panel B) hedge portfolio that is long

in Democracy firms and short in Dictatorship firms. Democracy firms are defined as firms with a GIM-index of 5 or less and Dictatorship firms are defined as firms

with a GIM-index of 14 or more, where GIM-index is the shareholder rights index from Gompers et al. (2003).
                                                                               The sample period is from September 1990
through December 1999 in Columns (1)-(4), and from September 1990 through December 2006 in Columns (5)-(8). In Columns (1)
and (5), the Democracy-Dictatorship hedge portfolio is formed based on all firms in the sample. In Columns (2)-(4) and (6)-(8), we form separate equal-sized hedge

portfolios for firms in the lower, middle, and upper third of the distribution of industry relative valuation measure. The four factors are the market factor (RMRF),

the size factor (SMB), the book-to-market factor (HML) and the momentum factor (MOM). All factors are obtained from Kenneth French’s website. Coefficients

on the four factors are omitted from the table for brevity and are available upon request. Variable definitions are in Table I and Appendix B. t-statistics are in

parentheses. Levels of significance are indicated by *, **, and *** for 10%, 5%, and 1% respectively.

                             Table VI: Fama-MacBeth Return Regressions

     This table reports the Fama-MacBeth coefficients from 112 monthly cross-sectional regressions of individual

stock returns on governance, its interaction with industry relative valuation measure, and controls. In Column

(1), governance is measured by the shareholder rights index from Gompers et al. (2003) (GIM). In Column (2),

the sample is restricted Democracy (GIM≤5) and Dictatorship (GIM≥14) firms and governance is measured by a

dummy for Dictatorship firms. As in Gompers et al. (2003), we include controls for lagged firm size, book-to-market

ratio, stock price, returns from months t-3 to t-2, from t-6 to t-4, and from t-12 to t-7, trading volume of NYSE or

Amex stocks, trading volume of NASDAQ stocks, a NASDAQ dummy, an S&P 500 dummy, dividend yield, sales

growth over the previous five years, and institutional ownership. Coefficients on these variables are omitted from

the table for brevity and are available upon request. Variable definitions are in Table I and Appendix B. The sample

period is from September 1990 through December 1999. t-statistics are in parentheses. Levels of significance are

indicated by *, **, and *** for 10%, 5%, and 1% respectively.

                                Table VII: Mutual Fund Buying Pressure

  This table reports results of regressions that examine the effect of governance on operating (Panel A) and stock

market (Panel B) performance of firms whose stock was subject to overvaluation following inflow-driven mutual

fund buying pressure. The measures of mutual fund buying pressure are from Khan et al. (2012): an indicator

for stocks subject to inflow-driven buying pressure (IBP) by mutual funds in the top decile of capital flows and

an indicator for stocks subject to widespread buying pressure (WBP) by mutual funds not experiencing significant

flows. The sample is restricted to Democracy (GIM≤5) and Dictatorship (GIM≥14) firms, where GIM-index is the

shareholder rights index from Gompers et al. (2003). Panel A reports results for OLS regressions of 2-year ahead

industry (SIC3)-adjusted operating performance (ROA) on a dummy for Dictatorship firms and its interaction with

IBP and WBP. In Column (1), the Dictatorship dummy is not interacted with IBP or WBP. In Columns (2) and

(3), the Dictatorship dummy is interacted with measures of flow-motivated (IBP) vs information-motivated buying

pressure (WBP), respectively. Controls for firm size (log of the book value of assets), and year and industry fixed

effects are included in all regressions. Variable definitions are in Table I and Appendix B. t-statistics based on robust

standard errors clustered at industry level are in parentheses. Panel B reports the alphas from four-factor regressions

of monthly returns of a value-weighted (VW) and equal-weighted (EW) hedge portfolio that is long in Democracy

firms and short in Dictatorship firms. In Column (1), the Democracy-Dictatorship hedge portfolio is formed based

on all firms in the sample. In Columns (2)-(3), we form separate hedge portfolios for firms were subject to IBP in

the previous quarter (Column (2)) and those that were not (Column (3)). In Columns (4)-(5), we form separate

hedge portfolios for firms that were subject to WBP in the previous quarter (Column (4)) and those that were not

(Column (5)). The four factors are the market factor (RMRF), the size factor (SMB), the book-to-market factor

(HML) and the momentum factor (MOM). All factors are obtained from Kenneth French’s website. Coefficients on

the four factors are omitted from the table for brevity and are available upon request. The sample period is from

September 1990 through December 2006. t-statistics are in parentheses. Levels of significance are indicated by *,

**, and *** for 10%, 5%, and 1% respectively.

                       Table VIII: Operating Performance around State Laws

  This table reports results for the difference-in-differences estimator using staggered passages of state business

combination (BC) laws. The sample is a panel of all firms in Compustat, excluding firms in financial and utilities

sectors, from 1977 to 1995. BC is a dummy that equals one if the firm is incorporated in a state that passed a BC law

by year   t. State BC law passage years are from Bertrand and Mullainathan (2003).    Data on states of incorporation

and state of location are from historical Compustat tapes. Before(-1) is a dummy for firms incorporated in states

that will pass a BC law one year from now, Before(0) is a dummy for firms incorporated in states that passed a BC

law that year, After (+1) is a dummy for firms incorporated in states that passed a BC law in the previous year,

and After (+2) is a dummy for firms incorporated in states that passed a BC law two or more years ago. Controls

include firm size (log of the book value of assets), its squared term, averages of the dependent variable across all

firms in the same industry and state of location in that year, excluding the firm itself. All regressions control for

year and firm fixed effects. In addition, Column (3) controls for state of location-year fixed effects. Coefficients on

these variables are omitted from the table for brevity and are available upon request. Variable definitions are in

Table I and Appendix B. t-statistics based on robust standard errors clustered at the state of incorporation level

are in parentheses. Levels of significance are indicated by *, **, and *** for 10%, 5%, and 1% respectively.

  This table reports results for panel regressions of capital expenditures, R&D, and acquisition activity on gover-

nance and its interaction with industry relative valuation. Governance is measured by the shareholder rights index

from Gompers et al. (2003) (GIM). In Column (1), the dependent variable is capital expenditures scaled by total

assets. In Column (2), the dependent variable is the number of acquisition bids a firm makes in a given year. In

Column (3), the dependent variable is the acquisition likelihood defined as a dummy variable that takes the value of

one if a firm makes an acquisition bid in a given year. In Column (4), the dependent variable is R&D expenditures

scaled by sales. The dependent variables in Columns (1) and (4) are winsorized at 5% level. Controls for firm

size (log of the book value of assets), Tobin’s q, cash flow, and year and industry fixed effects are included in all

regressions. All controls are lagged one period. Coefficients on these variables are omitted from the table for brevity

and are available upon request. Variable definitions are in Appendix B. t-statistics based on robust standard errors

clustered at industry level are in parentheses. Levels of significance are indicated by *, **, and *** for 10%, 5%,

     This table reports results for panel regressions of measures of operating efficiency on governance and its interaction

with industry relative valuation. Governance is measured by the shareholder rights index from Gompers et al. (2003)

(GIM). In Column (1), the dependent variable is labor productivity defined as log of sales in 1996 dollars scaled by

number of employees. In Column (2), the dependent variable is cost of goods sold scaled by sales. In Column (3),

the dependent variable is log of wages in 1996 dollars scaled by number of employees. In Column (4), the dependent

variable is the log of two-year ahead sales to current year’s sales. All dependent variables are winsorized at 5% level.

Controls for firm size (log of the book value of assets), Tobin’s q, cash flow, and year and industry fixed effects are

included in all regressions. All controls are lagged one period. Coefficients on these variables are omitted from the

table for brevity and are available upon request. Variable definitions are in Appendix B. t-statistics based on robust

standard errors clustered at industry level are in parentheses. Levels of significance are indicated by *, **, and ***

                                 i.     Proof of Proposition 1:

  If R − γ(I − A)/p0H ≥ B/∆p0 then from equation (3) we know the investors will invest.
However if B/∆p > R − γ(I − A)/p0H from equation (6) we know that the manager will
choose the bad project with higher private benefits. Both inequalities in equation (7) can
only hold when δ > 0 since δ ≤ 0 ⇒ B/∆p ≤ B/∆p0 . QED

                                  ii.    Proof of Corollary 1:
  ∂B/∆p0
    ∂δ    < 0 while ∂(B/∆p)
                       ∂δ    = 0, therefore B/∆p − B/∆p0 increases with δ and more firms
satisfy equation (7). Also, ( ∂A
                              ∂δ < 0) so more firms can get financing and those firms who
get financing due to overvaluation will misbehave. QED

                                iii.    Proof of Proposition 2:

  By assumption, increased corporate governance reduces the private benefits from the bad
project. If the private benefits, B, are reduced then B/∆p − B/∆p0 falls (i.e. ∂B
                                                                                ∂
                                                                                  (B/∆p −
B/∆p0 ) > 0.) Thus, when the private benefits are reduced to b then only firms for which
b/∆p > R − γ(I − A)/p0H ≥ b/∆p0 will misbehave - which is fewer firms since B/∆p −
B/∆p0 > b/∆p − b/∆p0 . QED

  The variables used in this paper are extracted from four major data sources: ISS Risk-
metrics Database, COMPUSTAT, CRSP, and SDC Platinum. For each data item, we
indicate the relevant source in square brackets. The specific variables used in the analysis
are defined as follows:

   • Governance [Riskmetrics]:

        – GIM-index is the sum of all antitakeover provisions in a firm’s charter that
          varies between 0 and 24 (Gompers et al. (2003)).
        – Dictatorship is a dummy which takes the value of one for observations with
          GIM index of at least 14. [Riskmetrics]
        – Democracy is a dummy which takes the value of one for observations with GIM
          index of at most 5. [Riskmetrics]

   • Relative valuation:

        – Total (or raw) relative valuation: the difference between a firm’s actual valuation
          and one implied by average industry pricing using historical industry multiples.
          To get implied valuation, for each industry j and year t, we first estimate a
          valuation model from the following industry-level regressions that use ten years
          of lagged data:

                       log Mijτ = a0jt + a1jt log Bijτ + a2jt log (N I)+
                                                                       ijτ             (B-1)
60                                                                               DECEMBER 2013


                                     + a3jt I(<0) log (N I)+
                                                           ijτ + a4jt LEVijτ + εijτ ,
                               τ = t − 10, ..., t − 1

            where i indexes firms, j indexes industries, and t indexes time. Mijt is the
            market value of equity, computed by multiplying the common stock price at
            fiscal year-end (item 199) by common shares outstanding (item 25). Bijt is the
            book value of equity, constructed as stockholders’ equity (Compustat item 216)
            plus balance sheet deferred taxes and investment tax credit (Compustat item
            35) minus the book value of preferred stock (Compustat item 56). N I is net
            income (Compustat Item 172). Since we estimate the regression in logs, we
            set negative values of net income to zero and include an indicator function for
            negative values of net income. LEVijt is the leverage ratio computed as the
            ratio of total long-term debt (Compustat item 9) to total assets (item 6). In
            order to reduce the impact of outliers, all variables are winsorized at the 1%
            level. [Compustat]
         – Industry relative valuation: average total relative valuation of all firms in the
           three-digit SIC industry, excluding firm i.

     • Firm variables:

         – ROA is defined as operating income after depreciation (item 178) scaled by
           year-end total assets (item 6). [Compustat]
         – Firm size is defined as log of the book value of assets (item 6), deflated by CPI
           in 1990. [Compustat]
         – Industry concentration is the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) of the indus-
           try, defined as the sum of the squares of the individual company market shares
           for all the companies in the three-digit SIC industry. [Compustat]
         – Investment is capital expenditures (item 128) over assets at the beginning of
           the fiscal year (item 6). [Compustat]
         – Number of acquisitions is the number of all transactions in which a sample firm
           acted as an acquirer in a given year. [SDC]
         – Acquisition probability is a dummy variable that takes the value of one if a firm
           makes an acquisition bid in a given year and zero otherwise. [SDC]
         – R&D is research and development expenditures (item 46) over sales (item 12).
           [Compustat]
         – Labor productivity is the log of sales (item 12) in 1996 dollars scaled by number
           of employees (item 29). [Compustat]
         – Cost of goods sold is the ratio of cost of goods sold (item 41) to sales (item 12).
           [Compustat]
         – Wages is the log of wages (item 42) in 1996 dollars scaled by number of em-
           ployees (item 29). [Compustat]
         – Sales growth is log of sales (item 12) in year t, scaled by sales in year t − 2.

– Tobin’s Q is the market value of assets divided by the book value of assets
  (item 6), where the market value of assets equals the book value of assets plus
  the market value of common equity less the sum of the book value of common
  equity (item 60) and balance sheet deferred taxes (item 74). [Compustat]
– Cashflow is the sum of earnings before extraordinary items (item 18) and de-
  preciation (item 14) over assets at the beginning of the fiscal year (item 6).
