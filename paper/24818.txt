                                          ABSTRACT

We explore a new mechanism to understand state funding for public colleges and universities by
leveraging data on the educational experiences of state legislators, specifically if and where they
received postsecondary education. Using novel, hand-collected data from 2002 through 2014, we
provide comprehensive documentation for the first time in the literature on the educational
backgrounds of state legislators. We find a statistically significant, positive association between
the share of legislators who attended their states' public institutions and state funding for their
entire public higher-education system. We also find a similar positive relationship between the
share of state legislators who attended particular campuses of the state's public university system
and funding for those campuses. This relationship is more pronounced among publicly educated
legislators who represent legislative districts close to their alma mater's district, and becomes
most consequential when the legislator's district contains his or her alma mater. We discuss the
implications of our findings for academic studies on how politics and legislators' personal
experiences in influence support for higher education.

1. Introduction

Elected representatives make important decisions about the allocation of resources across society
and the provision of public goods. Prior scholarship has found legislators weigh electoral con-
siderations and their own individual preferences in developing positions on public policy issues
(Downs, 1957; Black et al., 1958; Bianco, 1994). Although elections create strong incentives for
legislators to respond to the preferences of their constituents (Geer, 1996; Stimson et al., 1995),
scholars have also documented that personal experiences can significantly influence legislators’
political decisions (e.g., Osborne and Slivinski, 1996; Besley and Coate, 1997; Levitt, 1996; King-
don, 1989). We know little about which kinds of personal experiences are most salient and how
they are weighed in practice alongside traditional political considerations. We aim to address
this open question by exploring a specific kind of personal experience, namely, if and where each
state legislator in the United States received a postsecondary education, and how these school
ties influence state support for higher education.
   Prior work has explored the determinants of state funding for public higher education. This
research has found that variation in funding across states stems from economic, demographic,
and political differences across states (e.g., Archibald and Feldman, 2006; McLendon et al.,
2009; Okunade, 2004; Rizzo, 2004; Toutkoushian and Hollis, 1998). However, although state
legislators have the primary responsibility for budget policy in their respective states, includ-
ing appropriations for higher education (Hovey, 1999), comparatively little work has explored
how their personal experiences influence funding outcomes. Some limited empirical evidence
shows the personal preferences of legislators can profoundly influence their views on policy (e.g.,
Levitt, 1996; Kingdon, 1989). Scholars have documented that legislators make decisions for rea-
sons beyond narrow political interests, arguing that their personal convictions, experiences, and
family members can influence their policy positions and votes on key legislation. For example,
Washington (2006) demonstrated that legislators who have daughters are more likely to support
progressive policies, particularly when the legislation relates to reproductive rights.
   We adopt a related approach by investigating how state legislators’ ties to colleges and uni-


                                                 2
versities (hereafter, institutions) influence higher-education policy. We propose that loyalty to
one’s alma mater (hereafter, alumni loyalty) is the mechanism that links school ties and a greater
support for higher-education funding among state legislators. Our conceptual framework draws
upon group identity, which suggests one’s identity or sense of self is largely based on group mem-
bership (Akerlof and Kranton, 2000; Tajfel and Turner, 1979). We emphasize the role of college
education in shaping a legislator’s support for higher education because a college education has
been found to be a formative experience that has a lasting influence on students’ sociopolitical
beliefs and identity (Hyman and Wright, 1979). Whether via selection or treatment, the college
experience is designed to bond alums to one another and the institution (Astin, 1977). And
because group identity affects individual behavior, this dynamic can result in favoring one’s own
group at the expense of others, or in our context, providing preferred treatment such as more
generous support for one’s own alma mater by virtue of alumni loyalty (Akerlof and Kranton,
2000, 2002; Mael and Ashforth, 1992).
   Although typically legislators are thought to be motivated by traditional political incentives
such as maximizing their chances of reelection, we argue that a particularly influential kind of
group identity develops among alums with respect to their alma mater, and that this identity
ultimately influences state legislators’ support for higher education. In our study, this logic
would manifest in state legislators voting and lobbying colleagues for more funding for public
higher education if they had attended the state’s public institution themselves. Moreover, the
support for higher-education funding would be greater for alums representing their alma mater’s
legislative districts, because alumni loyalty would be amplified by traditional political incentives
to appeal to a major constituent such as a college or a university.
   We systematically examine the links between state legislators’ school ties and state funding
for higher education by using a novel dataset that covers 96,010 legislators and their legislative
districts, which contain 496 public institutions for the years 2002 through 2014. Our unique
dataset allows us to provide, for the first time to our knowledge, a comprehensive description on
the educational backgrounds of state legislators. First, we seek to investigate whether a statis-



                                                 3
tically significant relationship indeed exists between the share of legislators who attended their
states’ public institutions and state funding for their entire public higher-education system. This
initial step is important because considerable variation exists across states regarding the share of
publicly educated legislators as well as the level of funding per full-time enrollment (FTE) (see
Stylized Facts in Section 3 and Figures 1-2). We find state funding is positively associated with
the share of legislators who attended their states’ public institutions; one additional legislator
who attended the state’s public college or university is associated with a 0.5% increase in the
total state funding for that state’s entire public higher-education system, holding all else con-
stant. For an average state, this increase amounts to an additional $4.9 million in annual state
funding. Furthermore, the positive relationship is more pronounced among state senators and
female representatives.
   Relatedly, we also observe significant variation in the allocation of state funding across in-
dividual campuses, which ranges from $1.4 million to $891 million for the 496 campuses in our
sample. We find a statistically significant, positive relationship between the aggregated share of
legislator alums from specific campuses and state funding allocated to those individual campuses
(e.g., the share of California state legislators who attended University of California at Berkeley
and state funding allocated solely to University of California at Berkeley). Electing one more
publicly educated legislator who graduated from a given campus is associated with a $49 mil-
lion increase in annual funding allocated to that particular campus. Together, our results show
publicly educated legislators are associated with not only higher levels of funding for the state’s
entire higher-education system, but also greater individual allocations to their alma maters.
   To gain more insight into our proposed mechanism of alumni loyalty and how it complements
traditional political incentives, we then explore the effect of publicly educated alums who rep-
resent the legislative district containing their alma mater. We hypothesize that (i) alumni ties
to a public institution and (ii) legislative district representation have an amplifying effect on
a legislator’s support for higher education. We find a statistically significant, positive associa-
tion between campus-level funding and alums who represent legislative districts near their alma



                                                 4
mater, and this relationship becomes most pronounced when the legislator’s district contains his
or her alma mater. Relative to alums representing nearby districts, alumni representation of
their alma maters reflects an additional 180% increase in funding. The results of our analyses
are consistent with our argument and substantiate the validity of our proposed mechanism of
alumni loyalty.
   In the next section, we review the relevant literature on the motivations of legislators and
state funding for higher education, along with their implications for our study. In Section 3, we
present several stylized facts from our novel dataset. In Section 4, we discuss our methodology
and present our key findings. We conclude in Section 5.



2. Conceptual Framework and Implications

The traditional model of American electoral politics is that elected officials respond to public
opinion (Black, 1972; Jacobs and Shapiro, 2000). That is, legislators work primarily to garner
support from voters, appealing to the median voter to raise their chances of re-election (Downs,
1957; Black et al., 1958; Caselli and Morelli, 2004). For example, prior work has documented how
public opinion motivated the U.S. Congress to enact more liberal policies in the 1960s, followed
by a reversal toward a more conservative course in the early 1980s, before rebounding back in the
liberal direction by the late 1980s (Stimson et al., 1995). Relatedly, other work has suggested a
connection between the provision of public goods and electoral motivations (e.g., Mayhew, 1974;
Fiorina, 1977; Cain et al., 1987).
   Aside from traditional political interests, legislators’ personal beliefs, experiences, and even
their children may also affect their policy decisions (Levitt, 1996; Kingdon, 1989; Bianco, 1994;
Washington, 2006). This channel seems particularly likely when the personal experience is di-
rectly related to the issue at hand. For example, Senator Rob Portman of Ohio reversed his
opposition to same-sex marriage in 2013, acknowledging his son’s sexual orientation had influ-
enced his view.



                                                5
   An experience that could plausibly influence legislators’ opinions on higher-education pol-
icy is their own educational experience. While experiences, in general, shape preferences and
attitudes (Bagozzi, 1981), a college education notably represents a crucial developmental time
for students during which their sociopolitical orientation is most malleable (Hyman and Wright,
1979). Various social experiences during this time, in addition to the leniency to freely experi-
ment with differing social roles, ultimately beget stronger bonds among alums and alumni loyalty
(Astin, 1977; Mael and Ashforth, 1992; Pascarella and Terenzini, 2005). Consequently, alums are
more likely to identify with one another and their alma mater, relative to unrelated individuals
and schools (Tajfel and Turner, 1979; Akerlof and Kranton, 2000, 2002). These social ties can
strengthen the incentive for legislators to support their alma mater and fellow alums, not only
for personal benefits, but also to give back to the school that made a lasting difference in their
own life. Thus, a loyal alum is more likely to donate generously and provide resources to the
institution (Arrow, 1972; Steinberg, 1987; Ade et al., 1994; Clotfelter, 2003; Mael and Ashforth,
1992).
   One insight from the work on group identity is that once people identify themselves as a group
member, they adopt behaviors that are aligned with the group’s norms (Akerlof and Kranton,
2000, 2002, 2008). In turn, group identity affects individual behavior (Akerlof and Kranton,
2000), which often leads to intergroup discrimination such as enhanced cooperation (e.g., Goette
et al., 2006) or greater affection and trust (e.g., Brewer, 1979) between members belonging to
the same group than between those from unrelated groups or isolated individuals. Prior work
suggests alums are more likely to support their own alma mater than to support other schools
because their beliefs and behavior are influenced by alumni loyalty (Akerlof and Kranton, 2002;
Miller et al., 1981; Tajfel and Turner, 1979; Landa, 1994). For an alum, continued affiliation
with the alma mater offers a source of prestige and identity, as well as an opportunity to provide
support of various kinds, including donations and voluntary participation in events (Simon, 1993;
Mael and Ashforth, 1992).
   Although altruism, social desirability, career advancement, and expectations of respect have



                                                6
been suggested as possible motives (e.g., Piliavin and Charng, 1990), the activities of loyal alums
could also be explained as a form of payment in exchange for intangible rewards such as personal
gratification and enhancing the value of their degree (Andreoni, 1990; Akerlof and Kranton,
2000), or even a sense of obligation to provide goods and services in return (Rose-Ackerman,
1996). As such, some studies have suggested alums may represent the most important financiers
of colleges and universities through their direct donations (e.g., Mael and Ashforth, 1992). In
our case, we would expect legislators to vote and lobby colleagues for more funding for public
higher education if they had attended their state’s public institution themselves.
     To date, the literature on higher-education financing has primarily focused on aggregate
determinants at the state level, including political characteristics, economic and demographic
conditions, and higher-education policies (e.g., Archibald and Feldman, 2006; McLendon et al.,
2009; Okunade, 2004; Rizzo, 2004; Toutkoushian and Hollis, 1998). More recent work on political
ideology has delved into the relationship between higher-education funding and partisan control
of the legislature, whereby Democratic and Republican Parties hold polarized preferences around
taxation and spending on public services such as education and healthcare (Alt and Lowry, 2000;
Barrilleaux et al., 2002), and some empirical research suggests the Democratic Party control of
the legislature may favorably influence higher-education funding (Archibald and Feldman, 2006;
McLendon et al., 2009). Similarly, some scholars have argued female politicians are more sup-
portive of issues related to public services such as poverty, education, and health (e.g., Sapiro,
1983; Rosenwasser and Seale, 1988; Carroll, 1994; Saint-German, 1989), though empirical stud-
ies on higher-education funding have not yet rigorously examined the effect of gender, to our
knowledge.
     Gubernatorial power represents another important source of political influence, which varies
considerably across states. For instance, a select group of states afford their governors significant
power via broader appointment privileges, line-item vetoes, and no term limits5 (Dometrius, 1987;


5
    Twelve states have no gubernatorial term limits: Connecticut, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Massachusetts, Minnesota,
    New York, North Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wisconsin.


                                                         7
Beyle, 2003); however, empirical evidence linking gubernatorial power to funding outcomes is also
limited. Lastly, state governments have different political ideologies along the liberal-conservative
continuum (Berry et al., 1998). For example, states with more liberal politicians may have a
greater affinity for supporting public services and providing more funding for public education.
   Notwithstanding a growing body of literature evaluating the determinants of higher-education
funding, previous work has not considered how legislators’ individual experiences shape funding
decisions. In this paper, we explore whether one salient type of personal experience, namely, if
and where each U.S. state legislator received a postsecondary education, is associated with state
funding of higher education.



3. Data and Stylized Facts

We examine novel biographical data on state legislators, documenting whether they received any
postsecondary education and the specific campus from which they graduated. We partition our
analyses by two distinct units of analysis – State System and Campus. The former evaluates
the impact of state legislators’ school ties on state funding of their respective states’ entire
public higher-education system (hereafter, system state funding), whereas the latter examines
the impact of school ties on the specific allocation of state funding to each campus (hereafter,
campus state funding). In our data, an example of a state system would be all of the public
institutions in the state of Wisconsin, whereas University of Wisconsin at Madison would be an
example of a campus.

3.1. State System Data

Our state-level dataset is built from multiple secondary sources on each state’s economic, demo-
graphic, educational, and political environment for the period 2002 through 2014 (see Table 1).
Economic and demographic variables include population estimates, unemployment rates, gross
state product (GSP), and tax revenue from the previous year. Education variables consist of
FTE, total tuition at public institutions, and bachelor’s degree attainment rate aggregated at


                                                 8
the state level. Given that each state’s funding is constrained by its available resources, funding
should be positively associated with GSP and tax revenue from the previous year. Conversely,
higher unemployment rates should lead to lower funding as state governments anticipate weaker
economies in subsequent years (Strathman, 1994). Likewise, factors such as enrollment and tu-
ition influence funding. The enrollment share of out-of-state students should be negatively related
to funding, because public institutions have been aggressively recruiting non-resident students to
compensate for funding cuts. A recent study reported that a 10% drop in state funding was as-
sociated with a 2.7% increase in out-of-state enrollment for public institutions between 2002 and
2013 (Jaquette and Curs, 2015). Taken together, we control for population, tuition, FTE, GSP,
bachelor’s attainment rate, and unemployment rate because many economic and demographic
conditions likely shape higher-education funding (McLendon et al., 2009; Okunade, 2004).
     State funding for higher education occurs through a multi-stage process. The appropria-
tions bill for a given state, which is a legislative motion that authorizes state spending such
as funding for higher education, is customarily introduced by the legislature subsequent to
the governor’s budget proposal. Although in some states each chamber drafts its own version
of the appropriations bill, most states give this responsibility solely to the lower house based
on the idea that spending proposals should originate from those legislators closest to the vot-
ers (The Councils of State Governments, 2002; Hutchison and James, 1988).6 The bill is then
amended and each chamber votes on it, with a conference committee resolving any differences
between the two. Finally, the governor may sign, sign with a line-item veto, or veto the entire bill;
however, the extent of gubernatorial power and the specific budgeting process differ considerably
across states (Dometrius, 1987; Hutchison and James, 1988; Squire and Hamm, 2005).
     Although we examined individual legislative votes, most voting records on amendments lead-
ing up to a state’s final appropriations bill are not available. For example, North Carolina’s


6
    All U.S. state governments are modeled after the federal government with three branches — executive, legisla-
    tive, and judicial — serving as a system of checks and balances. All but one state, Nebraska, have a bicameral
    legislature made up of two chambers: a smaller upper house (i.e., the Senate) and a larger lower house with
    relatively shorter terms (i.e., the House of Representatives, the Assembly, or the House of Delegates).


                                                         9
Appropriations Act of 2007 (House Bill 1473) was introduced in early March. This bill was
amended later that month to include two bills that would increase funding for the North Car-
olina Research Campus (NCRC) in Kannapolis (S1050 and H1375) and revised once again to
include funding for the University of North Carolina expansion (S1069), but no electronic records
of legislative votes on these amendments exist. Another challenge in studying voting outcomes is
the prevalence of partisan voting (Bartels, 2000). Between 2009 and 2011 in North Carolina, for
instance, both the Senate and the House reflected party-line votes on the Appropriations Bill.
In 2009, the Senate had 27 Ayes (all Republicans) and 18 Noes (all Democrats), with 65 Ayes
(all Republicans) and 52 Noes (all Democrats) in the House. In 2011, the Senate had 31 Ayes
(all Republicans) and 19 Noes (all Democrats), with 72 Ayes (four Democrats) and 47 Noes (all
Democrats) in the House. Such stability in partisan voting patterns over time has been widely
documented (e.g., Peltzman, 1985; Bronars and Lott Jr, 1997; Bender and Lott Jr, 1996). As a
result, we use the share of alumni legislators aggregated at the state level, a measure described
in more detail below.
   For our main variable of interest, we categorize the educational background data of each
legislator and governor into one of seven mutually exclusive types of institutions, which are then
aggregated as percentages at the state level: in-state public, in-state private, in-state community,
out-of-state public, out-of-state private, out-of-state community, and no college education. Our
primary data source for the educational backgrounds of legislators is Vote Smart, which is a non-
partisan, non-profit organization that collects information on candidates for public office across
six areas: background, voting records, campaign finances, issue positions, interest-group ratings,
and public statements (Vote Smart, 2016). We supplement Vote Smart’s biographical data of
state legislators with our independent data-collection effort because Vote Smart’s educational
backgrounds data is deprecated with inaccurate entries for more than 25% of sampled legislators
and missing data for approximately 13%. For instance, the entire biographical section for nu-
merous legislators was missing in some early years of the dataset. Other examples of data issues
include incorrect or vague labeling of the campus location for multi-campus universities (e.g.,



                                                10
“University of North Carolina” instead of “University of North Carolina at Greensboro”), or
missing the obtained degree for those who attended multiple institutions (i.e., the undergraduate
institution where one received a bachelor’s degree is not specified). We therefore cross-checked
the Vote Smart dataset by searching each legislator online to validate and/or update his or her
educational background using sources such as Ballotpedia (a non-partisan, non-profit political en-
cyclopedia), LinkedIn, and state government and personal campaign websites. We also used the
State Legislative Election Returns dataset to obtain the most accurate list of elected legislators
for each year (ICPSR studies 3938, 8907 and 21480; Klarner et al., 2015).
     Our final sample for the State System Analyses contains 96,010 legislators across all 50 states
for the years 2002 through 2014. From this sample, we document several notable descriptive
statistics on the educational backgrounds of legislators. These data represent an important con-
tribution of our work in and of themselves because they have not been previously documented in
the literature, to our knowledge. We find the average four-year college-degree-attainment rate is
87.3% for state senators and 81.6% for state representatives.7 Furthermore, 7.9% of senators and
12.7% of representatives did not receive any postsecondary education. Considerable variation
exists across states in the share of legislators with four-year postsecondary education (see Figures
1 and 2). The New Hampshire legislature has the highest average share of legislators without
postsecondary education (39%), followed by Arkansas (37%), South Dakota (33%), Montana
(26%), Maine (25%), Kansas (24%), and New Mexico (18%).8 The members in the House of
Representatives drive New Hampshire’s high rate. At 400 seats, the largest lower chamber of
all U.S. State Legislatures, only 57% of New Hampshire state representatives received postsec-
ondary education from four-year institutions, with more than half having attended out-of-state

institutions (or 13.7% out-of-state public and 23.5% out-of-state private). By contrast, in South
Dakota, 79% of college-educated legislators attended in-state institutions, 74% of which were
public institutions (or 43.3% in-state public and 9.2% in-state private).
     For the State System Analyses, we obtained the dependent variable — system state funding —
from SHEEO Grapevine at the Center for the Study of Education Policy and Illinois State
University (SHEEO, 2014). It reflects all tax funds appropriated for higher-education annual
operating expenses within each state, which covers any public institution, including public two-
year colleges and community colleges. We use the log transformation of our dependent variable
given its highly skewed distribution and the low likelihood of extreme values. State funding and
tuition are adjusted to constant 2014 dollars by cost of living, inflation, and enrollment mix. The
enrollment-mix index reflects interstate differences in higher-education accessibility, accounting
for the number of public institutions and the cost per FTE. Political variables include the share
of Republican and female legislators, the presence of a Republican governor, and whether the
governor attended an in-state public institution.
     Our main independent variable for the State System Analyses — in-state public — represents
the weighted mean percentage of state senators and representatives who attended in-state public
four-year institutions, where we used the number of legislative seats for the weights. For example,
the Colorado General Assembly (Colorado state legislature) is composed of 100 seats in total,
with 35 members for the Senate and 65 for the House. In 2010, 51% of senators (18 out of 35) and
48% of representatives (31 out of 65) had school ties to four-year public institutions in Colorado.
The weighted mean accounting for the number of seats is then calculated as 48%·(35/100)+51%·
(65/100) = 50%. As opposed to an aggregate percentage across both chambers, a weighted mean
percentage more accurately captures differences in institutional powers. Senators hold superior
voting power, because the size of the lower chamber is, on average, roughly three times larger
than that of the upper (i.e., mean of 39 senators vs. mean of 108 representatives).9 We believe


9
    All our results are robust to alternative specifications of the main independent variable, including equal weights
    between the two chambers (e.g., in-state public = 0.5*[in-state public UH ] + 0.5*[in-state public LH ]) and no


                                                          14
this weighted measure is the best indicator available of alumni influence in state legislatures.
We also split our main independent variable by chamber — in-state public LH (lower house) and
in-state public UH (upper house) — to disentangle the effect of voting power. Consequently, some
of our State System Analyses exclude Nebraska because of its unique unicameral, nonpartisan
legislature (Huber et al., 2001).
   A broader measure of our main independent variable — in-state public or community — sim-
ilarly represents the weighted mean percentage of state legislators who attended in-state public
or community colleges at the state level. We include either public four-year institutions or com-
munity colleges in this measure because state appropriations for higher education also extends
to two-year colleges.


3.2. Campus Data

We used the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) for our campus-level
data on 496 public institutions covering the same period between 2002 through 2014 (see Table
2). Although the United States currently has over 700 active public institutions in the U.S., our
balanced panel for the Campus Analyses is restricted to 496 institutions that reported financial
data to IPEDS every year. Here, we focus on a more direct tie between alums and each public
institution’s campus unlike the aggregated state-level analyses in State System Analyses. In this
case, the thought experiment is if publicly educated legislators positively influence the total state
funding for their respective state’s entire public higher-education system, is each campus bene-
fiting commensurately? As such, multi-campus universities are not aggregated in these analyses
and are instead observed independently by campus (e.g., University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill and University of North Carolina at Greensboro are recorded as two distinct observations
rather than consolidating the entire University of North Carolina system all together). The main
independent variable for this analysis — in-state public campus alum — represents the weighted



 distinction by chamber (e.g., in-state public = [share of legislators who attended any in-state public institu-
 tions] / [total number of legislators across both legislative chambers]).


                                                      15
mean percentage of state senators and representatives who attended a specific campus of an
in-state public institution (e.g., the share of California state legislators with alumni ties to Uni-
versity of California at Berkeley given the dependent variable of state funding for the Berkeley
Campus), where we used the number of legislative seats to construct the weights, analogous to
the method detailed in State System Data. The remaining share of legislators who attended other
campuses of any in-state public institutions is represented by the second independent variable,
in-state public other campus alum (e.g., the share of California state legislators with alumni ties
to University of California at Los Angeles given the dependent variable of state funding for the
Berkeley Campus). Note these two independent variables — in-state public campus alum and
in-state public other campus alum — are mutually exclusive and together represent the total
share of legislators who attended any in-state public institutions in a given state (i.e., in-state
public from the State System Analyses).
   The dependent variable — campus state funding — reflects all tax funds appropriated for
an individual campus within each state, except grants and contracts. Although from different
sources, system state funding is in essence an aggregated measure of campus state funding for a
given state. As in the State System Analyses, we use the log transformation of our dependent
variable, given its highly skewed distribution and unlikely extreme values.
   Our final sample for the Campus Analyses includes 496 campuses across 49 states that covers
41 flagships and 135 research-oriented institutions (based on Carnegie Classification I). Control
variables for each campus include net assets (i.e., the excess of the assets over liabilities or the
residual interest in the assets remaining after liabilities are deducted; changes in net assets result
from revenues, expenses, gains, and losses), expenses for academic and institutional support,
revenues from tuition and fees, grants provided by federal and state agencies, and district-level
population estimates. All financial variables such as net assets are adjusted to 2014 constant
dollars by cost of living and inflation.
   To gain more insight into our proposed mechanism of alumni loyalty, we explored the effect of
alums who represent the district containing their alma mater, in-district public campus alum (e.g.,



                                                 16
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill alum who represented University of North Carolina
at Chapel Hill’s legislative district). We hypothesize that the influence of (i) alumni ties to a
public institution and (ii) legislative district representation could have a complementary effect
on a legislator’s support for higher-education funding. This amplification results from coupling
one’s alumni loyalty with traditional political incentives to appeal to a major constituent such
as a college or a university.
   In subsequent analyses, we introduce three main independent variables categorized according
to whether a campus’s legislative district was represented by an alum, whether a campus’s nearby
legislative districts were represented by an alum, and the remaining share of alums representing
other districts in a state. Thus, the three independent variables, (i) in-district campus alum, (ii)
nearby-district campus alum, and (iii) other-district campus alum, are intended to measure (i) the
share of alums representing the campus’s legislative district, (ii) the share of alums representing
legislative districts near their alma mater’s district, and (iii) the share of all remaining alums
in a state unaccounted by the previous two independent variables. We define nearby districts
as those that are adjacent to the campus’s legislative district while located in the same city
and within 10 miles of the institution. We apply these restrictions because large cities such as
Chicago are divided among more than 20 legislative districts. With our definition, on average,
we find two nearby districts for the Senate and three for the House (see Table 2 for additional
variable descriptions). These variables are intended to explicitly capture (i) the additive effect of
alumni loyalty and the political incentives of district representation, (ii) alumni loyalty without
the political incentives, and (iii) relatively weaker alumni loyalty without the political incentives
that arise from geographic remoteness to one’s alma mater.
   Descriptive statistics of variables are presented in Table 3, and Tables D and E provide
the correlation matrix. We find positive correlations between system state funding and in-state
public (0.15, p < 0.001), in-state community (0.12, p < 0.002), and in-state public or community
(0.17, p < 0.001). By contrast, the share of legislators with ties to any out-of-state institutions,
any out-of-state, is negatively correlated with system state funding (0.21, p < 0.001). Likewise, at



                                                 17
the campus level, campus state funding is positively correlated with alums representing their alma
mater’s legislative district, in-district campus alum (0.16, p < 0.001), and alums representing
districts that are close to the main campus of their alma mater, nearby-district campus alum
(0.12, p < 0.001).

   Overall, legislative school ties to in-state institutions, including both public and private,
are relatively higher in the Midwest (77.4%) and South (74.8%) than in the West (59.3%) and
Northeast (58.8%). The share of legislators who attended two-year community colleges, either
in state or out of state (and without any record of having attended a four-year institution), is
similar across the four regions, with an average of 4.3%, 4.1%, 3.6%, and 2.5% in the West,
Midwest, South, and Northeast, respectively. Interstate mobility for legislators who attended
community colleges is very low. Of all community college ties, 84.7%, 88.4%, 89.8%, and 79.3%
were in-state ties for each region, respectively.
   For legislators who attended out-of-state institutions, the three regions other than the North-
east reflect a near 50/50 divide between public and private. Of all ties to out-of-state institutions,
53.1% were pubic institutions in the West, 48.2% in the Midwest, and 51.5% in the South. In the
Northeast, however, 70.8% of all out-of-state ties were private institutions, whereas only 29.2%
were public. The divergence in the Northeast could stem from both the clustering of states in
the region and the preponderance of private institutions.
   Because prior work has argued that female politicians may be more predisposed to supporting
public services (Sapiro, 1983; Rosenwasser and Seale, 1988), we measure the share of female
legislators across the West, Midwest, South, and Northeast, where the average is 27.7%, 22.6%,
18.4%, and 25.7%, respectively. The relatively higher share of female legislators in the West is
more evident for politically liberal states such as Colorado (36.7%), Washington (33.2%), Hawaii
(30.7%), and California (28.5%). By contrast, several politically conservative states in the South
rank among the lowest in female legislative representation: South Carolina (10.%), Alabama
(11.8%), Mississippi (14.1%), Louisiana (14.9%), and Tennessee (17.5%). We also classify states
based on the outcomes of past presidential elections, where conservative states are defined as
those carried by the Republican in each of the past four presidential elections (2000, 2004, 2008
and 2012), and vice versa for liberal states. We have 22 conservative states and 18 liberal




                                                    21
states based on this classification,10 and the liberal states elected more female legislators than
conservative states, averaging 26.6% against 17.3%.
     The share of Republican legislators, as expected, is higher in conservative states, at 54.9%,
than liberal states’ 38.5%. Of the seven states where the average share of Republicans exceeds
70%, only one state, New Hampshire, is categorized as liberal.11 We find no meaningful differ-
ences in education across parties: 83.9% of Republican legislators attended four-year institutions
compared to 86.1% of Democrats with analogous school ties. And by chamber, we find 88.5%
for Republican senators and 90.5% for Democratic senators, compared to 82.5% and 84.7%
for Republican and Democratic representatives, respectively. The two parties have statistically
identical shares of legislators with school ties to in-state institutions, at 58.1%. The preceding
descriptive analysis shows regional patterns in legislative school ties that are consistent with
accessibility of higher education in a state, including the number of institutions and interstate
mobility. We also observe similar trends in school ties by gender and by party affiliation across
the four regions in the United States.
     Many of these descriptive statistics are the first of their kind in the literature, providing
background information on the politicians responsible for funding the nation’s colleges and uni-
versities. In the following section, we consider the relationship between legislators’ school ties
and state funding with regressions that control for differences in states’ economic, demographic,
political, and educational environments.

4. Methodology and Results

4.1. State System Analyses

To test the relationship between school ties and state funding of the public higher-education
system, we regress the log of system state funding for state i in year t on the share of legislators
with in-state college ties:12


                System State F undingit = α0 + α1 (School T ies)it + α2 (Controls)it + it .                           (1)

       For our main specification, we employ fixed-effects regression models in which the unit of
observation is a state-year. The year fixed effect controls for unobserved characteristics that affect
all states uniformly within a given year (e.g., economic conditions in the United States), whereas
the state fixed effect controls for unobserved state characteristics that affect funding conditions
consistently over time (e.g., a state-specific budgeting process or a time-invariant favorability
towards higher education). Note this specification is particularly conservative, because including
a set of state and year fixed effects means our main parameter of interest is identified solely
by variation in the educational experiences of legislators within a state over time, and any
fixed unobserved confound — such as voters’ persistent preference for public goods in a state
— is differenced out. For all of our analyses, we standardize each independent variable by
subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation to allow for an easier interpretation
and comparison of the parameter estimates.
       In Table 4, the main dependent variable — system state funding — is regressed on the main
variable of interest, in-state public. Along with state and year fixed effects, we control for the


12
     An alternative specification is to regress state-level per-capita funding on seven mutually exclusive school
     ties: in-state public, in-state private, in-state community, out-of-state public, out-of-state private, out-of-state
     community, and no college education. Saturating the specification with seven categories introduces considerable
     multicollinearity (because shares naturally sum to one), pushing up our standard errors. As a result, none of
     the individual coefficients is statistically significant when simultaneously tested with state and year fixed effects,
     although they are jointly significant and signs are in the expected direction with positive coefficients for in-state
     public and negative for out-of-state public (see Table B). We therefore focus our analysis on the coarser category
     of in-state higher education, rather than the finer categorization.


                                                             23
share of Republicans, the share of female legislators, the governor’s characteristics, GSP, tax
revenue, bachelor’s attainment rate, unemployment rate, tuition, and FTE.13 We cluster our
standard errors by state for System State Analyses and by campus for Campus Analyses to
account for serial correlation among variables within a state or a campus, respectively (Hoechle
et al., 2007). In other words, we cluster standard errors by either state or campus based on the
type of variation we wish to leverage (i.e., within-state variations for System State Analyses and
within-campus variations for Campus Analyses), which improves the accuracy of our prediction
by emphasizing variations across clustered groups, because the data are independent across
clusters but not within (Petersen, 2009; Cameron and Miller, 2015).
      We present our state-level results in Table 4. Specification 1 of Table 4 is our most restrictive
specification that includes our main controls, state and year fixed effects, and clustering of
standard errors by state. Here, we regress the log of system state funding on in-state public
and find a positive and statistically significant relationship between school ties and funding. A
one-standard-deviation increase in in-state public is associated with a 4.8% increase in system
state funding. This result suggests that electing one more legislator who attended an in-state
public institution is associated with a 0.5%, or $4.9 million, increase in funding given the average
legislature size of 148 members.
      We replicate Specification 1 in Specification 2 by legislative chamber, in-state public UH,
and in-state public LH, and our results are largely consistent. In Specification 2, which is our
most restrictive specification, the relationship is more pronounced among state senators who
attended in-state public institutions (i.e., in-state public UH or the upper legislative chamber),
which is not surprising given their greater influence on voting. For state senators, a one-standard-
deviation increase in in-state public UH is associated with a 4.2% increase in system state funding.

     An important assumption in the fixed-effect specification is that no correlation exists between the time-varying
     component in the error term and the independent variables. Though our main results are less pronounced
     when employing a state fixed effect, it is necessary to obtain unbiased estimates as our Lagrange multiplier
     test of random effects shows a strong correlation among residuals within each state (Breusch and Pagan, 1980).
     Because both random and fixed-effect specifications are significant, we also conducted a Hausman test of strict
     exogeneity to confirm a fixed-effect specification remains unbiased and consistent (Hausman, 1978).


                                                          24
Considering the average senate size of 39 members, our results imply an addition of one state
senator who attended an in-state public institution is associated with a 1.5%, or $14.2 million,
increase in state funding. We find that a greater share of female legislators is associated with
higher funding. The coefficient, however, is only statistically significant in the lower chamber.
A one-standard-deviation increase in female LH is associated with a 3.4% increase in system
state funding. Put differently, an addition of one female representative from the average female
representation of 24% in the House is associated with a state funding increase of 1.8%, or $17.1
million.

                    Nebraska state legislature is unicameral and thus excluded for column (2)




   We find similar results for in-state public or community, a broader measure of in-state public,
where funding is positively linked to the weighted mean share of legislators who attended in-
state public or community colleges (see Table A). In addition, we find a negative relationship
between funding and legislators who attended out-of-state institutions (see Table B). Lastly, we
check whether the positive effect on state funding for higher education changes after the Great
Recession, as the average state funding per capita has declined substantially by $42.1 in the
period after the Great Recession, compared to an increase of $14.2 during the preceding years


                                                             26
(e.g., Figure 3). Specification 3 of Table 5 shows the effect is much stronger in the years following
the Great Recession, where a one-standard-deviation increase in in-state public is associated with
a 5.8% rise in system state funding, relative to a 1.0% gain indicated prior to the Great Recession.
Likewise, electing one more senator with ties to an in-state public institution translates into an
increase of 2.0%, or $19.0 million, relative to 0.39%, or $3.7 million, in the earlier period. These
results are consistent with the notion that public school ties among state legislators helped
protect public institutions from the most severe funding cuts during the Great Recession.

4.2. Campus Analyses

This section of our study entails two distinct analyses to explore complementarity between alumni
loyalty and traditional political incentives: (i) testing the relationship between state legislators’
school ties to specific public campuses and the allocation of state funding to those campuses,
and (ii) testing the relationship between legislative district representation by publicly educated
alums and the allocation of funding for their alma mater. The main specification at the campus
level uses a series of control variables, including the campus’s net assets, expenses for academic
and institutional support, revenues from tuition and fees, grants provided by federal and state
agencies, and district-level population estimates (see Table 2 for variable descriptions). A campus
fixed effect is added to control for unobserved institutional characteristics that affect a given
school’s funding consistently over time (e.g., institutional quality, flagships, research-oriented),
along with year fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered by campus to address concerns
over serial correlation. Analogous to State System Analyses, we standardize each independent
variable by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation to allow for an easier
interpretation and comparison of the parameter estimates.
   For the first analysis that examines the relationship between state legislators’ school ties to
specific campuses and the allocation of state funding to those campuses, we regress the log of
campus state funding for campus i in state j in year t on the share of legislators who attended a
specific campus, in-state public campus alum, while controlling for the remaining share of publicly
educated legislators in a state, in-state public other campus alum:




       Campus State F undingijt = β0 + β1 (Campus Alums)ijt + β2 (Controls)ijt + µijt .          (2)


   Column 1 of Table 6 presents our most restrictive model that includes campus and year
fixed effects with all controls and standard errors clustered by campus. We find a positive
and statistically significant association between alums (i.e., in-state public campus alum) and



                                                 29
funding for their alma mater. As expected, the coefficient magnitude of in-state public campus
alum is statistically different from and much larger than that of in-state public other campus
alum (F = 5.02, p < 0.026). Here, a one-standard-deviation increase in in-state public campus
alum is associated with a 13.8% increase in campus state funding. This means that an addition of
one more legislator who graduated from a given public campus is associated with a $49 million
increase in annual funding allocated to that particular campus. These results are consistent with
the notion that while in-state public institution alums show greater support for state funding
of higher education broadly, this positive effect is much more consequential when it relates to
funding for the particular campus they attended as a student.

   Finally, we dive deeper into our proposed mechanism of alumni loyalty by exploring the effect
of alums who represent the legislative district containing their alma mater, in-district campus
alum. We hypothesize that (i) alumni ties to a public institution and (ii) legislative district rep-
resentation could have an amplifying effect on a legislator’s support for higher-education funding


                                                               30
by coupling one’s alumni loyalty and political incentives. In column 2 of Table 6, we regress
the log of campus state funding on the main independent variable, in-district campus alum, with
our main controls, campus and year fixed effects, and standard errors clustered by campus. We
find a positive and statistically significant relationship between funding and those representing
their alma mater’s legislative district, in-district campus alum. Relatedly, a statistically signifi-
cant, positive association is also observed between nearby-district campus alum and campus state
funding. The coefficient of in-district campus alum is statistically larger than that of nearby-
district campus alum (F = 5.70, p < 0.018), which is consistent with the latter being motivated
by alumni loyalty without political incentives and the former being motivated by both forces.
The estimates suggest alums representing their alma mater’s legislative district, relative to those
representing nearby districts, result in an additional 180% in state funding for their alma mater.
As expected, the remaining share of alums in a state representing other legislative district, other-
district campus alum, show a statistically significant and positive association with funding for
their alma maters.
      In sum, we observe a statistically significant, positive relationship between the share of state
legislators who attended in-state public institutions and the total state funding for their respective
state’s public higher-education system (Table 4), as well as funding allocated for their specific
alma mater (column 1 of Table 6). In column 2 of Table 6, we gain insight into both the campus-
specific effect and traditional political incentives, with results supporting our hypothesis about
the complementary effect of alumni loyalty and the desire for garnering constituent support.
Together, our findings corroborate the validity of our proposed mechanism of alumni loyalty.14

     In the Appendix, we consider an instrumental variable (IV) regression to mitigate some concerns regarding
     endogeneity and omitted-variable bias by leveraging exogenous changes in legislative district boundaries cause
     by redistricting. While the test statistic ensures the maximum bias to be less than 10% (Staiger and Stock,
     1994), our instrument may not be completely exogenous, thus yielding unreliable estimates, because the IV
     estimates are much larger than the OLS estimates. See Appendix for detailed discussion.

5. Discussion

The role of public funding in higher education has recently become a contentious issue in the
United States. Declining state support has compelled public institutions to pursue alternative
sources of revenue (Goldin and Katz, 1998; Ehrenberg, 2006). Average state funding, which fell
to as little as 10% of total institutional revenues for some states, has necessitated large increases
in tuition, with the national average tuition at four-year institutions rising by more than 36%
since 2004 (Ehrenberg, 2006). In most states, tuition consumes more than 15% of the state
median household income, whereas it takes up less than 10% of the median household income in
only five states (Hiltonsmith and Draut, 2014).
   These trends call for new insights into the determinants of public funding for higher educa-
tion. In examining the factors that drive a state’s commitment to higher-education funding, our
analyses confirm and reinforce the importance of economic, demographic, political, and policy
conditions as key determinants of state funding for higher education. Notably, however, our
study also highlights that the personal experiences of state legislators, specifically educational
backgrounds, are important predictors of funding outcomes.
   We provide empirical evidence that state legislators’ school ties are positively related to state
funding for higher education. Specifically, we find a statistically significant, positive association
between the share of legislators who attended their states’ public institutions and state funding
for those states’ entire public higher-education system. Although McClendon et al. (2009) simi-
larly find a positive link between appropriation committee members’ schools ties and university
funding, we are able to demonstrate a broader relationship between the proportion of alumni
politicians in the entire legislature and funding levels. In addition, our panel data allow us to
explore variation within states over time. This feature is important because we find differences
in our effect before and after the Great Recession. Further, we observe significant changes in
the incidence of school ties and funding per FTE across states over time (see Figures 1-3). For
instance, the share of legislators with ties to in-state public institutions increased for 24 states.
By state, the standard deviation for the year-over-year change in in-state public ties ranges from


                                                 32
0.3% to 8%.
   Finally, our more-detailed data also allow us to consider heterogeneity among alums whose
legislative districts include their alma mater, with which we can show complementarity between
political incentives and alumni loyalty in shaping legislative support for state funding of higher ed-
ucation. Consistent with the expectation that alumni loyalty and traditional political incentives
may have an additive effect on a legislator’s support for higher education, we find a statistically
significant, positive relationship between the share of state legislators who attended specific cam-
puses of the state’s public system and funding for those individual campuses. This relationship
is more pronounced among publicly educated legislators who represent legislative districts close
to their alma mater’s district, which becomes most consequential when the legislator’s district
contains his or her alma mater. Our results consistently bolster the ultimate conclusion: public
colleges and universities that have alums who represent their legislative district receive more
state funding.
   In sum, our findings accord with the notion that alums will have strong ties to their alma
mater and are more likely to provide personal support (e.g., Akerlof and Kranton, 2000; Mael
and Ashforth, 1992; Ade et al., 1994). However, our study has important limitations. We do
not distinguish between the different kinds of social experiences legislators might have had in
college (e.g., membership in a fraternity or on a sports team), whether the legislator benefited
financially through scholarships, or whether the legislator maintains on-going ties with public
institutions. In future research, scholars could also collect legislator-level data on committee
membership and campaign contributions to more precisely account for the effect of other kinds
of political interests on the link between publicly educated state legislators and state funding for
higher education. In this spirit, a key implication from our work is that future studies on the
political economy of higher-education funding should not only include a comprehensive list of
political variables, but also carefully account for the personal experiences of legislators.

A. Instrumental-Variable Estimation

Given the potential endogeneity of legislators’ college ties, an ideal experiment for testing our
conceptual framework would be to randomly assign school ties to our sample of legislators and see
how that affects state funding for higher education. Because this approach is clearly infeasible, we
test the robustness of our specifications through an IV estimation. Based on the assumption that
unobserved but fixed factors influence voters’ choices for the state legislature, our fixed-effects
specification controls for both unobserved and observed time-invariant state-level factors. To
the extent that this assumption does not hold — that is, within-state variation in the education
of elected legislators over time is endogenous — we leverage exogenous variation in the public
institution’s legislative district as an IV for the share of alumni legislators representing the
legislative district containing their alma mater campus, in-district campus alum.



           Campus State F undingijt = β0 + β1 (Campus Alums)ijt + β2 (Controls)ijt + µijt ,                        (3)

                  Campus Alumsijt = δ0 + δ1 (Redistricted)ijt + δ2 (Controls)ijt + υijt .                          (4)



    Conceptually, we exploit the fact that Congressional and state legislative district lines are
redrawn every 10 years in the U.S. based on Census population estimates. Following the release of
the latest Census data in December 2010, 40 states implemented new district lines over the next
two years, meaning 33% of public institutions in our sample, or 166 out of 496 total, switched
to a different legislative district between 2011 and 2012.15 Changes in the boundaries of state
legislative districts should be a plausible instrument because these changes would directly alter
the share of alums representing an institution’s legislative district, while remaining uncorrelated
with residuals. Legislative redistricting, to our knowledge, does not have any direct effect on state
funding for higher education, and our data reflect this lack of association (r = 0.016, p < 0.20).
Moreover, scholars argue legislative redistricting, including gerrymandering, is often motivated
either by incumbent protection or partisan advantage; however, neither has been known to have
causal implications on funding outcomes (e.g., Cain, 1985; Gelman and King, 1994; Tufte, 1973).
Redistricting, therefore, should satisfy the exclusion restriction.

     Both chambers’ legislative districts (e.g., Senate and House representation) changed for 11% of our public
     institutions, 17% of our public institutions experienced a change only in the lower chambers legislative district,
     and only 5% experienced a change in the upper chamber representation, leaving 67% of public institutions
     unaffected by redistricting.


                                                           42
    Table C presents the results from our IV estimation. As before, the dependent variable —
campus state funding — represents an allocation of state funding for a specific institution, or for
a specific campus in the case of multi-campus universities. Our main independent variable — in-
district campus alum — measures the share of publicly educated alums representing their alma
mater’s legislative district. State fixed effects are used for all specifications. Although standard
errors are clustered by campus to address serial correlation, the analyses below do not employ
year or campus fixed effects, because we want to leverage across-group variation to estimate the
effect of in-district campus alum on campus state funding, given the redistricting shock of 2011
and 2012. That is, we only observe one change in district boundaries, which would be completely
soaked up by the campus-year fixed effects.
    In Table C, the instrument — redistricted — is an indicator for whether the legislative district
of a given public institution’s campus changed for either legislative chamber. The relevance of
the instrument is confirmed in the first-stage regression shown in Specification 2. The first-stage
results show a statistically significant, negative association between redistricted and in-district
campus alum even after controlling for the exogenous regressors (coefficient = −0.00142***);
this reflects the possibility that voters from districts housing state institutions deliberately elect
alums to advance their interests, whereas the redistricting breaks this direct, endogenous link
and allows for our robustness check. This coefficient is also statistically different from zero, but
a relatively low F-statistic for the joint significance test of the first-stage coefficients suggests a
potentially weak instrument (F = 10.81, p < 0.001). Given one endogenous regressor, however,
our IV estimates should be reliable because the F-statistic slightly exceeds the critical value of
10.22 (Staiger and Stock, 1994; Stock et al., 2002). Specification 1 shows that alums represent-
ing their alma mater’s legislative district, in-district campus alum, are positively associated with
campus state funding. This positive relationship remains significant when instrumented by re-
districted, as seen in the second-stage IV estimation in Specification 3. A much larger coefficient
in Specification 3 relative to Specification 1 is likely driven by our relatively weak instrument, or
more specifically, by a weak correlation between the instrument and the endogenous regressor,
which is also reflected in the large standard errors reported in Specification 3.
