           TAXATION, SAVING AND THE RATE OF INTEREST:       ABSTRACT

            After   exploring both the crucial role of    the interest elasticity
of   the saving rate in the analysis of a wide variety of issues in economic —

particularly   tax   —
                         policy   and reasons why previous studies of the effect

of interest rates on consumption and saving have biased the estimated

elasticity toward zero, this study presents new estimates of consumption

functions based on aggregate U.S. time series data. The results are

striking: a variety of functional forn,estimatiOfl methods and definitions

of the real after—tax rate of return invariably lead to the conclusion

of a substantial interest elasticity of saving.

            The implications of this result for the analysis of the effi-

ciency and equity of the current U.S. tax treatment of income from

capital are explored. In reducing the real net rate of return, current

tax treatment significantly retards capital accumulation.          This in turn

causes    an enormous waste of resources and      redistributes a substantial
fraction   of gross income from labor to capital. Rough estimates of the

lost welfare exceed fifty billion dollars per year         (a present value
close    to a trillion dollars!) and of the redistribution from labor to

capital exceed one quarter of capital's share of gross income. This

suggests that exempting saving from the tax base (or equivalently,

allowing instantaneous depreciation of capital expenditures) could

 substantially increase national income and welfare without transferring

 income from workers to owners of capital. It also suggests that the
usual calculatiorisof tax burdens   by income class substantially over—

estimate both the progressivity of the income tax   and   the alleged

regressivity of consumption taxes.

              Taxation, Saving and the Rate of Interest*

                          Michael J. Boskin**



    The effect of Interest rates on economic behavior, particularly on

saving and consumption, has been a central concern of economists at least

since the development of classical macroeconomics. Not only has the rate

of interest been viewed as the mechanism for equating saving and investment

in pre—Keynesian macroeconomic models, but it also has been at the center

of virtually all microeconomic models of Intertemporal consumer behavior.

It is thus curious that empirical studies of the effects of interest rates

on saving are few and far between.1 Most such studies conclude that interest

rates have only a negligible effect on consumption or saving.2

     The notion that saving is perfectly interest inelastic has received

widespread acceptance among empirical and policy oriented macroeconomists.

While I shall present below considerable evidence that nothing could be

further from the truth, it is worthwhile exploring just how important the

interest—elasticity of the saving rate is in the analysis of a wide variety

of vital issues of economic policy. In so doing, we hope to point out how

costly it has been (and will continue to be) to accept the conjecture — based

on evidence which is flimsy at best and dangerously misleading at worst —

1Thus, Break, [1974, p. 1511 notes "Unfortunately, empirical evidence on the
 interest elasticity of the saving rate is rare."

   discussion of why these studies may have biased the estimated interest
 elasticities toward zero is presented below.

that the interest—elasticity of the saving rate is negligible. This is done

in Section 1.

     Section 2 discusses several previous studies of saving behavior. We deal

with possible biases in previous estimates of the interest—elasticity of the

saving rate. Special attention is paid to the notion, which has come to be

called "Denison's Law," that the saving rate is essentially constant and un-

affected by changes in the tax system or other changes in the real after—tax

rate of return to capital. An analysis of data for the United States in

Section 3 leads me to conclude that no behavioral significance can be attri-

buted to the conventionally measured gross private saving rate: it measures

neither saving nor income in the appropriate manner and attempts to do so

reveal a saving rate which can hardly be called constant.

     Section 3 also presents detailed sets of estimates of private consumption

functions. A variety of functional forms, definitions of the variables and

estimation methods all lead to the conclusion that private saving is indeed

strongly affected by changes in the real after—tax rate of return. The esti-

mated total (income plus substitution) interest elasticities of private sav-

ing cluster around 0.3 to 0.4. While this is hardly an enormous elasticity

by conventional standards, it is substantially larger than virtually all

prv1ous estimates and the conventional wisdom, and has drastic implications

for the effect of tax policy on income, welfare and income distribution.

     Section 4 reports estimates from this same body of data of Harrod—neutral

CES production functions. Again, a variety of estimation techniques yields

similar estimates of the elasticity of substitution of approximately one—half.

Combined with our estimates of the interest—elasticity of the saving rate,
                                     —3—



this immediately implies that policies which raise the after—tax rate of

return will increase labor's gross share of income in the long—run.

     Section 5 summarizes the implications of the empirical results for the

analysis of the effects of various policies on income, welfare and income

distribution. Briefly, policies (such as switching from an income tax to

a consumption tax) which raise the after—tax rate of return to capital will

increase income substantially, remove an enormous deadweight loss to society

resulting from the distortion of the consumption—saving choice, and redistri-

bute income from capital to labor.

     Section 6 concludes with a discussion of the limitations of the study and

avenues for further research.

1. The Issues at Stake



    We shall discuss in turn five basic concerns of economic policy: the

effects of the income tax on the distribution of income, the differential

incidence of a consumption and an income tax, the tax treatment of human and

physical capital, the effect of inflation on the capital intensity of the

economy, and the debate over whether the saving rate is high enough in the

United States. We shall see that the interest elasticity of the saving rate

is the key parameter in the analysis of each of these issues. The potential

importance of the interest elasticity of saving in the analysis of the effect

of monetary policy is obvious and well—enough known so that repitition here

is unnecessary.

    Virutally all empirical estimates of tax burdens by income class allocate

income taxes according to income, i.e., they assume the tax is not shif ted.1

In an economy in which either the private saving rate is sensitive to the real

after—tax rate of return, or the marginal propensity of the public sector to

invest out of revenues is different from the private sector's marginal propen-

sity to save out of private income, this assumption is Incorrect. Since an

income tax both decreases the after—tax rate—of—return on capital and transfers

resources from the private to public sector, it affects the national saving

rate and capital—labor ratio. If saving responds positively to increases in

the rate—of—return and/or the public propensity to save falls short of the

private propensity to save,2 an income tax retards capital accumulation and



1For example, see Pechman and Okner [1974].

2We present evidence to support this position below.
                                   —5—



leads to a lower level of income and lower wage/rental ratio than would other-

wise exist.3 Further, labor's share of gross income will fall with increases

in income taxation if the elasticity of substitution falls short of unity)

In these circumstances, a proportional income tax is quite different than a

tax which is borne in proportion to income; indeed, it transfers income from

labor to capital, and hence is regressive, relative to such a tax.

    A closely related question concerns the differential incidence of an

income and a consumption tax. While most economists recognize the efficiency

advantages in taxing consumption rather than income, the general argument

against a consumption tax has been that it is regressive because it excludes

interest income from the tax base. This analysis is correct insofar as it

goes, for interest income does accrue disproportionately to the wealthy. How-

ever, it overlooks two basic points. First, the rate structure may be set

differently under a consumption tax; second, the exemption of interest income

from the tax base may increase the saving rate, the capital/labor ratio, the

productivity of labor and the wage/rental ratio. This long—run transfer of

income from capital to labor must be offset against the short—run gain to

capital from the interest income exemption. The net outcome, of course,

depends upon the particulars of the two taxes being compared. Again, however,

the prevalent view is that of Pechman [1973], ". .   .the   differential effect

on consumption and saving between an income tax and an equal yield expenditure

tax is likely to be small in this country."



LSee the analysis in Feldstein [l974ab]. Also see the contributions by
 Diamond [1970], Hall [1968], Krzyzaniak [1967], and Sato [1967].

2We present evidence to this effect in Section 4.
                                  —6—



    A related issue concerns the realtive tax treatment of physical and human

capital. I have argued elsewhere (Boskin (1975]) that the tax system probably

biases capital accumulation toward investment in human capital and away from

physical investment because most human capital investments are financed out of

tax free foregone earnings. This is equivalent to instantaneous depreciation

of this component of human investment. Since we do not allow instantaneous

write—off of investment in physical capital (except research and development

expenditures), the current system of income taxation probably reduces the

after—tax rate—of—return on physical capital relative to that on human capital.

Hence, the deadweight loss from the misallocation of a given amount of invest-

ment in physical and human capital will depend upon, among other things, the

interest—elasticity of the saving rate.

    Attention has recently been focused on the economic effects of inflation.

In a Tobin—type monetary growth model with taxes, Feistein [1975] demonstrates

how inflation may decrease the capital intensity of production and hence affect

the real economy. Again, a key issue appears to be whether saving responds

positively to increases in the real net rate of return.

     Finally, we come to the perennial issue of are we saving enough in the

United States. A variety of economists and politicians have continually ex-

pressed concern over the slower rate of real economic growth in the U.S. than

in Japan and Western Europe. Hardly a day goes by when a major speech is not

given on "the capital shortage." While the issue is complex and I can hardly

hope to deal with it in detail here, suffice it to say that under a not im-

plausible set of assumptions, a major component of the answer reduces to whether

or not current taxes, in driving a wedge between the gross marginal social
                                  —7—



yield and net marginal private yield on investment, distorts the timing of

consumption over the life—cycle; a sufficient condition for this to occur is

a positive (pure substitution) interest—elasticity of the saving rate.'

     Thus, if the saving rate displays some interest elasticity, our notions

about tax incidence, about the effects of inflation on the real economy, and

about intertemporal allocative efficiency will have to be revised drastically.

We shall return to a more complete discussion of these issues in Section 5

below.

2.    Previous Studies and Data Description


a. Previous Work on Saving Behavior

       For several decades, econometric work on saving behavior consisted

largely of estimating Keynesian—type consumption functions. The inclusion

of an interest rate variable in such analysis was the exception rather than

the rule. Further, when interest rates were included, nominal before tax

rates rather than real after—tax rates were used. Feldstein [1970] has

demonstrated that such a procedure almost certainly biases downward the esti-

mated interest elasticity. Since most of the early work on consumption and

saving focused on issues other than the effect of interest rates, perhaps it

is not surprising that little attention was paid to the weak, and sometimes

negative, relationship between saving and the rate of interest. Musgrave and

Musgrave [l971.,   p.   478]   report that "Studies of the relationship between saving

and   the rate of interest differ in their conclusion. Some hold that there        is

a substantial negative relationship, while others attribute little weight to

the rate of interest in the consumption function."            It is curious,
however, that little attention is paid to interest rates in consumption func-

tions in the large scale econometric macromodels in widespread use today.

      Several recent studies of saving have included interest rates as deter-

minants of saving. Wright [1969] includes a measure of after—tax rates of

return on stocks and bonds in estimating consumption functions from U.S.

annual time series data. His estimates imply an interest elasticity of saving

of approximately 0.2. As he himself notes, this is substantially larger than

the usual assumption, and despite his efforts, may       be   closer to the total than

the pure substitution elasticity. However, his measures of consumption and

income suffer from several deficiencies and his data refer to the period prior

to 1958. Hence, at the very least, his results must be improved and updated.
                                     —9—



       Weber [1970; 1975] examines the impact of interest rates on aggregate

consumption. He finds a positive relationship between consumer expenditures

and nominal interest rates. In the second study, he includes the expected

inflation rate as a determinant of consumer expenditures but finds no evidence

that   expected   inflation affects consumption.

       In a study of quarterly U.S. aggregate postwar data, Taylor [1970] esti-

mates an enormous interest elasticity, approximately 0.8. Since his study is

directed toward other issues, he merely reports this result without attempting

to explain why his estimate is several times larger than that of other research-

ers. Perhaps this is because it is unclear that he is estimating a structural

equation rather than a reduced form from some larger system.

       Finally, in a thought provoking reexamination of "Denison's Law," David

and Scadding [1974] document the continued constancy of the gross private

saving rate, the constancy of the saving rate augmented to include consumer

durables purchases in saving and the rental flow from durables in income, and

changes in the composition of private saving between the household and business

sectors. They interpret this relative constancy of the gross private saving

rate as evidence that taxes —    either    through a reduction in private income or

a reduction in the real net rate of return on capital — do not affect private

saving behavior. While this argument also has been made by a large number of

other economists, we shall demonstrate below that drawing such behavioral infer-

ences from these data is not warranted.

       In brief summary, there is very little empirical evidence upon which to

infer a positive relationship (substitution effect outweighing income effect)
                                —10—



between saving and the real net rate of return to capital. Surprisingly little

attention has been paid to this issue —   particularly   in light of its key role

in answering many important policy questions — and those studies which do

attempt to deal with it can be improved substantially.


b. The Data

     The data used in this study came from a variety of sources reporting on

aggregate U. S. annual time series from 1929 to 1969. Most of the data are

derived from the complete — and consistent —   accounting   system for the pivate

sector of the U.S. economy developed by Christensen and Jorgenson [1972].

These data include information on private income, gross saving, wealth, con-

sumer expenditure, labor compensation, property compensation, rates of return

on capital disaggregated into four sectors, depreciation, replacement and

revaluation of assets. They are worked up from the U.S. national income and

product accounts and other sources; Divisla price and quantity indexes are

used throughout.

     Data are also used directly from the National Income and Produce Accounts,

the Statistics of Income, and a variety of miscellaneous sources. The defini-

tions of the main variables used in the study, with emphasis on how they

differ from conventional definitions, are as follows:

     Gross Private Saving. National income accounts (NIA) gross private

saving plus personal expenditures on durable goods plus statistical discrepancy.

Christensen and Jorgenson [1972] include the surplus in the social insurance

trust funds; for the period under study this makes little difference. We

present gross private saving rates with and without the surplus included in

Tables 1 and 2 below.
                                   —11—



    Net Private Saving. Gross private saving less replacement and depre-

ciation. Depreciation is estimated for each type of capital good and assumed

to be geometric; while this may or may not be the best form to impose on the

data, it is probably a substantial improvement over the NIA depreciation fig-

ures (which are reconciled to IRS tax depreciation figures which, in turn,

bear no simple relationship to true depreciation). Use of other measures of

depreciation does not alter the conclusions reached below.

    Disposable Private Income. Unlike the NIA definition, we include retained

earnings as part of disposable income. Also includes the rental flow from

durables.

     National Income (net and gross). Includes the rental flow from consumer

durables.

    Wealth. Market value of private nonhuman assets.

     Rates of Return. Nominal after—tax rates of return from Christensen and

Jorgensen [1972]. Also used were the Moody's Ma bond rate, adjusted for

average marginal tax rate on interest income, from Statistics of Income, and

Standard and Poor's high grade tax—free municipal bond rate.

     Expected Inflation Rate. Estimated from an adaptive expectations model

of price expectations, truncated after eight years, with varying speeds of

adjustment. Expectations were projected forward to form long run average

rates for five, ten and twenty years.

     Miscellaneous. Population, unemployment rates, price data, other components

of income from NIA or Economic Report of the President. All magnitudes expressed

in constant 1958 prices from Christensen and Jorgenson [19721; aggregate magni-

tudes expressed in per capita terms.

3. Private Saving


    The relative constancy of the gross private saving rate —        the    ratio

of gross private saving to gross national income — so well documented by

David and Scadding (1974] fails to reveal a variety of important features of

private saving in the U.S. For the sake of comparison, Table 1 presents

gross private saving rates for the U.S. economy, 1929—69, with and without

the social insurance fund surplus included in the measure of gross saving.

Again, the relative constancy of this ratio in years of full employment. is

obvious. In the postwar period, it ranges from twenty to twenty—four percent,

with most of the observations at twenty—two or twenty—three percent.1

     The gross private saving rate is the product of the saving rate out of

disposable income and the ratio of disposable income to total income, i.e.,



          GPSR =
                   GNP
                         =
                             DPI
                                   * GNP
                                     .L                                (3   1)




We know that taxes as a percentage of total income have risen substantially

over this period. Hence the saving rate out of disposable income must have

increased substantially to offset the decline in the ratio of private to total

income. Table 2 documents this fact; indeed, the saving rate Out of private

net—of—tax income has    increased     by more than fifty percent since the early

postwar period. The behavioral interpretation given to these data by David




'Recall the inclusion of consumer durables raises this rate from the 15Z
   to 16% of the conventional measure.

and Scadding [1974] is that taxes and present consumption are essentially

perfect substitutes; the rise in taxes is offset by an equivalent decline

in current consumption. They go on to explore a variety of intriguing con-

jectures concerning consumer behavior.

      Three basic points need to be made concerning this conjecture. First,

most theories of consumer behavior relate saving to disposable income. If

this is correct, the saving rate varies substantially. A direct test of

whether disposable income or total income is the appropriate variable in a

private saving function is presented below.

      Second, it indeed would be surprising if consumers made the type of

rational calculations vis 'a   vis   the government and business sectors in terms

of gross saving and income. Consumers know their capital depreciates. Again,

our economic theories generally relate to how consumers choose their net

position. Further, except for some possible embodied technical change, it

is net saving that is relevant to the issue of whether taxes affect capital

accumulation. Table 2 presents calculations of the net private saving rate —

net   saving divided by net income. This series exhibits substantially more

relative variation than the gross series and can hardly be called constant,

even if we confine ourselves to the postwar period.1 While depreciation

series are notoriously unreliable, use of several alternative series based

on tax, replacement cost, etc. depreciation still yields substantial varia—

tion in the net private saving rate.         I take this to be a strong indictment

of the structural interpretation of "Denison's Law."




11f we took the broader view of saving as inclusive of human investment, use
   of Kendrick's [19761 data reveals still more variability in the total saving
   rate, gross as well as net.
                                 —16—




    Third, even if total gross income and gross saving are examined, there

still may be an independent effect of real net rates of return on saving.

Even if taxes and present consumption are perfect substitutes (the public

sector is doing its benefit—cost analyses properly, free rider issues are

ignored, etc.), the share of private wealth consumed today (publically or

privately) will depend upon the net, or after—tax return to saving, whereas

gross income is the flow from private wealth at the gross return. Hence,

taxes decreasing the net return to saving may cause a decrease in saving.

     Before proceeding to a variety of estimates of saving equations, it is

perhaps worthwhile to offer a brief conjecture on the apparent constancy of

the saving rate. Consider two motives for saving: smoothing of consumption

over the life—cycle and bequests. Further, assume bequests (broadly construed

to include provision of education as well as pure financial bequests) are

luxuries. Hence real income growth would tend to increase saving. However,

if saving is also positively related to the real net return on capital, the

slight decline in this rate would lead to a decrease in saving. Hence, the

two effects offset one another. No doubt many other effects have been at work

as well. Thus, I find it extremely difficult to give any structural or behav-

ioral interpretation to the constancy of the gross private saving rate.

     Merely pointing out some difficulties in interpretation of some data

does not suffice to reject the conjecture outright; nor does it provide an

alternative behavioral interpretation. Hence, we turn now to estimates of

the effect of taxes on private saving, i.e., to estimates of consumption

functions.

    Equation (3.2) presents our basic estimate of a (private) consumption

function:1



    LGCONSP = —3.8 + 0.56 LGDPI + 0.18 LGDPI(—1)                     (3.2)
                     (1.3) (0.12)          (0.08)

                 + 0.28 LGWLTH(—1) — 0.003 LGUNEM       —   1.07 R
                      (0.06)               (0.01)           (0.31)


        =    0.99;    SSR =    0.00171;   SE = 0.0088




where LGCONSP is the natural logarithm of real per capita private consump-

tion, DPI is disposable private income, WLTH is wealth, UNEM is the

unemployment rate, R is the real after—tax return on capital, (—1) indi-

cates a one period lag, SE is the estimated standard error of the regression

and SSR is the sum of squared residuals. Estimated standard errors appear

in parentheses below the estimated coefficients.

    The equation performs quite well by conventional standards. The estimated

standard error is a tiny fraction of the mean value of the dependent variable.

The individual coefficients are measured relatively precisely and have the

expected signs. The important thing to note is the positive real rate of return

effect; the estimated interest elasticity of saving at mean values of the vari-

ables is approximately one—fourth. Also note that the implied income elasti-

city of saving exceeds unity.

    A variety of authors have conjectured on the effect of inflation on saving.

For example, Mundell [1963] argues that inflation increases saving as it destroys

the value of accumulated wealth and consumers attempt to restore their wealth—

income position. There is also an uncertainty argument which leads to a similar

result: consumers hedge by spreading the loss of income over more than one

period. These effects may offset any indirect effects of the rate of inflation

acting through the real rate of return. We have thus entered the expected

rate of inflation () as an additional regressor in the basic equation. This

yields:



          LGCONSP = —0.46 + 0.57 LGDPI + 0.18 LGDPI(—l)                          (3.3)
                         (1.34) (0.12)             (0.08)

                         + 0.26 LGWLTH(—l)    —
                                                  0.003 LGUNEM — 1.07    R —   0.29     ir

          R2 =   0.99;     SSR =   0.0017;   SE = 0.0091



The estimated real net rate of return elasticity is still substantial, vir-

tually unchanged at about one quarter. The other coefficients are hardly

affected, and expected inflation does have the expected negative sign for

consumption.

     A loglinear specification gives similar results:



          LGCONSP = —0.60 + 0.56 LGDPI + 0.17 LGDPI(—l)                         (3.4)
                    (1.29) (0.12)       (0.08)

                         + 0.28 LGWLTH(—1)   —    0.004 LGUNEM — 0.041 LGR

          R2 =   0.99;     SSR = 0.0017;     SE =   0.0088



    Again, the estimated interest elasticity is around one—fourth and the

other estimated coefficients are quite similar to those from the semi—log

specifications)

     The measure of the real net rate of return on capital involves three

elements: the nominal rate of return, the tax rate, and the inflation rate.

We have experimented not only with alternative methods (lag structure, for-

ward projection, adjustment speed) of estimating the expected inflation rate,

but also with alternative measures of the nominal net return. Use of the

Moody's Aaa bond rate in an equation analogous to. (3.2) yielded an estimated

coefficient of —0.6 with an estimated standard error of 0.2. This implies an

interest elasticity of slightly less than 0.2. Use of Standard and Poors high

grade municipal bond rate makes it unecessary to measure marginal tax rates

on capital income; this also yielded an estimated coefficient of —0.6 with

an estimated standard error 0.2; this produced an interest elasticity of

slightly less than 0.2.

     There is. always a problem in interpreting saving or consumption functions

estimated by single equation methods. It is difficult to believe that the rate

of return (or wealth or income) is exogenous.   Since the saving function is

embodied in a larger model of economic activity — whether a simple growth model

or a monetary growth model or a full scale macroeconometric model —   the   para-

meter estimates obtained with single equation methods may be biased. Since

we do not wish to specify a complete macroeconometric model, we proceed as

follows: We estimate consumption functions by an instrumental variable tech-

nique using as instruments principal components of the exogenous variables

from the Hickman—Coen annual macroeconometric model. We thus reduce the pro-

blem to one of manageable proportions. The exogenous variables from which we



1Likewise, different adjustment speeds for inflationary expectations, and dif-
 ferent length of forward projection of    produced virtually identical results.
                                             —20—



form the principal components include tax rates, monetary instruments (such

as the discount rate and reserve ratio), population, time, etc. Use of these

principal components as instruments yields consistent estimates of the struc-

tural parameters (see Aniemiya [19661 and Jorgenson and Brundy [1973]). This

procedure yields1:



          LGCONSP = —5.83 + 0.55 LGDPI + 0.32 LGDPI(—l)                     (3.5)
                         (1.55) (th13)              (0.23)

                         + 0.72 LGWLTH(—1) — 0.031 LGUNEM    —   2.28 R — 0.36
                          (0.03)                 (0.014)         (0.62)   (0.21)


             =   0.99;     SSR =   0.0087;    SE =   0.021



     the equation performs quite well by conventional measures. The (con-

sistent) estimate of the interest elasticity is somewhat larger than with

ordinary least squares, slightly larger than 0.4. Again, it is measured

quite precisely. While much more work with such estimators is necessary,

these estimates are preferrable to those reported above.

     Finally, the estimated coefficients for the other variables are quite

similar to the ordinary least squares estimates except for that on lagged

wealth. Allowing different combinations of the real net rates, wealth, and

income to be enogeneous produced a range of estimated wealth elasticities

spanned by those reported here. It may well be that ordinary least squares

estimates of wealth coefficients are substantially biased downward.



1Since the data on the principal components, which were supplied kindly by
 N. Hurd, go only through 1966, this equation excludes 1967—69.
                                            —21—



        Since the period 1929—69 includes the depression, the mere inclusion of

the unemployment rate may not be sufficient to account for cyclical fluctua-

tions in saving. Hence, we reestimated the basic equation using postwar data

only:



             LGCONSP = —3.85 +        0.62 LGDPI + 0.007 LGDPI(—1)         (3.6)
                            (1.76) (0.21)           (0.24)

                            + 0.72 LGWLTH(—1) — 0.003 LGUNEH — 2.08 R + 0.007 ir
                             (0.05)                (0.02)       (0.81)   (0.14)


             R2 =   0.99;     SSR =   0.0025;   SE = 0.0139




        The now familiar pattern of a substantial interest elasticity is repeated

with these data. The equation performs less well by the usual measures, since

there is somewhat less variation in each of the series and the sample size is

reduced sharply when we confine ourselves to the postwar era.

        Once again, however, we estimate a substantial elasticity of saving with

respect to the real net rate of return, about 0.4.

     Alternative measures of permanent income produced similar results. Using

the natural logarithm of current and lagged labor income yielded an estimated

interest rate coefficient of —3.32 with an estimated standard error of 1.7; this

corresponds to an interest elasticity of 0.6. The worse fit and less plausible

estimated coefficients on the other variables are typical of this theoretically

more appealing specification and leads us to reject these estimates in favor

of those reported above.

     Finally, the alternative real net rate of return measures yielded estimated

interest coefficients of —1.32 (estimated standard error, 0.29) and —1.33
                                  —22—




(estimated standard error, 0.29) on the Moody's based real net yield on bonds

and the Standard Poor's based real yield on tax—free municipals, respectively;

these coefficients correspond to an elasticity of about 0.3.

     Table 3 summarizes the empirical results reported above. In brief summary,

alternative sample periods, estimation techniques, measures of theteal after—

tax rate of return on capital and measures of permanent income all lead to the

conclusion of a non—negligible interest elasticity of private saving. The range

of estimates goes from just under 0.2 to around 0.6 and clusters at about 0.3

to 0.4; the estimate I prefer on statistical grounds is that from equation (3.5),

about 0.4.

4. Production



       In order to gain further insight into the effects of tax—induced changes

in capital accumulation on the distribution of income, we have estimated pro-

duction functions from the same data used to estimate private saving. Recall

that a key issue in our two factor aggregate model is the size of the elasti-

city of substitution between capital and labor. Increases in the capital labor

ratio will lead to increases (decreases) in labor's share of gross income if

the elasticity of substitution is less (greater) than unity. Further, the

increase in the wage/rental ratio due to an increase in the capital/labor

ratio varies inversely with the elasticity of substitution.

       Since we are dealing with a two factor model, we estimate a constant

elasticity of substitution (CES) production function with Harrod—neutral

technological progress1:



              =    IrKP+ (ELLt)]"                                  (5.1)




where y is output, K capital input, L labor input, t time,

EL =                A is the exponential labor augmenting rate2 and a, the
       EL(O)eXt,
elasticity of substitution, equals l/(l+P).




 1Diamond [1965] has demonstrated that Harrod neutrality is the only type of
  technological progress compatible with balanced growth. We interpret
  our results as derived from a Harrod—neutral CES production function. If
  technical change, for example, was Hicks neutral, the coefficient of lo, w
  is interpretable as a direct estimate of the elasticity of substitution.
  Indeed, this is the interpretation originally given by Arrow, et. al. [1961].
  Note, however, that the estimate of the elasticity of substitution is still
  about one—half.

      specification thus avoids the "impossibility" problem pointed out by
 Diamond and McFadden [1965].

    Rearranging (4.1) we see that



         1og() = c        + (1—o) log w + (o—l)xt                 (5.2)




where c is a constant.



  Estimating (4.2) on data for 1929—69, deleting the war years, for the

private economy yields:



         log() =         —0.45 + 0.554 log w — 0.0045 time        (5.3)
                         (0.06) (0.034)       (0.0021)


         R2 =    0.99;     SE =   0.033;     SSR = 0.033



The equation fits the data quite well. The standard error of the regression

is a small fraction of the mean value of the dependent variable and the esti-

mated coefficients are measured rather precisely. The estimated elasticity

of substitution is 0.45, which is quite similar to the usual time series esti-

mates1. This immediately implies that labor's share of gross income varies

in the same direction as the capital/labor ratio. The derived estimate of

A, the labor augmenting rate, is 0.092.

     Fit to powtwar data alone, we obtain:

          log() =        —0.42 + 0.52 log w — 0.005 time           (5.4)
                         (0.18) (0.13)       (0.006)


          R2 =   0.98;     SE =   .016;     SSR = .0045


1See Nerlove [1967] for a survey of estimates of CES production functions.
 Our estimate is quite similar to usual time series estimates, which in turn
 are usually smaller than cross section estimates. While time series esti-
 mates may be biased downwards because of lagged adjustments, Lucas [1969]
 rejects this conjecture. Cross section estimates suffer from a variety of
 problems; See Nerlove (1962] and Lucas [1969].

2One might think of this as including some exogenous human   investment.
                                           —26—



The estimated elasticity of substitution is 0.48; unfortunately, while the

point estimate of the labor augmenting rate is quite similar to that for

the whole period, its estimated standard error is quite large.

     As with the estimates of saving functions, the issue of potential bias

in the estimates must be confronted. Possible measurement error and the

endogeneity of wages in a full model lead us to follow the same procedure

as described above for consumption/saving. We use an instrumental variables

estimator, using principal components from the exogenous variables in the

Hickinan—Coen model as instruments. This yields



          log() =        —0.53 + 0.56 log w — 0.005 time         (5.5).
              y
                         (0.02) (0.04)            (0.002)


          R2 =   0.99;     SE =   0.034;    SSR = 0.032



Again, the equation fits quite well. The estimated elasticity of substitu-

tion is 0.44, and the estimated labor—augmenting rate is 0.09; both estimates

are quite close to those reported above.

    While increases in the capital—labor ratio will increase the wage—rental

ratio (which is probably a more insightful way to analyze tax incidence in

a growing economy than examining factor shares) regardless of the elasticity

of substitution, these results suggest that policies which increase capital

accumulation will increase labor's gross share of national income.

    We now turn to a more detailed examination of the implications of our

empirical results.

5. Implications for Income, Welfare and Income Distribution



    As discussed in Section 1, these results have striking implications for

tax policy. The current tax treatment of income from capital —   primarily   the

personal and corporate income taxes — decreases the net rate of return to

capital accumulation; the modest positive real net of interest elasticity thus

implies a substantial tax—induced decrease in saving and the capital intensity

of production, a reallocation of consumption from the future to the present and

a substantial transfer of gross income from laborto capital. To estimates of

these effects we now turn.


a. Welfare

     The welfare analysis of intertemporal resource allocation involves a variety

of complex issues which are beyond the scope of this paper. For example, exter-

nal benefits to saving and investment (for example, learning by doing) may

render the social rate of return higher than the private rate; other distor—

don (e.g., lack of a complete set of futures markets) may be important. If,

however, we proceed in the usual manner and ignore all distortions other than

taxes and argue that to a first approximation the saving rate would be efficient

in the absence of taxes, we may adopt the usual consumer surplus measure of

lost welfare: one—half the product of the tax—induced increase in the price

of future consumption and the compensated change in future consumption. Feld—

stein [1975] shows that this product may be written as



             = —1/2(1 +      )(P1PcL)                             (5.1)
                                        S1
                                        —28—




where P1 and P0 are the prices of future consumption after and before
taxes on   capital income are imposed (e (—r/(l—j)T) and e
                                                              —rT
                                                                    ),   i is   the

marginal rate of tax on capital income, r is the net rate of return on

capital, T is the length of time between saving and dissaving, S1 is

saving for future consumption, and Sr is the compensated interest elas-

ticity of the saving rate.

     Recall that since the private sector is a net saver, the income and

substitution effects of a change in the rate of return work in opposite

directions. Hence, our estimates are lower bounds on the pure substitution

elasticity. The real net rate of return, r, averages about three or four

percent over our sample period; T, the average length of time between sav-

ing and dissavirig, is probably around twenty—five years. Hence, examining

(5.1), we see that the contribution of the real net rate of return elasticity

to lost welfare is magnified by the factor l/rT        4/3.

    While    i.'   varies   substantially by the type of capital, and the progres-

sive rate structure of the personal income tax makes it difficult to measure

marginal, as opposed to average, tax rates, we adopt 50% as a reasonable

estimate of .        Harberger [19691 suggests that 60% is a good approximation;
Pechman and Okner [1974] argue that 40% is better. The former figure does

not deal adequately with the nonprofit sector, whereas the latter fails to

impute any indirect business taxes to capital. Since S1 is saving for

future consumption, total net private saving understates S1 because of

the dissaving of the elderly population during retirement. If the population

grows at 1—2% and real income grows at 3% per year, and T            25 years, S1

equals about one and one—half times total net private saving, about $200

billion. Estimates of the annual welfare loss resulting from the tax—induced

distortion of the timing of consumption over the life cycle for different

values of        and r are reported in Table 4. Our preferred estimate,

based on r = 0.4    and CS =     0.4,    yields an estimate of the annual welfare

loss of close to sixty billion dollars! This estimate is rather insensitive

to variations in r and only modestly sensitive to variations in CSr•

     By comparison to previous studies of the welfare loss from differential

taxation of different types of capital,1 these numbers are enormous. They

amount to an astounding waste of resources. Recall that these estimates are

annual costs to society. The present value of these costs is a large multiple

of the annual costs (the exact relation depending upon the assumed rate of

discount) and can easily amount to hundreds of billions of dollars. Viewed

another way, if we abolished taxes on income from capital this year, by the

end of the decade welfare would have increased by close to two hundred billion

dollars, or about twice the current annual yield of the individual income tax

     These estimates highlight the fact that the current tax treatment of income

from capital induces consumers to save less for consumption later in life —

primarily   old age —   than is socially optimal. It seems strange simultaneously
to reduce substantially the return to saving, and hence private provision for

retirement, and to attempt to increase provision for retirement publically

through social security, which in turn may well decrease private saving.2

While both the taxation of capital income and the social security system serve

other goals, they are in basic conflict in the attempt to provide retirement

or old age consumption.

     Do such enormous welfare costs make sense? First, extrapolating the esti-

mated interest elasticity over a large change in tax induced variations in the

real after—tax rate of return may not be warranted. On the other hand, the

estimated elasticities are a lower bound on the pure substitution elasticities,

since they include a negative income effect of interest rate increases on saving.

     Second, substituting taxes on labor income for those in capital income can

produce a distortion in labor markets, e.g., in the allocation of work between

home and market. While most estimates of labor supply functions suggest an

aggregate supply of labor which is quite wage inelastic, it is quite difficult

to measure labor supply in the envelope since — subsuming effort and human in-

vestment — and taxes affect human investment in a variety of offsetting ways.1

Since one reason one works early in life is to save for future consumption,

cross elasticities as well as own elasticities are important; the interested

reader is referred to Feldstein [1975] for a detailed discussion. We merely

note that our estimates    must be adjusted downward to get the net effect of

substituting labor income taxes for capital income taxes.

     Finally, one might expect that such enormous inefficiency would result in

an intense pressure to revive the tax laws or to provide retirement consumption.

Indeed, social insurance benefits have grown rapidly and increasingly generous

treatment of income placed in retirement plans has been a key feature of recent

tax reform.


b. Income and Its Distribution

     The long—run effect of changes in the structure of capital income taxes on

income and its distribution depends upon the exact change being considered. For



1See Boskin [1976].
                                      —32—



example, integration of corporate and personal income taxes or switching from

income to consumption as the base of personal taxation, or both, will increase

income substantially if the rise in the real net rate of return is n,t offset

by other policies (government saving, monetary policy, etc.). Assuming no

other policies are enacted which affect the real after—tax rate of return and

that an equal current yield consumption tax replaces current capital income

taxation,1 the real net rate of return, with      0.5, will double in the short—

run. This will lead to an Increase in saving, the capital—labor ratio and wage

rates, and to a fall in the gross rate of return to capital.

     Feldsteln [1974b] derives the relationship between the net rate of return

to capital and capital income taxes in a one sector growth with factor taxes

and variable saving rates. The estimates reported above (real net interest

elasticity of saving of 0.4, elasticity of substitution of 0.45, etc.) imply

an elasticity of the net rate of return with respect to capital income tax

rates of 0.3 (an elasticity of substitution of one would imply 0.6).2 Hence,

a complete abolition of capital income taxation would increase the real net

rate of return some thirty (or more if the elasticity of substitution is larger)

percent. Since the capital—labor ratio increases in proportion to S/a, where

S is net saving and a labor's share of gross income, our estimates imply a

new steady—state capital—labor ratio some 15—20% larger than currently.

     From the production function, and competitive factor markets,



          log   =   C   + (1 + p) log k                          (5.2)




11t is quite likely that a personal consumption tax would have progressive
 rates; indeed, this often overlooked fact makes the distributional effects
 of switching from income to consumption taxes much more palatable.

2Extrapolations over such a larger range are somewhat hazardous. We present
 here only illustrative calculations.
                                 —33—



          is the substitution parameter in the CES form, i.e., p      —   1,
where p

where a is the elasticity of substitution. Hence, our estimate of p is,

around 1.2. Thus, a 15—20% increase in k would result in a 33—44% increase

in the wage—rental ratio; the abolition of capital income taxation transfers

gross income from capital to labor.

     Further,




          log    = C + p log k                                     (53)



so the 15—20% increase in k implies an increase in this ratio of factor

shares of about 18—24%. Since the factor share ratio is currently around

3, it would increase to about 3.6. Thus, capital's share of gross income

would fall by around 15%.

     With the general distributional pattern developed above, we mention

briefly two other important tax incidence' issues. First, the results presented

above imply a substantial shifting of capital income taxes from capital to

labor due to the decreased capital—labor ratio caused by current tax treatment.

Again, Feldstein [1974b] develops a formula to measure this differential inci-

dence; our estimates imply that capital shifts approximately one half of the

burden of capital income taxes onto labor. Failure to account for tax shifting

via decreased saving has led many researchers to conclude that taxes on income

from capital are much more progressive than they really are in fact; for example,

the excellent study by Pechman and Okner [1974] ignores these long run effects:

 capital income taxes are generally considered borne by capital and general income

 taxes in proportion to income.1 The results reported here suggest that each of



 1Pecbxnan and Okner [1974] do provide careful estimates based on a variety of
  generally accepted incidence assumptions; however, the case of a large share
  of capital income taxes being borne by labor is not included.
                                   —34—



these procedures may overstate substantially the progressivity of such taxes.

     Second, our results on the interest elasticity of the saving rate suggest

that proposals to integrate the corporate and personal income tax which are

financed by increases in labor income taxation or consumption taxation would

increase saving, the capital—labor ratio, welfare, the wage—rental ratio and

labor's share of gross income.

     These transfers of gross income from capital to labor from tax policies

which decrease capital income taxation must be offset against the decrease in

taxes onincome from capital and possible increase in taxes on labor income

to compare after—tax incomes. Further, the full transfer of gross income will

take a period of years of occur.

     This immediately raises the issue of what to assume about tax revenue and

rates along the new growth path. Further, we have ignored government saving.

The net increase in the capital—labor ratio must net out any changes in gov-

ernment saving) Since the increased capital—labor ratio will result in a cor-

responding increase in per capita output, tax revenues at constant rates will

increase well above what they would have been before an initial year equal—

yield change. We may choose to compare situations with equal revenue year by

year, or with equal shares of taxes in gross income; or with the initial rates

continuing; or still other scenarios. Hence, to give an accurate picture, we

must compare changes in after—tax incomes under some well—defined set of assump-

tions about the course of tax rates.2



1Ny preliminary estimates reveal a much lower government propensity to invest
 out of revenues than the private sector's propensity to save out of income.

     other policies.
                                  —35—



     We shall not attempt to deal with this conceptual issue here. We

merely note that in addition to the usual efficiency arguments in favor of

abolishing taxes on interest income,1 and the often overlooked potential

horizontal equity arguments in favor of consumption taxation.2 The analysis

and empirical evidence described above cast serious doubt on the usual com-

parison of the distributional effects of income and consumption taxes.

     Again, while the net effect on income and its distribution depends uponi.

the specific set of assumptions made, the general argument remains the same:

the modest positive interest elasticity implies that tax policies — from cor-

porate and personal income tax integration or switching to consumption taxes —

which lower taxes on income from capital will increase saving, the capital

intensity of production, income, and welfare; and further, will transfer gross

income from capital to labor.

2Since consumption is a more stable function of permanent income than is
 current income, a consumption tax may improve our ability to tax persons
 with the same permanent income at the same rate.

6. Conclusion



     We have presented a good deal of evidence which suggests that there

is a positive relationship between private saving and the rate of return.

A variety of definitions of variables, functional forms and estimation

methods all led to this conclusion. This relationship has immensely

important implications for economic policy. Among the more important

are that the current tax treatment of income from capital induces an

astounding loss in welfare due to the distortion of the consumption!

saving choice and that reducing taxes   on interest income would   in   the

long-run raise the level of income and transfer a substantial portion

of capitals share of gross income to labor. The overall distributional

effects of such a policy combine this long—run effect with that of the

exemption of interest income from taxation,

     Taken as a whole, the results reported here strengthen substantially

the case for reforming the tax treatment of income from capital in the

United States, e.g., integration of the corporate and personal income

taxes or, better yet, switching from income to consumption taxation.

     They also have obvious implications for the potential effectiveness

of monetary policy in the short— and long—run.
