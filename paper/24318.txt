                                           ABSTRACT

We investigate the consequences of public disclosure of information from company income tax
returns filed in Australia. Supporters of more disclosure argue that increased transparency will
improve tax compliance, while opponents argue that it will divulge sensitive information that is,
in many cases, misunderstood. Our results show that in Australia large private companies
experienced some consumer backlash and, perhaps partly in anticipation, some acted to avoid
disclosure. We detect a small increase (decrease) in tax payments for private (public) firms
subject to disclosure suggesting differential costs of disclosure across firms. Finally, we find that
investors react negatively to anticipated and actual disclosure of tax information, most likely due
to anticipated policy backlash rather than consumer backlash or the revelation of negative
information about cash flows. These findings are important for both managers and policy makers,
as the trend towards increased tax disclosure continues to rise globally.

1.       Introduction

         There is currently widespread public and political pressure for action to limit perceived

harmful tax practices by businesses. One response to this pressure has been to increase the amount

of information available to taxing authorities for enforcement, while another is to improve

accountability and compliance via mandatory tax disclosure to the public. The latter response is of

particular concern to firm managers fearing that the private costs of tax-related public disclosure

will outweigh the benefits (Graham et al. 2014; Ernst & Young 2011). For instance, it can

potentially create compliance burdens, divulge sensitive information, generate confusion about

company behavior, and impose reputational damage on firms. Although more transparency results

in potential costs that must be weighed against the perceived benefits, policy discussions generally

proceed in a near-absence of evidence about its potential impacts.1

         Our paper seeks to fill this void by considering the recent case wherein the Australian

Taxation Office (ATO) disclosed firm-level data from Australian company tax returns, including

income and taxes payable, for listed and private firms. We analyze a variety of hypothesized

potential effects, focusing on changes in firm behavior, consumer sentiment, and investor

responses. Our results suggest that private companies took relatively more action to avoid public

disclosure than public companies, and the effect of public disclosure appears to have raised the tax

payments of private companies but lowered the tax payments of public companies, consistent with

differences in disclosure costs among firms. Relatedly, private firms subject to disclosure

  For example, on July 4, 2017 the European Parliament voted in favor of public country-by-country reporting whereby
limited tax information for MNCs is broken down by taxing jurisdiction. While these reports are designed to aid tax
administrators, policymakers are evaluating the possibility of making this information public. Although making less
political headway in the U.S., several members of Congress wrote a letter to the Financial Accounting Standards Board
on July 18, 2017, urging them to require information from country-by-country reports in financial statement footnote
disclosures. Analysis of the Norwegian and Japanese experience with public tax disclosure has provided what up to
now is known about its consequences. For instance, some attention has been paid to small firms in Norway and Japan
(Bø et al. 2015; Hasegawa et al. 2013) and individuals in Japan (Hasegawa et al. 2013). We discuss this in Section 2.

experienced a small decline in consumer sentiment, suggesting that expectations of consumer

backlash may have motivated some private firms to avoid disclosure. Finally, we find a negative

investor reaction to both anticipated and actual disclosure. Cross-sectional tests point to anticipated

policy backlash resulting in adverse changes to the tax code as the likely source of the reaction.

For instance, in the 2016−17 Budget, the Australian government announced that it would introduce

a diverted profits tax, effective on 1 July 2017.2 The momentum for this new law was almost

certainly fueled by public scrutiny of the newly disclosed tax information.

         In 2013, the Australian legislature began debating publicizing tax-return data. Proponents

argued that more transparency would encourage companies to pay their “fair share” of tax, improve

accountability, and educate the public about compliance with tax laws (Bradbury 2013).

Opponents argued that disclosure would create compliance burdens, divulge sensitive information

to competitors, generate confusion about company behavior, and impose risks on business owners

(Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand 2015; Hurst 2015). The legislature passed a

bill mandating disclosure for foreign-owned private firms and Australian listed firms reporting

more than 100 AUD million of “total income” on the Australia company tax return.3 Disclosure

occurred on December 17, 2015 for the first year covered by the legislation (2013-2014). The same

policy went into effect for Australian-owned private firms reporting more than 200 AUD million,

with disclosure for this set of companies occurring on March 22, 2016. This generated substantial

  The new legislation imposes a 40 percent tax on diverted profits. Diverted profits are profits deemed to be reported
outside of Australia by Australian companies that use tax avoidance arrangements between related parties to divert,
or report, profits offshore that do not have economic substance. https://www.ato.gov.au/general/new-legislation/in-

media attention. For instance, Figure 1 graphs the number of media articles discussing taxpayers

that “paid no tax”, or the ATO generally, illustrating a sharp surge on December 17, 2015.

         Hanlon and Heitzman (2010) call for more research on how consumers and investors

perceive corporate tax avoidance, noting that one challenge is the number of divergent and

subjective proxies to measure tax avoidance. Our setting provides an opportunity to examine

consumer and investor reaction to an objective measure of tax avoidance – whether or not a

company remitted any income tax in Australia. As firms subject to disclosure are the largest in

Australia, paying no tax is a signal of potential profit shifting, a particular tax avoidance technique

currently under intense scrutiny. Our focus is also consistent with observed media headlines

highlighting the many firms that were disclosed as having remitted no income tax.

         Legislating disclosure of tax-return data has several potential effects that are all inter-

connected. Chen (2016) uses the Australian setting to examine whether investors value corporate

tax return information. 4 However, one cannot fully understand investor reactions without

considering consumer and firm reactions. Investors, for example, will try to price consumer

responses and firm responses (Hanlon and Slemrod 2009). Moreover, firms’ responses will depend

on managers’ beliefs about consumer and investor reactions (Gallemore et al. 2014). For instance,

firms may try to avoid disclosure because they fear a consumer response, may change their real

behavior as a result of public pressure (Dyreng et al. 2016), or change their disclosure practices

(Kays 2017). Hence, while prior literature focuses on one of these effects, we examine many

effects in the context of a unique piece of legislation.




4
 Chen (2016) focuses exclusively on investor reaction and finds a negative reaction around two early legislative dates,
including the April 3, 2013 date that we examine. She finds a positive reaction around two later legislative dates, and
no reaction around the actual disclosure date of December 17, 2015. When we condition on the unexpected taxpaying
status of the firm, we find a small negative reaction to the actual tax disclosure on December 17, 2015.

                                                          3
       We begin by examining the effects of disclosure on firm behavior. As changes in tax

reporting behavior are of primary interest, we work directly with the ATO to examine aggregated

tax-return data before and after the disclosure. This evidence is useful because consumer and

investor responses are, to some extent, predicated upon firm responses. To determine whether

firms acted to avoid disclosure, we examine the distribution of reported income around the

threshold and find evidence of an increase in the frequency of income just below the threshold,

consistent with some firms adjusting their income to avoid disclosure. In particular, these tests

suggest that at least some private firms anticipate a net cost to disclosure. We also look for changes

in tax payments by firms above and below the disclosure threshold. We detect a small increase

(decrease) in tax payments for private (public) firms. While all firms face public pressure to pay

more tax, listed firms also face pressure from shareholders to pay less tax.

       Next, we investigate how Australian consumers responded by analyzing two sources of

consumer sentiment data generated from surveys. Our first source comes from YouGov, a market

research firm that tracks perceptions of relatively well-known global brands, including Australian

public companies and large foreign-owned companies operating in Australia. We find no evidence

of changes in measures of sentiment for these brands after the disclosure, regardless of whether

the disclosure reveals no tax paid. Our second source is a survey we designed and administered

before and after the release of data for Australian-owned private firms. We study responses to

questions about views towards these businesses along five dimensions, and detect a small decline

in sentiment after the disclosure for firms subject to disclosure. Taken together, these results

suggest consumer sentiment is more resilient for relatively global brands of large public firms, and

perhaps slightly more vulnerable (at least in the short term) for smaller domestic brands.




                                                 4
       Finally, we examine investor reactions by examining market returns around a pivotal

legislative event on April 3, 2013 and the actual disclosure on December 17, 2015. On April 3,

discussion of the legislation included for the first time the specific thresholds determining which

firms would be subject to disclosure. On December 17, the ATO made available on its website

limited tax-return information for 1,538 of the largest companies in Australia. We find a significant

negative market reaction for non-taxpaying firms subject to disclosure on both dates. These results

suggest that the market did anticipate a reduction in firm value arising from a disclosure of no tax

paid in Australia. We explore cross-sectional variation in the disclosure costs to firms anticipated

by investors. Across several measures designed to capture different sources of variation in

anticipated costs such as the potential for confusion from the disclosure, the level of investor

sophistication, and brand recognition of the firms, we conclude that the negative investor reaction

stems from anticipated policy backlash rather than anticipated declines in consumer sentiment or

negative information about cash flows.

       Our paper contributes to the literature examining the costs and consequences of public tax-

return information, including how specific implementation rules may affect disclosure outcomes.

Further, our paper contributes to the literature on taxes and reputation. Surveys of tax directors

have found that one pervasive fear associated with tax planning is garnering negative attention

(Graham et al. 2014). Relatedly, several studies have searched for evidence on reputational

consequences associated with tax shelter involvement (Dyreng et al. 2016; Gallemore et al. 2014;

Graham et al. 2014; Hanlon and Slemrod 2009; Dyreng et al. 2017; Austin and Wilson 2017). Our

study shows that there can be costs to disclosure outside of the tax shelter context – i.e., even when

firms may be obeying the law. For instance, we find that disclosure of a zero tax liability without

any context in which to interpret and understand the reason likely leaves some firms who are not



                                                 5
avoiding taxes in a situation where they experience negative consumer, investor, or policy

attention. This is important for policymakers to consider in the design of disclosure rules.

2.      Background on tax disclosure and relevant literature

        Tax disclosure policies take many forms, with mandatory disclosures made privately by

the taxpayer to the taxing authority the most common. Some countries have introduced policies

that allow for public scrutiny of private tax information, such as Denmark, Sweden, Finland,

Iceland, Norway, and (in the past) Japan and the United States. An important debate regarding

public scrutiny of tax information is currently taking place in both the EU and the U.S. On July 4,

2017 the European Parliament voted in favor of public country-by-country reporting, whereby

limited tax information for MNCs is broken down by taxing jurisdiction. While these reports are

designed to aid tax administrators, policymakers are evaluating the possibility of making this

information public. Although making less political headway in the U.S., several members of

Congress wrote a letter to the Financial Accounting Standards Board on July 18, 2017, urging

them to require information from country-by-country reports in financial statement disclosures. 5

        One policy argument in favor of putting more information in the hands of the public is that

the additional scrutiny will improve tax compliance by shaming firms that do not pay tax. Bø et

al. (2015) explore the effect of public tax disclosure of individual taxpayers in Norway, and

observe income changes consistent with public disclosure improving tax compliance of self-

employed individuals. Hasegawa et al. (2013) examine public disclosure in Japan, and find strong

evidence, based on bunching of observations right below the disclosure threshold, that some small

corporate and individual taxpayers actively avoided disclosure, suggesting they viewed the

disclosure as costly. However, putting more information in the public eye, particularly information

that is confusing, incomplete, or misleading, could shame firms who are in full compliance with

the law. Empirical research contributing to policy debates such as public country-by-country

reporting is sparse, primarily because so few settings exist in which to examine the effects of

making tax information public.

        In order to examine the effects of public tax disclosure, we focus on a recent policy change

in Australia where once-private tax-return information was mandated to be publicly disclosed by

the ATO. Table 1 offers a detailed timeline of the implementation of Australia’s tax disclosure

legislation. On February 4, 2013, the government announced they intended to improve tax

transparency with public disclosure. On April 3, 2013, details of the intended regime were

announced, including the income threshold for being subject to the new rule. On June 29, 2013,

the Tax Laws Amendment Bill 2013 was enacted, applying to all companies reporting total income

of 100 AUD million or more on an Australia company tax return.

        Some Australian-owned (i.e., controlled) private firms argued that, because their owners

were often represented by a small number of individuals, as opposed to private companies owned

by foreign corporations or Australian public companies with a widely dispersed shareholder base,

disclosure would inappropriately reveal personal details about a firm owner’s financial situation. 6

Indeed, it was this argument that prompted a draft amendment to be enacted on November 12,

2015 that would exempt Australian-owned private companies from the disclosure regulation.

Reflecting continued disagreement on this issue, the exemption was amended to increase the

disclosure threshold for private firms to 200 AUD million. Pursuant to the legislation, on



6
  Much of the media coverage following the disclosure centered on wealthy Australians who controlled disclosed
private firms. For example, Gina Rinehart, chairman of Hancock Prospecting (a private mineral and exploration
company) with estimated personal wealth over 8 billion USD, was covered extensively.

                                                     7
December 17, 2015 the ATO released the Corporate Tax Transparency Report (the “ATO report”)

on its website revealing firm-specific total income, taxable income, and tax payable for the tax

year ending June 30, 2014. Due to the late nature of the private-company amendment, the first

report (December, 2015) included 1,538 Australian public and foreign-owned firms, while the

second (March, 2016) included 321 Australian-owned private firms.

         Table 2 shows descriptive statistics for the data disclosed in both December and March.

We rely on Orbis data to identify public firms, as Orbis provides both the Australian Business

Number (ABN) from the ATO report and the listing status of firms. The data show that about 36

percent of firms report a zero tax liability, a statistic that featured prominently in the media with

headlines such as “Almost 600 major corporations did not pay tax in 2013-14 financial year, ATO

says.”7 Although the detailed ATO report offers general reasons for a zero tax liability (not on a

firm-by-firm basis), the media did not probe into these reasons, instead noting, for example, that

the data highlight “a number of companies that paid little to no tax, but does not outline how they

minimized their tax bill.”8 However, the median effective tax rate (ETR) disclosed is the statutory

tax rate in Australia of 30 percent.

         There is evidence of significant reputational costs of malfeasance accruing to firms in a

range of nontax settings such as accounting fraud (Karpoff et al. 2008), defective products (Garber

et al. 1998) and violation of environmental regulations (Karpoff et al. 2005). Reputational costs in




7
  Interestingly, the ATO also notes in its report that, even for taxpaying entities, the disclosed data “do not themselves
indicate whether an entity is paying a high or low rate of tax. Measuring a company’s ETR requires more information
than that included in the report and comparing ETRs across single entities does not take into account related-party
transactions, the broader economic group, or a number of other factors.” The ATO states that for privacy reasons it
cannot release publicly any of the additional information that would be required to evaluate the tax rates of these
entities and instead subsequently adopted a Voluntary Tax Transparency Code to complement the disclosed data,
whereby firms may voluntarily release information to help interested users better interpret the data. See
http://taxboard.gov.au/consultation/voluntary-tax-transparency-code/ for the Voluntary Tax Transparency Code.

these studies take many forms, encompassing a variety of ways in which stakeholders form a

perception of the firm that influences the interaction between the firm and its stakeholders. For

instance, firms may experience loss of sales, increased regulatory scrutiny, depressed share

valuations, shareholder lawsuits, negative media attention, employee turnover, or impairment to

brand reputation and consumer interest. Empirical evidence on the reputational costs of tax

avoidance is relatively scarce.

        The most comprehensive study to date on the reputational costs of tax avoidance is

Gallemore et al. (2014). Despite a battery of tests, this study finds little evidence of ex post

consequences to the firm – such as media reputation, equity prices, or increased tax payments –

from public scrutiny of tax shelter involvement. This study confirms a finding in Hanlon and

Slemrod (2009) of negative stock returns in consumer-focused firms around the publicity, but

documents that the investor response is short-lived. Despite the lack of broad empirical evidence

of ex post consequences, Graham et al. (2012) find more than half of tax executives agree that

potential harm to their firm’s reputation is an important factor in deciding whether to implement a

tax strategy. Consider the Starbuck’s episode in the United Kingdom. YouGov brand data show

that consumers responded negatively to reports that Starbucks generated £398 million in U.K. sales

in 2012 but remitted no tax.9 Figure 2 shows that Starbuck’s Buzz Score (whether respondents

heard anything positive or negative about a brand) declined substantially around three key dates –

media coverage, regulator questioning, and the decision to remit more tax.

        Our setting provides an opportunity to build upon these studies and contribute to an

important policy debate in three important ways. First, the Australia legislation provides an

objective measure of tax avoidance that received media scrutiny – paying no tax in Australia – but

paying no tax is often a result of legal activity, unlike, for example, involvement in an illegal tax

shelter. This is important because one policy concern is that some firms will suffer reputational

costs from public scrutiny following disclosure even when they are not inappropriately avoiding

taxes. Second, public scrutiny in our settings occurs in a much larger sample of firms than in prior

literature. In our setting, hundreds of firms are being scrutinized simultaneously, which may

generate results that differ from, and are more robust than, findings from settings where a single

firm is scrutinized.10 Finally, in Australia there is a low level of conformity between financial and

tax accounting (Alford et al. 1993). This is important because another policy concern is the extent

to which the tax disclosures reveal new information, and how it might be interpreted if it differs

from available information (e.g., accounting information).

3.       Analysis of behavioral response by firms

3.1      Hypothesis development

          Slemrod (1992) notes that, in response to the tax system, firms may respond on multiple

 dimensions, including reporting income differently, changing how they classify income, changing

 organizational form, retiming transactions and income, or actually changing tax behavior by

 allowing tax-related cash flows to change. In our setting, one potential response by firms to the

 new legislation is to avoid being subject to the new rules. Firms will generally voluntarily disclose

 information if the benefits of such disclosure outweigh the costs, and if firms perceive the

 disclosure to be costly, whether as a result of consumer, policy, or investor backlash, they may

 try to avoid disclosure altogether (Verrecchia 2001).



10
  Hanlon and Slemrod (2009) examine the impact of public scrutiny in 108 firms over a 14-year period, while
Gallemore et al. (2014) study a sample of 118 firms over a 10-year period. These studies caveat small sample size and
low power as a potential reason for not finding a broad set of statistically significant results.

                                                         10
          While there is a broad literature examining firm responses to mandatory disclosure

requirements and stakeholder responses to voluntary disclosures (e.g., Healy and Palepu 2001;

Beyer et al. 2010), much less has been done to examine corporate attempts to avoid mandatory

disclosure. Gao et al. (2009) find that some firms undertook less investment and paid more cash

to shareholders in order to remain below a threshold of 75 USD million in public float and thereby

avoid full compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley. Firms also appear to manage around thresholds to

avoid requirements mandating both audits and public disclosure (Bernard 2016; Shroff 2016), or

only audits (Kausar et al. 2016), as well as avoiding disclosure in other settings (Verrecchia and

Weber 2006; Leuz et al. 2008). In the tax setting, Hasegawa et al (2013) find that in Japan, small

businesses manipulated their income in order to fall below a mandatory disclosure threshold.

Towery (2017) finds that firms avoid accruing financial statement reserves for uncertain tax

positions to avoid being subject to Schedule UTP reporting requirements. Finally, Dyreng et al.

(2017) find that some firms with significant subsidiary locations in tax havens simply fail to

disclose those subsidiaries despite the legal requirement to do so. We hypothesize that, in response

to a disclosure mandate with an income threshold, some firms will avoid disclosure altogether by

reporting income below the threshold.11

 H1a. Some firms will take action to avoid being subject to public disclosure of tax information.

         Another possible behavioral response by companies is to alter what will become publicly

disclosed. This is, presumably, the intended response by the politicians who created the disclosure

legislature—to reduce abusive tax avoidance in Australia and thereby collect more tax revenue.




11
   For instance, the income threshold is applied to individual entities, not to economic groups, so income thresholds
can be manipulated through complex business structures, which the ATO points out are often observed in private
companies.         See,      for      example,        https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Large-business/In-detail/Tax-
transparency/Corporate-tax-transparency-report-for-the-2013-14-income-year/.

                                                         11
This response to the disclosure would constitute a real response of public disclosure, which is

increasingly being documented in the accounting literature. For example, Christensen et al. (2017)

show that in the U.S., when firms were mandated to disclose mine safety records, mine safety

actually increased. Kubick et al. (2016) find firms that received an SEC comment letter requesting

additional tax information, a form of mandatory disclosure, increased their actual cash tax

payments by 1.5 percentage points. In our setting, some firms may opt to increase their tax

remittance in general to avoid being seen as not paying their “fair share.”12 This response is likely

predicated upon the cost of additional tax payments versus the cost of potentially negative tax

information being disclosed about the firm. If firms place a relatively low cost on having the firm

be disclosed as having paid little tax, they may well not change their underlying tax behavior. For

example, Hasegawa et al. (2013) fail to document that, in response to a cessation of mandatory

public tax disclosure, firms changed their underlying tax payments. Motivated by the literature

regarding the real effects of disclosure, we examine the following hypothesis:

     H1b. Some firms will change their tax payments in response to public tax-return disclosure.

         To properly test these hypotheses, it is necessary to use Australian tax return data for firms

both subject to and not subject to disclosure. However, there is no publicly-available, data source

that would provide total income in Australia reported on line 6S from an Australian Company Tax

Return (around which the disclosure threshold is based) or the level of tax payments to Australia

by all firms. Fortunately, we were able to obtain data assistance from the ATO due to their

understandable interest in the economic effects of this new legislation. In particular, the ATO

provided us with de-identified aggregated data on the total income and tax payments for all

  SEC comment letters are a form of mandatory disclosure because the ‘conversation’ between the firm and the SEC
does not constitute enforcement actions per se, but the content of the ‘conversation’ is publicly available.

companies filing an Australian Company Tax Return in the years 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 – the

first tax return year subject to disclosure. Aggregate data were provided across 19 income

categories (i.e., total income ≥ 95 AUD million and < 100 AUD million), taxpaying status (i.e., a

zero tax liability versus a positive tax liability), and the type of firm (i.e., foreign-owned, Australian

private, Australian public).

        While the aggregate nature of the Australian tax return data limits our ability to pursue

some natural statistical tests, the data are nevertheless highly appropriate for examining our

hypotheses. These analyses are also helpful in interpreting our later tests and allow us to explore

some nuances in the tax disclosure setting that researchers have been unable to examine directly

heretofore. For instance, we can examine here separately any changes in the behavior of foreign-

owned, Australian private, and Australian public firms. Most large private companies in Australia

are foreign-owned, and are thus simply subsidiaries of large, almost always public, companies.

Existing studies have documented that tax avoidance is generally positively valued in public

companies (e.g., Hanlon and Slemrod 2009; Frischmann et al. 2008) and that peer effects provide

incentives in public firms to manage taxes (e.g., Bird et al. 2017). Consequently, increased

transparency could impose a cost (from investor backlash) if public firms are viewed as paying too

much tax rather than too little. Moreover, private companies were the most vocal group arguing

very high costs to disclosure, particularly Australian private companies.

3.2     Avoiding disclosure by reporting income under the threshold

         To examine H1a, we look at the distribution of reported total income around the disclosure

 threshold. Figure 3, Panels A, B and C show the number of firms in each income bin in the year

 prior to disclosure and the year subject to disclosure, separately for each type of firm. The 100




                                                   13
 AUD million threshold applies to all companies for these tests. 13 In all cases, we observe a jump

 in the number of firms reporting just under the threshold, while the number reporting income just

 over the threshold holds relatively steady or declines. The excess mass just under the disclosure

 threshold is relatively less pronounced for public firms, with an increase of just 33 percent in the

 number of firms from 2013 to 2014. In contrast, the number of firms just under the threshold

 increased by 65 and 73 percent for private and foreign-owned firms, respectively. This finding

 resonates with the argument from private companies that the costs of disclosure are relatively

 higher because less information is already in the public domain. 14

         In Panel D, we examine in more detail the taxpaying status of firms reporting income just

below the disclosure threshold to learn more about the possible incentives to avoid disclosure.

Some interesting patterns emerge. For foreign-owned and public companies, firms reporting just

under the threshold are generally taxpaying firms, while for Australian private companies, there is

little difference in the composition of firms reporting income under the threshold in terms of

taxpaying status. Why would a public taxpaying firm potentially exert more effort to avoid

disclosure than a non-taxpaying firm? In the public firm setting (with foreign-owned firms as

private subsidiaries of public companies), this resonates with the notion that public firms face

pressure to reduce taxes and to maintain effective tax rates in line with competing firms.

3.3      Changing taxes paid



13
   When the legislation was passed on June 29, 2013 for the tax year from July 1, 2013 to June 30, 2014, all companies
filing a tax return in Australia with total income of 100 AUD million (about 75 USD million) or more anticipated
being subject to disclosure. Discussion of an exception for Australian private companies began on June 4, 2015. By
the time the 200 AUD million increased threshold was introduced, the tax return for 2014 was already filed.
14
   While we tabulate only 2013 and 2014 and only certain income groups to make the graph more manageable, the
ATO provided us with data from 2011-2014 for many different income categories. The average percentage year to
year change in this time period is 7, 9, and 8%, for foreign, private, and public firms, respectively. The standard
deviation for these percentage changes is 0.26, 0.23, and 0.39. In light of the mean and standard deviation of these
changes, the percentage changes in the 95-100 bin from 2013-2014 suggests the differences are significant.


                                                         14
       To examine H1b, we look at the taxpaying behavior of firms filing an Australian company

tax return in the years 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014 – the first year subject to disclosure.

Specifically, we focus on any changes in taxpaying behavior in 2014 for firms over the disclosure

threshold, relative to firms under the disclosure threshold. As before, we look separately at foreign-

owned, Australian private, and Australian public firms. Each panel in Figure 4 considers a different

measure of taxpaying behavior and as above, data are reported in aggregate.

       In Panel A, for firms subject to disclosure (i.e., over the threshold) there is a slight increase

in the percentage of firms paying no tax for foreign-owned and public firms, but a slight decrease

for private firms. For firms not subject to disclosure (i.e., under the threshold), there is a sizeable

decline in the percentage of firms paying no tax for public firms, and relatively little change in

foreign-owned and Australian private companies. Whether firms are subject to disclosure or not,

additional regulatory scrutiny by the ATO likely applied some pressure to remit tax for fear of

political backlash. However, in the public company setting, the pressure to reduce tax payments

by shareholders likely tempers that pressure, or even outweighs it, for some public firms subject

to public disclosure. Hence, we observe a pattern consistent with some public companies subject

to disclosure being less likely to start paying tax, rather than more likely.

       Panel B examines only taxpaying firms and considers increases in tax payments. We do

not observe strong patterns in the intensive margin of taxpaying firms consistent with pro-

compliance effects of public disclosure. Australian private and public firms appear to be

decreasing and increasing, respectively, tax payments over time, regardless of disclosure. The only

potential effect of disclosure is for foreign-owned companies, where the ratio increases slightly in

2014 for firms not subject to disclosure but decreases for firms subject to disclosure. As foreign-

owned companies are generally subsidiaries of public companies (e.g., Google Australia), this is



                                                  15
again consistent with investor pressure to reduce taxes in the public company setting. These data

patterns are consistent with—although certainly not dispositive of---private companies

anticipating a greater cost to disclosure than public companies precisely because they exhibit a

higher prevalence of both avoiding disclosure and increasing the amount of tax they pay (slightly

more so when they are subject to disclosure).

3.4      Other Changes in Firm Behavior

         While firms may avoid mandatory disclosure or may change their underlying tax behavior

so as to change the contents of the mandatory disclosure, in this section, we briefly discuss one

additional behavior firms may take—firms can supplement confusing mandatory disclosure with

clarifying voluntary disclosure (Guay et al. 2016). The limited time-period after these disclosure

events precludes an in-depth analysis of this effect, but we nevertheless describe some preliminary

analysis on this potential corporate response to mandatory public tax-return disclosure.15

         We start by examining the corporate communications from the ten largest firms that were

covered in the media as not having paid any tax, as arguably these firms would be most driven to

respond to the public disclosure. 16 We examine corporate press releases, annual reports, websites,

and do general Google searches for information from the firm. Of those ten firms, we find two

examples of changes in disclosure. 17 Next, we downloaded the most recent annual reports for the



15
   See Kays (2017) for additional work on Australian firms’ voluntary disclosure responses to the mandated disclosure.
16
   We obtained the list here: http://www.smh.com.au/business/the-economy/top-ten-australian-companies-paying-no-
tax-20151217-glpr80.html.
17
   Lendlease now hosts a website (http://www.lendlease.com/investor-centre/taxation/tax-disclosure/) that discusses
the ATO disclosure and provides some explanation for why Lendlease was disclosed as having paid no tax. While
Lendlease does provide this additional information, the reasons offered for owing no tax are very rudimentary.
Lendlease explained why it paid no tax by noting that “For FY15 Lendlease’s allowable tax deductions exceeded
taxable income for the year. This means Lendlease is in a ‘tax loss’ position in Australia.” It then went on to provide
some reasons why it had so many deductions. We also found evidence that Qantas, the largest non-tax payer that was
highlighted in many media articles, also included more tax information in its tax footnote in its annual report than it
had in the previous year. Qantas notes, in part that it “is committed to embedding risk management practices to support
the achievement of compliance objectives and fulfill corporate governance obligations… The Qantas Group has paid
all taxes that it owes and all tax compliance obligations are up to date. The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) has

                                                          16
Australian Securities Exchange 100 (ASX 100), and, examined what disclosures they made

regarding the ATO. We found four examples out of the 100 annual reports that specifically

mentioned the ATO disclosure regime, often mentioning how much in tax the firm paid. 18 Finally,

in general searching online, we have found other examples of disclosure clarifying the tax

payments.19 In summary, we find some evidence of companies attempting to explain to the public

and investors the ATO disclosures. Our analysis suggests, though, that the great majority of

companies did not react in this way. However, as stated, this disclosure regime is relatively new,

and more firms may, in time, start disclosing clarifications regarding the ATO disclosure.

         Finally, in May of 2016 the Australian Board of Taxation introduced the Voluntary Tax

Transparency Code to increase public disclosure of tax information by companies. 20 We find that

9 companies not subject to the mandatory disclosure regime adopted the voluntary code. 21 Of those

that were subject to the mandatory disclosure regime that adopted the Code, 15 of them were

foreign-owned and 50 were Australian public companies. We find that firms with a greater number

of subsidiaries and firms with a greater proportion of institutional shareholders were more likely

to adopt the voluntary code. Indeed, comments received from the ASX 100 in developing the

framework suggest that differences in consolidation for accounting and tax make it difficult for




advised that the Qantas Group is a key taxpayer continuing to have a ‘low’ likelihood of non-compliance.” It made
no such disclosure in prior years.
18
   For example, CIMIC noted “The Group is committed to managing all taxes in a sustainable manner regarding the
commercial and social imperatives of our business and stakeholders. The Group does not undertake purely tax driven
transactions,” and went on to remark that, according to the ATO disclosure, its tax payment was the 13th largest of any
firm in Australia. In another example, Tatts discloses that its most significant contribution to sustainability is “our
financial contribution to the broader community via our tax contribution…” It then breaks down taxes paid by state.
19
   Mirvac, for example, now maintains a document called “2016 Tax Corporate Governance Statement: Our Approach
to Tax,” where they note “Mirvac Limited did not pay any income tax in relation to the 2015 and 2016 financial years,
as its income was able to be offset by these historical tax losses.” On December 18, 2015, TechnologyOne issued a
press released that clarified “its effective tax rate in response to the ATO’s corporate tax transparency report,” and
notes that receipt of the R&D tax credit is partially responsible for their “effective tax rate being less than 30 per cent.”

investors to reconcile tax expense and tax payable. This suggests that firms increased voluntary

disclosure to help alleviate confusing mandatory disclosure and is consistent with the findings of

Guay et al. (2016), who find that managers use voluntary disclosures to help financial statement

users navigate complex financial statements.

4.     Does disclosure of tax information affect consumer sentiment?

4.1    Hypothesis development

       Whether and how tax disclosure affects consumer sentiment are important unanswered

questions (Hanlon and Heitzman 2010). Anecdotally, managers fear consumer backlash of the sort

that Starbucks experienced in the U.K. (Graham et al. 2014). However, Gallemore et al. (2014)

were unable to detect a decline in sales revenue or an increase in advertising expense following

adverse media coverage accusing firms of tax shelter involvement. In our setting, we are able to

take advantage of relatively high-frequency survey data that was not available for the annual or

quarterly-level tests conducted in the illegal tax shelter setting in Gallemore et al. (2014).

       Our setting also allows us to explore how information disseminated by the media about tax

avoidance affects consumers. Prior studies assume that only firms with a media report about tax

shelter use were accused of such an activity (Hanlon and Slemrod, 2009; Gallemore et al. 2014).

That is, the role of the media was to disseminate otherwise publicly available tax information,

lowering information acquisition costs (Dyreng et al. 2017). Kaniel and Parham (2017) describe a

channel through which the media impacts consumers called the “prominence channel”, whereby

the media increases visibility. We can explore this channel in the tax context because firms with

the same (publicly available) tax data experience negative media coverage, while others do not.

       The prominence channel is relevant here because it is not clear the extent to which

consumers looked at the disclosed information on the ATO website, read about the disclosures in



                                                  18
the media, or both. In the tax shelter setting, looking directly at the information required tedious

searches of court documents. Here, looking directly at the information was relatively easy – the

ATO publicly posted the data on a widely accessed webpage. Indeed, usage statistics indicate that

the information was viewed over 13,000 times in December of 2015 (the release month of public

and foreign-owned firm data) and over 6,000 times in March of 2016 (the release month of private

firm data), and was one of the most widely accessed datasets the Australian government provides

to the public.22 Figure 5 shows that these usage statistics are significant relative to other months.

While some views constitute stakeholders other than consumers, the fact the data about private

firms was widely accessed suggests some consumers viewed the data.

           With this background, we first consider whether being subject to disclosure has a negative

effect on sentiment. Being subject to disclosure raises the level of scrutiny that consumers might

consider a negative signal about the firm. Moreover, if consumers are unaware of the legislative

details regarding which firms were selected for disclosure, being subject to disclosure could be

interpreted as selective regulatory scrutiny. Our first hypothesis is:

              H2a. Consumer sentiment is unchanged for firms subject to public disclosure.

           Next we consider whether, conditional on being subject to disclosure, there is a differential

effect on sentiment for companies that are revealed to have paid no tax. One notable and easily

accessible piece of information (i.e., no calculations are required) in the data was the zero tax

liability reported by a large number of firms. Given that a zero tax liability in Australia for many

firms does not necessarily indicate aggressive tax avoidance, relative to, for instance, being

accused of tax shelter involvement, a decline in sentiment would suggest that some firms unfairly

experienced costs to public disclosure. Our second hypothesis is:



22
     See https://data.gov.au/site-usage/dataset?month=&publisher=australiantaxationoffice for usage statistics.

                                                            19
H2b. Consumer sentiment is unchanged for firms subject to public disclosure of no tax payments.

         Finally, we consider whether, conditional on being subject to disclosure, negative media

coverage affects sentiment. It was relatively straightforward to access the data directly, but if

consumers learned of firms’ tax data from media coverage, or if media visibility impacts consumer

sentiment, then we may observe a decline in sentiment only for those firms highlighted specifically

by name in a major news source. Thus, our third hypothesis is:

      H2c. Consumer sentiment is unchanged for firms experiencing negative media coverage.

         To test these hypotheses, we analyze two data sources. The first is data from YouGov, an

international market research firm that monitors sentiment daily for thousands of well-known

brands across the world using online surveys. The second is data from a survey designed by us and

executed by TurkPrime in Australia. Using these datasets, we examine changes in consumer

sentiment surrounding the tax disclosure events in Australia in December, 2015 and March, 2016.

4.2      Data and empirical tests – YouGov data

         We obtain daily YouGov data at the respondent-level for 230 brands in Australia from June

of 2015 to June of 2016 to examine the December 2015 disclosure event. As YouGov covers large,

international brands, and the December disclosure includes the largest foreign-owned and listed

firms, the YouGov data are suitable for examining public firms. Our sample includes the panel of

brands covered by YouGov in December 2015, retaining brand/day observations with at least 30

respondents for November 2015 through January 2016. Table 4, Panel A displays the descriptive

statistics for this sample. There are 218,087 survey respondent/day/brand observations, with




                                                  20
159,256 of those observations representing brands owned by firms subject to disclosure. To

examine H1a, we estimate the following difference-in-difference specification:23

        YouGov Measure = β0 + β1December 17, 2015 + β2Subject to Disclosure x
              December 17, 2015 + Firm Fixed Effects + ε                                                (1a),

where YouGov Measure is either Reputation, Impression, or Buzz. Reputation (Impression) equals

-1 if the brand had a negative reputation (impression), 0 if it had neither a negative nor a positive

reputation (impression), and +1 if it had a positive reputation (impression).24 Buzz is -1 if over the

last two weeks they heard anything negative about the brand, 0 if they heard nothing, and +1 if

they heard something positive. December 17, 2015 is 1 for December 17, 18 or 19, 2015, and 0

otherwise. Subject to Disclosure is equal to 1 if the firm was subject to disclosure, and 0 otherwise.

The coefficient β2 captures the change in sentiment following public disclosure for firms subject

to disclosure, relative to other firms. To examine H1b, we estimate the following:

        YouGov Measure = β0 + β1December 17, 2015 + β2Paid No Tax x
              December 17, 2015 + Firm Fixed Effects + ε                                                (1b),

where YouGov Measure and December 17, 2015 are as defined above and Paid No Tax is equal to

1 if the brand owner was disclosed as having paid no tax, and 0 otherwise. We estimate Equation

(1b) in the sample of firms for which Subject to Disclosure equals 1, so the coefficient β2 captures

the change in sentiment following public disclosure of no tax paid, relative to public disclosure of

a paid some tax. To examine H1c, we estimate the following:

         YouGov Measure = β0 + β1December 17, 2015 + β2Covered by Media x
              December 17, 2015 + Firm Fixed Effects + ε                                                (1c),




23
   Because respondents might provide responses for multiple brands, we cluster standard errors at the respondent-
level. As we include firm fixed effects, we do not include any firm-specific time-invariant indicator variables.
24
   Reputation and Impression have a correlation of 0.50 across the population of YouGov data. Reputation captures
what the respondent believes others think of the brand, while Impression captures what the respondent thinks.

where all variables are defined previously except Covered by Media, which equals 1 if the firm

experienced negative media coverage in a major Australian news source, and 0 otherwise.25 We

also estimate Equation (1c) in the sample of firms for which Subject to Disclosure equals 1, so the

coefficient β2 captures the change in sentiment following negative media coverage, relative to no

(less prominent) media coverage.

         Panel B of Table 4 tabulates the estimation results. Across all three dependent variables,

we fail to document a significant effect, consistent with this disclosure event in Australia not

meaningfully changing consumer sentiment. Thus, we are unable to reject any of our stated null

hypotheses in a sample of relatively large firms with strong global brands. This result may reflect

that for large, influential brands public perception is not easily shaken or that there was already a

widespread belief that these firms did not pay their “fair share” of taxes, and thus the disclosure

did not constitute “new news.” Interestingly, we fail to find a significant result in Column 9, where

firms are literally receiving more Buzz suggesting not all consumers are heavily influenced by the

media. In any case, these results line up with those reported in Section 3 where we fail to see public

firms increasing tax payments, which we would expect to see if firms experienced high costs to

public scrutiny of not paying tax from consumer backlash.

4.3      Data and empirical tests – TurkPrime data

         As   YouGov captures large, global brands, the data are not suitable for learning about the

impact of tax disclosure on consumer sentiment regarding smaller, private, firms. Therefore, we




25
  Coverage of this disclosure event in Australia occurred in a number of ways including Twitter, blogs, etc. Consistent
with prior literature, we focus on major news sources. Specifically, we search Factiva, in Australia, on December 17th
and 18th, for news types “Corporate/Industrial News”, “Political/General News”, or “Selection of Top
Stories/Trends/Analysis,” in the highest circulating newspapers (Herald-Sun, Daily Telegraph, Courier Mail, The
Sydney Morning Herald, and The West Australian), plus the Australian Broadcast Corporation, for the search string
(ATO OR “paid no tax”). We then read the resulting articles and recorded the names of firms/brands we judged to
have received negative coverage in the media. The notes from this exercise are available from the authors upon request.

                                                          22
administered a survey in Australia through TurkPrime, Amazon’s online platform, surrounding the

March 22, 2016 disclosure to examine changes in sentiment about generally smaller Australian

private firms. We asked Australians about their impression of 30 firms on two separate days prior

to the March 22 disclosure (March 17 and 20) and three separate days after (March 23 and 27, and

April 21). TurkPrime ensured a minimum of 1,400 respondents for each date. The number of

responses per firm varies depending on the level of familiarity respondents have with that firm and

whether, conditional upon familiarity with the firm, they answered all the questions. No respondent

participated more than once. Our sample appears to be reflective of the Australian population. 26

        Because we had to design the survey before we learned which companies would be subject

to disclosure, selecting the sample for the survey was not straightforward. We chose the 30

Australian private companies for our survey in two steps. First, we collected information on

financial accounting sales from the BvD Orbis database and selected the largest 100 private firms.

Second, we ran an initial survey to gauge familiarity with these 100 firms, and retained the 30

firms on the list with the highest level of familiarity. For up to 15 companies with which a

respondent was familiar, we asked the following questions, across the five survey dates:

        (1) In your personal opinion, how favorable is your perception of X?
        (2) Assuming you were in a position to need to do business with a company like X, how
            likely is it that you would do business with X, instead of one of its competitors?
        (3) How ethical do you think X is?
        (4) Do you feel that X pays as much in taxes as it should?
        (5) Have you heard of any recent scandals involving X?”




26  Based on observable information, our respondents appear representative of the general Australian population.
According to the Australia Bureau of Statistics,
 http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/0/151AA7593B394934CA2573210018DA4A?Opendocument
49.7 percent of Australians are male and in our sample 49.5 percent are male. Using the midpoint of a range for age
(e.g., respondents who answered they are between 20 and 29 are assumed to be 25), the average age of our respondents
is 36, whereas the median age in Australia is 37.4. Finally, respondents had average income of 75,000 AUD, whereas
average income in Australia is 81,920 AUD (http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/6302.0).

                                                        23
       We measure General Perception, Willing to do Business, Ethical Perception, and Pays

Sufficient Tax along a seven-point Likert scale for questions (1) through (4), respectively (Likert

1932). A response of 1 indicates “Not Favorable”, “Not Likely”, “Not Ethical”, or “No” while a

response of 7 indicates “Very Favorable”, “Very Likely” “Very Ethical” or “Yes”. For question

(5), we measure Heard of Scandal as an indicator variable equal to 1 if the respondent indicates

they have heard of a recent scandal involving the firm, and 0 otherwise. Table 4 Panel A provides

descriptive statistics for the data. To test H2a, we estimate a difference-in-difference specification:

       TurkPrime Measure = β0 + β1March 22, 2016 + β2Subject to Disclosure
             + β3March 22, 2016 X Subject to Disclosure + ε                                    (2),

where TurkPrime Measure is either General Perception, Willing to do Business, Ethical

Perception, Pay Sufficient Tax, or Heard of Scandal. The variable March 22, 2016 is equal to 1

for survey responses after the disclosure, and 0 otherwise. Subject to Disclosure is equal to 1 if the

firm was subject to disclosure, and 0 otherwise. We cluster standard errors by firm and respondent.

In Equation (2), the coefficient β3 captures the change in consumer sentiment following public

disclosure for firms subject to disclosure, relative to firms not subject to disclosure.

       While we would ideally be able to test H2b and H2c with the TurkPrime data, data

limitations preclude these tests. Instead we predict, based on public data, which firms would be

disclosed and, among those, which would be disclosed as having paid no tax or be subject to media

coverage. This is because we needed to administer the first two rounds of our survey prior to the

disclosure data’s release. In the event, our predictions were imperfect, as only one company subject

to disclosure in our survey paid no tax or was subject to media scrutiny, providing insufficient

variation. As a result, we cannot rigorously test H2b or H2c with the TurkPrime data.

       We present the results of estimating Equation (2) that tests H2a in Table 5. The estimated

coefficient on the interaction term is negative and statistically significant in Columns 1 through 4.


                                                  24
This result is consistent with consumers interpreting firms’ inclusion in the disclosure regulation,

and the resulting increase in scrutiny, negatively. Taken together with our earlier results from the

YouGov data, consumer sentiment surrounding tax disclosure appears more fragile for relatively

smaller firms. In Column 5, whether the respondent has heard of the firm being involved in a

scandal increases after the disclosure, but—surprisingly—not more so for firms subject to

disclosure. This possibly reflects many of the headlines in the media referring to companies paying

no Australia tax, rather than naming specific firms. These results are consistent with the patterns

observed in Section 3, whereby private firms appear more eager to avoid disclosure and increase

tax payments than public firms, most likely to temper, at least in part, consumer backlash.

5.     Does disclosure of tax information affect equity prices?

5.1    Hypothesis development

       Much of the existing literature on tax avoidance focuses on how shareholders of public

firms view tax avoidance. The public firm setting is complicated by the fact that tax reporting

decisions occur in a principal-agent framework (Crocker and Slemrod 2005). Managers have

private information about the availability of legal avenues for tax reduction, so incentives are often

aligned through complex compensation contracts. As residual claimants, it is in the shareholders’

best interest for the manager to engage in some level of tax avoidance, net of any costs of doing

so. These may be direct costs arising from settling tax disputes, or they may be indirect costs, such

as those from consumer backlash (declines in sentiment), political backlash (changes in tax rules

or regulation), or a decline in the optimal amount of tax avoidance in the absence of disclosure.

       Public disclosure of tax information has the potential both to increase costs of tax

avoidance and reduce private information. Consequently, a priori public disclosure may have

either negative or positive effects to shareholders. Consider, for instance, that in addition to the



                                                 25
potential decline in consumer sentiment described earlier, investors might also anticipate a policy

backlash that is harmful to the firm. Indeed, the statistics ultimately generated by the disclosure

event--that more than one-third of firms remitted no tax--apparently resonated with some portion

of the Australian public, and certainly played a role in the political debate over corporate tax

reform.27 Alternatively, investors may learn something new about the firm’s tax reporting due to,

for instance, the low level of convergence in Australia between accounting income and taxable

income (Alford et al. 1993), reducing agency costs (Desai and Dharmapala 2006) .

         Which effect dominates is an empirical question and depends on many things including the

amount of backlash the firm experiences (or, is expected to experience), whether any new

information revealed to investors about the firm’s tax reporting decisions is positive or negative,

and how firms respond (or are expected to respond). Existing research has detected a small, short-

term, negative market reaction to news of tax shelter involvement (Hanlon and Slemrod 2009;

Gallemore et al. 2014). However, a zero tax liability does not carry the same negative connotation

as tax shelter involvement, does not necessarily involve future payments for fines or penalties, nor

does it necessarily constitute new information. Financial accounting information serves as a proxy

for the level of tax payments by the firm, and is already publicly available.

         We search for a reaction by investors by examining stock returns in the 3-day window

surrounding two key dates – April 3, 2013 and December 17, 2015. Searching for a response across

both dates allows us, in part, to separate out some of the key factors described above. For instance,



27
  For example, The West Australian carried a story on December 18, 2015 headlined “Pressure on for company tax
reform” that noted how the disclosure was pressuring the Turnbull Liberal Party government to reform the corporate
tax law. Labor unions referenced the statistic to criticize corporations (International Transport Workers’ Federation
2016; Australian Council of Trade Unions 2016). Tax activist groups used the statistic to encourage tax reform
(GetUp! 2016; Oxfam 2016). The disclosure has been tied to talk of criminalization of some forms of tax planning,
including using jail sentences as punishment (Passant 2016). And, perhaps most importantly, the statistic has been
referred to in advocating for tax reform legislation (e.g., Leigh 2016a; Leigh 2016b; Ludwig 2016; Wardell 2016).


                                                         26
April 3, 2013 was when the intent to pass legislation was announced, along with the details of how

firms would be selected for disclosure; however, no tax information about firms was disclosed.

December 17, 2015 was the date on which tax information was first disclosed. Therefore, results

from our April tests cannot be attributed to the arrival of new information.

         H3a: Equity prices are unchanged following anticipation of public tax disclosure.

         H3b: Equity prices are unchanged following public tax disclosure.

5.2      Data and empirical tests – April 3, 2013

         As no information was disclosed on April 3, in order to react appropriately to the new

legislation, investors needed to predict which firms would ultimately be subject to disclosure.

Moreover, to anticipate costs of disclosure, investors would also need to predict the content of the

disclosure. For consistency, we assume in these tests that investors focus on what the media

ultimately highlighted after the disclosure event--no-tax companies.28 We also assume that

financial accounting data is used by investors to predict which firms would be subject to disclosure

and whether the firm would be disclosed as a firm that pays no tax. 29 To test H3a, we estimate the

following regression equation during the period March 1 to May 31 of 2013:

         Three Day Buy and Hold Return = β0 + β1Paid No Tax + β2April 3, 2013
                + β3Paid No Tax x April 3, 2013                                                                    (3a),

where Three Day Buy and Hold Return is, unsurprisingly, the three-day buy-and-hold return. April

3, 2013 is equal to 1 for April 3, and 0 otherwise. Paid No Tax is equal to 1 if the firm had zero

tax expense in fiscal 2012, and 0 otherwise. We cluster standard errors by calendar date. As the




28
   Note that a zero tax liability is often the focus of media coverage, particularly in the context of tax payments in a
single, relatively high-tax, country – e.g., a typical story headline covering the Starbucks affair in the U.K. read, “Good
bean counters? Starbucks has paid no tax in UK since 2009” (Hickman 2012).
29
   Financial accounting Sales in Orbis is assumed to be the market’s proxy for Total Income on the tax return. The
correlation between Financial Accounting Tax Expense in Orbis, the market’s proxy for Tax Payable on the tax return,
and actual Tax Payable in the ATO data is 0.79.

                                                            27
disclosure threshold is based on income, which is highly correlated with size, any economy-wide

factor that affected large firms differently from small firms could spuriously manifest on the date

of the disclosure. To address this issue, we use a sample of firms most likely to be subject to

disclosure, and examine the stock price behavior of firms likely to be disclosed as paying no tax. 30

         We report the results of estimating Equation (3a) in Table 5, Panel B. The estimated

negative interaction term in Column 1 implies that firms with zero financial accounting tax

expense reported in the prior period had three-day returns surrounding the April 3 event date that

were 1.18 percentage points lower than other firms. This suggests that investors anticipated

relatively higher costs of disclosure for the set of firms likely to be disclosed as not paying tax.

         In the remaining columns of Panel B, we report the results of cross-sectional tests of

response heterogeneity with respect to indicators of these potential costs in order to shed light on

whether it is the anticipation of higher costs to disclosure driving the result reported in Column 1.

First, we consider group complexity, measured by the number of legal entities in the group from

the BvD Orbis data. As highlighted by the ATO, a significant difference between book and tax

accounting arises in consolidation. The ATO report notes that “disclosed information will be at

the corporate tax entity level; however, these entities may not represent economic groups, and

some economic groups contain two or more tax groups and other non-consolidated entities within

them.”31 Companies with larger groups could experience relatively higher costs from anticipated



30
   We find similar results across other specifications. For instance, when we look at the effect of being subject to
disclosure, there is a significantly negative market response. We also control for size, and analyze only those firms
right around the disclosure threshold – both of these specifications produce similar results to those that we report.
These results are available from the authors upon request.
31
   Also in the ATO report: “Entities listed in Report of entity tax information may not be directly comparable to entities
reporting as financial groups under corporation law. Many economic groups are made up of multiple entities and lodge
returns for each entity in the group, even though they may all be included in one set of financial statements. This can
also result in the tax being paid by one entity in the group, for the whole group, and others in the group showing nil
tax payable.” See https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Large-business/In-detail/Tax-transparency/Tax-transparency--
reporting-of-entity-tax-information/

                                                           28
disclosure if book-tax diffferences concern consumers, regulators, or politicians. Alternatively,

firms with more complex groups may have greater ability to influence the likelihood of disclosure

through restructuring and intercompany transactions, lowering the costs of the new rules. In

Column 2, the point estimate is not statistically significant.

       Second, we consider the proportion of institutional investors, a common proxy for investor

sophistication (Bartov et al. 2000). As described earlier, the potential impact to firms from the new

disclosure regime in Australia is quite nuanced, and was surely difficult to assess early on.

However, Chen (2016) documents a significant amount of negative media coverage surrounding

the April 3, 2013 legislative date arguing that disclosure would be costly for firms. We expect that

negative media coverage is less likely to influence the analysis of a sophisticated investor.

Therefore, our prior was that institutional investors anticipated lower costs of disclosure. In

Column 3, we report a significantly positive coefficient for firms with more institutional

shareholders (0.0137), consistent with our expectations. This result is also consistent with our

inability to document, on average, a sizable decline in consumer sentiment for public firms in

Section 4, or a change in firm behavior in Section 3 suggesting that firms themselves anticipated

a no-tax disclosure to be costly.

       Third, we consider brand value, measured as a binary variable indicating YouGov

coverage. Naturally, YouGov polls consumers about brands owned by firms concerned about

brand image. On the one hand, these firms could experience relatively higher costs to disclosure

from greater consumer backlash. On the other hand, consistent with our inability to find any

decline in consumer sentiment in Section 3 in our YouGov sample, these firms may experience

relatively lower costs to disclosure because these brands are so well established. In Column 4, we




                                                  29
report a significantly positive coefficient for firms covered by YouGov (0.0088), suggesting that

the latter effect dominates.

5.3      Data and empirical tests – December 17, 2015

         Next, we examine the market reaction to the actual disclosure event. As in our prior tests,

reaction surrounding the disclosure could arise from changes in expected costs of disclosure.

Unlike our prior tests, however, here investors could also react to the arrival of new information

about firms’ tax situation. To test H3b, we estimate the following specification during the period

November 1, 2015 – January 31, 2016:

         Three Day Buy and Hold Return = β0 + β1Paid No Tax + β2 December 17, 2015
         + β3Paid No Tax X December 17, 2015                                                                    (3b),

The variable December 17, 2015 is equal to 1 for December 17, and 0 otherwise.32 To capture the

new information about no-tax liability contained in the disclosure, we code Paid No Tax equal to

1 if the firm is disclosed as a no-tax firm but had positive zero financial accounting tax expense

reported in the prior period. We report the results of estimating Equation (3a) in Table 5 Panel C.

         In Column 1, we report a small, but statistically significant, negative response to Paid No

Tax for firms subject to disclosure. This result arises either from investors interpreting the new tax

information negatively, consistent with agency costs (Desai and Dharmapala 2006), or from beliefs

that backlash to the firm would be greater than anticipated.33 To separate out the potential channels,




32
   In robustness analysis, we expand the date window, and set the date indicator equal to one for December 16, 17 and
18; our main result, the negative coefficient in Column 1 of Table 6, Panel C becomes indistinguishable from zero.
This could be because increasing the window to include days where investors were not actively pricing the disclosure
simply adds noise to the regression result, or could be because of a return reversal as investors decide they overreacted.
To test for overreaction, we set the date indicator equal to one for December 21 and 22 (December 19 and 20 are
Saturday and Sunday), and find that the coefficient on December 21 and 22 x Paid No Tax is not significantly different
from zero, failing to support the possibility of a return reversal. Details are available from the authors.
33
   To avoid estimation problems that firms near the threshold of disclosure cause, we also estimated the regressions
eliminating the 10 firms closest to the threshold, and the results are qualitatively unchanged.

                                                           30
we run the same cross-sectional tests as before. 34 In Column 2, we again fail to find any significant

effect attributable to group complexity. In Column 3, we report a large positive response to a no-

tax disclosure for firms with less sophisticated investors and a small negative response for firms

with more sophisticated investors. The large response by less sophisticated investors suggests they

are more likely to use financial accounting information as a proxy for tax information, and thus,

there is more ‘news’ in the disclosure. Moreover, the news is positive, suggesting they think less

about agency costs of tax avoidance than more sophisticated investors. Indeed, Khan, Srinivasan,

and Tan (2017) recently find evidence consistent with institutional investors encouraging tax

avoidance. Finally, in Column 4, we find evidence that the negative response to the actual

disclosure of no-tax paid is concentrated in the YouGov sample.35 As we find no evidence of an

actual decline in consumer sentiment surrounding the disclosure, it is more likely that investors

are anticipating a greater level of political backlash to large, well-known firms.

6.       Conclusions

         There is currently widespread pressure for action to limit perceived harmful tax practices

by businesses. One response has been to increase the amount of information available to taxing

authorities for enforcement, while another is to improve accountability and compliance with

disclosure to the public. The latter response is of particular concern to firm managers fearing that




34
   We argue that we are able to separate out the new information channel from the beliefs about indirect costs in these
tests because, for instance, we see no good reason why more versus less sophisticated investors would form
significantly different beliefs about backlash around the actual disclosure because backlash is now observable.
Moreover, we see no reason why investors in YouGov firms would form different opinions about the new information
contained in the disclsoure than investors in non-YouGov firms.
35
   One concern expressed by some Australian firms was that firms that validly paid no tax because they actually earned
no income would be perceived as avoiding tax. It is difficult to tell from the ATO data which firms paid no tax for
valid reasons, and which did not. However, in a sample of only firms that had no taxable income that remitted no tax,
we continue to find a small, negative reaction on the date of the disclosure for firms that paid no tax, suggesting that
the market punished even those that potentially had valid reasons for paying no tax. We do not conduct this test for
our survey-based tests, as we do not believe it is plausible that Australian consumers would be able to differentiate
between a firm paying no tax because it has no income, and paying no tax for other reasons.

                                                          31
the costs of public disclosure will outweigh the benefits. For instance, transparency can potentially

create compliance burdens, divulge sensitive information, generate confusion about company

behavior, and impose reputational damage on firms. Policy discussions generally proceed in a

near-absence of evidence of the effects of disclosure.

       Our paper seeks to fill this void by considering the recent episode wherein the ATO

disclosed firm-level data from Australian company tax returns, including income and taxes

payable, for listed and private firms. We analyze changes in firm behavior, consumer sentiment,

and share prices. Our results suggest that private companies took more action to avoid disclosure,

and the effect of disclosure appears to have raised the tax payments of private companies but

lowered the tax payments of public companies, consistent with differences in disclosure costs.

Relatedly, private firms experienced a small decline in consumer sentiment, suggesting that

expectations of consumer backlash motivated some private firms to avoid disclosure. Finally, we

find a small negative investor reaction to both anticipated and actual disclosure. Cross-sectional

tests point to anticipated policy backlash resulting in changes to the tax code as the likely source

of a reaction. For instance, Australia introduced a diverted profits tax, effective on July 1, 2017.

The momentum for this was clearly intensified by public scrutiny of tax information.

       Our paper contributes to the literature examining the costs and consequences of public tax-

return information, including how specific implementation rules may affect disclosure outcomes.

Further, our paper contributes to the growing literature on taxes and reputation. Surveys of tax

directors have found that one pervasive fear associated with tax planning is garnering negative

attention. Relatedly, several studies have searched for evidence on reputational consequences

associated with tax shelter involvement. Our study shows that there can be costs to disclosure

outside of the tax shelter context – i.e., even when firms may be obeying the law.

Figure 2. Starbuck’s Buzz Score in the UK from May 2012 through June 2013




Notes. Figure 2 reports Starbuck’s Buzz Score. YouGov’s Buzz score for a brand measures whether people have heard
anything positive or negative about the brand in the media or via word of mouth. Specifically, Buzz Score is positive
(negative) if the consumer indicated “Over the PAST TWO WEEKS, which of the following brands have you heard
something POSITIVE (NEGATIVE) about (whether in the news, through advertising, or talking to friends and
family)”. Three key dates (indicated by the vertical lines) related to allegations of tax avoidance by Starbucks in the
UK are: (1) October 15, 2012: Reuter’s published a news article exposing some of Starbuck’s international tax
arrangements, (2) November 12, 2012: Starbucks executives appeared before the Public Accounts Committee; (3)
December 6, 2012: Starbucks announced that it intends to remit £20 million U.K. tax, but admits no wrongdoing.

Notes. This table shows the sample composition of firms included in the ATO disclosure of tax return data in
December (Australian public and foreign-owned) and in March (Australian private). We rely on BvD Orbis data to
identify Australian public firms (of the 1,859 firms in the ATO data we are not able to match 5 to Orbis). TI is Taxable
Income. TP is Tax Payable. The Effective Tax Rate is the ratio of Tax Payable/Taxable Income. Total Income is the
tax return data item on which the disclosure thresholds were based. Dollar amounts are in millions.

Notes. General Perception, Willing to do Business, Ethical Perception, and Pays Sufficient Tax are measured using a seven point Likert scale according to how
respondents answered questions (1) through (4), respectively. A response of 1 indicates “Not Favorable”, “Not Likely”, “Not Ethical”, or “No” while a response
of 7 indicates “Very Favorable”, “Very Likely” “Very Ethical” or “Yes” depending on the question being asked. Question (1): In your personal opinion, how
favorable is your perception of X? Question (2): Assuming you were in a position to need to do business with a company like X, how likely is it that you would do
business with X, instead of one of its competitors? Question (3): How ethical do you think X is? Question (4): Do you feel that X pays as much in taxes as it
should? We measure Heard of Scandal as an indicator variable equal to 1 if the respondent indicates that they have heard of a recent scandal involving the company,
and 0 otherwise. March 22, 2016 is equal to 1 for survey responses collected after the March 22, 2016 disclosure, and 0 otherwise. Subject to Disclosure is equal
to 1 if the firm’s tax return data was included in the March 22, 2016 disclosure, and 0 otherwise.
