                                              ABSTRACT

This paper studies growth and structural transformation of the Chinese economy from 1953 to 2012
through a lens of a two-sector growth model. The main goal of the paper is to provide a systematic
analysis of both the pre-1978 reform and post-1978 reform periods in a unified framework. First, we
construct a dataset that allows the application of the neoclassical model and computation of wedges,
their components, and rates of TFP growth. Second, we determine the key quantitative factors behind
growth and structural transformation. The changes in the intersectoral labor wedge play the dominant
role in accounting for the change in the share of labor force in agriculture. TFP growth and changes
in the intersectoral wedges are the two most significant factors contributing to GDP growth. Further
decomposing the effects of reduction in wedges, we find that two components: the production component
(the gap between the ratio of the marginal products of labor and relative wages) and the consumption
component (the gap between the marginal rate of substitution and the relative prices) play a particularly
large role. Third, we use the pre-reform period as a key benchmark to measure the success of the post-1978
reforms. We show that reforms yielded a significant growth and structural transformation differential.
GDP growth is 4.2 percentage points higher and the share of the labor force in agriculture is 23.9 percentage
points lower compared with the continuation of the pre-1978 policies. We provide extensive historical
evidence for the reforms that are consistent with the evolution of the components of the wedges. The
decrease in the production component of the intersectoral wedge is consistent with increased competition
and demonopolization of the economy. The decrease in the consumption component of the wedge
is consistent with the price and housing reforms. Finally, we project the path of the Chinese economy
until 2050 and also calculate a lower bound on future growth by projecting pre-reform trends.

    “In 1949 a new stage was reached in the endeavors of successive Chinese elites to meet do-
mestic problems inherited from the Late Imperial era and to respond to the century-old challenge
posed by the industrialized West. A central government had now gained full control of the Chi-
nese mainland, thus achieving the national unity so long desired. Moreover, it was committed
for the first time to the overall modernization of the nation’s polity, economy, and society. The
history of the succeeding decades is of the most massive experiment in social engineering the
world has ever witnessed.” (MacFarquhar and Fairbank 1987, p. xiii)


1    Introduction

We study the Chinese economy from 1953, three years after the founding of the People’s Re-
public of China, through the lens of a two-sector neoclassical growth model.1 Our main focus
is on studying wedges that hinder reallocation of resources across sectors and the changes of
these wedges that are important for structural transformation.2 The main goal of the paper is
to provide a systematic analysis of both the pre-1978 reform and the post-reform periods in a
unified framework.
    Specifically, our model is a two-sector (agricultural and non-agricultural) neoclassical model
with wedges building on Cole and Ohanian (2004), Chari, Kehoe, McGrattan (2007) and Chere-
mukhin, Golosov, Guriev, and Tsyvinski (2013). The intratemporal labor wedge is the cost of
intersectoral reallocation of labor. The intratemporal capital wedge is the cost of intersec-
toral reallocation of capital. The intertemporal capital wedge is the cost of reallocating capital
across time. We further decompose the intersectoral labor wedge in three components: the
consumption component (the ratio of the relative prices and the marginal rate of substitution),
the production component (the ratio of the sectoral marginal products of labor relative to the
sectoral wages), and the mobility component (the ratio of the sectoral wages). We similarly
decompose the intersectoral capital wedge into its components.
    We construct a comprehensive dataset that allows the application of the neoclassical model
to the study of the entire 1953-2012 period. We provide consistent data series for sectoral
   1
     Our analysis takes as an initial point the year of 1953 — after the Communist Party consolidated power
and launched a comprehensive modernization of economy and society. Coincidentally, this is also the start of
the systematic collection of detailed economic statistics.

     See Acemoglu (2008) and Herrendorf, Rogerson and Valentinyi (2013) for overview of the models of structural
transformation. Caselli and Coleman (2001), Fernald and Neiman (2010), Restuccia, Yang and Zhu (2008), and
Lagakos and Waugh (2013) are models with sector-specific wedges.

output, capital and labor, wages, deflators, and relative prices as well as defense spending and
international trade variables. Using this dataset we then infer the wedges (and other variables
such as sectoral TFPs) from the computed first order conditions of the model. Given the
wedges, the neoclassical model matches the data exactly. We view the construction of the
dataset that can be easily used for computations of the neoclassical model and for inferring the
wedges and their components as the first contribution of the paper.
       We start our analysis with the pre-1978 reform economy. This period is important to study
for several reasons. First, 1953-1978 was one of the largest economic policy experiments and
development programs in modern history. It is important to evaluate the overall success or
failure of this program as well as successes and failures of the contributing factors and policies.
Second, the analysis of the 1953-1978 period is an important benchmark against which the
post-1978 growth and the success of the reforms should be measured. The main question
here is how the Chinese economy would have developed if the pre-reform policies continued.
Thirdly, the successful First Five-Year Plan (FFYP), the Great Leap Forward (GLF), and the
post-1962 period of readjustment, recovery, and political turmoil provide a range of interesting
policies on their own. On one hand, the model of Chinese development was based on Soviet
Industrialization which we studied in Cheremukhin, et al. (2013). On the other hand, the
Chinese policies were quite distinct from their Soviet counterparts. We evaluate several of
these policies and contrast them with the Soviet experience.
       The first part of the analysis is to perform a wedge-accounting exercise for the entire pre-
reform period to determine the main factors behind GDP growth and changes in the share of
labor force in agriculture. We fix wedges at their initial values (1953) for the whole period of
interest (1953-75) and simulate the economy3 . We then compare the simulated GDP growth
and the change in the share of labor force in agriculture with the actual historical path. Con-
sider wedge accounting for 1953-1975. Compared with the counterfactual, the annual growth
rate of GDP increased by 5.6 percentage points, and the share of labor in agriculture decreased
by 5.9 percentage points. For GDP growth, the two most important factors were the growth of
non-agricultural TFP (contributing 1.9 percentage points) and the decrease in the consumption
component of the labor wedge (contributing 1.6 percentage points). The rest of the wedges
   3
    The analysis for 1953-1978 delivers similar insights and only differs in a larger change in the share of labor
in agriculture in 1975-1978.

worsened and contributed negatively to the growth of GDP. Overall, the worsening of wedges
resulted in 0.5 percentage points reduction in the annual GDP growth. The change in the
share of labor force in agriculture (-5.9 percentage points) is essentially fully determined by
the decrease in the consumption component of the labor wedge (contributing -7.8 percentage
points). While these are the numbers for the pre-reform period overall, changes in the inter-
sectoral labor wedge played an even more significant role in GDP growth and changes in the
share of labor force in agriculture during the Great Leap Forward and the subsequent recovery.
   We also contrast the development of the Chinese economy from the beginning of the Great
Leap Forward to 1967 with the development of the Soviet economy under Stalin’s industrial-
ization. If China followed Soviet industrialization and collectivization policies the results in
terms of GDP growth would be comparable to a combination of the Great Leap Forward and
the post-1962 retrenchment but the share of labor in agriculture would have been lower under
Soviet policies. The quick reversal of the policies under the Great Leap Forward led to a signif-
icantly higher labor wedge in China but coincided with the recovery of the losses in agricultural
and non-agricultural TFP.
   We then study the 1978-2012 period through the lens of our model. We first perform a
wedge-accounting exercise for the period of 1978-2012. Compared with the counterfactual of
fixed 1978 wedges and no TFP growth, the annual GDP growth rate increased by 9.4 per-
centage points and the share of labor force in agriculture decreased by 36.9 percentage points.
For GDP growth, two most important factors were the growth of non-agricultural TFP (con-
tributing 5.8 percentage points) and the decrease in the intersectoral wedge (contributing 1.1
percentage points). Agricultural TFP contributed 0.8 percentage points. Two components of
the labor wedge played the key role – the decrease in the consumption component (contribut-
ing 0.5 percentage points) and the production component (contributing 0.7 percentage points).
Together these two components account for 1.2 percentage points of the annual GDP growth.
The change in the mobility component of the intersectoral labor wedge, the intersectoral capital
wedge net of consumption component, and intertemporal capital wedge play a minor role. The
change in the share of labor in agriculture is predominantly determined by the decrease in the
intersectoral wedges (contributing -21.6 percentage points). Two components play the key role
– the consumption component (contributing -10.6 percentage points) and the production com-
ponent (contributing -16.7 percentage points). These two components play the same role as the


                                               3
increase in manufacturing TFP (contributing -10.6 percentage points) and agricultural TFP
(contributing -12.2 percentage points). The worsening in the mobility component accounted
for 6.7 percentage points of the change in the share of labor force in agriculture. We conclude
that more than 50 percent of the GDP growth is explained by growth of non-agricultural TFP
and 11 percent are explained by the decline in the consumption and the production component
of the intersectoral wedges. The key factors behind the change of the share of labor force in
agriculture are the reduction in intersectoral wedges and TFP growth in equal measures.
   Second, we simulate the continuation of post-GLF (1967-75) trends of the policies for the
post-1978 period to provide a benchmark against which to measure the success of the post-
1978 reforms. The reforms generate 4.2 additional percentage points of GDP growth. The
main factors are the faster growth of non-agricultural TFP (4.4 versus 2.0 percentage points)
that generates 3 percentage points of GDP growth and the faster decrease in the intersectoral
wedges that generates 1 percentage point of additional GDP growth. The dominant factors in
the decrease in the share of labor force in agriculture (-23.9 percentage points) are the decrease
in the production component of the labor wedge (contributing -13 percentage points) and the
faster manufacturing TFP growth (contributing -6.9 percentage points). We conclude that the
reforms yielded significant growth and structural transformation differentials compared with
the continuation of the post-GLF trends. In other words, about 3/4 of the growth differential
is due to the increased growth of the non-agricultural TFP; 1/4 of the growth differential is due
to the faster reduction in the intersectoral wedges. The reduction in the production component
of the labor wedge and growth in non-agricultural TFP are also dominant forces behind the
change in the share of labor force in agriculture.
   We then provide extensive historical evidence consistent with the behavior of the wedges
through the lens of model for 1953-2012. Most importantly, we argue that the two reforms
are consistent with the changes in the key components of the intersectoral wedges post-1978:
price and housing reform (for the consumption component), and increase in competition (for
the production component).
   Finally, we project the path of the Chinese economy until 2050. Specifically, we extend the
1978-2012 trends of sectoral TFPs and wedges and then simulate the model under the chosen
paths of exogenous variables until 2050. We find that China’s economy can continue growing
at 7-8 percent per year for another 10 to 15 years. The growth of non-agricultural, non-state


                                                4
TFP plays the main role in projected growth. The reduction in the wedges – reallocation of
labor from the state to non-state, non-agricultural sector and the reduction in the production
and consumption components of the intersectoral wedges – account for 1.5 percentage points of
growth. The growth rate of real GDP slows to around 4.5 percent by 2030 and to 3.6 percent in
2036-2050. Reallocation of labor from state to non-state firms and the decline in the production
component of the wedge accounts for 1.2 percent. In other words, as the TFP growth slows,
the relative contribution of the policies to reduce wedges in the economy rises from about 20
percent in the first decade of the projection to 30 percent in the third decade. Finally, we
calculate a lower bound on the future real GDP growth by projecting the post-GLF trends
(1966-1978) forward from 2013. This is a useful exercise as it answers the question of how the
economy will perform if the reforms are significantly (and even drastically) slowed down. We
find that growth will be slower at 4.5-5 percent in 2012-2036 but the movement of labor from
agriculture will stop. The slower growth of the manufacturing TFP and the slower decline in
the production component of the intersectoral labor wedge account for the difference between
the two projections.
   We now briefly discuss the literature on the topic. A body of work by Carsten Holz is the
most comprehensive attempt to construct high-quality data for economic analysis of China’s
economy: Holz (2006) assesses availability and quality of the data and constructs a number of
the key data series for the analysis of productivity growth in 1952-2005; Holz (2013a) provides
a detailed guide to classification systems and data sources of Chinese statistics; Holz (2003,
2013b) studies the quality of China’s output statistics. Despite the importance of the issue,
there are no studies of the 1953-1978 period that use modern macroeconomic tools. Ours is the
first paper that analyzes this period from the point of view of the neoclassical growth model,
and provides a unified treatment of the Chinese economy from 1953 to 2012. We are aware of
only one strand of papers dedicated to model-based macroeconomic analysis of the 1953-1978
period by Chow (1985, 1993) and Chow and Li (2002) whose work mainly focuses on data
issues. The post-1978 period received more attention from macroeconomists but perhaps less
prominence than its importance would suggest. Notable contributions are a collection of papers
in a landmark book edited by Brandt and Rawski (2008), an important quantitative analysis of
China’s post-1978 structural transformation and sectoral growth accounting by Brandt, Hsieh,
and Zhu (2008), Brandt and Zhu (2010) and Dekle and Vandenbroucke (2010, 2012), growth


                                               5
accounting by Young (2003) and Zhu (2012), the model of “growing like China” with the focus
on financial frictions by Song, Storesletten, and Zilibotti (2011), a study of misallocation by
Hsieh and Klenow (2010), analysis of factor wedges across space and sectors of Brandt, Tombe,
and Zhu (2013) and Tombe and Zhu (2015), a model of transformation of the state-owned firms
by Hsieh and Song (2015).
   It is useful to also compare our post-1978 results with Brandt, Hsieh, and Zhu (2008), Brandt
and Zhu (2010) and Dekle and Vandenbroucke (2012) who study structural transformation of
China post-1978 reforms. They find that the decrease in the barrier to labor reallocation played
a relatively small role in the change in the share of labor force in agriculture. The key difference
is that their notion of the barrier captures only a part of the labor wedge (that corresponds to
our production and mobility components of the wedge but omits the consumption component).
When the reduction in the overall wedge is taken into account, as we do here, the contribution
of this factor more than doubles. We further compare our results by extending our model
to a three-sector version where we divide the non-agricultural sector into the state- and the
non-state sector following Brandt and Zhu (2010). We then decompose the contribution of non-
agricultural TFP to the structural transformation in 1978-2012 into the contributions of TFP
growth in the state- and non-state sectors, respectively, and the contribution of reallocation
from the less productive state sector to the more productive non-state sector. We confirm the
findings of Brandt, Hsieh, and Zhu (2008) and Brandt and Zhu (2010) of the importance of
growth of non-state TFP in overall TFP growth. We also in passing note that our model with
wedges (by construction) matches the data exactly while these papers rely on calibration to
match some (but not all) features of the data.
   More broadly, our paper is related to such studies of structural transformation as Caselli
and Coleman (2001), Kongsamut, Rebelo and Xie (2001), Stokey (2001), Ngai and Pissarides
(2007), Acemoglu and Guerreri (2008), Buera and Kaboski (2009, 2012), Herrendorf, Rogerson
and Valentinyi (2013). The main difference with this literature is that we find that the changes
in the intersectoral labor wedges (and policies associated with them) play an important role
in structural transformation. Also notable is a two-sector model of growth accounting with
misallocation applied to Singapore by Fernald and Neiman (2010).

industrialization (Cheremukhin et al., 2013). There are two sectors, agricultural (A) and non-

   Following Chari, Kehoe and McGrattan (2007), we define three wedges 1 + τW,t , 1 + τR,t ,
and 1 + τK,t as the right hand sides of expressions (8), (9), and (10). We note that our analysis
is an accounting procedure as competitive general equilibrium allocations with wedges match
data exactly.
   We also study the components of the wedges. Let pi,t and wi,t denote the prices of goods
and wages in the competitive equilibrium. The right hand side of the intra-temporal optimality
condition for labor (8) can be re-written as a product of three terms, to which we refer as
consumption, production, and labor mobility components:
               M                                          M /w

In the competitive equilibrium decentralizing the efficient allocation, all three components are
equal to one. Each of these components is an optimality condition in one of the three markets.
The first, consumption, component is the optimality condition of consumers. The consumption
component typically measures frictions in consumer goods markets. The second, production,
component is the optimality condition of competitive, price-taking firms. The production
component measures frictions in the production process The third, mobility, component is
equal to one when workers can freely choose in which sector to work. The mobility component
measures frictions in labor allocation between sectors, conditional on the relative wages. An
analogous decomposition can be done for the intersectoral capital wedge (9). As we do not
have reliable data on interest rates in each sector, we will decompose the intratemporal capital
wedge only into two components, consumption and non-consumption components. Note that
the consumption component is common for both the intersectoral labor and capital wedge.


3     Data

In this section we discuss the construction of the data for a systematic analysis of the structural
transformation of the Chinese economy from 1952 to 2012. One contribution of our paper is
construction of the data for an application of a two-sector neoclassical model with wedges for
this period.

3.1   Data sources and construction of the data

Our two main sources of data on China national accounts are the yearly “China Statistical
Yearbooks” (CSY) and the “60 Years of New China” (60Y). Both sources are published by the
Chinese National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). The second source aggregates data from previous
publications for the years 1949-2009 and is also closely related with a book on pre-1996 statistics
compiled by Hsueh and Li (1999), “China’s national income 1952-1995” (HL).
    We use nominal value added by sector and the growth rate of real value added by sector
to construct indices of real value added in the agricultural (primary) sector and the non-
agricultural (secondary and tertiary) sector in 1978 prices. The same sources allow us to
estimate the relative prices of agricultural goods to non-agricultural goods by taking the ratio
of price deflators in the two sectors. The price deflator in each sector is computed as the ratio
of nominal to real value added in that sector. The ratio of price deflators equals 1 in 1978


                                                9
by construction. We use gross fixed capital formation in current prices which serves as our
measure of nominal investment. We convert investment (as well as other components of GDP)
from nominal to real values using the GDP deflator.
      We use Holz (2006), Tables 19 and 20 on pages 159-161, as our main source for the aggregate
and sectoral capital stock. We use the level of capital and its ratio to GDP in 1953 to estimate
the initial level of capital in 1978 prices. We apply the perpetual inventory method (with a
depreciation rate of 5 percent) to our series for real investment in 1978 prices to obtain the
series for aggregate capital in 1978 prices. The series that we obtain is largely consistent with
Holz’s estimates of aggregate capital stock for 1953-2006, with two minor differences: Holz
computes capital in constant 2000 prices and uses a variable depreciation rate which ranges
between 3 and 5 percent.
      We also use data from Holz (2006) to divide the aggregate capital stock into capital used
in the agricultural and non-agricultural sectors. This sectoral division of capital stock is only
available for 1978-2012. For earlier years we use the data on sectoral investment from Chow
(1993) to estimate the composition of capital stock by sector. We use net capital stock accu-
mulation by sector from Table 5 on page 820 in Chow (1993), and then apply the perpetual
inventory method to accumulate sectoral capital stock for 1953-1978. We break down the total
real capital stock in 1978 prices by sector using the relative proportions implied by Chow’s
data. We also constructed data on sectoral capital stock using provincial data for the pre-1978
period and the results are consistent with our main series.
      For labor input, we use data on population, employment and its composition from the
two primary sources (60Y, CSY). We adjust the employment numbers prior to 1990 using the
procedure proposed by Holz (2006), Appendix 13, page 236. The correction addresses the
reclassification of employed workers that was made by the NBS in 1990.
      For data on wages by sector we use average wages for staff and workers in the agricultural
and non-agricultural sectors for 1952-2012. The pre-1978 data come from CSY for year 1981.
The post-1978 data come from CSY for years 1996-2013. One issue with this data is that the
wages of staff and workers may not be the same as labor remuneration for workers. Staff and
workers are concentrated in non-agriculture, and to the extent that they are in agriculture, they
are likely in state farms4 . We address this concern by computing the ratio of labor remuneration
  4
      See, for example, Holz (2014) for detailed data.


                                                         10
in non-agriculture to agriculture from Bai and Qian (2010). We find that the ratio of two series
behaves similarly for the overlapping time period (see Data Appendix for more details).
   Our primary source of data on sectoral price indexes is the CSY. We use sectoral value
added deflators obtained earlier when computing real value added by sector.
   The data on defense spending comes from three main sources. The earlier period of 1952-
1995 is jointly covered by HL and CSY, which report nominal defense spending in yuan. For
the period 1983-2012 an alternative source of data is the website of the Stockholm International
Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) which reports spending on defense for a variety of countries
as a percent of GDP. For the overlapping period the trends are broadly consistent but the exact
estimates vary by a factor of 1 to 1.5. As there seems to be no reliable way of obtaining more
precise estimates, we average the two available sources for the overlapping period. We obtain
an estimate of real defense spending in 1978 prices using the share of defense in GDP from
these two sources.
   The main source for data on sectoral exports and imports is Fukao, Kiyota and Yue (2006).
Fukao et al. report data on China’s exports and imports by commodity at the SITC-R 2-digit
level for 1952-1964 and for 1981-2000, obtained from the “China’s Long-Term International
Trade Statistics” database. Using data from Fukao et al. (2006), we construct estimates
of nominal exports and imports of agricultural and non-agricultural commodities. We then
subtract imports from exports to obtain estimates of net exports by sector. We use the price
deflators computed earlier to estimate real net exports by sector in 1978 prices. For the 1965-
1980 period, to our knowledge, there is no available data on trade by sector. We linearly
interpolate the ratios of net export to value added by sector for this intermediate period. For
the 2001-2012 period we use data directly comparable to that reported by Fukao et al. (2006),
now available in CSY.
   We convert real GDP per capita in 1978 prices to 1990 international dollars using Maddison’s
estimate of 4803 dollars of 1990 per person for the year 2003. We then apply real GDP growth
rates (in constant 1978 prices) to construct real GDP per capita in international dollars for other
years in the 1952-2012 period. This series may differ slightly from real GDP in international
dollars reported by Maddison for other years, as relative prices changed. However, our index
captures well the general patterns and the long-term growth rates. For more details on data
construction we refer the reader to our extensive Online Data Appendix.

3.2   Summary of the data

Figure 1 shows aggregate and sectoral, agricultural and non-agricultural, data for China for
1952-2012. We divide the discussion of this period into two subperiods: pre- and post- 1978
reforms.
   China 1952-1978
   The Chinese economy in 1952-1978 grew rather rapidly, with a 3.6 percent average rate of
growth of real GDP per capita. However, the economy did not experience structural transfor-
mation. In 1952, the primary occupation for 83 percent of the working-age Chinese population
was agriculture. This fraction declined very slowly (with the exception of the brief period dur-
ing the GLF when about 20 percent of the labor force temporarily moved from agriculture to
manufacturing), remaining above 80 percent until 1970 and declining to 75 percent in 1977.
The role of agriculture in GDP was also very important, with more than 70 percent of value
added produced in agriculture in 1952, declining only to 30 percent in 1977 (with a similarly
brief downward shift during the GLF). International trade was rather insignificant – China’s
net export of agricultural production was only 3 percent prior to the GLF and declined to
zero after 1960. The imports of non-agricultural goods constituted an even smaller fraction of
non-agricultural value added in the same period. Defense spending was a large component of
manufacturing production accounting for 6 percent of GDP.
   China 1978-2012
   In 1978-2012 annual growth in real GDP per capita increased to 8.4 percent annually. This
coincides with a rapid increase in investments (as a share of GDP) and reallocation of labor
from agriculture to non-agriculture. The share of labor force in agriculture fell from 75 percent
in 1977 to 33 percent in 2012. The share of value added produced in the agricultural sector
fell from 30 percent to 5 percent respectively. Defense expenditures declined from 6 percent of
GDP to 1.5 percent of GDP in the late 1980s. The relative prices of non-agricultural goods
show a 40 percent appreciation in the 5 years following the reforms, and then continued to
appreciate. Non-agricultural value added shows remarkable growth throughout both periods,
growing at 10.5 and 10.1 percent, respectively. Agricultural value added grew much slower, at
2.0 percent per year prior to reforms, and 4.4 percent afterwards. The ratios of sectoral capital
stock to sectoral GDP remain roughly stable over the whole period.

4      Measurement of wedges in the data

In this section we discuss the choice of parameters that we use to measure sectoral productivities,
wedges (8), (9) and (10), and their components.

4.1     Parametrization

For our baseline preference specification we chose a commonly used Stone-Geary specification
which sets σ = 1. Parameter η measures the long run share of agricultural consumption and
we set it to 0.15. These parameters are consistent with the literature that used the two sector
growth model to study growth and structural transformation in a variety of historical episodes5 .
    We set the subsistence level to 54 yuan per capita per year in 1978 prices. This subsistence
level accounts for 53 percent of agricultural consumption per capita in 19526 . If we set it higher
than 69 percent of consumption of 1952, the simulated economy would go below the subsistence
level in 1960 during the famine of the Great Leap Forward. We explore in an online appendix,
how our main results change in response to alternative calibrations of γ A .
    We choose the initial capital stock to match the observed level of capital in 1952. Our
technology specification is close to Hayashi and Prescott (2008). The elasticities for the agri-
cultural sector are also in line with estimates of Tang (1984), who uses the contributions of
labor, capital and land at 0.5, 0.1 and 0.25 respectively, with the remaining share of 0.15 as-
signed to intermediate inputs.7 However, there is a large variation in estimates of factor shares
   5
     See Caselli and Coleman (2001), Buera and Kaboski (2009, 2012), Herrendorf, Rogerson and Valentinyi
(2013), Stokey (2001). Our parameters are especially close to the calibration in Hayashi and Prescott (2008).
The long run share η is also consistent with food expenditure shares in most developed countries.
   6
     The subsistence level is equal to 76 percent of consumption during the famine in 1960.
   7
     See p.89 and Appendix Table 9, p.228 in Tang (1984) for the discussion of the consistency of these input

Finally, for χt , the path of the fraction of labor force in the population is pinned down by the
data. All our parameters are given in Table 2.

5    Wedge decomposition

We now present the calculation of the total factor productivities XtM , XtA ; the wedges 1 + τW,t ,
1 + τR,t and 1 + τK,t ; and the components of the wedges. We report the annual growth rates
for the pre-1978 (1952-1978), post Great Leap Forward period (post-GLF, 1966-1978), and for
the post-1978 period in Table 38 . Figure 2 plots the agricultural and non-agricultural TFP and
the intersectoral wedges. Figure 3 plots the components of the wedges.9
    We now summarize the results of this section. The 1953-1978 period is characterized by mild
growth of TFP (1.9 percent per year in non-agriculture and 0.3 percent per year in agriculture),
a reduction in the labor wedge driven by the consumption component, and a reduction in the
capital wedge. The post-GLF period saw an acceleration of agricultural TFP (2.4 percent) and
a deceleration of the reduction in the wedges. After 1978, there was a significant acceleration
of TFP growth, especially in non-agriculture. The reduction in the barriers also significantly
accelerated, especially the production components of the labor wedge.

     For the sake of brevity, we refer to the consumption component of the intratemporal labor wedge as “con-
sumption”, to the production component of the intratemporal labor wedge as “production”, to the mobility
component of the intratemporal labor wedge as “mobility”, and to the non-consumption component of the
intratemporal capital wedge as “capital”.

     We later show that the investment wedge plays a minor role and relegate this graph to the appendix.

6         Analyzing the pre-reform economy
6.1        Wedge accounting for the pre-reform economy

In this section, we perform a wedge accounting exercise for the pre-reform economy to quantify
the contribution of each component of our wedge decomposition to growth and to changes in
the share of labor force in agriculture. First, we compute the path of the economy holding
all wedges fixed at their 1953 levels. Second, we compute the path of the economy when all
exogenous variables (including wedges and productivities) are set to values observed in the
data. When all those series are set to the values observed in the data, the model matches
the observed quantities and prices in the data exactly. We compare the simulated path with
fixed wedges with the actual historical path by computing the difference between the rates
of growth of annual GDP and the difference between the changes in the share of labor force
in agriculture for the period. Finally, we compute the contributions of wedges and TFPs by
removing exogenous variables one at a time and computing the relative changes in GDP and
the share of labor force in agriculture for each case.10
         Table 4 summarizes the results for the pre-reform economy. We provide calculations for two
periods: 1953-1975 and 1953-1978. We choose the 1953-1975 period as the baseline because
there was a significant fall in the share of labor in agriculture during 1975-1978 and a fall in
the wedges. The overall results are, however, similar for either of these two periods.
    10
    The accounting procedure imposes some additional technical assumptions to compute the relative contribu-
tions and keep expectations constant across counterfactuals. For more details see the appendix on computational
details.

                     Table 4: Wedge accounting 1953-1975 and 1953-1978


   Consider wedge accounting for 1953-1975. Compared with the counterfactual, GDP growth
increased by 5.6 percentage points and the share of labor force in agriculture decreased by
5.9 percentage points. For GDP growth, two most important factors were the growth of non-
agricultural TFP, XM , (1.9 percentage points) and the decrease in the consumption component
of the labor wedge (1.6 percentage points). The rest of the wedges worsened and contributed
negatively to the growth of GDP: the production component (-0.8 percentage points), mobility
component (-0.5 percentage points), and intersectoral capital wedge (-1 percentage points). The
overall worsening of wedges resulted in -0.5 percentage points of reduction in the annual GDP
growth. Demographics played a major role contributing 4.0 percentage points to GDP growth
so that the growth rate of GDP per capita is significantly less than the growth rate of GDP.
The change in the share of labor force in agriculture (-5.9 percentage points) is essentially fully
determined by the decrease in the consumption component of the labor wedge (-7.8 percentage
points). For 1953-1978, the results are similar with the exception that the change in the share
of labor force in agriculture is larger (-12.5 percentage points).
   We conclude that the decline in the consumption component of the labor wedge is impor-
tant for GDP growth and is the only factor in explaining the decline in the share of labor
force in agriculture. Importantly, agricultural TFP growth does not play any role in struc-
tural transformation. The non-agricultural TFP growth is the most important factor for GDP
growth.

                          Table 5: Wedge accounting post-GLF: 1966-1975


       We now turn to the wedge accounting for the post-GLF period, 1966-1975. We present it
here as we use the trends from that period to evaluate the success of the post-1978 reforms.
This period experienced a slightly higher GDP growth than in 1953-1975 (but significantly
higher per capita GDP growth due to slower growth of population). The contributions of
non-agricultural and agricultural TFP to GDP growth were also larger.

6.2      Historical evidence

Before starting the analysis of the behavior of the wedges in the context of the historical
evidence, it is useful to establish the periodization of the PRC economic history. Naughton
(2007) considers Economic Recovery (1949-52), the Twin Peaks of the First Five-Year Plan
(1953-1956), Great Leap Forward (1958-1960), Crisis and “Readjustment” (1961-1963), Launch
of the Third Front (1964-66), the Cultural Revolution (1967-69), the Maoist Model: a New Leap
(1970-1972), Consolidation and Drift (1972-76), and the Leap Outward and End of Maoism
(1978-).11 Selden (1979, p.153) provides a useful summary of the main stages in China’s
development priorities. Ash, et al. (2003, p. 32-55) gives a detailed chronology of major
economic developments in China from 1964 to 2001.
  11
    Cambridge History of China (MacFarquhar and Fairbank 1987, Perkins 1991) considers the periodization
as follows: Emulating the Soviet Model (1949-57) with three subperiods – Consolidation and Reconstruction
(1949-52), Socialist Construction and Transformation (1953-56), Adjusting the New Socialist System (1956-57);
the Search for a Chinese Road (1958-65) – with two subperiods Great Leap Forward (1958-62) and Economic
Recovery (1963-65); and the 1966-82 period with the following subperiods – Disruption in the economy (1966-69),
Industrial development strategy (1966-76), Changing industrial strategies (1977—80), Accelerating industrial
growth, 1982—1987. Bramall (2009, p. xxiv) uses four periods: early Maoism (1949-1963); late Maoism (1963-
1978); market socialism (1978-1996); and Chinese capitalism (1996-2008).

6.2.1    TFP growth

The First Five-Year Plan (1952-57) was “an unusually successful program of economic develop-
ment” (Lardy 1987a, p.157). The plan was modeled on the Soviet experience of collectivization
and industrialization in 1928-1939: the development program was drawn “half in Moscow, half
in Peking” (Naughton 2007, p. 66), and the principal slogan was “Let’s be modern and Soviet”
(Selden 1979, p.153). On the other hand, there was a much more moderate attitude towards
agriculture than the abrupt Soviet change12 . The growth of TFP in non-agriculture is con-
sistent with several facts. First, Soviet assistance played an important role. Lardy (1987a, p.
178) argues that Soviet technical assistance was “unprecedented in the history of the transfer of
technology” as China “received the most advanced technology available within the Soviet Union,
and in some cases this was the best in the world”. Close to 6000 Soviet advisors helped establish
and operate the 156 large-scale capital intensive Soviet-assisted projects (Naughton 2007, p. 66;
Rawski, 1979, p. 51)13 . These projects constituted “the core of the industrialization program”
and absorbed about a half of total industrial investment (Lardy 1987a, p. 158). Eckstein (1977,
p. 102) considers these large turnkey industrial installations designed in Russia, transported in
full to China, installed and often operated by Soviet advisors as one of the “crucial element[s]
of industrialization of China during the First Five-Year Plan”. The system of planning and
development was itself modeled on the Soviet Union and assisted by the advisors. Second and
related to the first factor, the import of the capital intensive goods and machinery (also to
a large extent from USSR) played an important role in allowing the economy to operate the
“frontier technology” (Naughton 2007, p.66). Eckstein (1977, p. 235) argues that import con-
stituted as much as 40 percent of the equipment component of investment in the 1950s. Third,
the First Five-Year plan model was a technocratic approach that “paid considerable attention
to complementarities, input-output relations, and technical requirements in production and
enterprise management” . The management model placed great responsibilities on a director of
  12
     As evidenced, for example, in Mao’s Speech to the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, April 25, 1956
“On the Ten Major Relationships” which was the synthesis and perhaps the most important Mao’s statement
on a distinct approach China’s development and the first serious criticism of the Soviet development strategy
(Selden 1979, p. 315-322).

     Li Fuchun, then the Chairperson of the State Planning Committee in the “Report on the First Five-Year
Plan for Development of the National Economy of the People’s Republic of China in 1953-1957, July 5 and 6,
1955” summarized: “We must center our main efforts on industrial construction ..., the core of which are the
156 projects which the Soviet Union is designing for us, and which will lay out the preliminary groundwork for
China’s socialist industries” (Selden 1979, p. 296-7).



                                                      20
enterprises, valued and utilized technical experts, and provided some stratification in pay and
benefits to improve incentives. (Eckstein 1977, p. 89-90). The plan also stressed individual
material incentives (Selden 1979, p. 153). Overall, by the mid-1950s, modern technology was
adopted on a large scale in industry (Lardy 1987a, p. 144).14 The growth of TFP in agricul-
ture during 1952-1957 is consistent with several facts. First, and unlike the Soviet Union under
Stalin, agriculture was never viewed purely as a source of revenue extraction for the forced
industrialization. Rural population was historically an important power base for the Chinese
Communist Party. Agriculture was also viewed as an important source of raw materials for the
industry. Overall, the process of collectivization in China “limited the disorder and destruction
of economic resources that marked the Soviet [experience of collectivization]” (Teiwes 1987,
p.111). We return to this issue in a more detailed comparison with Stalin’s industrialization
in Section 6.3. Second, more efficient methods of agricultural production were implemented.
Nolan (1976) gives detailed figures and determines five such methods: (1) increase in irrigated
areas; (2) increased multiple cropping; (3) afforestation; (4) improved seeds; (5) increased col-
lection and application of organic fertilizers (see also Naughton 2007, Chapter 11). Thirdly, the
collectivization led to consolidation in the land plots that led to improvement in the agricultural
productivity, decreased the travel time between plots, and allowed the use of mechanization
(Spence 2013, p. 491)
       During the Great Leap Forward (1958-1962), TFP in agriculture fell by 41 percent from
its peak in 1958 to the trough in 1962; TFP in manufacturing fell in 1958 by 23 percent and
again in 1961 by 26 percent. One important factor that affected TFP in both agriculture and
non-agriculture was worsening of incentives (Naughton 2007, p. 69; Lardy 1987b, p. 365).
Material incentives, monetary rewards, bonuses were prohibited, free markets in the country-
side were curtailed, and restrictions on the productive private farming plots were placed. The
fall in manufacturing TFP is consistent with several factors. First, the collapse of agricultural
production led to severe shortage of agricultural materials for textile and food-processing in-
dustries. Second, many small scale plants such as backyard steel furnaces were exceptionally
inefficient (e.g., Eckstein, 1977, p. 124).15 Third, the Sino-Soviet split led to the departure of
  14
      Another factor that affected TFP in both the agricultural and the non-agricultural sectors of the economy
is the advances in basic hygiene, disease, and pest control that affected productivity and longevity (see, e.g.
Spence 2013, p. 488).
   15
      Selden (1979, p. 100) gives the following estimates for these furnaces. In July 1958, there were 30-50
thousand small furnaces, in October – close to 1 million. By October 1960, only over 3000 were still operational,


                                                       21
virtually all Soviet advisors in the late summer and early fall of 1960. This meant that a large
number of capital-goods projects had to be suspended (Eckstein, 1977, p.203; Selden 1979,
p. 97). The reversal of the manufacturing TFP fall after 1961 is consistent with the general
“readjustment and consolidation” policies that refocused industrial production to more specific
and high productivity projects (e.g., petrochemical and fertilizer) rather than advancing on a
broad front, and to a revival of material incentives (Eckstein, 1977 p. 126).
    The fall in TFP in agriculture is consistent with several factors. One factor was that pro-
ductivity fell due to poor management of agriculture under the commune system.16 Communes
that comprised over 5000 members became a predominant form of organization in agriculture,
and due to their size and organization were very difficult to effectively manage. Considering
the negative productivity impact of the communes Lardy (1987b, p. 370) argues that the most
important factor was in the poor construction and design of the irrigation projects which re-
duced rather than raised yields.17 The unusually bad weather in 1960 also had serious adverse
effects on the yields.18 Li and Yang (2005) argue that the most important causal factors in the
collapse of agricultural output between 1958 and 1961 were: (1) the diversion of resources from
agriculture, which was responsible for 33 percent of the decline; (2) excessive procurement of
grain affecting physical strength of the peasantry accounting for 28.3 percent of the decline;
(3) bad weather contributing 12.9 percent of the decline. The fall in productivity was reversed
only after 1962.19
    The period of 1962-1966 was a period of recovery from the disaster of the Great Leap
Forward. In 1962, the government backtracked by reducing the size of communes to “production
teams” of about 20-30 households per team (Lin, 2012, p. 89, p. 153.). 20 million workers
were sent back from cities to the countryside. Mao recognized that “backyard furnaces” were a
and the rest shut down. He further quotes an editorial from People’s Daily of August 1, 1959: “We must face
the problem frankly: Last year’s small furnaces could not produce iron”.
   16
      Lin (1990) discusses a variety of hypotheses and presents a view emphasizing the role of incentives in the
fall of productivity. See also Donnithorne (1987, Chapter 2) for the detailed description of the evolution of the
communes.
   17
      See also Cheng (1982, p. 267).
   18
      See e.g. Selden (1979, p. 97) or a more recent study based on the meteorological data (Kueh 1995). The low
agricultural output was further exacerbated by miscalculation in the 1959 plan to reduce the area and resources
allocated to grain production. This decision followed the successful harvest of 1958 and was done under the
false supposition of the new era of significantly increased productivity in agriculture and following the massive
falsification of data on yields (Naughton 2007, p. 70).

collapse of agricultural production and the famine.

ed. “Chairman Mao talks to the people,” 142-43, cited by Perkins, 1991, p. 478). “Agriculture
first” strategy included reopening of private plots (Lardy 1987b, p. 389), decentralization of
commune management, and greater reliance on material incentives (Eckstein, 1977 p. 60-61).
These policies continued throughout the Cultural Revolution, the last years of Mao and the first
post-Mao years — until the beginning of reforms in 1978. (Perkins, 1991, p. 486) The planning
and Big Push ideology persisted but was softer and less brutal than in the 1950s. Agricultural
TFP grew by 35 percent from the low of 1962 to the peak of 1966, but was still 25 percent
below the peak of 1958. The increase in agricultural TFP is consistent with the continuation
of the “readjustment and recovery” policy in agriculture. Manufacturing TFP grew quickly —
recovered to the pre-crisis peak of 1957 in 1964, and increased by almost 60 percent from the
low of 1961 to the peak of 1966.
       The next subperiod (1967-69) is that of the peak of the Cultural Revolution.20 Despite
the exceptional importance of the events of the Cultural Revolution for the country, the eco-
nomic implications were much more muted. The fall in agricultural and manufacturing TFP
in 1967 and 1968 was relatively minor, and agriculture was affected less than manufacturing.
Sectoral TFPs reached or exceeded the peak of 1966 already in 1970. This is consistent with
the conclusion of Perkins (1991, p. 482-483) that “In short, all of the worker strikes, the battles
between workers and Red Guards, and the use of the railroads to transport Red Guards around
the country had cost China two years of reduced output but little more, at least in the short
run... the contrast between the disruption caused by the Cultural Revolution and that resulting
from the Great Leap Forward of 1958-60 is striking” and that “The Cultural Revolution at its
peak (1967-68) was a severe but essentially temporary interruption of a magnitude experienced
by most countries at one time or another.” (Perkins 1991, p. 486). Naughton (2007, p. 75)
reaches the same conclusion that “From an economic standpoint, the Cultural Revolution (in
the narrow definition [1966-69]) was, surprisingly, not a particularly important event”. Eckstein
(1977, p. 204-205) also argues that the economic disruptions were minimized, at least, in agri-
culture with perhaps the largest impact being on transport. Spence (2013, p. 549) provides an
additional argument that PLA kept the Red Guards out of its production plants, importantly,
  20
    Historians typically define the period of Cultural Revolution starting in late 1965 and ending with the
convocation of the Ninth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in April 1969 (e.g., Harding 1991,
p. 111) .

from the Daqing oil fields.
   The period of 1966-76, as Perkins (1991, p. 486) argued, was very similar to the original
1950s vision of the First Five-Year Plan and that the early changes to the strategy started
happening only in 1977. Naughton (1996, p. 76) argues for a slightly more nuanced breakdown.
The New Leap in 1970 was a period of militarization of the economy that also instituted some
principles of the Great Leap Forward. The 1972-1976 period was that of consolidation and drift.
It started with the economic problems of the 1970s whereas the heavy industry development
was both increasingly inefficient and outstripped the agricultural facilities to provide food. A
new more moderate course was started in 1972-74 by Zhou Enlai.

6.2.2    Wedges

In contrast with several detailed studies of TFP behavior during the pre-reform period described
above there is much less work on the potential wedges. That is why, rather than focusing on the
detailed exposition that we have done for the TFP, we view this section as describing evidence
that is broadly consistent with the patterns of the wedges.


Consumption component of the intersectoral wedges The consumption component of
the wedge starts from the very high level in 1952-1953 and is driven by the very low level of
consumption of non-agricultural goods. The reason is as follows. We calculate this consumption
as the residual of non-agricultural output after investment. Since we assume in the model
that all investment is done in non-agricultural goods, the level of this component and the
overall wedge for those years is very sensitive to the data on investment. Almost certainly, we
overestimate the level of this component of the wedge for these years. At the same time, as we
discussed in the previous section this was the period of the First Five Year Plan that placed
heavy emphasis on investment and this is consistent with the high level of the consumption
wedge.
   During the Great Leap Forward, the dominant factor driving the consumption wedge was
the catastrophic collapse of agricultural consumption that moved aggregate consumption very
close to the subsistence level. This approaching of the subsistence level of consumption and
the shortages of agricultural goods are both consistent with the consumption component of the
intrasectoral wedges falling significantly.



                                              24
   The disaster of the Great Leap Forward followed the reported exceptional results of the
1958 harvest. Partially, the harvest was indeed good but falsification of reports by those who
did not want to disappoint the authorities also played a role. “Evidently dazzled by claims that
rural production under commune management had doubled, increased tenfold, or even “scores
of time”, the Central Committee issued the ecstatic vision of the Great Leap forward” (Spence,
2013, p. 518). This resulted in higher grain procurement quotas and higher targets of rural
industrial production. At the same time, the complete destruction of incentives as well as poor
harvests had a dramatic negative effect on agricultural output.
   A useful proxy for the degree of intervention in the agricultural markets is the level of state
procurement. Depending on how exactly procurement is modeled, it can represent itself in
various wedges – either in consumption or in the production component of the wedge, or as
we argued in the previous section – in the TFP wedge. The changes in the agricultural policy
during the Great Leap Forward were so large and abrupt that most likely procurement affected
a variety of wedges. Since the TFPs and wedges behaved similarly – experiencing a rapid fall
and then a rapid recovery – we use procurement to provide indirect evidence for the behavior
of wedges.
   The level of state procurement of grain reached its peak in 1959 and rural retentions per
capita reached the trough in 1960 (Lardy 1987b, p. 381 Table 7; Li and Yang 2005, Table
1). The combination of high plans (and therefore procurement quota) and low output resulted
in severe shortage of agricultural goods and a great famine which cost about 30 million lives
(Meng et al., 2013). For example, retained grain per person fell from 273 kilograms per capita
in 1957 to 193 kilograms in 1959, and to 182 kilograms in 1960 (Li and Yang 2005, Table
1); or from 227 kilograms in 1959, to 215 kilograms in 1960, and to 207 kilograms in 1961 if
one accounts for re-sales (Ash 2006, Table 5). Ashton et al. (1984, Table 5) estimate that
average daily calorie consumption was a shocking 1534 Kcal in 1960. Lardy (1983, p.150)
documents severe shortages of food in 1961 and 1962. Lardy (1987b, p. 375) cites the evidence
of the shortage represented in the “extraordinary increase in rural [unregulated] market prices of
available foodstuff”. Following the agricultural crisis, first attempts to scale back procurement
were evidenced in 1961. Also, in the winter of 1961, the fixed procurement prices were raised
(Lardy 1987b, p. 385). In 1961-2, procurement was drastically reduced (Li and Yang, 2005,




                                               25
Table 1; Lardy 1987b, p. 388)21 . The average food consumption recovered to 2026 calories in
1964. This decrease in the procurement levels and the eased shortages of the agricultural goods
are consistent with the consumption component of the intersectoral wedge decreasing and then
increasing. Post-1965, grain procurement net of resales stabilized at about 40 percent of output
(Ash, 2006, 1985).
       We now discuss a variety of additional evidence that is consistent with the high level of the
consumption wedge and its behavior. A sizable literature studies price scissors in China (e.g.,
Yu and Lin 2008). Most of it focuses on the price scissors defined as the observed terms of trade
between the agricultural and the non-agricultural sector. There are, however, several papers
that study the difference between observed prices and prices that would occur if various policies
(such as rationing) were removed. Such comparison between the observed and undistorted prices
is similar to our concept of the consumption wedge. While the models and the dates in these
papers vary, we view them as a useful supplement to our analysis supporting our main point
that the agricultural prices were too low, and non-agricultural prices were too high compared
with the undistorted benchmark.22 Imai (2000) studies a static, two sector model of the pre-
reform (1964-1978) period in which a planner chooses a proportion of the non-agricultural good
to be invested, and thus rations the non-agricultural. This implicit tax changes the terms of
trade between agriculture and non-agriculture. While Imai (2000) allocates all of this tax to
the labor wedge and does not calculate the consumption wedge, the difference in the terms of
trade compared with the undistorted optimum parallels our consumption wedge. He finds that
the undistorted agricultural prices would be 35-50 percent higher. The undistorted purchases
of the non-agricultural goods would be on average 59 percent higher (67 percent higher in
1970-1978). Sheng (1993b) constructs an index of the prices of agricultural goods on the free
markets compared with the state list prices and argues that this ratio ranged from 1.3-1.4 in the
1950s and 1964-1970, and 1.5-1.8 in the first part of the 1970s. During the Great Leap Forward
the ratio increased to 4.12 in 1961 and then decreased to 2.7 in 1962 and 2.2 in 1963. Finally,
Table 7 in Zhang and Zhao (2000) summarizes a variety of estimates by Chinese economists of
the degree of unequal exchange between agriculture and manufacturing. These estimates are
based on the Marxist labor theory of value and are not directly comparable with the analysis
  21
   Net of resales procurement as a proportion of grain output started falling in 1960 (Ash 2006, Table 5).
  22
   See also Naughton (2007, p. 60) who argues extensively that such price wedge was a key feature of the
command economic system in China.

here. Still, the broad comparison of the trends is useful. The estimates of unequal exchange
in the 1950s range from 20 to 65 percent. The estimates of the state purchasing price being
below the “real value” for agricultural goods range from 20 percent in the 1950s, 40-80 percent
during the Great Leap Forward, and about 50 percent in the 1970s.23 Nolan and White (1984)
summarize: “Chinese economists now are generally agreed that serious “unequal exchange” has
existed throughout the post-Liberation period (and thus does today) in the sense that the
“price” of industrial commodities is much greater than their “value” (in terms of embodied
labour) and the “price” of agricultural commodities is much below their “value” ”.


Mobility component of the labor wedge We start the discussion of the mobility com-
ponent with its increase in 1955. This is consistent with the start of the implementation of
the hukou system of registration of urban and rural population and the restrictions on their
movement. Cheng and Selden (1994) give a detailed account of the origins of this system which
can be be traced to the 16th of July 1951 when the Ministry of Public Security issued “Reg-
ulations Governing the Urban Population”. At that stage, the system was just a registration
system. On 12 March 1954, the Ministry of the Interior and Ministry of Labour issued an
important “Joint Directive to Control Blind Influx of Peasants into Cities” that was aimed at
the cities and started to curb migration. Finally, in 1954-1956 a set of measures was introduced
to further limit and disincentivize migration including, importantly, food rationing. While the
hukou system and migration controls were still in the incipient stage and far from the scope
and strictness of the later years, the evidence is consistent with the increase in the labor wedge
starting from mid-1950s.24
       The mobility component decreased by 82 percent from 1957 to 1960 and then increased,
returning to its 1957 level in 1964. It is not surprising that this was accompanied by an un-
precedented increase in the agricultural labor force. The reversal of the barrier is also consistent
with the massive forced resettlement of urban population to the countryside. In 1961-62, about
30 million urbanites were thus moved to the countryside (Lardy 1987b, p. 387).
  23
     We also refer the reader to Cheng (1982, Chapter 7) and Chinn (1980) for extensive description of rationing
and coupons for both agricultural and non-agricultural goods. While the magnitude and evolution of the relative
wedge is difficult to assess, Cheng (1982, p. 217) argues that “The most detrimental effect is caused by the
separation of production and consumer demand”.
  24
     Nolan and White (2007) also argue that the measures to control migration started to be effective after 1955.
For a comprehensive history of the hukou system see Chan and Zhang (1999).



                                                       27
   From 1962 to 1966 the mobility component of the wedge continued its increase which is
consistent with Ministry of Public Security starting to rigorously control and enforce the re-
strictions on rural to urban migration (Chan and Zhang 1999).
   Liu (2005) discusses hukou conversion process as a crucial aspect of rural–urban migration
whereas recruitment by state-owned enterprises was the main channel for individuals in rural
areas to obtain an urban hukou during the 1960s and 1970s. The policy of hukou conversion
is consistent with the decline in the mobility component of the wedge, even though it likely
accounts only for part of this decline. Wu (1994) also discusses the policy of sending about
18 million urban youth to villages during Cultural Revolution and their gradual recall back
to the cities. This policy likely had a mixed impact on the mobility wedge – first an increase
and then a decrease. Moreover, in 1971, the government, for the first time since the collapse
of the Great Leap Forward, relaxed control over the increase in permanent positions in the
urban/industrial sector. This policy is consistent with the decrease in the mobility wedge.
Another force affecting the mobility component of the wedge is the return to human capital.
Lower returns to education manifest themselves in the lower non-agricultural wage and a lower
mobility wedge. Fleisher and Wang (2005) provide evidence that returns to schooling measured
as the ratio of the income of college graduates to income of individuals with only elementary
schooling declined from a ratio of 1.8 in the years prior to 1960 to a ratio of about 1.3 in the
years around 1980. They argue that three factors contribute to the decline in the wage gap: (1)
decreased differential between traditionally good (for example, high paying employers owned
by the central government) and bad jobs (Zhou 2000); (2) decreased differential in pay between
workers who differ in schooling within jobs; (3) discrimination in the assignment of college
graduates to jobs in favored occupations, industries, and geographical locations, as evidenced,
for example by sending high school graduates to rural jobs (see discussion in Zhou and Hou
1999).


Production component of the labor wedge There is very little data on the size of the
production component of the labor wedge. The only direct evidence we are aware of is the study
by Dong and Putterman (2000) who argue that monopsony in the pre-reform industry was a
significant impediment to structural transformation. They calculate the difference between the
marginal product of labor and wages, including welfare benefits and subsidies, in Chinese state


                                              28
industry. The study finds that the mean gap was 169 percent and the median gap was 189
percent for 1952-1984.


Intersectoral capital wedge In this section, we discuss the non-consumption component
of the capital wedge in Figure 3, panel 4. The total intersectoral wedge is the combination of
the consumption wedge and this component.
       In 1952-1957 the intersectoral capital wedge decreased significantly. This is consistent with
the main strategy of the First Five-Year Plan that placed the “overwhelming allocation of
investment resources to industry” and production of capital goods (Lardy 1987a, p.158). Selden
(1979, p. 153) states that the order of economic priorities for that period was: heavy industry,
light industry, agriculture. Lardy (1987a, p. 158) and Eckstein (1977, p. 188) give details
of investment allocation to industry and agriculture to also argue about the low priority of
agricultural investment.25
       The intersectoral capital wedge decreased significantly to the trough in 1960 and then
started its reversal. This behavior is consistent with several facts. The first years of the
GLF strategy were based on a massive infusion of capital both to the industries developed in
the First-Five Year plan, and importantly to small-scale industrial plants such as “backyard
furnaces” (Lardy 1987b, p. 365)26 . The reversal of the wedge afterwards is consistent with
several facts. There was a massive closure of the construction of industrial projects after
the disastrous first years of the GLF (Lardy 1987b, p. 387) and a corresponding increase in
investment allocated to agriculture. The “Agriculture first” strategy most significantly increased
chemical fertilizer production, electricity allocation, and the production of small agricultural
implements (Eckstein, 1977, p. 60). These measures also are consistent with the increase in
the intersectoral wedge in those years.27
       From 1962-1966 the declining capital wedge is consistent with the arguments that the period
of readjustment did not mean that fundamentally the growth strategy shifted to prioritize
  25
     The report by Li Fuchun gives the following state investment priorities: industrial departments – 58.2 percent
of total; agriculture – 7.6 percent; transport, post and telecommunications – 19.2 percent; trade, banking, and
stockpiling – 3 percent; urban public utilities – 3.7 percent (cited in Selden 1979, p. 296-7).
  26
     While often the first years of the Great Leap Forward are associated with the small scale projects such as
backyard furnaces (see, e.g. discussion in Spence 2013), Lardy (1987b, p. 367) gives detailed statistics on the
preponderance of investment allocation to the medium and large-scale industrial plants.
  27
     For example, special allocations of materials to produce small instruments such as hand tools and carts
were implemented in 1962, and the availability of these items was restored to the pre-GLF years (Lardy 1987b,
p. 391).


                                                        29
agriculture. Rather, the moderates in the government – Zhou Enlai and Chen Yun, among
others – were successful in extending the period of readjustment until 1965 and in deferring
the Third Five-Year plan until 1966. In particular, they won in a critical debate on the target
for steel production, and were able to scale it down. However, the moderates only slightly
and temporarily altered the growth strategy of the primacy of the industrialization to allow
a respite with “agriculture first” (Lardy 1987b, p. 396)28 . The fact that the capital wedge
did not increase to reflect the priorities in agriculture is also consistent with the program of
the “Third Front”. Mao worried about US involvement in Vietnam and about the rift with
the Soviet Union that potentially could lead to a war. The “Third Front” was a massive
construction program in the inland provinces of the entire industrial base that would not be
vulnerable to the attacks by the Soviets or Americans.29 The Third Front was important even
during the Cultural Revolution, but the rapid expansion of the first phase was stopped by the
Cultural Revolution. The decline in the non-consumption component of the capital wedge, the
consumption and mobility component of the intersectoral labor wedge are consistent with the
argument of Perkins (1991, p. 486) who concludes that the period of 1966-76 was very similar
to the original 1950s vision of the First Five-Year Plan. The declining behavior of these wedges
support this argument.
       Considering the whole period of 1952-1978, the behavior of the capital wedge is consistent
with the classification of the evolution of China’s development strategies by Cheng (1982, Table
9.3) who ranks the sectoral priorities. Only during the Readjustment period of 1961-1965
agriculture received priority consistent with the increasing capital wedge; in all other periods
heavy industry ranked first in the list of priorities consistent with the decline of the capital
wedge.

6.3      Great Leap Forward and Comparison with Soviet Industrialization

We first simulate the behavior of the economy assuming that the Great Leap Forward did not
happen. Figure 4 plots the behavior of the actual and simulated GDP, shares of labor force
in agriculture, wedges and sectoral TFPs. We linearly extrapolate TFP in both sectors and
  28
     Eckstein, however, argues that the basic tenets of the “Agriculture first” strategy – higher priority of agricul-
ture and the industries that supply inputs to it – held even during and after the Cultural revolution (Eckstein,
1977 p. 61).
  29
     See Naughton (1988) for a detailed discussion of the industrial policies under the Third Front.

the components of the labor and capital wedges between 1957 and 1964. The key differences
with the actual wedges are as follows. There is no drop in the manufacturing TFP. There is
no jump in 1958 and then no consequent fall in agricultural TFP. There are no jumps in the
consumption and production components of the labor wedge and so there is no decrease in the
overall labor wedge.




                                    Figure 4: No GLF



                                            31
      Figure 4 plots the behavior of actual and simulated real GDP and the share of labor force in
agriculture. Fluctuations in most of these variables are dampened in the absence of the GLF.
In contrast to the actual path, the counterfactual lshare of labor force in agriculture increases
to 93 percent and then comes back.
      The changes in the intersectoral labor wedge play a dominant role in explaining the changes
in the share of labor force in agriculture during the GLF. The temporary decrease in the labor
wedge accounts for the bulk of the movement of peasants to the manufacturing sector and then
back. However, there is only a temporary positive effect on GDP, with a slowdown and famine
that followed.
      Overall, the GLF was a very short episode of the disruption of the economy with a temporary
negative impact. We note the importance of the changes in the labor wedge for the behavior
of the share of labor force in agriculture and GDP during that period.
      The conclusion that Great Leap Forward significantly reduced the labor wedge while re-
sulting in a significant fall in TFP naturally leads to the comparison with the policies of the
Soviet Union under Stalin.
      We perform the following counterfactual simulations. We start Stalin’s policies in 1957
(1957 thus being 1928 of Stalin’s policies). This choice of timing is guided by the idea that the
peak of the reforms in China under the Great Leap Forward (1960) should coincide with the
peak of Soviet collectivization (1932). This is done to isolate GLF, and to study similarities
as well as differences between the GLF and the most intense phase of Stalin’s collectivization.
This comparison highlights Mao’s way of transforming agriculture that was even more radical
than Stalin’s.30
      Specifically, we use the wedges computed in (Cheremukhin, et al. 2013) for Soviet Russia’s
industrialization and choose the timing of Stalin’s policies to coincide with those of the GLF.
We impose the wedges and sectoral TFPs for Stalin’s 1928-1939 economy on our model of the
Chinese economy over the period 1956-1967. We do this by multiplying each wedge by period-
over-period relative changes in wedges implemented by Stalin. We then compare the actual
data for the Chinese economy to the simulated Chinese economy with Stalin’s policies imposed.
That is, the model in 1957-1968 has the same innovations to wedges and sectoral TFPs as that
of Stalin. After 1968, the economy returns to the same growth rates of wedges and the sectoral
 30
      For a survey of the existing literature on exactly this comparison see Yang (2008).


                                                        32
TFPs as in the baseline model.
   Figure 5 plots both actual Chinese wedges and the simulated economy with Stalin’s wedges.
There are similarities between these economies and some important differences. The main result
of Stalin’s policies would be much lower share of labor force in agriculture while the behavior
of GDP per capita is broadly the same.




                           Figure 5: Soviet collectivization vs GLF



                                              33
   We now compare the behavior of the wedges. First, the fall in agricultural TFP was more
significant in China compared with Soviet Russia. The fall in agricultural TFP from peak to
trough was 20 percent in Soviet Russia versus 41 percent in China. This is consistent with
the more radical way of transforming agriculture in China during the Great Leap Forward.
The rates of recovery post 1962 in China and post 1932 in Soviet Russia were rather similar
with a slightly higher trend growth in China (7.6 percent from 1962 to 1966 in China versus 5.8
percent from 1932 to 1938 in Soviet Russia). Second, non-agricultural TFP recovered quickly in
China and had faster trend growth (1.9 percent from 1960 to 1976 in China versus 1.7 percent
from 1933 to 1940 in Soviet Russia). Third, the intersectoral labor wedge was permanently
lowered in Soviet Russia while recovered to the pre-GLF levels in China. The behavior of the
components of the wedge were also different. The consumption component of the wedge in
Russia fell less than in China reflecting a less severe fall in agricultural consumption and being
farther away from subsistence. The production component of the intersectoral labor wedge was
permanently lowered in Soviet Russia compared with a decline and then recovery in China.
   Table 6 shows the contribution of each factor. We summarize the results as follows. If
China followed Soviet industrialization and collectivization policies the results in terms of GDP
growth would be comparable to a combination of the Great Leap Forward and the post-1962
retrenchment but the share of labor would have been lower under Soviet policies. The quick
reversal of the policies under the Great Leap Forward led to a significantly higher labor wedge in
China but coincided with the recovery of the losses in agricultural and non-agricultural TFP. In
contrast, Soviet collectivization would have achieved a long-term reduction in the labor wedge
at a cost of a long-term reduction in manufacturing TFP. The decline in the intersectoral labor
wedge in the counterfactual would have happened due to two opposing factors. On one hand,
there is a significant decrease in the production component of the wedge, that we emphasized
as an important feature of Stalin’s policies in Cheremukhin et al. (2013). On the other hand,
a milder effect of disruption in consumption of agricultural goods resulted in a smaller fall and
a higher level after recovery of the consumption component of the wedge in the counterfactual.

7     Analyzing the economy in 1978-2012

In this section, we first perform a wedge-accounting exercise for the period of 1978-2012, using
the same procedure as in the last section. Second, we simulate the continuation in the post-GLF
(1967-75) trends of the policies in the post-1978 period to provide a benchmark against which
to measure the success of the post-1978 reforms. We then discuss extensive historical evidence
consistent with our findings. Finally, we describe an extension to the three sector model with
private and state firms and provide further decomposition of TFP growth in non-agriculture.

7.1   Wedge Accounting 1978-2012

Table 7 summarizes the results. Compared with the counterfactual of fixed 1978 wedges and
no TFP growth, annual GDP growth increased by 9.4 percentage points and the share of labor
force in agriculture decreased by 36.9 percentage points.
    For GDP growth (9.4 percent per year), two most important factors were the growth of non-
agricultural TFP XM (5.8 percentage points) and the decrease in the intersectoral wedges (1.1
percent). Agricultural TFP contributed 0.8 percentage points. Two components of the labor
wedge played the key role – the decrease in the consumption component (0.5 percent) and the
production component (0.7 percentage points) of the wedge. Together these two components
account for 1.2 percentage points of GDP growth. The change in the mobility component and
intersectoral capital wedge plays a minor role.
    The change in the share of labor force in agriculture (-36.9 percentage points) is predom-
inantly determined by the decrease in the intersectoral wedges (-21.6 percentage points) and



                                                  35
the combined effect of sectoral TFP growth. Two components of the intersectoral wedges play
the key role – the consumption (-10.6 percent) and the production (-16.7 percentage points)
components. These two subcomponents play the same role as the increase in manufacturing
TFP (-10.6 percentage points) and agricultural TFP (-12.2 percentage points). The worsening
in the mobility component accounted for 6.7 percentage points of the change in the share of
labor force in agriculture.
   The investment wedge overall plays a minor role for the whole period and we report it as
the part of the other category in the table. However, we also performed a finer decomposition
by the subperiods and find that it was an important contributor to growth in the 1990s and
2000s. The average wedge was negative and implied an investment subsidy in the order of 5
percent. The main effect of the wedge was that it led to an increase in investment as a share
in GDP. Compared with the counterfactual of no subsidy, the investment wedge accounts for
1.1 percentage points of annual growth in the 1990s and for 1.5 percentage points of annual
growth in the 2000s.
   We conclude that more than 50 percent of GDP growth is explained by growth in non-
agricultural TFP and 11 percent are explained by the decline in the consumption and production
components of the intersectoral wedges. The key factors behind the change of the share of labor
force in agriculture is the reduction in intersectoral wedges and TFP growth in equal measures.

7.2       Comparison with post-GLF trends

In this section, we consider an important benchmark against which to measure the success of
the reforms. Specifically, we compare the data for 1978-2012 to the simulated Chinese economy
with the post-GLF trends in wedges and TFPs.31 In Figure 6, the paths in the data are
represented by solid lines, the paths used in the wedge accounting exercise by dashed lines, and
post-GLF trends are represented by dotted lines. The results of the simulations are presented in
Figure 7 where the dotted line is the counterfactual behavior of the post-1978 economy without
reforms.
       Table 832 summarizes the results. The reforms generate additional 4.2 percentage points of
annual GDP growth. The main factors are the faster growth of non-agricultural TFP (4.4 versus
2.0 percentage points) that generates 3 percentage points of GDP growth and the faster decrease
in the intersectoral wedges that generates 1 percentage point of additional GDP growth. The
faster decrease in the consumption component (-1.8 versus -1.5 percentage points) generates
0.2 percentage points of growth; the faster decrease in the production component (-2.4 versus
-0.5 percentage points) generates 0.6 percentage points of additional growth, and the faster
decrease in the intersectoral capital wedge (-1 percent versus 0 percentage points) generates 0.2
percentage points of growth.
       The dominant factors in the decrease in the share of labor force in agriculture (-23.9 percent-
age points) are the decrease in the production component of the labor wedge (-14 percentage
points) and faster manufacturing TFP growth (-6.9 percentage points).
       We conclude that the reforms yielded a significant growth and structural transformation
differential compared with the continuation of post-GLF trends. About 3/4 of the growth
differential is due to the increased growth of non-agricultural TFP; 1/4 of the growth differential
is due to the faster reduction in the intersectoral wedges. The reductions in these components
are also dominant forces behind the change in the share of labor force in agriculture.
  31
      Note that we are keeping population growth the same as in the post-1978 data and do not consider the
effects of demography.

force in the agriculture and to GDP growth of the data versus the counterfactual simulation, as in all of the

7.3     Historical evidence

In this section, we discuss historical evidence that is consistent with the behavior of the wedges
and their components in the decomposition above.

7.3.1    TFP growth

The trend post-GLF TFP growth before 1978 was 2.4 percent per year in agriculture and 1.9
percent per year in the non-agricultural sector. After 1978, these growth rates increased to
3.9 percent and 4.4 percent, respectively. The acceleration of productivity growth was however
uneven across time and across sectors.
   In 1978-85, TFP in agriculture grew 4.7 percent annually - faster than non-agricultural
TFP at 3.4 percent annually. After 1985 agricultural TFP growth slowed down to 3.7 percent
and was outpaced by the growth of non-agricultural TFP at 4.6 percent annually. We now
discuss the reforms of 1978-1985 in more detail. The reforms started by the Third Plenary
Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party (December 1978) which (i)
scaled down production teams, (ii) raised agricultural prices both for within-quota (by 17
percent) and above-quota production (by 30-50 percent), and (iii) allowed farmers to sell their
produce in local and remote markets (Lin, 1988, Lin, 2012, p. 155). Another key change, the
move from collective farming to the household responsibility system (HRS), was not a top-
down reform but instead emerged from the bottom up. In December 1978, the peasants of the
Xiaogang village — forced by bad weather and low harvest of 1978 – secretly agreed to effectively
break the commune into individual household production units where each household would be


                                                    39
responsible for its own production. This brought outstanding results which were discussed in
the Central Rural Work Conference in the end of 1979. The Conference decided to allow the
introduction of the HRS in the poorest areas. Following its success in 1980, the government
made a decision to spread the system to all households in 1981 — even though the very Third
Plenum of the 11th Central Committee in 1978 officially banned decollectivization (Xu, 2011).
By the end of 1981, 45 percent of rural households were in the HRS, and by the end of 1984
this number reached 99.8 percent (Lin, 2012). At this point, the HRS assigned the land to
individual households for 15 years (Lin, 1992).
       There is a consensus in the literature that the fast growth of agricultural productivity
in 1978-85 is due to agricultural market liberalization. It is useful to divide the effects of
agricultural reforms into two primary factors: (1) the direct increase in the incentives and,
consequently, efficiency, due to the introduction of the Household Responsibility System and
(2) the indirect effect on incentives and efficiency of the market and price reform. The empirical
studies of the effect of these reforms (Lin, 1988, McMillan, Whalley, and Zhu 1989; Lin 1992,
Wen, 1993, see a survey in Huang, Otsuka, Rozelle, 2008) show that improved incentives due
to the introduction of the household responsibility system explained the vast majority of TFP
growth in agriculture during this period. Both McMillan, Whalley, and Zhu (1989) and Lin
(1992)33 also find a significant effect of the increase in agricultural prices albeit the effect of
prices is much smaller than the effect of the HRS.34 There are other factors that were consistent
with the increase in the productivity during this period. Fan (1991) confirms the predominant
importance of the institutional change but also attributes about a third of the output growth
to technological change which, however, may also be attributed to institutional reforms (Wen,
1993). Huang and Rozelle (1996) argue that technological adoption played the most significant
role (and slightly higher than that of the institutional reform) in the productivity growth and
rice yields and that the effects of the reform may be overestimated.35 Zhang and Carter (1997)
argue that the magnitudes of the effects of institutional reforms in the previous studies may be
  33
      See also Qian (2008).
  34
      The immediate impact of the reform may seem implausible. Indeed, the reforms in agriculture were just
announced in the end of 1978; their full impact could only be salient in 1980 at the earliest. The improvements
in productivity in the years 1978 and partially 1979 may therefore be consistent with the factors related to the
rise of Deng to leadership and the general improvements in quality of governance after the chaos of late Maoism
(MacFarquhar, 1991).
   35
      They also argue that the HRS system might have in some cases slowed down technology adoption – e.g.,
slowed adoption of hybrid rice by 12 percent in the early 1980s.



                                                      40
somewhat overestimated if one takes into account the weather fluctuations.
       After 1985, agricultural TFP continued to grow — although at a much lower rate (2.8 per-
cent per year on average). This slowdown is consistent with the following facts. First, the fast
growth of 1978-85 was difficult to sustain as it started from a very low base and the initial gains
were relatively easy to achieve through introducing basic incentives and raising procurement
prices (Lin, 2012). Second, after the impressive results in agriculture, the government’s focus
moved to developing the urban rather than the rural sector. The government even reduced the
relative agricultural prices after 1984 (Lin, 1992). Huang (2012) argues that “the rural policy
reversals coincided closely in timing with the assumption of power by a new group of leaders
in the aftermath of the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown.” The pro-rural economic policymakers
lost power to urban technocrats from Shanghai (Huang and Qian 2010) who focused on the
urban infrastructure investments at the expense of the rural sector. Third, further agricultural
reforms were postponed. Most importantly, land remained state-owned. Tenure security and
tenant rights were strengthened only in the early 2000s. The Rural Land Contract Law was
adopted in 2002 and took effect in 2003 (Huang, Otsuka, and Rozelle, 2008).36 Article 20 of
the Law established tenure length for arable land to be 30 years (with grassland ranges at
30-50 years and forestland for 30-70 years). At the same time, the market liberalization and
price reforms intensified post-1985 (we discuss them in more detail later) and played a more
significant role than in 1978-1984 in the increase in productivity (see e.g., Figure 1 in de Braw,
et al. (2004) for the estimates of the yearly impact of the gains of the market reforms in 1985-
1995 and a comparison with the incentive reforms). There are also several studies that argue
for the importance of technological progress. Huang and Rozelle (1996) argue that in 1985-90,
technology adoption accounts for all of the increase in rice yields. Liu and Wang (2005) show
that the technological progress plays a dominant role in the recovery of agricultural production
during 1991-1999 following the stagnation of the late 1980s. Chen et al. (2008) studying the
TFP growth in agriculture in 1990-2003 reach the same conclusion with regards to technologi-
cal progress attributing it to the delayed effect of the market reforms in the late 1980s. For a
more detailed overview of the developments in agriculture in the post-reform period we refer
the reader to Huang, et al. (2008).
  36
    The length of land use tenure is an important determinant of productive incentives and therefore of TFP;
see Brandt, Li, and Rozelle (1998) for empirical evidence.



                                                    41
       In contrast with agricultural productivity, in 1978-85 the growth of non-agricultural TFP
was relatively slow (3.4 percent per year) — although higher than in 1952-78 (1.9 percent per
year). Kuan et al. (1988) studies productivity change in Chinese industry from 1953 to 1985 and
argue that “post-1978 shift in the relative contribution of factor accumulation and productivity
growth represents a dramatic departure from the previous 25 years of industrial growth [in favor
of growth of TFP]”. They argue that the increase in productivity growth may be due to several
factors: (1) simultaneous changes in policy (such as reduced state procurement in investment
goods) and institutions (decentralization of authority over production and investment); (2)
increased emphasis on the consumer goods manufacturing; (3) delayed effect of redirection of
the funds from the underdeveloped provinces towards coastal industrial areas.
       Only after 1985 did non-agricultural TFP growth accelerate to 4.6 percent per year. This
is consistent with the fact that China undertook substantial pro-market reforms in the non-
agricultural sector but these reforms mostly started in 1985.37 Before that, the incentives within
large urban non-agricultural firms basically remained the same as in the command economy
of the pre-1978 period. Before 1985, the only two exceptions in the non-agricultural reforms
were the introduction of foreign-owned firms and the small rural firms. The Law on Chinese-
Foreign Equity Joint Ventures was passed already in 1979 but the contribution of FDI to
China’s macroeconomic performance remained very small. The firms funded by foreign capital
employed only 60 thousand people in 1985, 660 thousand in 1990, and 18 million people in
2010 (Huang, 2012). The contribution of small rural firms (so called “township and village
enterprises”, or TVE) was much more important38 . These firms did not exist in 1978; but by
1985 12 million TVEs already employed 70 million people (Huang, 2012). These firms were
spawned by the rural reform as labor was freed by growth in agricultural TFP and the rural
residents were allowed to get non-farm jobs (see Yang and Zhou, 1999). The TVEs were not
controlled by the central government, and it was in the interest of the local governments to
make them grow to reduce poverty (Xu, 2011). The growth of TVEs — which continued after
1985 as well — was also supported by the financial reform. Huang (2012) cites a 1980 Politburo
document on the reform of rural credit cooperatives that foresaw the expansion of rural credit.
The reform took place in 1983, when the Agricultural Bank of China decentralized its control
  37
     While government started to increase autonomy and profit retention for some firms already since 1980, the
scale of this reform was too small until 1985 (Jefferson and Rawski, 1994, Groves et al., 1994).
  38
     See an extensive discussion of the TVEs and the causes of their growth in Naughton (1996, p. 144-169).

of rural credit cooperatives (Huang, 2012).
   The growth of TVEs is consistent with a moderate acceleration of TFP growth in 1978-
85 relative to pre-reform era. But the most important changes in the non-agricultural sector
came after 1984; this is consistent with the rapid acceleration of non-agricultural TFP growth
in 1985-2012 (4.6 percent per year on average). Building on the success of the household
responsibility system in agriculture, the government introduced a dual-pricing system and a
contract management responsibility system in state-owned industrial enterprises (Wu and Zhao,
1987, Groves et al., 1994, Chen, 1995, Lau et al., 2000). This decision was made in several
steps. In May 1984, the State Council issued the “Ten Regulations” (more formally, “On
Further Expansion of Decision Making Power on the Part of State Run Industrial Enterprises”
called “Ten Regulations”) which distinguished between the planned economy and the non-
planned economy. The latter was supposed to function as a market economy provided that
the enterprises fulfilled the plan; however, prices for above-the-plan production could not be
more than 20 percent higher or less than 20 percent lower than state prices (Lau et al., 2000).
In October 1984, the Third Plenum of the 12th Central Committee adopted “A Decision on
Economic Reform” which foresaw market pricing for agricultural goods and dual pricing for
raw materials and producer goods (Wu and Zhao, 1987). In February 1985, the State Price
Administration and the State Material Administration cancelled the 20 percent limit.
   The contract management responsibility system (CMRS) provided the state-owned indus-
trial enterprises with autonomy to retain profits and flexibility to set wages and bonuses. The
system was rolled out gradually and by 1987 it covered 95 percent of state-owned enterprises
(Choe and Yin, 2000). Groves et al. (1994) show that the introduction of the CMRS had a
significant positive effect on productivity. Furthermore, Li (1997) shows that over 87 percent of
industrial TFP growth in the 1980s was attributable to improved incentives, intensified product
market competition, and improved factor allocation.
   These policies of “marketization and corporatization” of the state-owned enterprises (SOE)
were then followed by their partial and full privatization. Although the above mentioned Central
Committee’s “Decision on Economic Reform” (October 1984) clearly stated the commitment
to public ownership, already in the mid-1990s the Chinese government decided to start a pri-
vatization program. In September 1993, the Third Plenum of the 14th Central Committee
admitted the possibility of small-scale privatization. Selected provinces had started privatizing


                                               43
small SOEs already since 1992 (Cao et al. 1999), but only in 1995, the central government
announced small-scale privatization as a national policy (“retain the large, release the small”
policy). Small-scale privatization was soon followed by large-scale privatization. In 1997, the
15th Party Congress decided that large state-owned enterprises should also be privatized (Cao
et al., 1999). The effects of privatization on firm-level TFP were generally positive (see surveys
of microeconomic studies in Guriev and Megginson, 2007, and Estrin et al., 2009), especially in
those firms that were privatized by the management (Gan et al., 2010). Although the largest
SOEs were privatized only partially (with the government remaining a majority shareholder),
even in these firms privatization brought higher transparency and some improvement in corpo-
rate governance.
   We now summarize some available estimates of the productivity growth in Chinese industry,
recognizing that we only mention a small number of them. First, we refer to Brandt, Rawski,
and Sutton (2008) for a comprehensive study of China’s industrial development. Jefferson and
Rawski (1994, Table 4) and Jefferson, et al. (2000) discuss enterprise reform in Chinese industry
and argue that from the 1980 to early 1990s there was a modest increase in productivity for the
state industry but the collective-sector productivity (urban and township and township-village
enterprises) appears considerably higher. At the same time, there is uncertainty due to data
limitations about the extent of the productivity growth of TVEs. Jefferson, et al. (2000) find
that there was a deceleration of productivity growth in the 1990s. Chen, et al. (2011, Table 1)
summarize various estimates of the productivity growth noting that there is large variability
in them. Dougherty et al. (2007) find significantly higher productivity growth in private
compared with the public firms and attribute these to the progress towards building market
economy. Brandt et al. (2012) study a panel of firms between 1998 and 2007 and present the
comprehensive set of firm-level productivity estimates for Chinese manufacturing that spans
China’s entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO). They find rapid productivity growth
and argue that about two-thirds of it can be contributed to net entry and the growth of entrants.
Finally, Tian and Yu (2012) provide the results of the metastudy of TFP growth in China.

7.3.2   Consumption component of the intersectoral labor wedge

The first important policy that affected the behavior of the consumption component of the
labor wedge is the reform of the price and distribution system. The economy experienced a


                                               44
gradual shift from the system in which a large number of prices were planned, agricultural and
non-agricultural goods were rationed, and the severe shortages were a norm.39 It is useful to
organize the discussion of the chronology of the main stages of the price reform from its start
to the late 1980s following Wiemer and Lu (1993): the adjustment period (1979-1984) and the
liberalization period (1985-1988). In 1978-1983, the prices received by farmers were rapidly
increased by a series of decrees but the state distribution system remained largely in place. By
1984, Whyte (1996, p. 61) argues that the most significant shortages of the key agricultural
goods had been substantially decreased. At the same time, the significant shortages remained
in the non-agricultural goods, especially, energy and raw materials (Naughton 1996, p. 222).
The increase in the agricultural prices and the reduction in rationing, and the decrease in
shortages of food are consistent with the increase in the wedge during that period. The speed
of liberalization significantly increased in 1984 with an effort to decontrol the prices of the
non-staple foods such as poultry and vegetables (Naughton 1996, p. 248). Importantly, the
price reforms also majorly expanded to non-agriculture. In 1984, for 30 types of products
including raw materials in the short supply such as copper and zinc, the out-of-plan market
activity was permitted (Wiemer and Lu, 1993 p.124). In April 1985, prices were freed for
many consumer durables such as sewing machines and watches.40 The markets for key items
with the intense excess demand were also gradually freed – such as famous-brand bicycles in
1986 and famous brand cigarettes and liquor in 1988. (Wiemer and Lu, 1993, p. 132). This
experience is consistent with a significant decline in the consumption component of the wedge.
The concerns over inflation in the late 1980-s brought partial retrenchment of the price reforms
and reimposition of some controls consistent with a brief upward increase in the price wedge.
In the late 1980s, the main focus was on market liberalization by reduction in the restrictions
on trading of commodities and commercialization of the state grain trading system.41 The
  39
      Hsu (1991) describes evolution of economic theories in China in 1979-1988 and their influence on policy
development. He argues (p. 23-24, and Section 5 for the detailed analysis of the price reform) that Kornai’s
(1980) theory of shortage as the systemic feature of the socialist economies became widely accepted in China
and shaped the increased support of reforming the price system (see also Wong 1986). Of particular interest
is the discussion of the two schools of thought: (1) that enterprise reform should precede the price reform (Li
Yining was the leader of this “enterprise (ownership) reform school), and (2) that the price reform should be
implemented together with the enterprise reform (Wu Jinglian was the leader of this “(integrated) price reform
school) (Hsu 1991, p. 157).
   40
      Decline in rationing of some non-agricultural goods happened slightly earlier. Derationing of textile and
cloth led to virtual disappearance of coupons for cloth by 1983. During 1982-1983 price controls were eliminated
on more than 500 small consumer goods such as shoelaces and buttons (Naughton 1996, p. 126).
   41
      For the detailed account of price and procurement reforms in 1979-1988 see Sicular (1988a,b)


                                                      45
1992-1993 saw the renewal of the price reforms with a rapid progress toward market prices,
particularly for crucial producer goods such as steel and full decontrolling of petroleum prices
in 1993 (Naughton 1996, p 289-290). Overall, by the beginning of the 1990s China’s price
and distribution system became essentially dominated by the markets. Yang and Li (2008)
cite China Reform and Development Report Expert Group (CRDR) that in 1993 the central
government only intervened to set the prices of 7 food commodities in retail markets, 6 farm
products in agricultural procurement, and 33 producer goods versus 158, 113 and 1,086 number
of goods in 1978, respectively. By 1991, household consumption expenditure on rationed goods
was only 5 to 10 percent in the cities and virtually zero in the villages versus 60 to 80 percent in
1978 (Weimer and Lu, 1993, p. 134)42 . Huang et al. (2007) summarize: “with the disappearance
of the wedges from the marketing and procurement system [in agriculture], the remaining
wedges after the mid-1990s reflect only trade policies and not trade and domestic policies.” We
conclude that by the beginning of the 1990s, the main effects of the price reform for agricultural
and non-agricultural goods and the corresponding reduction in the consumption component of
the wedge have been completed. One important exception was the primary energy sector,
especially coal production that supplied 70 percent of China’s energy needs in 1992. This
sector had a very high level of price and quantity control. The reform of the sector started only
in 1992 and was gradually implemented over the next five years. This likely contributed to the
decline in the consumption component of the wedge even post 1993.43
       The second important factor behind the decline in the consumption component of the labor
wedge is the housing reform. While housing shortage was prevalent since at least 1950s, it was
particularly severe at the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1976. The average floor space per
person then was 3 sq.m. (Wang and Murie 1996; Tables 1-3 in Lee (1988) for the decline in
the residential floor space since 1952). In 1990, the average living space available per person
in the urban areas was only 6.7 square meters, well below the housing norm of 8 sq.m. per
person. (Chai 1996, p. 274). Wang and Murie (1996) argue that very low rents, when the
rent for a typical flat in a city cost less than a pack of cigarettes, were the main cause of the
  42
     See also Gao et al. (1996) and Wang and Chern (1992) for models of demand in China under rationing.
  43
     The price wedges remained for some staple foods such as rice and maize and on cotton because of the
desire to provide low-cost input for processing sector (Anderson, et al. 2008). In the first half of the 1990s, the
most important changes were the significant reduction in the compulsory quotas and further increases in the
proportion of the procurement done at market prices. The late 1990s saw further decrease in the wedges on
rice, reductions in trade protection and restrictions on export and import and by 2000 “virtually disappeared”
(Anderson, et al. 2008). These relatively minor changes likely had a small effect on the price wedge.


                                                        46
shortages and the low quality of the housing. Fleisher et al. (1997) provide some evidence that
the migration to the higher income provinces was hindered by the availability of housing due
to below equilibrium prices. Wang and Kinsey (1994) argue that strict rationing of housing
(and only partial rationing of food) was prevalent at least until 1987.
       The major nationwide housing reform started in 199444 with the formal publication of the
resolution of the conference The Decision on Deepening the Urban Housing Reform45 . The
key provisions of the housing reform were (Table 2 in Wang and Murie 1996): (1) to change
the nature of the housing from a welfare service to a consumable commodity; (2) to change
the system of distribution from in-kind and free to monetary and market-based; (3) to change
the system of ownership and tenure from public to private; (4) to move from the subsidized
minimum rent to the market rent.
       An important recent paper provides a detailed empirical analysis of the impact of housing
reform on consumption of housing and calculates the degree of misallocation prior to the reform
(Wang 2011). The misallocation is estimated by comparing housing consumption (both size
and amenities) for households living in subsidized units assigned by their state employers with
households with similar characteristics living in private housing. The estimates of mismatch
are equal to 15 percent less housing services than the households would have chosen in the
private market. Furthermore, the system of state allocation of housing reduced the welfare of
state-owned residents by 25 percent relative to a system in which instead of subsidized housing
the households were able to freely choose the market housing.
       The 1998 decision to further move from in-kind provision of housing by state companies
to cash subsidies allowed to significantly increase house purchases from private developers.
Deng et al. (2014) argue that it was “the turning point of China’s housing reform” and the
key strategic part of the overall economic reform, especially in the light of possible post-1997
  44
     The discussion is based on the comprehensive survey of the reform by Wang and Murie (1996) unless noted
otherwise.
  45
     Prior to 1994, there were several experiments with the housing reform. The first nationwide experiment
was started in 1980 with the total of about half a million square meters (about 10000 units) of housing available
for sale. The experiment was formally abandoned in 1982 due to low demand. The second experiment in
1982-85 carried out pilot tests of sales of housing with about 10 million sq. m. (about 200000 units) sold. The
third experiment in 1986-1988 in Yantai city in Shandong province offered the more comprehensive approach
of adjusting the low rents, introducing housing subsidy, and promoting sales of the public sector housing. The
National Housing Reform Plan was issued formally in February 1988 but was slow to get implemented at least
until the update of the resolution in 1991. Yet, prior to the late 1993 Wang and Murie (1996) conclude that
“the current situation is far from that aimed at in the reform plans”. Wang (2011, 2012) and Deng et al. (2014)
also argue that the major reform started in 1994. See also Iyer et al. (2013).


                                                       47
Asian crisis slowdown. By the early 2000s, the housing market was mostly deregulated. This
is evidenced for example by the drastic reduction of the housing subsidies. Khan and Riskin
(1998, 2005) provide evidence that housing subsidies reduced from 18 percent to 10 percent
of disposable urban income in 1988-95 and from 10 percent to 2 percent in 1995-2002 (in real
terms, the per capita housing subsidy declined in these years by 70 percent)46 . Overall, the
per capita floor space has increased to 24.97 meters in 2004 (Deng et al. 2014)47 and the home
ownership of 80 percent in China was among the highest in the world (Wang 2011).
       Even after 2002, deregulation continued through softening of the hukou system which is
quintessentially a housing ration as it serves as a barrier to a free housing market48 . Effectively,
urban households’ consumption of services is subsidized through urban public good provision;
at the same time there are no wedges in the consumption of food (either for urban or rural
citizens). Therefore, a stricter hukou barrier translates into a higher price wedge49 . As hukou
continued to soften, the price wedge continued to decline. We also note an important recent
paper by Garriga et al. (2014) who develop a model of how structural change affected the house
and land prices in the cities, capturing 2/3 of the change in prices.
       We now discuss additional indirect evidence that also is consistent with the decline in the
consumption component of the wedge. First, the World Bank’s Development Research Group
“Estimates of wedges to Agricultural Incentives” estimates price wedges for 85 countries and for
a number of those covers the periods of 1955-2011.50 Anderson et al. (2008) provide a detailed
description of the methodology of the project and use China as one of the main examples
of application of this methodology. Their primary measure of wedges is the Consumer Tax
Equivalent (CTE) calculated as the difference in the price that the consumers pay for a given
food commodity and the international price at the border, taking into account the differences in
  46
      It is also important to note that the housing subsidy was much more important than the price subsidy even
in the beginning of the 1990s, further supporting our claim that housing reform was the main reason behind
the reduction of the price wedge in the 1990s. The price subsidy on food and fuel in 1992 was only 4 percent of
the urban disposable income (Yang and Zhou 1999); net non-housing subsidies declined to 1.25 percent in 1995
and to negligible 0.07 percent in 2002 (Khan and Riskin 2005).
   47
      Of course, this increase in housing per capita reflects not only the removal of shortages but the overall
growth in the economy and real incomes.
   48
      It is interesting to note that the hukou system’s restriction on housing may affect even the high income
migrants. The governments of more than thirty big cities have implemented a policy of restricted transactions
since 2011 that did not allow purchases of a new house without a local hukou (Song 2014).
   49
      Wang and Zuo (1999) provide evidence that rural migrants not only pay much more but also receive inferior
housing.
   50

product quality. The implicit subsidy to agricultural goods was 42.6 percent in the beginning of
the 1980s and reduced virtually to zero by 1995. The implicit tax on non-agricultural tradable
goods declined steadily from 43 percent to about 4 percent in the early 2000s. While this
relative terms of trade wedge also reflects the trade frictions and does not directly translate
into the consumption component of the wedge, the behavior of this measure closely tracks the
behavior of the consumption component of the wedge. Secondly, the decline in the consumption
component is consistent with consumer revolution which started in the 1980s and drastically
expanded the variety of goods and services available (Chai 1996, p. 274). Indeed, consider
a model in which a consumer values a variety of agricultural and non-agricultural goods but
the planner prohibits production of some goods. It is easy to show that an in increase in the
share of the newly available non-agricultural goods reduces the consumption component of the
wedge by reducing the relative measure of the unproduced goods. The third kind of evidence
refers to the decline in the degree of unequal exchange between agriculture and manufacturing
(see Sheng 1993a and Zhang and Zhao, 2000). Yan Ruizhen et al. (Table 5.2 in Sheng 1993a)
estimate that the degree of uneven exchange decreased from 71.9 percent in 1978 to 15.4 in
1987. Niu et al. (Table 7 in Zhang and Zhao 2000) estimate that the percent by which state
purchasing price is below “real value” for agricultural products decreased from 39 percent in
1981 to 29 percent in 1989.

7.3.3   Production component of the intersectoral labor wedge

Early work of Naughton (1992) argued that relaxation of state monopoly over industry is
“a single simple interpretative framework [that] explains a great deal” about “a range of the
complex changes that Chinese economy is undergoing” and that “The most crucial step in
economic reform was the ending of the government monopoly over the economy, and especially
over industrial production and investment.” (Naughton 1996).
   We first focus on studies that measure the markup in industry and its decline which provides
direct evidence corresponding to the decline in the production component of the labor wedge.
An influential paper by Li (1997) studies panel data on 789 state-owned enterprises between
1980 and 1989 and finds that the markup declined by 15 percent. Furthermore, he finds that
industry’s markup in 1980 is positively correlated with the growth of investment suggesting
that the industries with higher initial profit margins experienced larger entry and expansion.


                                              49
He also concludes that in 1989 monopoly power was still significant.51 Bai and Qian (2010)
compute labor shares of income and argue that the results of Li (1997) for 1978-1998 were
due to the increase in market competition and the decline in the share of SOEs.52 A related
argument is provided by Dong and Putterman (2000) that state monopsony in industry was an
important cause of slowness of structural change with respect to employment in the pre-reform
period. Dong and Putterman (2002) study panel data for 967 Chinese SOEs in 1980-1990 and
provide extensive direct evidence on the positive gap between the marginal product of labor
and the full wages (including all forms of compensation) and the reasons behind the significant
decline in this wedge. They find (Dong and Putterman 2002, Table III) that the mean gap
across all industries decreased from 263 percent in 1980 to 139 percent in 1990. There is also
evidence of significant dispersion in the misallocation and its decline across different industries.
Among the lowest quartile, the gap decreased from 37 to 18 percent, while among the third
quartile it decreased from 300 percent to 184 percent. Their analysis points to two statistically
significant factors behind such decline. The most important reason is the increase in product
market competition due to the decline in the share of SOEs. For example, the gap fell faster
in the consumer goods sector than in the producer industry and in provinces where reforms
were more rapid. The second factor, present in several years, is the increase in bonuses and
performance pay that affected rent-sharing between enterprises and workers.53
       We now turn to the indirect evidence that corresponds to the decline in non-agricultural
monopoly power. Naughton (1992) provides evidence of a disproportionate reduction in prof-
itability of sectors that in the beginning of the reforms had high profitability and those with
low technological barriers to entry. He interprets this as evidence of a decline in monopoly rent
due to entry and particularly the entry of non-state industry. Naughton (1992, Table 1) ranks
industries by the reduction in profitability between 1980 and 1989. Among the sectors that ex-
perienced the largest such decline are light industrial sectors with initial high profitability and
  51
     Another important finding is that growth in bonuses and improved market competition accounted for 49
percent of TFP growth. That is, reduction in the production component of the wedge and the monopoly power
of the state owned enterprises also had the effect on TFP that we discussed in the previous section.
  52
     They also find that for 1998-2005, the increase in monopoly power was one of the main reasons for the
decrease in the labor share of income in industry. At the same time, they find an increase in the labor share of
income in services. On the contrary Cao and Liu (2011) find that industry concentration decreased particularly
fast for state owned enterprises in 1998-2007. Li, Liu and Wang (2012) in a model of China’s state capitalism
draw a distinction between the more competitive downstream industries and monopolized upstream industries
dominated by SOEs.
  53
     See also Dong and Putterman (1996) for the analysis of decline in monopoly power of rural TVEs.



                                                      50
low technological barriers to entry. For example, in textiles the profitability declined from 69
percent in 1980 to only 15.8 percent in 1989. Rubber products, culture and sport items, drinks
and similar sectors experiences a decline in profitability of more than 20 percent.54 At the
same time, in 1989 a large number of sectors with significant monopoly power remained.55 An
alternative explanation to the decline in profitability of state owned enterprises is the increase
in the share of labor compensation (Fan and Woo 1996, Sachs and Woo 2001). Either a reduc-
tion in monopoly power or an increase in the share of labor compensation led to the decline
in the production component of the wedge. Holz (2002) provides a careful examination of the
two hypotheses and argues that together they explain most of the variation in profitability. A
recent OECD study (Conway et al. 2010) documents a significant increase in product market
regulation and competition from 1998 to 2007. They report (Conway et al. 2010, Table 2) that
out of 590 sectors in 1988, 88 were highly concentrated (15 percent) and 70 were concentrated
(11 percent). In 2007, out of 521 sectors, 33 were highly concentrated (6 percent) and 36 were
concentrated (7 percent). At the same time, they argue that in some sectors such as aviation,
telecommunication and rare earth industry market competition might have recently decreased.
Brandt et al. (2012) find significant pro-competitive effects of trade liberalization following the
entrance of China to the WTO.
       In the above discussion, we focus on evidence for the reduction in the non-agricultural
monopoly wedge. Ideally, we would have liked to provide evidence on the relative evolution of
the monopoly wedges in agriculture. However, there is lack of studies on the evolution of the
monopoly wedge in agriculture (with the exception of Bai and Qian (2010) who compute the
factor income shares in agriculture and non-agriculture but study the determinants only of the
industrial income share).
       Overall, our evidence on the decline in the production component of the wedge is consistent
with the conclusions of the literature that the increase in competition was one of the key
elements of the reforms. Hsu (1991, p.39) argues that one of the key goals of the reformist
economists in China in the 1980s was to eliminate the inefficiency of the monopoly and that
  54
     Naughton (1992) also extensively discusses the effect of the price reform, in particular in agriculture, on
the decline in monopoly power in industry. For example, the largest reductions in profitability came from the
industries producing consumer goods by processing agricultural products. Therefore, our discussion of the price
reform is also relevant for the behavior of the production component of the wedge. In the appendix, we sketch
a model in which the reduction in procurement affects the production component of the wedge.
  55
     Ahuja (2012) computes a version of the Parente-Prescott model calibrated to China and finds significant
gains to demonopolization.

“this new attitude toward market competition represents a fundamental change in the Chinese
conception of the socialist enterprise”.56 Brandt and Rawski (2008) summarize in their preface
to China’s Great Economic Transformation: “In our view, reform has pushed China’s economy
toward extraordinarily high levels of competition. Despite pockets of monopoly and episodic
local trade barriers, intense competition now pervades everyday economic life.” (p. 14 and
details in Chapters 15, 16, 19). Nicholas Lardy’s “Markets over Mao” (Lardy 2014, p. 23-38)
provides a comprehensive discussion of the dramatic decrease in the monopolization of the
economy during the reforms with the exception of some service and energy sectors.

7.3.4    Mobility component of the labor wedge

There are two most important factors that are associated with the mobility component which
we briefly describe here. On one hand, the hukou system was gradually reduced and labor
mobility became much easier (see Song 2014 for a recent overview of the hukou system and
its evolution)   57 .   This is consistent with the mobility component of the wedge declining. On
the other hand, the higher returns to skills tend to increase the gap between the agricultural
and the non-agricultural wage. On balance, the increase in the skill premium due to human
capital likely plays a dominant role at least starting from the 1990s. Zhang et al.. (2005) find
a dramatic increase in the returns to education in urban China in the 1990s, with the rate of
return to education increasing from 4.0 percent in 1988 to 10.2 percent in 2001.58 This is also
consistent with the evidence in Sicular et al. (2007) who studied the determinants of the rural-
urban income gap in 1995 and 2002 household surveys and concluded that the contribution
of location declined and the contribution of education was increasingly important. Cai et al.
(2008, p. 183-186, 195-198) describe the developments of the Chinese labor market in the
Reform era, summarize the literature and argue that education is the most important barrier
to finding jobs off farm, and that the importance of this factor has significantly increased. They
also describe several studies arguing for the importance of the increase in the skill premium
  56
      This is in contrast with the pre-reform belief that socialism and competition are incompatible as the socialist
enterprises engage in fraternal cooperation rather than in destroying the rivals (Hsu 1991, p. 39).
   57
      At the same time, Chan and Buckingham (2008) argue that the reforms of the hukou system may be
significantly overstated. Specifically, the cumulative effect of these reforms is to shift responsibility for hukou
policies to local governments, which in many cases actually makes permanent migration of peasants to cities
harder than before.
   58
      Meng (2012) argues that returns to college and higher education decreased slightly post 2003 which may
be related to the large influx of graduates due to the 1999 university expansion and an associated decline in
quality.


                                                         52
and education premium. Moreover, they argue that the importance of hukou in affecting labor
mobility significantly decreased over time.

7.4   Decomposing non-agricultural TFP growth with a three sector model

In this section, we extend our 2-sector model by dividing down the non-agricultural sector into
2 sub-sectors: state and non-state. We follow Brandt and Zhu (2010), Brandt, Hsieh, and Zhu
(2008), and Dekle and Vandenbroucke (2012) and relegate the details to the appendix. We
define two wedges in addition to those introduced in the 2-sector model. These two wedges
correspond to the intratemporal wedges in capital and labor allocations between the state
and non-state sectors within non-agriculture. The state and the non-state sectors have the
same production functions. We also follow Brandt and Zhu (2010) assuming that the share
of non-agricultural labor force allocated to the state sector is determined exogenously. When
aggregated to two sectors (agricultural and non-agricultural) the three sector model generates
identical results to the ones described above.
   The three sector model allows us to further investigate the contributions of state and non-
state non-agricultural TFP and the reduction of barriers for reallocation of labor from the state
to the non-state sector.
   Figure 8 presents the calculation of the post-1978 state and non-state non-agricultural sector
TFPs. The annual growth rate of state TFP is equal to 2.4 percent which is remarkably close
to 2.0 percent state sector growth post-GLF. The growth rate of non-state TFP is 13 percent
per year, with TFP increasing by the factor of 10 compared with 1978.
   Figure 9 presents the share of the labor force in the non-agricultural sector. The economy
from 1978 to 2012 experienced a 45 percentage points reduction in this share.
   Table 9 presents a decomposition of the contribution of non-agricultural TFP for the wedge
accounting exercise of section 7.1. Two key factors affect the 5.8 percentage points non-
agricultural TFP’s contribution to GDP growth: private sector TFP growth is responsible
for 3.4 percentage points and the reduction in the state sector is responsible for 1.5 percentage
points. All four factors (private TFP growth, state TFP growth, labor reallocation, and capital
reallocation) contribute to the change in the share of labor force in agriculture.
   Table 10 presents a decomposition of the contribution of non-agricultural TFP for the
exercise that evaluated the gains from reforms in section 7.1. Two key factors explaining the

TFP growth (1.7 percentage points) and the reduction in the state sector (0.8 percentage
points). All four factors contribute to the change in the share of labor force in agriculture.

8    Robustness

We provide extensive robustness checks for all key parameters in the Appendix and summarize
the results briefly here. First, we find that sizable changes in production function factor shares
have only mild effects on the estimates. In particular, a substantial increase in the factor share
of capital in the production function of the non-agricultural sector decreases the contributions
of TFPs and increases the contribution of the mobility component of the intersectoral wedge.
An increase in the factor share of labor implies a slightly bigger contribution of agricultural TFP
while a decrease in the factor share of land implies a slightly smaller contribution of agricultural
TFP to changes in the share of labor force in agriculture. While the effect of changes in these
parameters on the results for the share of labor force in agriculture is small, the effect on results
for GDP growth is negligible.
    Second, a decrease in the degree of substitutability between agricultural and manufacturing
goods makes economic outcomes more sensitive to developments in the agricultural sector, and,
hence, attributes more of the changes in GDP and the share of labor force in agriculture to
agricultural TFP and the consumption component of the intersectoral wedge. The contributions
of other factors are diminished. Given that we deliberately chose a conservative value of the
elasticity of substitution in our baseline calibration, less substitutability between goods (σ = 0.8
or lower values suggested by the literature) reinforces our main results.
    Third, a lower subsistence level γA implies a smaller contribution of agricultural TFP and
a larger contribution of the intersectoral wedges and the inverse is also true. Since we already
set the subsistence level to a relatively high value in the baseline calibration, our main results
represent a conservative estimate of the effects of intersectoral wedges. We find that for the
highest level of γA = 65 that is close to the level of agricultural consumption per capita during



                                                    55
the famine period the contribution of the consumption component of the intersectoral labor
wedge is reduced by about one third, and the contribution of agricultural TFP increases by
one quarter. Conversely, setting a subsistence level lower than our baseline, increases the
contribution of the consumption component of the intersectoral labor wedge and reduces the
contribution of agricultural TFP. Other parameters essentially drop out of the expressions for
changes in wedges and have no effect on the results. For more details and specifics we refer the
reader to the appendix.


9    Projections for 2013-2050

In this brief and more speculative section we project the path of the Chinese economy until
2050. We consider two projections. The first is the continuation of the post-1978 trends which
is the benchmark projection. The second is the imposition of the post-GLF (1966-1978) trends
starting from 2013. This second projection can be viewed as a lower bound on future Chinese
growth.
    Specifically, we project the paths of sectoral TFPs and wedges and then simulate the model
under the chosen paths of exogenous variables. We take the average trends for all wedges for
two periods: 1966-78 and 1978-2012. The ratios of exports to value added by sector and the
ratio of defense spending to GDP are assumed to stay constant at their average 2000-2012
levels. Population and labor force are assumed to grow 0.5 percent annually, which is on the
lower end of rates observed over the 1978-2012 period. The components of the intersectoral
wedges are assumed to keep changing at the same rate as in the corresponding periods. The
intertemporal capital wedge is assumed to converge to its average 2000-2012 level from its 2012
level.
    We assume that both agricultural and non-agricultural TFP continue growing initially at
their average growth rates. However, at their current speed, TFP in both sectors may exceed
the level of TFP in the USA by 2050. We thus assume that after Chinese TFP in either sector
reaches the level of 70 percent of the US TFP, it slows down its growth and exponentially
converges to US trend, as shown in Figure 10. These assumptions imply that non-agricultural
TFP growth will slow down within the next 10 years, while agricultural TFP will keep growing
at current rates until around 2030.
    There are two key differences in the projections. The first is that TFP growth is faster

                                              56
initially (until the convergence and the slowdown) in both sectors in the case of the post-1978
projection. The second is that in the case of projecting post-GLF trends, there is no decline in
the production component of the intersectoral labor wedge.

         Figure 11: Actual and projected economic indicators in China in 2000-2050.


   Figure 11 further describes the simulated path of the Chinese economy. Our post-1978
trend projection implies a stable share of investment in GDP at 40 percent. The movement of
labor from agriculture to other sectors will continue, with the share of labor force in agriculture
declining from 37 percent in 2010 to 28 percent in 2050. The share of value added by the
agricultural sector will reach 2 percent in 2050 from 6 percent currently. The level of GDP
per capita will approach that of the US by 2040 when China is likely to become a developed
country. However, if the economy behaves similarly to what it did under the post-GFL trends,
it would grow slower, and the movement of labor out of agriculture would stop.
   We summarize the results of the wedge accounting decomposition for the simulated and
projected economy for the period 1978-2050 in Table 11 for the benchmark case of continu-
ation of the post-1978 reform trend. Figure 12 presents the same numbers on GDP growth
decomposition in graphical form.

                                    59
   The analysis of Figure 12 can be summarized as follows. As we argued, the key factors for
1978-2012 growth were: non-state, non-agricultural TFP growth and reallocation of labor from
state to non-state non-agriculture; reduction of the wedges, most importantly, the consumption
and the production wedges; and agricultural TFP growth. In the next three decades the key
factors of growth are as follows. The growth in private non-agricultural TFP will continue to
play a major role but its contribution diminishes as the economy approaches the technological
frontier. Similarly, as the state sector diminishes, the relocation of labor from state firms plays
a role smaller that during the 1978-2012 period. The reductions in intersectoral wedges and
their components continue to play an important role. The contribution of the reduction in
the production component of the intersectoral labor wedge is only slightly reduced compared
with the 1978-2012 period. The reduction in the consumption component of the intersectoral
labor wedge, however, is important only in the first decade of the projection as the level of this
component is already quite low.
   We conclude that China’s economy can continue to grow at 7-8 percent per year for another
10 to 15 years. The reduction in wedges – the reallocation of labor from the state to the non-
state, non-agricultural sector and the reduction in the production and consumption components
of the intersectoral wedges – account for 1.5 percentage points of annual growth. Real GDP
growth slows to around 4.5 percent by 2030 and to 3.6 percent in 2036-2050. Reallocation of
labor from state to non-state firms and the decline in the production component of the wedge
accounts for 1.2 percentage points in that period. In other words, as TFP growth slows, the
relative contribution of the policies to reduce wedges in the economy rises from about 20 percent
to 30 percent.
   Finally, we summarize the results of the wedge accounting decomposition for the simulated
and projected economy for the period 1978-2050 in Table 12 for the case of projecting post-GLF
trends. Figure 13 presents the same numbers on GDP growth decomposition in graphical form.
   The main difference in this scenario is a lower contribution to growth of manufacturing TFP
up to 2036, and the lower contribution of the decrease in the production wedge. However, even
in this case of growth slowdown, the economy is projected to grow at 4.5-5 percent until 2036.

10    Conclusions

This paper provides a unified treatment of the 1953-2012 period of economic development of
People’s Republic of China. First, we find the importance of changes in the wedges and their
components for growth and structural transformation. Second, our analysis of 1953-1978 serves
as a key benchmark against which to compare the success of reforms in the post-1978 period.
Third, we provide a careful analysis of the important changes in the economy of China in
1953-2012 and assess the key driving factors behind these changes. As such, the model is a
useful lens through which to view different policies implemented during the time of a significant
transformation of the country.

this set of equations is invertible, so that for any set of data there is a unique set of exogenous

essentially an accounting procedure. This allows us to use counter-factual paths of wedges to
compute the marginal contribution of each wedge to the deviations of data from undistorted
allocations.

12.2    Three-sector model

We extend our 2-sector model by dividing the non-agricultural sector into 2 sub-sectors: state
and non-state. We follow the route taken by Brandt and Zhu (2010) and Dekle and Vanden-
broucke (2012). We only discuss the elements of the model that change when compared with
the 2-sector model. We start with the frictionless benchmark.
   There are three sectors in the economy, agricultural (A), state non-agricultural (S), non-
state non-agricultural (N ). Output in sector i ∈ {A, S, N } is produced according to the Cobb-
Douglas production function
                                                         α      α
                            Yti = Fti Kti , Nti = Xti Kti K,i Nti N,i ,
                                               
                                                                                                    (28)

where Xti , Kti , and Nti are, respectively, total factor productivity, capital stock, and labor in
                                                               i
sector i; αK,i and αN,i satisfy αK,i + αN,i ≤ 1. We denote by FK,t      i
                                                                   and FN,t the derivatives of
Fti with respect to Kti and Nti .
   The S and N sectors produce the same non-agricultural good (M ) which can be consumed,
used to accumulate capital, for foreign trade or for government consumption. The feasibility
condition for non-agricultural goods is:

                           Nt cM     M    M          S    N    M
                               t + ext + Gt + It = Yt + Yt ≡ Yt .                                   (29)

                                                   76
   The capital is allocated to sectors according to

                                     KtA + KtS + KtN = Kt .                                    (30)

   The feasibility constraint for labor is

                                    NtA + NtS + NtN = χt Nt ,                                  (31)

where χt is an exogenously given fraction of working age population.
   Firms in sector i hire capital and labor to maximize profits
                                               αK,i           αN,i
                     Πit = max pit Xti Kti               Nti           − wti Nti − rti Kti ,
                          {Kti ,Nti }

where pN    S
       t = pt = 1.

   Maximization behavior of the firms implies that wti and rti are equal to the marginal product
of capital and labor in sector i in each period.
   We define two wedges in addition to those introduced in the 2-sector model. These two
wedges correspond to the intratemporal distortions in capital and labor allocations between
the state and non-state sectors within non-agriculture. Combining the first-order conditions
of firms in the state and non-state sectors and assuming identical CRS production functions
(αK,S = αK,N ≡ αK,M , αN,S = αN,N ≡ αN,M ,αK,M + αN,M = 1), it follows that:
                                                   αN,M             αK,M
                                  XN         wtN                rtN
                                        
                               1 = tS                                         .                (32)
                                  Xt         wtS                rtS
   This result poses a problem to assuming exogenous processes for ratios of returns to labor
and capital in the state and non-state sectors. If we make assumptions consistent with equation
(32), then any allocation of labor and capital satisfies equilibrium conditions. If we make
assumptions that violate equation (32), then labor and capital are allocated entirely to one of
the two sectors. To eliminate multiplicity of equilibria and corner solutions, we follow the route
taken by Brandt and Zhu (2010): by assuming that the share of non-agricultural labor force
allocated to the state sector is determined exogenously:
                                                      NtS
                                        ψt ≡                 .                                 (33)
                                                   NtS + NtM
   The wedge governing capital reallocation is then defined in the standard way:
                                                      N
                                                     FK,t          rtN
                                    1 + τRS,t ≡       S
                                                               =       .                       (34)
                                                     FK,t          rtS

                                                    77
    All the other wedges remain intact. We need to define some extra variables to compare the
extended model with the 2-sector model. We define production of non-agricultural goods as
the sum of production in the state and non-state sectors:

    The wage differences between state and non-state sectors are determined as follows:
                                                           1                     αK,M

    Changes in τRS,t affect the allocation of capital, and also the relative returns to both capital
and labor. Changes in ψt determine the allocations of both capital and labor.
    The returns to capital and labor in the non-agricultural sector are defined as:

data exactly. This again allows to compute the marginal contribution of each wedge to the
deviations of data from undistorted allocations.

12.3     Computational Details

The goal of the wedge accounting methodology we use in this paper is to quantify the contribu-
tions of changes in wedges towards changes in economic variables. Two economic variables of
particular interest are real GDP and the share of labor force in agriculture. For our procedure
to be an “accounting” procedure, we need to find two paths of wedges: the first (baseline)

                                                            78
path should account for the data exactly, and the second path should match some benchmark
counterfactual against which to evaluate economic outcomes. We choose the benchmark coun-
terfactiual to be one in which all economic variables are fixed at their initial values throughout
the period of interest. Once we have paths of all economic variables in the data and in the
benchmark counterfactual, we invert the system of equations (12-27) and use it to compute the
corresponding paths of wedges.
   Given this choice of the benchmark counterfactual, the difference between wedge paths by
construction accounts for all of the changes in economic variables during the period of interest.
Moreover, we can compute the effect of each wedge on an economic variable of interest (e.g. real
GDP) by switching the path of just one wedge from its baseline path to its counterfactual path
and simulating the model. Adding counterfactual wedge paths, one at a time, we can compute
the effects of all the wedges on the variable of interest. A combination of these effects gives
the desired wedge decomposition that accounts for the total change in the economic variable
of interest. Thus, the name “wedge accounting”.
   However, there are several technical challenges that complicate the practical implementation
of our accounting procedure.
   First, economic agents are forward-looking and care about their consumption in the future.
Thus, each simulation has an undefined terminal condition for expected consumption in pe-
riod T+1, which has a major effect on the path of the model economy. To make meaningful
comparisons between contributions of wedges, expectations of future consumption have to be
somehow held “fixed” across simulations.
   The way we choose to deal with this problem is to extend the period of interest and make
projections of economic variables far into the future (up to 2050). Then we could construct
the benchmark counterfactual in such a way that although there is no change in economic
variables during the period of interest (e.g. 1978-2012), later on the economy could catch up
to the baseline projected path (e.g. between 2020 and 2050). Similarly, for all intermediate
simulations, with some wedges changing and others fixed, we assume that in the far future the
economy reaches this same level for all economic variables of interest. Under this assumption,
we can keep the terminal condition identical for all simulations and solve the problem outlined
above.
   Second, there is a complication implied by capital accumulation. Although most counter-


                                               79
factual paths of wedges are constant paths equal to their initial values throughout the period of
interest, some wedges (e.g. the investment wedge) require some movement to match the path of
no change in economic variables, and their level may be very different from their initial value.
   Finally, the model is highly non-linear, so that the sum of individual effects of wedges
is not equal to the total change in an economic variable. There are several ways of dealing
with this problem. One way, used in Cheremukhin et al. (2013), is to compute the Shapley
values for contributions of each wedge. Shapley’s procedure requires computing contributions
for all possible orders in which wedges could be switched from the benchmark counterfactual
to the baseline, and then averaging contributions across those orders. However, for this specific
application (due to large changes in economic variables and a long period of interest) the
Shapley method is not practical due to the difficulty in finding starting values for the shooting
(simulation) algorithm from which it would converge to the solution. Instead, we choose to
break down wedges into blocks (TFPs, intersectoral wedges, everything else), and compute the
contribution of each block. Then we rescale the contributions of elements of each block to match
the total contribution of the block. We attribute the residual (the difference between sum of
block contributions, and total change in economic variables) to the “other” category in all of
our results. We do this in order to isolate the intra-temporal wedges from the inter-temporal
investment wedge and effects of expectations, which we also put into the “other” category
when reporting results. Thus, the dynamic forward-looking nature of the exercise poses certain
technical difficulties, which result in some uncertainty about the separate contributions of these
various dynamic factors.
   To sum up, our wedge accounting methodology consists of six steps.
   1. Project the path of the economy into the future far enough for convergence between
different combinations of wedges to take place.
   2. Construct the benchmark counterfactual path of economic variables and its convergence
to the projected path in the far future.
   3. Compute the wedges for both the actual (and projected) path and the benchmark
counterfactual.
   4. Find starting values for the shooting algorithm which allows the simulation to reproduce
both the actual (and projected) and the counterfactual paths exactly given the paths of wedges.
   5. Compute effects of wedges by taking the baseline simulation and then removing variations


                                               80
in one wedge at a time.
   6. Compute effects of blocks of wedges by taking the baseline simulation and removing
variations in a block of wedges at a time.
   Combining the results from steps 5 and 6 and properly rescaling them to match block effects
gives the results reported in our Tables. This procedure was done for various periods and
counterfactuals for GDP and the share of labor force in agriculture. It is generally applicable
to all variables of interest.

12.4    Sensitivity Analysis

In this section we consider the effects of alternative parameterizations of the model. The
baseline values for the parameters are presented in Table 2. We consider the effects of changes
in the key parameters: the production elasticities, the subsistence level and the elasticity of
substitution between goods — on two of our main results: wedge accounting for 1978-2012 and
the effect of reforms.
   Tables 13-16 present the effects of parameter changes on the wedge accounting decompo-
sition of GDP growth and the change in the share of labor force in agriculture from 1978 to
2012. Similarly, Tables 17-20 present the effects of parameter changes on the effect of post-1978
reforms on GDP growth and the change in the share of labor force in agriculture.
   We summarize the main effects as follows. First, a decrease in the degree of substitutability
between agricultural and manufacturing goods makes economic outcomes more sensitive to de-
velopments in the agricultural (subsistence) sector, and, hence, attributes more of the changes
in GDP and the share of labor force in agriculture to agricultural TFP and the distortion to
consumption, i.e. the consumption component of the intersectoral distortion. The contribu-
tions of other factors are diminished. Given that we deliberately chose a conservative value
of the elasticity of substitution in our baseline calibration, less substitutability between goods
(suggested by most micro estimates) only reinforces our main results.
   Second, a substantial increase in the factor share of capital in the production function of
the non-agricultural sector decreases the contributions of TFPs and increases the contribution
of the mobility component of the intersectoral distortion. However, the overall effect of this
change in parameters is small. Third, the effects of changes in the factor shares of labor and
land in the agricultural production function are even smaller. An increase in the factor share


                                               81
of labor implies a slightly bigger contribution of agricultural TFP while a decrease in the factor
share of land implies a slightly smaller contribution of agricultural TFP to changes in the share
of labor force in agriculture. The effects on contributions to GDP growth are negligible.
      Fourth, the effects of changes in the subsistence level are more pronounced. A lower sub-
sistence level implies a smaller contribution of agricultural TFP and a bigger contribution of
intersectoral distortions. A higher subsistence level implies a larger contribution of agricultural
TFP and a smaller contribution of intersectoral distortions. Note that we deliberately set the
subsistence level to a relatively high value in the baseline calibration, so our baseline results
represent a conservative estimate of the effects of intersectoral distortions. Note also that the
level of γA = 65 is close to the highest possible level of subsistence which would match the level
of agricultural consumption per capita during the famine of the Great Leap Forward. Thus,
this exercise represents the lower bound on the contributions of intersectoral distortions on
GDP and share of labor force in agriculture. Conversely, setting a subsistence level lower than
our baseline, would only reinforce our main results.
      Finally, we have redone the analysis using alternative price series using agricultural and
industrial goods prices advocated by Young (2003).59 For agricultural prices we used the
General Purchasing Price Index for Farm Products and for industrial prices we used the Ex-
Factory Price Index for Industrial Products, available from the CSY for various years. We find
that the effect of using these alternative price series on our results is negligible.

13      Data Appendix

We present data on six broad aspects of the Chinese economy: national accounts, labor inputs,
capital inputs, foreign trade, prices and wages.

13.1     National Accounts

Our two main sources of data on the system of national accounts of China are published
by the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). The …rst one is the "China Statistical
Yearbook" (CSY) which is available from the o¢ cial website (http://www.stats.gov.cn/ eng-
lish/Statisticaldata/ AnnualData/) for the years 1996-2014. The second main source is the "60
Years of New China" (60Y) which aggregates data from previous publications for the years
1949-2009.    (http://tongji.cnki.net/ overseas/engnavi/ YearBook.aspx?          id=N2010030107).
The second source is closely related with a book on pre-1996 statistics compiled by Hsueh
and Li (1999), "China’s national income 1952-1995" (HL).
     Table 1 reports the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) measured as value added, for the whole
economy and by sector, in current and constant prices, measured in 100 million yuan. Table 2
reports the Gross Domestic Product by Expenditure Approach, in current prices, measured in
100 million yuan. GDP is broken down into consumption, reported separately for households
and for the government, gross capital formation (GCF), in turn broken down into gross …xed
capital fromation (GFCF) and inventories, and net exports. The table also reports data on
foreign trade: total value of imports, exports and the trade balance.

                                                 86
   The source of data for Tables 1 and 2 are "60 Years of New China", which only covers
1952-2008 for the series of interest.
   Table 3 reports the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) measured as value added, for the whole
economy and by sector, in current and constant prices, measured in 100 million yuan. Table 4
reports the Gross Domestic Product by Expenditure Approach, in current prices, measured in
100 million yuan. GDP is divided into consumption, reported separately for households and
for the government, gross capital formation (GCF), in turn divided into gross …xed capital
fromation (GFCF) and inventories, and net exports. The table also reports data on foreign
trade: total value of imports, exports and the trade balance.
   The source of data for Tables 3 and 4 are "China Statistical Yearbooks" from 1996 to 2014,
which only cover 1978-2012 for the series of interest.
   In order to get consistent series for the whole period of interest, 1952-2012, we merge the
data from the two sources. The two sources largely agree for the overlapping periods. However,
there are some discrepancies between the two sources, with the earliest appearing for year 1990.
For the con‡icting cases we always prefer the most recent data vintage - CSY 2014.
   Table 5 reports merged series for GDP by sector, in current and constant prices, for 1952-
2012. Table 6 reports merged series for the breakdown of GDP by expenditure approach, also
for 1952-2012.

13.2    Prices and Wages

To obtain a consistent series for GDP and its sectoral split into agriculture and non-agriclture,
we need to obtain sectoral GDP de‡ators. We compute aggregate and sectoral GDP de‡ators
using Table 5 by dividing value added in current prices by the indices in constant prices, and
multiply each series by a constant that converts nominal values into constant 1978 yuan. We
report the results in Table 7. Taking the ratio of price de‡ators in the two sectors allows us to
estimate the relative prices of agricultural goods to non-agricultural goods.
   We also report indexes of agricultural and industrial goods prices. These are the General
Purchasing Price Index for Farm Products and the Ex-Factory Price Index for Industrial
Products, available from the CSY for various years. For pre-1978 values we use values from
CSY for year 1981.
   In Table 8 we report average wages for sta¤ and workers in the agricultural and non-

agricultural sectors for 1952-2011. These data come from two sources. The pre-1978 data
come from CSY for year 1981. The post-1978 data come from CSY for years 1996-2013 from
the o¢ cial website. Two other columns report the factor share of income earned by labor
in agriculture and non-agriculture, computed from Bai and Qian (2010), "The Factor Income
Distribution in China 1978-2007."
   We use the data on the labor share from Bai and Qian (2010) as a robustness check for
our wage series. Figure 1 compares the ratios of agricultural to non-agricultural wage rates
computed for sta¤ and workers from the CSY (our baseline estimate) and inferred from the
labor shares reported by Bai and Qian (alternative estimate) for the overlapping period 1978-
2007. From Figure 1 we conclude that the ratio of agricultural to non-agricultural sta¤ and
worker wages follows the same trend as the ratio of labor remuneration in agriculture per
agricultural worker to labor remuneration in non-agriculture per non-agricultural worker.

   Table 11 reports merged series for population and employment by sector, for 1952-2012.
We are interested in the division of economic activity into agricultural and non-agricultural.
For this purpose, we treat the primary sector as agricultural, and add up employment in the
secondary and tertiary sectors to obtain employment in the non-agricultural sector.
   At this point, we incorporate a correction proposed by Holz (2006), Appendix 13, page 236.
The correction takes care of the reclassi…cation of employed workers that was made by the NBS
in 1990. As a consequence, for years prior to 1990 total employment values are adjusted up
by a factor of approximately 1,1666. This correction increases the size of total employment,
but does not tell us anything about sectoral employment. To adjust also the breakdown of
employment into agricultural and non-agricultural activity, we use the proportions obtained
from the o¢ cial series, as described earlier.

13.4    Capital Inputs

We use Holz (2006), Tables 19 and 20 on pages 159-161, as our main source for aggregate and
sectoral capital stock. We repeat the data on total and primary capital stock in current and
2000 prices in the right two panels of Table 13. We convert the series for total capital stock to
1978 yuan using the GDP de‡ator (see subsection on prices and wages).
   We use the level of capital and its ratio to GDP in 1953 to estimate the initial level of
capital in 1978 prices. We apply the perpetual inventory method (with a depreciation rate of 5
percent) to our series for real investment in 1978 prices (computed using Gross Fixed Capital
Formation as share of GDP) to obtain the series for aggregate capital in 1978 prices. The
series that we obtain is largely consistent with Holz’s estimates of aggregate capital stock for
1953-2006, with two minor di¤erences: Holz computes capital in constant 2000 prices and uses
a variable depreciation rate which ranges between 3 and 5 percent.
   We also use data from Holz (2006) to divide the aggregate capital stock into capital used in
the agricultural (primary) and non-agricultural sectors. This sectoral division of capital stock
is only available for 1978-2011.
   For earlier years we use the data on sectoral investment from Chow (1993) to estimate
the composition of capital stock by sector. As shown in Table 12, we use net capital stock
accumulation by sector from Table 5 on page 820 in Chow (1993), and then apply the perpetual
inventory method to accumulate sectoral capital stock for 1953-1978. As initial values we use

the value from the same table for non-agricultural capital, and the value of 450 for agricultural
capital. We then break down by sector the total real capital stock in 1978 prices computed
earlier using the relative proportions implied by Chow’s data.
   To check the validity of this data, we construct sectoral capital series using provincial data
on investment in …xed assets by type of unit from the the China Compendium of Statistics
1949-2008 (Table 8). For 5 provinces (Fujian, Hunan, Jilin, Shanghai, Shanxi), the data on
rural and urban investments go back to 1950; in case of Tianjin, they start in 1956. We
attributed all the …xed asset investments of collectively-owned units in rural areas to the the
agricultural sector and all …xed asset investments in other units in rural areas and all units
in urban areas - to the non-agricultural sector. This gave us data on investment by sector by
province. We aggregated data on agricultural and non-agricultural investment for the available
provinces. We found that the share of agricultural investment in total investment from this
provincial dataset traces very closely the series obtained from Chow as described above. The
similarity is illustrated in Figure 2.




              Figure 2. Measures of share of capital in agriculture.

   Another source of data on sectoral capital stock for the pre-reform period is Tang (1984),
Table 5. We …nd the series for Farm capital stock to grow at a rate similar to our baseline
series, as shown in Figure 3. However, the level of Farm capital is less than half of the total
agricultural capital stock in our baseline estimate, most likely because Farm capital aggregates

                                              101
a restricted subset of items included in our baseline estimate.




                  Figure 3. Measures of agricultural capital.

   For the most recent period, 2003-2012, we use CSY 2013, Table 5-9, Investment in Fixed
Assets, total and in the agricultural sector, to compute the breakdown of investment into ag-
ricultural investment and non-agricultural investment. Using the perpetual inventory method,
we compute capital by sector in 2003-2012.

13.5    Defense Spending

The data on defense spending comes from three main sources. The earlier period of 1952- 1995
is jointly covered by HL and CSY, which report nominal defense spending in yuan. For the
period 1983-2011 an alternative source of data is the website of the Stockholm International
Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) which reports spending on defense for a variety of countries
as a percent of GDP. For the overlapping period the trends are broadly consistent, but the
exact estimates vary by a factor of 1 to 1.5. As there seems to be no reliable way of obtaining
more precise estimates, we average the two available sources for the overlapping period. We
obtain an estimate of real defense spending in 1978 prices using the share of defense in GDP
from these two sources.

13.6    Foreign Trade

The main source for data on sectoral exports and imports is Fukao, Kiyota and Yue (2006).
Fukao et. al. (2006) report data on China’s exports and imports by commodity at the SITC-R

2-digit level for 1952-1964 and for 1981-2000, obtained from the "China’s Long-Term Inter-
national Trade Statistics" database. Using data from Fukao et. al. (2006), we construct
estimates of nominal exports and imports of agricultural and non-agricultural commodities.
We then subtract imports from exports to obtain estimates of net exports by sector. We use
the price de‡ators computed earlier to estimate real net exports by sector in 1978 prices. For
the 1965-1980 period, to our knowledge, there is no available data on trade by sector. We lin-
early interpolate the ratios of net export to value added by sector for this intermediate period.
For the 2001-2012 period we use data directly comparable to that reported by Fukao et. al.
(2006), now available in CSY.

13.7    Three Sectors

For the 3-sector model we break down non-agricultural sector into its state and private compon-
ents. For modeling purposes, we are interested in the breakdown of production (value added),
labor inputs and capital inputs. The separation of the sectors occurs only after the reforms
started in 1978. Before that, there was hardly any non-state non-agricultural production. So
we construct the breakdown for the 1978-2012 time period. Our …rst main source is Dekle and
Vandenbroucke (2006) "A quantitative analysis of China’s structural transformation" (DV).
DV report fractions of value added produced by the state and private sectors for 1978-2003.
They also report data on the split of capital and labor inputs for the same period. For later
years we use data from the CSY and follow DV’s methodology wherever possible. We replicate
DV’s numbers very closely for the overlapping period (1985-2003), which is encouraging.
   To obtain a breakdown of value added we use "gross industrial value added" from CSY, for
which split is reported into state-owned, collective, individual and other/foreign. We attribute
state-owned and collective to the state sector and all other categories to the private sector.
   To obtain a breakdown of employment we use Table 4-2 "Number of Employed Persons
at Year-end in Urban and Rural Areas" which reports total number of employed, as well as
those employed in state-owned, collective-owned, cooperative and TVEs. We attribute the
four aforementioned categories to the state sector, and the rest to the private sector.
   To obtain a breakdown of capital we use data on the "Original Value of Fixed Assets of
Industrial Firms above certain size" which are reported for all industriall …rms and for state-
owned enterprises. We use these data to split total investment in the non-agricultural sector

(see subsection on capital) into state non-ag. investment and private non-ag. investment.
We merge these series with data from DV starting from the year 1998. We then apply the
perpetual inventory method (with constant 5-percent depreciation rate) to obtain the series
for capital in state non-ag. sector and private non-ag. sector.
   Our constructed shares of value added, employment and capital stock in the state non-ag.
sector are reported in Table 16.

13.8    Final Dataset

In this subsection, we combine series constructed and reported in previous subsections into a
…nal dataset. Tables 17 and 18 present the combined dataset used in the analysis.
   Table 17 presents total value added (GDP), value added by agriculture (YA) and non-
agriculture (YM), which in turn is split into state (YS) and private (YP) non-agriculture.
Agricultural value added is either consumed (CA) or exported (exA). Non-agricultural value
added produced (YM) plus imported (ImM) is used either for consumption (CM), investment
(Inv) or defense spending (GM). All values in Table 17 are in constant prices in 100 million of
1978 yuan.
   The left panel of Table 18 presents total capital stock (K) broken down by sector: agri-
culture (KA), non-agriculture (KM), in turn broken down into state (KS) and private (KP)
non-agriculture. Like value added, the capital stock is measured in 100 million of 1978 yuan.
The central panel of Table 18 presents total employment (N) split into: agriculture (NA), non-
agriculture (NM), in turn split into state (NS) and private (NP) non-agriculture. Employment,
as well as total population (POP), are measured in million persons. The right panel of Table
18 presents the index of relative prices of agricultural and non-agricultural goods (pA/pM) and
the ratio of wages in agriculture to wages in non-agriculture (wA/wM). The index of relative
prices is normalized to 1 in 1978.
