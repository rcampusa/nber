                   Some Pleasant Monetarist Arithmetic


                                ABSTRACT




     Contrary to the conclusion of Sargent and Wallace, it is possible to

exogenously and independently vary monetary and fiscal policy and retain

steady—state equlibrium in economies like the United States. In particular,

the central bank is not forced to monetize increased deficits either now or in

the future. This conclusion is based on the fact that the real after—tax

yield on government bonds is considerably less than the growth rate of real

income except during brief disinflationary periods.

     Sargent and Wallace (1981) are widely regarded to have demonstrated         that

monetary   policy cannot be manipulated exogenously with a fixed growth path       of

government   expenditures and a fixed tax structure.      More succinctly, the

central   bank can only   choose whether to monetize a government deficit now or

later.    This result can be viewed as a generalization of the Blinder and Solow
(1973, 1974), Tobin and Buiter (1976) and Steindi (1974) analyses of the
stationary   state when it is assumed that (base) money is increased while

government spending and the tax rate are fixed so that government borrowing is

adjusted passively via open—market operations.' The Sargent and Wallace

(1981) argument appears persuasive to such authors as King and Plosser (1983),

but I believe it is serously wrong as a guide to understanding monetary policy

in the United States. This paper first demonstrates that whether or not

money, spending, and taxes can be manipulated independently by the government

is an empirical not a theoretical question. Then in Section II, I present

evidence that at least the United States government can indeed independently

manipulate all three instruments with government debt adjusting in a passive

but stable manner.

                         I. Steady—State Equilibrium

      Miller (1983) has derived a version of the govrnment budget constraint

which is useful for studying the long—run growth equilibrium of the economy.

Simplifying the notation of his equation (4), we can write this constraint as




(1)                G—T=pM+(r)D

Here, G and T are government expenditures and taxes less transfer

payments, respectively, both measured as fraction of NNP and exclusive of any

government interest payments or the taxes thereon. M and D are the money—

NNP and debt—NNP ratios, and i and         are the growth rates of nominal money

and the real government debt, respectively. Finally, r is the real after—

tax interest rate.2 That is, the excess of spending over taxes must be

financed by either base money creation or by borrowing in excess of the amount

needed to pay the real after—tax interest on the government debt.3

      The question raised by Sargent and Wallace is whether there Is only one

value of money—creation revenue 1jM for which debt will be a stable fraction

of NNP.4 This is formalized as asking whether a steady—state equilibrium

exists and is stable for alternative values of    1.tM.   The steady—state

equilibrium debt—NNP ratio D is found from equation (1) to be



(2)                -G—TpM

where y, the growth rate of real NNP, must be equal to            if D is

constant. Equation (2) says that if the government is spending more than it

takes in explicit taxes and the inflationary tax, there can still be a

constant debt—NNP ratio if the growth rate of real NNP exceeds the real after—
                                           3



tax    interest   rate. If r exceeded y, then any positive excess of

C over T + M would indeed cause D to grow without limit. Sargent and

Wallace (1981) instead simply assumed that r exceeds y and hence inevitably

came to the conclusion that the government could not independently choose

ji,   C, and T. I shall argue in Section II below that this assumption is

incorrect empirically and proceed here with the analysis on the assumption

that y is greater than r.

        The basic idea is that the government will borrow more than enough to

make interest payments if D is constant and that this net borrowing5

(i —   r)D increases with D.      So higher deficits G — T —   .1M   will be

associated with higher debt—NNP ratios, but they can be financed indefinitely

as a matter of arithmetic unless the real interest rate were equal to or

greater than the growth rate of real income.

       To check that the economy will in fact move toward the equilibrium debt—

income ratio, suppose that actual value of D differed from its steady—state

value D. The growth rate of D is 6 — y,            the difference in the growth

rates of its numerator and denominator. Straightforward manipulations and the

assumption of either perfect foresight or indexed government bonds yield the

growth rate relation6



(3)



That is the growth rate of the debt—income ratio will be positive if the

actual D is less than its steady—state value D and negative if D exceeds

5     So   D will gradually converge to        even if the economy were to start

from another position as might result from cyclical deficits, wars, short—run

monetary or fiscal policy, or changes in the underlying trend values of C, T,
                                                     4




or   ji   which define the the steady—state equilibrium.

      Consider the following simple example:


                G= 0.22                                                       T= 0.18
                y =     0.04/year                                             r = 0.02/year
                ii
                      = 0.10/year                                             M = 0.10 year


Therefore, the steady—state debt—income ratio is



                       —    0.22—0.18—(0.10/year)(0.10 year) — 0.03
                                  (0.04/year)—(0.02!year)              0.02/year


                     D =    1.5   year



Suppose that the Fed decided to increase money growth to p' =                      0.20/year and
that this induced M to fall to M' =              0.09 year. Then the new equilibrium debt—

income ratio is



                        =   0.04—(0.20/year)(0.09        year) =   1.1 year
                                         0.02/year



When this policy is initiated, the growth rate of the debt—income ratio would

be

                        —          0.02/year                 1.5 year)
                                   1.5 year (1.1 year —


                        —
                            y = —0.0053/year


That is, over the first year of the new policy D would fall by approximately

(1 year) (—0.0053/year) (1.5 year) = —0.0080 year to 1.492 year. The rate of

decline would decrease as D assymptotically approached D' = 1.1 year.7 Thus,

the government—budget identity does not pose any problems for the existence or
                                          5




stability of the steady—state equilibrium as money growth is varied exoge—

nously with fiscal policy fixed. Similarly, government spending or tax rates

can be varied exogenously with the other fiscal variable and monetary policy

held unchanged. In this way the standard macroeconomic practice of varying

fiscal or monetary instruments with government borrowing adjusting passively

is shown to be consistent with a stable steady—state equilibrium.



                                El. Empirical Issues

     Section I ——   like   Sargent and Wallace (1981) —   is   basically an

arithmetic exercise. In this section I argue that the empirical evidence

favors the relevance of Section I for the United States. There are two

substantial differences between the two arithmetic exercises: Sargent and

Wallace use before—tax real yields instead of after—tax real yields and they

assume that the relevant real yield exceeds the growth rate of real income.



II.A. Differences about the Relevant Real Yield

     The differences over which yield should be compared to real income growth

are partially semantic and partially substantive. Sargent and Wallace define

an exogenous fiscal policy as a fixed path for the difference between

government spending and taxes (exclusive of money or debt creation and

interest payments) measured in terms of real goods. I hold the levels of each

of these variables (and hence their difference) constant as a fraction of real

income. Thus, if decreased money growth reduces real income, it would reduce

the level of the future real deficit on my assumption of constant deficits as

a fraction of income.
                                      6




     This difference is relevant only if lower money growth (and hence a

higher debt—income ratio) reduces real output as supposed by Sargent and

Wallace. They make a crowding—out argument because in their life—cycle

framework more government debt means that less wealth will be held in the form

of capital. Thus tax receipts on capital returns go down as tax receipts on

government debt goes up.8

     Suppose instead that individuals are fully rational and care about their

children as themselves. In that kind of world, government accounts are

consolidated into those of the individuals which it represents so that whether

the government finances by taxes or bonds is irrelevant to individual choices

about consumption and accumulation of physical capital. Measured saving will

equal the unaffected capital accumulation plus however many new government

bonds are issued instead of tax receipts. But individuals will not be

concerned with how many IOIJs they are writing themselves.9 It should be noted

that on this latter view of saving behavior, the real interest rate is

unaffected by the level of the debt—income ratio.1°

     In conclusion, there are good reasons to suppose that the difference in

the way in which exogenous fiscal policy is defined is not a substantive

one. The fall in private capital which Sargent and Wallace associate with

higher levels of the debt—income ratio need not occur. Nonetheless, it will

be shown in Section II.B that even the real before—tax yield on government

securities has been generally well below the growth rate of real income. In

that case even in the Sargent and Wallace world exogenous variations in the

deficit need not be monetized by the central bank.
                                       7




II.B. Real Yields versus Real Growth

     As anyone who has ever looked at real before—tax yields on government

securities is aware, it is a simple matter to show that secular real before—

tax yields have not approached corresponding growth rates of real output. It

follows directly that real after—tax yields must be even less. This is not to

suggest that the real return to capital in the economy is less than the growth

rate of real output; but the real rate of return on government bonds and bills

is clearly far below this average socIal return. Presumably the difference

reflects both nonpecuniary services and a very low correlation with the market

return, but that really is not at issue In understanding the implications of

the government budget constraint.

     Ibbotson and Sinquefield (1982) have compiled (before—tax) real rates of

return for U.S. Treasury bills and bonds for the years 1926—1981. The

arithmetic (geometric) means of the yields for long—term government bonds and

Treasury bills are 0.3 and 0.1 (—0.1 and 0.0) percent per annum,

respectively. The corresponding nominal yields were 3.1 and 3.1 (3.0 and

3.0). So even if all holders were tax exempt, the experience of the last 55

years suggests that the real after—tax yield on government securities has been

nowhere near the 3.0 percent per annum average growth rate of real Income over

the same years.11

     It would be possible to increase the estimated real yield somewhat, but I

have been unable to find any study that indicates an average real yield on

government securities as high as 3 percent even without any allowance for

income taxes. Taking account of income taxes would lower these estimates; so

there seems to be no doubt empirically that for the U.S. the growth rate of

real income exceeds the real after—tax yield on government securities.

                         III. A Possible Reconciliation

       The point of this paper is a technical one: In the United States,

dynamic inconsistencies do not result from treating government expenditures,

taxes, and base—nioney growth as simultaneously exogenous. A current deficit

is therefore not per se inflationary in the sense of requiring future

increased money growth as claimed by Sargent and Wallace (1981).

       This conclusion would not hold for all economies nor need it hold always

for the United States Suppose for example that as the ratio of government

debt to income and hence physical capital rises, the yield on government debt

rises toward that of physical capital instead of remaining constant as assumed

above and by Sargent and Wallace. Then if the equilibrium debt—income ratio

were to increase to the point that the real after—tax yield on government

securities equalled or exceeded the growth rate of real income, the economy

would cross over to the explosive character analyzed by Sargent and Wallace

(1981). While this may have occurred for other countries in the past, the

United States does not yet seem near that point.

       To see this first consider the fiscal 1983 deficit estimated at $208

billion by the U.S. Council of Economic Advisers (1983, p. 26). If we allow

for a cyclical component based on moving from the assumed 10.7 to 6.0 percent

unemployment, the "structural" deficit would be about $117.5 billion less —

that   is, about $90 billion. This amount is only $5 billion more than actual

fiscal 1982 interest payments. So even without taking account of the large

offsetting state government surpluses, there is no evidence of substantial

differences between secular government spending (exclusive of interest) and

net taxes. Furthermore, current ratios of government debt to income are far

below the 1946 value of 1.1.12
                                      9




     In conclusion, the Sargent and Wallace (1981) propositions should not be

generally applied in analyses of the United States or similar economies.

Where they are applied, they should be justified by evidence that the real

after—tax yield on government bonds really does exceed the growth rate of real

income or would do so under the circumstances being considered. It is hardly

surprising that arithmetic alone cannot give a real answer to a substantive

economic question.

      'This paper does not attempt to comment on the relevance of the balanced—

and Auerbach and Rutner (1977) on this point.

      2See Darby (1975). See Section II for further discussion of the use of

the real after—tax yield.

      3The standard national income accounting definition of the deficit counts

as government borrowing and private saving that portion of after—tax nominal

interest which represents an adjustment for decline in the real value of the

nominal debt. In those terms, we would include in equation (1) the growth

rate of the nominal debt        + iT   and the nominal after—tax Interest rate

r + iT,     where the inflation rate     it    cancels.   See Jump (1980) and Darby and

Lothian (1983). Miller's equation (4) substitutes the steady—state condition

that the growth rates of real NNP and real debt are equal, but we leave the

equation in this form to analyze behavior out of full steady—state

ecjuilibriuin.

      4The fraction of NNP    which people desire to hold as money is a decreasing
function of the nominal interest rate and hence             i.   In   the relevant range

            alternative term for net borrowing (ry—r)D would be "negative debt

service."

     6These manipulations begin with the identity       —          [(r   + w)D +

G — T —      — (i   + ¶)D] which was obtained by taking the time   derivative      of

the natural logarithm of D where the perfect foresight or indexing

assumption allows us to express the nominal after—tax interest rate as the sum

of the corresponding real rate and actual rather than expected inflation.

(In the steady state there is no need to distinguish actual from expected ir.)

Then, we have    —•=       I [G — T — iM — Dl from which equation (3) follows
by substitution of equation (2).

     7Note however that absent perfect foresight or a prior refunding into

indexed bonds of long—term bonds — see Darby and Lothian (1983) —           this
adjustment will be much faster as the real value of the existing bonds and

debt service drops.

     8Tobin (1965) proposed a different mechanism by which inflation might

reduce the private capital stock. In either case, improvements in the

aggregate production function as firms devote less inputs to conserving cash

balances would tend to offset, eliminate, or dominate this capital stock

effect so that the effect of money growth on real output is theoretically

ambiguous. I have assumed elsewhere (1979a) that the production function

effect dominates so that lower inflation rates on net increase real output.

     9White (1978), Darby (l979b), and Kotlikoff and Summers (1981) all report

evidence that "bequest assets" dominate "life—cycle assets" in total U.S.

wealth, and this finding supports the assumption of concern about ones

children's welfare. Barro (1974, 1978), Kochin (1974), and David and Scadding

(1974) all present evidence in support of the "ultrarational" or "Ricardian"

view. Note that saving increases if the government finances a tax cut with
                                       15



increased borrowing not in anticipation of future increased taxes but in

anticipation that otherwise total NNP would fall.

     '°Plosser (1982), for example, finds that asset prices are unaffected by

the extent to which a given level of government expenditures is financed by

borrowing instead of taxes.

     12H1gh ex post real interest rates experienced during 1981—1982 appear to

be a result of slowing inflation (compare 1929—1933) and not a matter of a

"regime change" to unprecedentedly high deficits.
