                                             ABSTRACT

         World trade in services has recently been a little under $US2 trillion, about a quarter of world
trade in goods. That ratio does not appear to have changed much in the last 50 years. For the US,
exports of services have recently been over 40% and imports about 20% of exports and imports of
goods, a return, for exports to the ratios of the early 1800s. Imports of services are now increasing
more rapidly than exports, but not faster than goods imports.
         Because measures of service trade are not anchored in any observation of physical movement,
they are dependent on definitions of residence. An example of that dependence and the ambiguities
it creates is exports of educational services, a domestic activity that becomes an export because
students are defined as foreign residents. Since many students later become US residents, the
supposedly exported service never leaves the US, or returns to the US unobserved and uncounted.
         A particularly serious problem of measurement is the growing transfer of intangible US
corporate assets to foreign affiliates of US firms, some of which use virtually no foreign factors of
production. These transfers, mainly for tax saving purposes, give rise to phantom flows of services
from the foreign affiliates to the US and to other countries and remove the exports from the U.S.
balance of payments. They make the meaning of measures of the current balances and GDP
ambiguous. One possible solution to the measurement problems would be to use measures assigning
at least intangible assets to countries of ownership, rather than nominal residence.

Introduction

       Most of the literature on international trade that has accumulated over the last 300 years

has dealt with trade in goods, and almost every country has had in place for many years a system

of collecting information on such trade. In the mercantilist era, a surplus of exports over imports

of goods was sought as a way of acquiring gold, and imports of goods were carefully watched

and counted as a source of tax revenue. As a result, there has been an apparatus in place for

measuring the inflow and outflow of goods in every country for centuries, based on counting and

appraising the value of goods as they crossed the country’s borders. Trade in goods among

regions of a country is often studied by trying to approximate the movement of goods across

regional, provincial, or state borders. Only recently, with the establishment of the single market

in the European Union, have some major trading countries moved away from the traditional

reliance on customs declarations at borders and been forced to invent other ways of measuring

trade in goods (OECD, 2001, p. 3). The collection of data on trade in goods is governed by

recommendations set forth in United Nations (2004), which translates for compilers of trade data

the methodological guidelines adopted by the United Nations Statistical Commission. One of the

principal recommendations is that countries use “…crossing the border rather than change of

ownership as the basic principle for compilation of trade statistics…” (P. 5). The geographical

basis of the data is emphasized by the recommendation that the data should “Record all goods

which add to or subtract from the stock of natural resources of a country by entering (imports) or

leaving (exports) its economic territory (p. 74), and by the definition of the partner in terms of

the “statistical territory of its trading partners” or, when free zones are involved, the economic

territory if the reporting country uses “the strict version of the special system of trade.” The

definitions are all based on geography rather than ownership.

       The measurement of trade in goods for the balance of payments has a different objective.

That is the measurement of changes in the ownership of goods between residents and non-

residents of a country. Since the great majority of such changes in ownership take place in

connection with the physical movement of the goods, the measures are quantitatively close, and

the balance of payments measures are mainly dependent on the data for the physical movement

of goods and very close to them. However, since imports are reported on a c.i.f. basis in the

goods trade data, and the balance of payments concept separates freight and insurance costs

from the value of the physical commodities, one adjustment that is required is to peel off those

costs and transfer them to the trade in services account.

       Most of the differences between trade statistics and balance-of-payments measures for

trade in goods involve the dependence of the balance of payments accounts on change of

ownership rather than physical movement. Thus, the trade statistics include, and the balance of

payments data exclude, goods purchased by travelers and brought home, because there is no

change of ownership, while there is a change in location. Trade data include, but balance of

payments figures exclude, goods imported for projects by non-resident construction enterprises

and the major item on the export side, exports transferred under U.S. military agency sales

contracts. The trade figures exclude, but the balance of payments figures include, Bunkers,

Goods for repair and Goods entering or leaving a country illegally. Other adjustments involve,




                                                                                                     2
for example, timing in terms of change of ownership rather than terms of the change in the

location of goods.

       In contrast to trade in goods, trade in services does not have two alternative

measurements. It exists only in the balance of payments universe. As is observed in OECD

(2001), “Unlike trade in goods, trade in services involves no package crossing the customs

frontier with accompanying documentation showing an internationally recognized commodity

code, a description of the contents, information on quantity, origin, and destination, an invoice

and an administrative system based on customs duty collection, which facilitates data

compilation.” The difference is more than a question of documentation. Trade in services often

involves no crossing of an international boundary by the service, but only a crossing of a border

by the consumer of the service. Many trades in services are geographically domestic

transactions made international solely by a difference in country of residence between the buyer

and the seller of the service. It is a balance of payments concept more than a trade concept, and

the definition of residence plays a crucial part in defining what trade in services is.



The size and growth of world trade in services

       Trade in services has been something of an orphan in international measurement, but

interest in it has been growing. However, it is hard to say just how large it is, because the

completeness of reporting varies greatly across countries. Some countries publish data, but they

cover only limited types of services. Some important participants, such as Bermuda and the

Cayman Islands, do not report to the IMF at all, although we know from their partners’

information that they are important transactors.




                                                                                                    3
       In 2002, the OECD countries as a group reported service exports of $US 1,622 billion, 25

per cent of the value of exports of goods. And they reported service imports of $US 1,631

billion, 26 per cent of reported imports of goods (OECD, 2003, Table A-1). Many countries that

report to the IMF do not report service exports and imports, but those that do, reported exports of

$US 1,885 billion and imports of $US 1,887 billion in 2003 (IMF 2006). Of these countries, the

145 that reported both goods and services exports and imports reported exports of services that

were 25.7 per cent of exports of goods, and imports of services that were 25.4 per cent of imports

of goods (IMF 2006). Thus there is fairly general agreement on a current ratio of services trade

to goods trade of about one quarter.

       It is hard to judge how fast trade in services has been growing, because the number of

countries measuring it has increased, and the number of categories covered by surveys and

reporting has been growing over time, but to inconsistent degrees in different countries. For 22

countries that have reported service exports and imports to the IMF since 1972, and accounted

for over half of “world” exports of services in 2003, the ratio of service exports to goods exports

grew from 21 to over 28 per cent between 1972-76 and 2002-03. The corresponding ratio for

imports rose from 24 to 26 per cent over that same period (Table 1). For a larger group of 30

countries that have reported service exports and imports since 1977, and accounted for two thirds

of “world” service exports in 2003, the ratio of service exports to goods exports grew from about

22 to over 27 per cent between 1977-81 and 2002-03. The ratio for imports grew from 24-25 per

cent to a peak of 28 per cent in 1992-96 and has since settled back to around 27 per cent. Thus

there is some indication of an upward trend in at least the reported service trade relative to goods

trade. Many countries are dropped from the recent IMF Balance of Payments CDs for years

before 1972, presumably because the definitions and measures of service exports and imports did




                                                                                                   4
not match the current definitions. However, it is possible to put together series extending back

somewhat further, to 1961, for 24 of the larger countries, from earlier IMF data (IMF, 1991).

These show almost the same ratios of service trade to goods trade in 1972 as in Table 1, 25.2

percent on the export side and 27.7 per cent on the import side. The corresponding ratios in 1961

were 26.6 per cent and 32 per cent, suggesting, if anything, a slight decline in the ratio, at least

on the import side, but no very large changes over these 40+ years.

       A further indication of the trend in the world importance of service trade can be gleaned

from estimates for 1950-1954, purportedly covering the whole world (Woolley, 1966, Table 3, p.

23. The ratios quoted here exclude investment income, treated as service trade in the source).

On the export side, they show service exports 21.6 per cent of goods exports, below the 1961

ratio, but almost the same as the average ratio for the first five years, starting in 1972, in Table 1.

On the import side, the estimated ratio in 1950-1954 is over 24 per cent, again below the 1961

ratio, but almost exactly the average of 1972 to 1976 in Table 1. Thus, there is little indication of

a strong trend in the ratio in the last 50 years if we assume that the adjustments made to the data

for the earlier period had been adopted in the official data by 1972, or at least by 2002.

However, if the same omissions in the official services data remain, and they are equally

important in the later period (for example, Karreman, 1961, Table 20, p. 48, raised the reported

transportation receipts by over a third and payments by almost half), some long term rise in the

service/goods trade ratio is implied.

       One reason for being suspicious about the apparent rising trend in service trade relative to

goods trade is that not only has the number of countries reporting service trade to the IMF risen

over the last 50 years, and even the last 30 years, but among those reporting, the number

reporting particular types of service trade has increased even more. While the number of




                                                                                                       5

countries reporting total service exports to the IMF has not changed greatly since 1983, the

number reporting exports of , for example, construction services, rose from 5 to 86, financial

services, 8 to 109, computer and information services, 1 to 96, and personal, cultural, and

recreational services, 4 to 92 (Table 2). In some cases, the services may not have existed in the

particular countries, or may not have been exported at all. In other cases, they might have been

reported under “other business services.” Neither of these reasons would imply any bias in the

overall ratios. However, it seems more likely that at least some of these services were traded, but

no device was in place for collection of data on them, in which case the increasing numbers of

reporters would imply upward bias in the overall ratios.

        The same information for imports of services is provided in Table 3. In most cases,

collection and reporting of data on particular imports and exports moved together, but there were

exceptions. Reports of freight imports increased faster than those on freight exports, and the

same was true for reports on insurance imports and construction imports. In general, however,

types of services poorly reported in import records were the same as those poorly reported in

export records, and the biases are probably similar on the two sides of the account.

       Even if there has not been any strong trend in world service trade relative to world goods

trade over the last half century, the growth of service trade has outpaced the growth of world

GDP, since the ratio of goods trade to GDP has risen substantially since 1950 in almost every

country. However, since world production and employment have moved from goods producing

to service producing industries, one might have expected a corresponding shift in the

composition of trade. The absence of an obvious shift in that direction may reflect the fact that

we are comparing nominal rather than real values of the two types of trade. If prices of traded

services have fallen relative to prices of traded goods, the stability of the nominal ratio may

conceal a more rapid growth in real service trade. If relative prices of traded services have risen,

on the other hand, the stability of the services/goods trade ratio would imply a decline in the

importance of service trade in real terms. That question is discussed more fully below, in

connection with U.S. trade, for which we have slightly more data. Reported imports of services

were about 10 per cent larger than reported exports in 1950-1954 (Woolley, 1966, Table 3, p.

23). The same was true among 22 countries until the 1990s, sometimes by 10 per cent or more,

but they have been much closer in size since then. That same trend is shown in the data for 30

countries since 1977, with the latest figures showing exports and imports almost equal in size

(Appendix Table B). Either comparative advantages in service production have shifted toward

these groups of 22 and 30 countries or there have been more improvements in measuring service

exports than in measuring service imports.




                                                                                                    9
       A rough idea of the composition of world service trade and changes in composition over

the last 20 years, as reported by the IMF, is given by Table 4. The three major elements are

Transportation, Travel, and “Other Business Services.” The composition of reported imports is

considerably different from that of reported exports. The direction and size of the discrepancies

between reported export and reported import totals vary across service categories, probably

because reporting by developed countries is more complete than that by developing countries.

Thus, reported imports of freight transportation are much larger than reported exports, probably

because imports of freight transportation services are mainly by developed countries from

developing countries. On the other hand, for Financial and Computer and Information services,

reported exports are much larger than reported imports, presumably because these are mainly

export items for developed countries. Reported exports of Insurance Services are much smaller

than reported imports, probably because exports are, relative to country size, disproportionately

concentrated in Bermuda, which does not report to the IMF at all.

       The major change in composition is the decline in importance of Freight and Other

transportation, reduced almost by half. Some of this reduction may be an effect of

containerization and other productivity improvements, but some may be an artifact of the

improvement in the reporting of “Other services” that can be seen in Tables 2 and 3. Passenger

transportation held up better than goods transportation. There was also a large decline in the

importance of Government services, n.i.e., which include “…services (such as expenditures of

embassies and consulates) associated with government sectors or international and regional

organizations and not classified other items” (International Monetary Fund, 2004, p. xxvi).

       Some indication of the geography of international trade in services is given in Table 5,

although again, the pattern may represent differences in reporting as much as differences in

behavior. Given the problems in reporting, the data indicate that the developed, or industrial,

countries as a group export services of a greater value than they import, while developing

countries run an import surplus in services. However, the distinction between the two sets of

countries does not govern the relationship completely. While the United States, France, and the

UK report an export surplus in services, Japan and Germany report importing considerably more

in services than they export. The developing country groups, except for those in Europe, all

show import surpluses in services.

       Over 20 years, the reporting of service exports seems to have caught up to the reporting if

service imports, so that there is no longer a world surplus of reported imports. The main trend in

direction is that the share of industrial countries in exports has declined, while their share of

service imports has risen. The share in imports of the Euro area rose, and that accounted for

most of the increase in industrial country imports.



The size and growth of U.S. trade in services

       The United States has been a leader in measuring service trade, perhaps because it offers

a more cheerful picture of the U.S. international position than the goods trade account. In 2005,

the United States reported a surplus of exports over imports in service trade, of $US 57 billion ,

in contrast to a deficit in goods trade of over $US 780 billion (Appendix Table C).

       Services have recently been much larger relative to goods in U.S. exports (over 40 per

cent) than in U.S. imports (20 per cent or so), presumably reflecting U.S. comparative advantage

in service industries (Chart 1). Service exports were about 60 per cent as large as service




                                                                                                    12

imports during the 1930s, became larger than imports during World War II, fell back to half in

the early 1950s, and then began to grow faster. By the early 1970s service exports began to

surpass imports and have done so ever since. However, in the last five years, it has been service

imports that have outpaced service exports (Appendix Table C).

         The large current importance of services relative to goods in U.S. exports is not

unprecedented. In the first 30 years of balance of payments records, 1790 to 1819, U.S. service

exports averaged about a third of goods exports, but their relative importance trended downward

from then, reaching a level of only 2 per cent of exports of goods in the early 1900s. Then they

began a long rise in importance leading to the current high levels (Chart 1). Services were more



                                                                                                                  13
important in U.S. exports than in U.S. imports in the early days of the United States, usually

more than twice as important through the 1840s. After the Civil War, the relation was reversed,

and services were generally much more important in imports than in exports in the latter half of

the 19th Century and through the 1960s, reaching well over 40 per cent of goods imports during

the years when goods imports were affected by World War II and the postwar recovery. As

goods imports grew rapidly starting in the 1970s, the ratio of service to goods imports receded to

around 20 per cent, where it has remained since the 1970s (Chart 1).

         Services have often been treated as nontradables, and they are, in fact, less traded than

goods, relative to their output. That is, exports and imports of services have been much smaller

relative to the output of services, than exports and imports of goods, relative to the production of


                                                                                                     14
goods, at least since 1869. Aside from World War II, service exports were almost always less

than 2 per cent of service output until the 1960s, according to contemporary estimates, later

revised to almost 3 per cent for the 1960s. Since then, they have grown to usually about 5 per

cent of service output. Goods exports have generally been much larger relative to goods output

during the same period, often 10 to 14 per cent before World War I, falling back to 7 or 8 per

cent from 1929 through the 1960s and then rising, to above 20 per cent in most of the last decade

(Chart 2). Service imports were larger, over 3 per cent during the 1960s, and reaching over 4 per

cent of U.S. service output in recent years (Chart 3). Goods imports were 10 per cent of goods

output in most of the late 19th century, ranged from 5 to 8 per cent of goods output most years

from then through the 1960s, and then soared, to reach 35 to 40 per cent of goods production

since 2000 (Chart 3).

          The relation of service trade to goods trade and the different movements of trade/output

ratios in the two sectors may reflect differences in price movements. As David Richardson

pointed out in his comments at the conference, the official data on implicit prices underlying

GDP and those for exports both show prices of services rising relative to those for goods. For

example, between 1929 and 2005, domestic prices for services rose by over three times as much

as domestic prices of goods, and export prices of services rose almost 2 &1/2 times as fast as

export prices of goods (Appendix Table I). If we accept these price estimates, they present a

very different picture from the nominal data, in some respects. In particular, they show the ratio

of services to goods in U.S. exports fairly stable from the 1960s through the early 1990s, and

then declining, instead of rising sharply through the 1970s and the 1980s. And they show the

ratio in U.S. imports to have fallen throughout the 1990s, instead of being stable (Chart 4).

       The translation from nominal to real, or constant dollar, terms makes much less

difference to the comparisons of trade to output in goods and services than to the comparison of

goods trade to services trade (Charts 5 and 6). The reason is that the reported disparity in price

movements between goods and services is in trade is very similar to that in domestic production.

       One problem with all of these comparisons in constant dollars, or in “real terms,” is that

price measurement in the service sector, and corresponding quantity measurement, are the

weakest parts of the national accounts. Two volumes of the CRIW series, Griliches (1992), and

Cutler and Berndt, (2001), devoted a great deal of attention to the problems of measurement of

prices and output in this sector. And it is hard to have much confidence in the measures. The

problems for trade in services are worse than for domestic production, because the collection of

prices for service trade is at a very early stage, as indicated in the paper by Khatchadourian and

Wiesner (2006). They mention that the BLS International Price Program has collected service

price indexes that cover “…approximately 8 percent of export service trade and 23 percent of

import services trade” (p. 2).

       The long-term history of costs of freight transportation, one of the largest segments of

international services trade, suggest that they were falling relative to prices of goods in general.

The evidence includes convergence of prices between origin and destination countries and

calculations of freight rates themselves, documented in papers by Harley, Hummels, North

(1958), and Williamson, many of which are discussed and summarized in Mohammed and

Williamson (2004). For other major parts of international service trade, such as travel and

business services, it is difficult to find price records, but they do not seem likely candidates for

large increases in price relative to goods.

       The ratios of trade to output, particularly for goods, exaggerate the importance of trade

somewhat, because while the production figures are output net of purchases from other

industries, export and import figures are gross of such purchases. Since such purchases are more

important in goods industries than in service industries, the exaggeration of the importance of

trade is greater for goods than for services.

       Estimates of U.S. service trade are still a work in progress. A report by the Office of

Technology Assessment estimated that exports of services, excluding banking services, were

about 60 per cent higher than “Official U.S. Government figures” in 1983 and 1984, and that

imports of services were 40-50 per cent higher in those years (U.S. Congress, Office of

Technology Assessment, 1986, Table 1). The latest official BEA calculations of service exports

and imports are quite close to the OTA estimates for those years, but somewhat larger for 1984

(Sauers and Pierce, 2005, Table 1).


       The path to the much higher revised estimates of trade in services was described in the

Appendix to Whichard and Borga (2002). That path began with new legislation in 1984 that

permitted BEA to conduct surveys of trade in services. The first benchmark survey was carried

out for 1986, and annual follow-up surveys began in 1987. Also, in that year medical service

exports were first estimated and primary insurance services were added to previous estimates of

reinsurance transactions. Estimates of expenditures by foreign students in the United States and

U.S. students abroad started in 1989. In 1990, services were redefined to exclude investment

income. In 1992, trade in services between U.S and foreign parents and their affiliates was

placed on a gross, instead of a net, basis, increasing both exports and imports of services,

coverage of transportation services was increased, and some new services were added to the

1991 benchmark. Truck transportation services between the United States and Canada were


                                                                                                   20
added to the service trade account in 1995. In 1996, BEA began a “Benchmark Survey of

Financial Services Transactions Between U.S. Financial Services Providers and Unaffiliated

Foreign Persons.” Since then, there have been other improvements in measures of transportation

services and reclassifications of software royalties and license fees, leasing of transportation

equipment, and compensation of employees, new sources for exports of medical services and

imports of travel, and various other items.

        One consequence of all these improvements in data collection and expansions in the list

of services covered is that historical comparisons over long periods are questionable. The

earliest estimates of U.S. service exports included only shipping earnings, and later also port

charges on foreign ships, and foreign tourist expenditures in the United States, items that

accounted for perhaps a third of service exports in 2003 (BEA website, downloaded in 2006).

The same items, plus estimates of bankers’ commissions might cover more of the current imports

of services, perhaps a little over half.

        Many services in the early United States were performed by foreign companies’ agents or

by affiliates of foreign firms, which possessed skills not common in the United States at that

time. Wilkins (1989) quotes a letter to Alexander Hamilton referring to Virginia to the effect

that “The trade of this state is carried on chiefly with foreign (British) capital. Those engaged in

it [the trade] hardly deserve the name of merchants, being factors, agents, and Shop-keepers of

the Merchants and Manufacturers of Great Britain…” She goes on to say that the passage does

not reveal whether theses were “…salaried, or partners in the British firms”, in which case they

might have represented imports of services into the United States, or “…financially independent

units that acted for British houses on a purely commission basis” (p. 40), in which case they

might have represented U.S. exports of services. Wilkins also reports that America’s national




                                                                                                   21
banking legislation of 1864-65 “…had not provided a satisfactory basis for the largest American

banks to participate in foreign trade financing…” and that as a result, “…to finance much of that

trade, American enterprises depended on foreign (mainly British) banking services “ (p. 463).

Outside of banking, Wilkins notes that “…in 1914, the United States had to rely on foreign-

owned shipping, foreign-owned cables, and foreign-owned radio communication” (p. 524).

Shipping services were recorded in the balance of payments, but not the others.

       Of course, many of the services traded currently, such as telecommunications and film

and television tape rentals, did not exist very long ago, but there apparently were many services

that did exist and were not recorded. It is therefore difficult to be sure how much of the apparent

trend in the share of service trade in total U.S. trade is genuine.



The definition of residence and trade in educational services

        The measurement of trade in more and more services places a great deal of weight on the

definition of residence, because the identification of residence can change what is, on the face of

it, a domestic transaction into an international transaction. One case in which the attribution of

residence changes a domestic demand on a country’s resources into an international demand is

that of foreign students, who are treated as residents of the country from which they come, with

the result that their costs of education and living expenses become a service export of the host

country. The service that is simply domestic production and consumption or investment in

human capital if a student is a resident of the United States, is an export of educational services if

the student is classified as a “foreign resident”.

        Since many students choose to stay in the host country after their education is completed,

the services “exported” to those students’ home countries never leave the host countries. The




                                                                                                   22
service exports are re-imported when the students become host country residents, an item missed

in the balance of payments, or they could be thought of as turning into an import of human

capital by the host country, a type of import that is never recorded.

        U.S. exports of educational services roughly doubled in value between 1992 and 2004,

reaching $13.5 billion (Nephew et al. 2005), but there are no comprehensive data on what

proportion of these service “exports” in fact never leave the United States. A hint that the share

staying in the United States might be important is provided by data on intentions to stay

expressed by foreign recipients of science and engineering doctorates in the United States. There

are data on “intentions to stay,” and on “definite plans to stay”. Among students from countries

accounting for about three quarters of such doctorates between 1985 and 1996, an intention to

stay in the United States was expressed by half in 1985, rising to 70 per cent in 1995 and 1996.

Among degree recipients from all countries, “plans to stay” were expressed by 68 per cent in

1992-95, 72 per cent in 1996-99, and 74 per cent in 2000-03. A “firm plan to stay,” meaning

that the student had accepted a definite offer of a postdoctoral appointment or employment in the

United States was reported by from 36 to 46 per cent of the doctoral recipients over 1985

through 1996, and “definite plans to stay” from 35 per cent in 1992-95, to 46 per cent in 1996-99

and 51 per cent in 2000-2003. (National Science Foundation, 1998b and 2006, Appendix Table 2

-33).

        The data on plans to stay do not reveal outcomes. Some indication of the fulfillment of

these plans is that of about 8,000 temporary residents receiving Science and Engineering

doctorates in 1998, over 60 per cent were still in the United States in 2003 (National Science

Foundation, 2006, Table 3-24).




                                                                                                  23
       Recipients of doctorates were only a small part of the 13 per cent foreign-born share in

R&D scientists and engineers in the United States in 1993, although the foreign-born were more

important among Ph. Ds than among those with less education. At all degree levels, about two

thirds of the foreign-born scientists and engineers employed in the United States had received

their training in the United States (National Science Foundation, 1998a, Table 1).

       If some substantial part of education exports remains in the United States, there is no

clear way to recognize that fact in the current balance of payments framework. What would be

required, but does not exist, is some accounting for flows of human capital. The decisions of

alien “importers” of U.S. education to settle in the United States would then be treated as an

import of human capital, analogous to the standard flows of financial capital. The re-import of

this education would be only a very small part of the imports of human capital via immigration.

       The impact of exports of education services may go beyond the tendency of students to

stay in the countries where they receive higher education. Even if students do not stay after

graduation, they may return as immigrants, carrying back the previously exported education

services. One study of immigration found that student flows explained migration to the United

States more consistently than “…traditionally highlighted economic variables…” Similar

relationships could be observed for migration to a cross-section of OECD countries (Dreher and

Poutvaara, 2005, p. 17).

       The idea that there is a human capital flow missing from the balance of payments data

was suggested a long time ago by Alfred Marshall. “England exports to India a good many able

young men: they do not enter in India’s list of imports; but it is claimed that they render to her

services whose value exceeds that of her total payments to them. They return to England (if they

come back at all) after their best strength has been spent: they are unreckoned exports from




                                                                                                     24
England. But that part of their incomes, which they have saved, is likely to come back sooner or

later in the form of material goods which enter into her imports. On the other hand, India counts

those material goods among her exports to England: but of course she makes no entry among her

imports for the expensive young men who have been sent to her. (Marshall, 1923, pp.134-135).



Tax havens and trade in services

       There is a considerable literature, some of which is summarized in Hines (2005), that

describes the effect of low rates of host country taxation in attracting investment and economic

activity by multinationals from the United States and probably, even more from other countries.

Some of the activity attracted is production, but much of it involves the shifting of income to

avoid or reduce taxes. Hines refers to “an impressive concentration of financial activity in tax

havens.” The 30 tax havens he lists accounted in 1999 for 0.7 per cent of the world’s population

and 2.1 per cent of world GDP, but for 4.8 per cent of net property, plant, and equipment of U.S.

affiliates, 3.4 per cent of employee compensation, and 3.7 per cent of employment. These shares

probably represent production taking place in the tax havens and are not of concern in

connection with the measurement of their production or export of services. However, these same

tax haven affiliates accounted for 15.7 per cent of gross foreign assets of U.S. affiliates, 13.4 per

cent of sales, and “…a staggering 30 per cent of total foreign income…” (ibid. p. 78). “Much of

reported tax haven income consists of financial flows from other foreign affiliates that parents

own indirectly through their tax haven affiliates. Clearly, American firms locate considerable

financial assets in foreign tax havens, and their reported profitability in tax havens greatly

exceeds any measure of their physical presence there” (ibid..). Hines goes on to suggest that

firms in other countries, such as Germany and the Netherlands, that largely exempt their firms’




                                                                                                   25
foreign income from taxation, have even stronger incentives to locate investment and income

production in tax havens (ibid., p. 79). Desai, Foley, and Hines (2003, p. 68) refer to this

flexibility as “…the ability of multinational firms to adjust the reported location of their taxable

profits.”

        This ability of firms to shift the location of assets and profits by paper transactions

internal to the firm makes the location of production ambiguous. That is especially true in

industries, such as banking and other financial services, in which production is intangible, but it

is also the case in other industries based on intellectual property and even in tangible goods

industries in which much of the value of the tangible goods stems from intangible intellectual

property. The ambiguity in the location of production produces a corresponding ambiguity in

measures of exports and imports, which involve the movement of goods and services across

international borders, ultimately from producers to consumers.

        Reported service exports by U.S. affiliates for the world, main regions, and a few selected

countries are shown in Table 6, with comparisons to the service exports reported by the same

countries, mainly to the IMF. The affiliate “exports” are not reported as exports in the BEA

surveys, but as sales by affiliates other than local sales, divided between sales to the United

States and sales to other areas outside the host countries. The comparisons are very imprecise

for a number of reasons. The U.S. affiliate non-local sales of services are incomplete in several

respects. One is that they do not include banking, an important part of service exports

worldwide, because the BEA surveys of banks do not include the extensive list of questions

asked of non-banking parents and their affiliates. Secondly, the BEA data are confined to

majority-owned affiliates, because minority-owned affiliates are not asked the questions about

destination of sales. Third, the BEA data are heavily suppressed, with very little country detail

available for Caribbean countries that account for much of trade in financial services. That

problem could be solved to some extent by making use of the unpublished and confidential data

that have been collected by the BEA but cannot be examined outside the BEA.

       The data reported by the countries to the IMF have other deficiencies. They lack detail,

and more important, several important countries in international trade in services, such as the

Cayman Islands and Bermuda, do not report to the IMF at all. However, Bermuda did report

exports and imports of services in its national accounts.

        For the world as a whole, sales of services outside host countries reported by U.S.

affiliates account for less than 10 per cent of aggregate exports of services reported by host

countries. In a few cases, the share of U.S. affiliates is much higher. One example is

Switzerland, where they were more than a third in 2002. For western hemisphere countries

outside of Central and South America, sales outside the host countries by U.S. affiliates were

larger than the aggregate service exports reported by countries in 2002. That was particularly the

case for Bermuda’s reported service exports in its national accounts (Bermuda did not report to

the IMF). In the case of Barbados in 2002, the reported U.S. affiliate service sales outside the

host country were 23 per cent larger than the total service exports reported to the IMF.

       Within Europe, where much more country detail is available, the notable change between

1999 and 2002 is that the growth of U.S. affiliate sales outside their host countries was, in a

number of cases, large relative to country reports to the IMF of increases in service exports. In

the Netherlands, U.S. affiliate external sales rose by almost $3 billion, while service exports

reported to the IMF rose by $6.8 billion. In Switzerland, U.S. affiliate external sales of services

increased by $10 billion, while service exports reported to the IMF rose by less than $1 billion.

And in the United Kingdom, U.S. affiliate external sales grew by over $11 billion, while service




                                                                                                    29
exports reported to the IMF increased by $14 billion. Those high U.S. affiliate external sales

figures suggest, at a minimum, that there are differences between what the host countries think

their service exports are and what the affiliates consider their external sales of services.

       Table 7 gives some hints about the characteristics of U.S. affiliates in various host

countries and what their peculiarities are. Affiliates in the area called “Other Western

Hemisphere,” essentially islands in the Caribbean, own enormous assets relative to their labor

input, measured by employment or employee compensation. For example, while the average

ratio around the world is about $700,000 per employee, the ratios in the three European countries

shown are all over $1.7 million per employee and those for affiliates in “Other Western

Hemisphere” are $9 million per employee. Within that group, affiliates in Bermuda had assets of

over $16 million per employee and those in the UK Islands in the Caribbean, $28 million per

employee. While worldwide, U.S. affiliates owned assets 21 times their payrolls, those in “Other

Western Hemisphere” had assets over 300 times their payrolls. Their activities appear to be very

capital-intensive types of production.

       Of course, capital/labor ratios could differ across countries because the industry

composition of production is different. In some cases, it is possible to compare capital/labor

ratios within broad industries. Tables 8 and 9 show the ratios for Depository Institutions and for

Finance (except depository institutions), and Insurance. In the case of depository institutions, in

which the worldwide average assets per employee in U.S. affiliates was $10 million, U.S.

affiliates in “Other Western Hemisphere” owned $117 million of assets per employee. Their

assets were more than 2,000 times their employee compensation, as compared with about 150

times employee compensation worldwide (Table 8).

                                                                                                                         32
        In Other Finance and Insurance, U.S. affiliates worldwide owned $6.6 million in assets

per employee while those in Switzerland owned assets of over $22 million per employee, those

in Bermuda, almost $28 million per employee, and those in “Other UK Islands,” over $60

million per employee. Worldwide, U.S. affiliates in this industry owned assets almost 100 times

their payrolls, but those in Switzerland had assets 175 times their payrolls and those in “Other

Western Hemisphere,” assets 300 to 400 times their payrolls (Table 9).

        The data for the two finance sectors make it clear that the loading of assets on to U.S.

affiliates in Switzerland and the Caribbean is not simply a result of the industry composition of

investment in those countries, but represents a choice by parent companies in financial service

industries to attribute assets to these locations.

        The assets producing the sales by U.S. affiliates, in countries where the ratio of assets to

labor inputs is particularly high, are not primarily physical assets, as can be seen from Table 10.

The worldwide ratio of total assets to net property, plant, and equipment in U.S. nonbank

affiliates was 5.6 in 1999, but the ratio in the Netherlands was almost 14, in Switzerland, 23, in

Bermuda, 27, and in UK Islands in the Caribbean, 34. Most of the assets of these asset-rich

affiliates were financial assets or intellectual property. It would be hard to define the location of

these assets, and if they are the basis for most of the output of these affiliates, one could say that

only statistical convention places that output in these affiliates’ host countries.

        Table 11 displays the “profit-type return” relative to labor compensation, for those

affiliates that are not only nonbank, but also majority-owned for both 1999 and 2002. Profit-type

return “…measures profits before income taxes, and it excludes nonoperating items (such as

special charges and capital gains and losses) and income from equity investments.” (U.S.,

Bureau of Economic Analysis, 2004, p. M-19). These ratios are clearly related to the asset/labor




                                                                                                    33

ratios of Table 7. While the worldwide ratios of “profit-type return” to payrolls were 56 and 57

per cent in the two years, those for Ireland were 400 and 572 per cent , and those for “Other

Western Hemisphere were over 600 per cent in both years. They were around 1300 per cent for

affiliates in Bermuda, 3000 to 5000 per cent for those in Barbados, and well over 1000 per cent

in UK Islands and other countries in the Caribbean area. The extremely high ratios of capital to

labor income are achieved by attributing large amounts of capital to the affiliates in these

countries.

       In the case of one service imported into the United States, insurance services, data are

available for imports in recent years from all sources, not only U.S. affiliates (Table 12). U.S.

imports of insurance services increased rapidly between 2001 and 2003, by more than half. The

tiny islands of the Caribbean, containing a negligible fraction of the world’s population, were

responsible for over half of U.S. imports of insurance services in 2001 and almost half in 2003.

Extreme specialization is not impossible, but it is hard to think of what resources in these islands

are producing all these services.

     While the allocation of financial assets to low tax countries is the most common distortion

of the location of production, and along with production, exports and imports, other intangible

assets are subject to similar manipulation and the creation of phantom flows of trade.. In 1997,

Microsoft made a major allocation of intellectual property to an Irish subsidiary, which collects

licensing fees from Microsoft sales to many other countries and, in the process, “…helps the

computer giant shave at least $500 million from its annual tax bill” (Wall Street Journal,

November 7, 2005, p. 1). The subsidiary has “…a thin roster of employees…” and the software

was mostly developed outside Ireland, but the subsidiary “…controls more than $16 billion in

Microsoft assets” (ibid.).

           Publicly available data do not report individual company transactions, but this one,

perhaps in combination with similar moves by other firms, made its mark in a number of places

in aggregate data. It is difficult to compare 1994 and 1999 BEA numbers by industry because of

the shift from the SIC to NAICS industry classifications, but this and similar transactions may

have figured in the more than tenfold growth over that period in the sales of U.S. affiliates in

Ireland classified as “Electronic and Other Electric Equipment” or “Services” in 1994 or as

“Computers and Electronic Products” or “Professional, Scientific and Technical Services” in

1999, from $2.5 billion to $26 billion (U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, 1998 and 2004).

There was a considerable growth in employment also, but only from 14 thousand to 36 thousand

(ibid.).

           Ireland as a country reported a major growth in exports of services the year after

Microsoft’s move. Exports of “Other Services” jumped from $US 2.3 billion in 1997 to $US

11.6 billion in 1998, of which exports of Computer and Information Services (not reported

before 1998) were $US 5.3 billion (IMF, 2006). It appears that Ireland’s exports of “Other

Services” before 1998 was composed only of royalties and license fees, government services,

n.i.e., and “Other business services”. The fact that there was no decline in the last category in

1998, when reports for five new service exports were added, suggests that they were not included

in this category before that data, and were probably not estimated at all.

           Software is not the only corporate asset subject to international shifting for tax purposes.

One news article on such shifts referred to “…patents on drugs, ownership of corporate logos,

techniques for manufacturing processes and other intellectual assets …” and quoted a tax lawyer

as calling such moves routine, “ ‘international tax planning 101’”. He added that “ ‘most of the

assets that are going to be relocated as part of a global repositioning are intellectual



                                                                                                     39
property…that is where most of the profit is. When you buy a pair of sneakers for $250, it’s the

swoosh symbol, not the rubber’, you pay for”. (“Key Company Assets Moving Offshore,” New

York Times, Nov. 22, 2002).

       Phantom flows are not confined to the services trade account, although they are more

important there than in goods trade. For example, trade statistics have long shown exports of

ships to Panama, Honduras, and Liberia, “flags of convenience,” which became the Pan-Hon-Lib

(or PHL) fleet. These ships were counted in trade statistics as exports to those countries because

the ships were registered there, but they may never have crossed the borders of the three

countries and were never owned by firms located there. The ships were owned “mainly by

residents of the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Continent” (Woolley, 1966, p.43).

       The amounts of this trade were substantial. In the 1960s, Liberia was the only country of

the three to which exporters reported significant exports of ships, always less than $1 billion per

year, but by the 1990s, reported exports of ships to Liberia were running at $3 - 4 billion per

year, and exports to Panama were $8-9 billion per year (NBER- UN World Trade Data Base).

       While exporting countries reported total exports of goods to Liberia of $13.6 billion

between 1982 and 1987, Liberia reported total imports of only $1.9 billion to the IMF (IMF

2006). Most of the difference was accounted for by $10.2 billion of exports of ships to Liberia

reported by exporting countries but never entered into Liberia’s balance of payments data,

presumably because the ships never entered Liberia and were never owned by residents of

Liberia. Panama had an even larger registered fleet that never crossed the country’s borders, to

judge by the trade data. Total exports to Panama reported by exporters amounted to $169.5

billion from 1984 through 2000, while goods imports reported by Panama to the IMF totaled




                                                                                                  40
$82.8 billion over the same period. The difference was more than accounted for by $94.5 billion

in reported exports of ships, not recognized as imports by Panama.

       These fleets created corresponding problems for the service accounts. According to

Karreman (1961), “The earnings and disbursements of vessels flying the flags of Panama,

Honduras, and Liberia are not reported at all by those countries, since they ‘do not consider the

vessels as part of their economy.’ Among reasons for registering ships under those flags… is

that those countries do not demand financial statements… and do not levy taxes on the

companies that own the ships. Another reason is that those three countries do not keep a close

watch on labor conditions prevailing on board those ships” (p. 27).



The Definition of Residence: What does the Current Account Balance Measure ?

       The Review Committee for Balance of Payments Statistics (1965) suggested that

”balance of payments data are peculiarly elusive” because, “The basic criterion for a balance of

payments transaction is that it is between a domestic and a foreign ‘resident.’…The application

of this set of concepts to concrete situations may involve subtle distinctions, and it is often

difficult to determine residence even when all the facts are known….Distinctions based on the

balance of payments concept of residence have not ordinarily been important in the affairs of

business firms, governments, or households; the concept, therefore, is not normally reflected in

their records. The balance of payments statistician seeking data on international transactions

from these records finds himself asking questions that are likely to be new and alien to the

company’s or the agency’s normal way of thinking.” (pp. 16-17).

       As the importance of intangible assets has grown, particularly for the United States, it

may no longer be true that questions of residence are new or alien to the thinking of companies,




                                                                                                  41
but the way they have become familiar to companies is different from the way that economists

think of them. For companies, issues of residence, or the location of intangible assets, are

important as tools for minimizing taxes, and companies can manipulate the residence of assets in

ways that do not fit with economists’ concepts of trade and production.

       What are the economist’s concepts of trade and the current balance? Meade (1951, p. 34)

defined exports as an element of “…demands for goods and services which directly or indirectly

cause a demand for factors of production (i.e. for the productive services of land, capital,

enterprise and work)…” whose incomes are recorded in the national income. Imports,

correspondingly, lead to a demand for “…the productive resources of other countries.”

        If we interpret that criterion as requiring that exports use the factors of production

physically located in a country, several aspects of current practice appear to contradict it. An

example is the treatment of firms “…organized in the United States and controlled by U.S.

interests, but operating abroad” as U.S. residents (U.S. Department of Commerce, 1990, pp. 3-4).

The same is true of the treatment as domestic production, a source of exports, of production

“…undertaken by a resident even though the physical process takes place outside the economic

territory.” (IMF, 1993, p. 23.)

       If the object in the balance of payments is not to measure the physical movement of

goods or services, and trade in services does not involve a change in ownership, what is the goal

of the measurement? Writings about the balance of trade, and particularly about the balance of

payments, have often had a whiff of mercantilism about them. That used to be especially clear in

the references to “favorable” or “unfavorable” balances. These terms have virtually disappeared,

but they reflected the traditional purpose of the calculations, which was to know whether a

country was gaining or losing gold. In an international regime aiming at stability of exchange




                                                                                                   42
rates, the substitute was the question of demand for and supply of a country’s currency. One

reflection of that aim was the effort to define “autonomous” and “accommodating” transactions,

as in Meade (1951, pp. 11-16). In the United States, there was a search for the appropriate

measure of balance-of-payments deficits or surpluses, the need for which stemmed from the fact

that “Leading countries have established fixed parities for their currencies and have undertaken

to maintain exchange rates within prescribed margins of those parities” (Review Committee for

Balance of Payments Statistics, 1965, p. 2). That purpose too has become obsolete. The Bureau

of Economic Analysis, describing concepts underlying the balance of payments in 1990, does not

provide a purpose for the calculation, but defines it simply as “…a statistical summary of

international transactions…defined as the transfer of ownership of something that has an

economic value measurable in monetary terms from residents of one country to residents of

another” (U.S. Department of Commerce, 1990, p. xiii). The article explaining alternative

frameworks for the international accounts (Landefeld, Whichard, and Lowe, 1993) refers to the

“standard balance of payments” as providing “…indicators of returns to domestic versus foreign

factors of production…” (p. 51), echoing Meade’s description.

       A more recent textbook defines a country’s current account balance as “…the change in

the value of its net claims on the rest of the world- the change in its net foreign assets” (Obstfeld

and Rogoff, 1996, p. 4). The issue of residence remains. An intangible asset has no real

geographical location; its only definite location is its ownership. A multinational corporate

owner can choose to assign the ownership of an intangible asset to an affiliate anywhere in the

world. By moving a piece of paper from one pocket to another, the firm changes the apparent

geographical location of an asset, of production from that asset, and the direction of trade flows

from its output. Production that had been taking place in the home country now takes place in




                                                                                                   43
the country of assignment of the asset. The home country, or other former nominal location of

the asset, which had been credited with its output, is now reported to be importing that output.

Has anything really happened? Can we accept that there has been a change in the reality we are

trying to measure, or are we being fooled into thinking that some economic event has taken place

when it has not?

        Since transfer of ownership from residents of one country to residents of another country

defines trade, the definition of residence is crucial. That definition gives rise to many of the

problems in measuring trade in services discussed above. The effects of the definition of

residence are broader than the balance of payments, extending to the measurement of national

income and product. If income and product are measured from the product, or final use side, the

definition of residence determines which transactions enter the balance of payments. If income

and product are measured from the income side, the definition of residence determines the

geographical allocation of net profits of firms operating in multiple locations.

       The issue for income and product accounts is illustrated in the calculation of sub-national

income and product aggregates. In the United States, this has usually been done from the income

side, avoiding the need to measure exports and imports of states, for example. The problem is

then faced in the allocation of profits. In one of the earliest such attempts, for 1919 (Knauth,

1923), the issue gets short shrift, after a brief comment that “The corporate surplus in 1919…is a

difficult item to distribute among the states.” The solution proposed was to distribute it in

proportion to value added in manufacturing. That was intended to be a rough approximation to a

distribution by the location of production. A slightly later estimate (Leven, 1925) attempted to

distribute entrepreneurial and property income by the distribution of the recipients of the income.




                                                                                                   44
        The current BEA estimates of Gross State Product, most fully described in Friedenberg

and Beemiller (1997), are still based on the income side of the accounts, and therefore do not

have to estimate exports and imports to and from each state, but still suffer to some extent from

the uncertainty about the location of the output reflected in the nonwage part of value added.

However, the basic sources of data are available on an establishment basis for most industries,

and the BEA appears to believe that using establishment data at least reduces the ambiguity

about where the production corresponding to the value added takes place. The greater the

importance of production from intangible assets, the less one can learn from using establishment

data.

        In the cases of international service trade based on intangible assets, if the assets

producing these services are exported to some countries by simply placing them on the books of

the affiliates incorporated there, what local resources are used in producing these services? What

is the flow of services from these exporters that is equivalent to the flow of goods measured in

the goods trade accounts? What would be the significance to the U.S. economy of a rise in the

deficit from these imaginary international flows?

        If there are what appear to be large distortions in the service trade data, or extreme

flexibility in assigning production of services to locations, they raise questions about the

meaning and purpose of the balance of payments accounts. Procedures for measurement are

often justified by conformity with IMF manuals and the SNA, without much discussion of the

underlying purposes of the measurement. And they rarely discuss the implications, if any, of

moving from a world in which production and trade consist mostly of goods to a world in which

most production is in the form of services, and the implications of moving from a world in which

production within a firm is located in a firm’s home country to a world in which production




                                                                                                   45
within a firm combines inputs located in many countries or worse, inputs with no definite

geographical location.

       The issue here is not what tax havens and the shifting of assets do to home and host

country tax revenues. The focus is on the tiny tax havens because some of them have so little

production outside of tax avoidance activities that it is relatively clear what is going on there.

However, much the same problem in measuring flows of services must exist, more hidden, in

larger countries. The question is whether we are, by our ways of measuring, creating phantom

international flows of some services that may not be crossing international borders at all.

Services that are produced and consumed entirely within the United States without crossing

borders may appear to be imported into the United States and exported from some Caribbean

Island. What do we learn about the economy of the United States or of the “exporting country”

from observing these phantom flows?

       Various ways have been suggested for incorporating production by foreign affiliates into

international accounts by producing accounts on what is referred to as an “ownership” rather

than a “residency” basis. While these accounts are not intended as replacements for the standard

balance of payments accounts, and some of them are intended for different purposes, such as

measuring the shares of world sales or production controlled by a country’s firms, they

sometimes do, in the process, escape from counting transactions that do not really take place by

combining the operations of parent firms with those of their foreign affiliates. Several papers

(Lipsey and Kravis, 1985, 1987, and 1992 and Blomström and Lipsey, 1989 and 1993) attempted

to measure and explain shares in world exports of firms based in the United States and Sweden,

combining the exports of parent firms with those of their foreign affiliates. Recalculations of the

payments balance along ownership, rather than geographical lines were suggested by DeAnne




                                                                                                     46
Julius (1990), and by a National Research Council panel (National Research Council, Panel on

Foreign Trade Statistics, 1992) and carried out for the United States in Baldwin and Kimura

(1998) and for Japan in Kimura and Baldwin (1998). The Bureau of Economic Analysis now

regularly publishes an ownership-based current account for the United States, explained in

Landefeld, Whichard, and Lowe (1993). The latest of these is U.S. Bureau of Economic

Analysis (2006).

        The common feature of these alternative measures is that they are based on the ownership

of the productive resources or of the firms in which production takes place, rather than the

location of the resources. In this way, they net out the effects of some of what I have described

as phantom transactions in the ownership-based accounts, although they do not remove them

from the standard accounts. For example, the transfer of intangible assets to a foreign affiliate

would, in the BEA ownership-based accounts, still reduce the service exports of the United

States, but that reduction would presumably be offset by an increase in the sales by foreign

affiliates, from which purchases by the affiliates from the United States and payments to foreign

factors of production would be subtracted. Similarly, increased purchases of insurance services

from re-insurance affiliates in the Caribbean would still appear in imports of services, but the

negative effect on the current balance would be offset, again, by increases in export sales by

foreign affiliates.

        The calculations by Baldwin and Kimura are more focused on the ownership of

production, adding the production, or value added, by U.S. affiliates abroad to production in the

United States by U.S.-owned firms. They do not subtract the payments to foreign labor by U.S.

affiliates, as the BEA calculations do, since those payments are part of the value added under the

control of U.S. firms, even though they are payments for resources resident abroad. However,




                                                                                                    47
this calculation washes out the effects of our “phantom” transactions, as the BEA calculation

does. The transfer of intangible assets to a U.S. affiliate overseas does not move the production

from that asset out of the U.S. firm, even though it moves it geographically.

        Given the ease with which the nominal location of production, imports, and exports from

intangible assets can be manipulated, the path of these variables might be better represented by

consistently attributing them to parent companies, the ultimate beneficial owners, in BEA

terminology.



Summary and Conclusions

       Trade in services is more difficult to define and measure than trade in goods, and as a

consequence, its size and growth are much less certain. A world total in recent years of a little

under $2,000 billion, is the reported value, approximately one quarter of world trade in goods.

The trend in the importance of services trade is even harder to guess, because the number of

services measured and the number of countries measuring service trade has increased, especially

since 1975. Despite those increases, there is only slight evidence of a rise in the importance of

service trade relative to goods trade.

       Since the United States has been a leader in measuring service trade, the data are more

complete than those for the world. Service exports have recently been over 40 per cent of goods

exports, while service imports have been only about 20 per cent of goods imports, but service

imports have been growing much faster than service exports in the last five years. The current

large importance of services in U.S. exports is not unprecedented. Service exports were about 30

per cent of goods exports in the first three decades of the existence of the United States. They




                                                                                                    48
fell to low levels (5 per cent or less of goods exports) at the end of the 19th Century and the

beginning of the 20th, and have been rising since then.

       Relative to goods and services output, service exports and imports are much smaller than

goods exports and imports, especially the imports. Service exports and imports are about 5 per

cent of services output, while goods imports are over a third of goods output and goods exports

are over 20 per cent of goods output. Both goods and services exports are at historically high

levels relative to output, compared to the period since 1869, and the same is true for goods

imports, which have risen steadily since 1950 after a long secular decline from 1869 to World

War II. Changes in services imports relative to services output have been much smaller, and the

ratio for 2000-2005 is not very different from that for 1869-73.

       The measures of service trade, because they are not anchored in any observation of

physical movement, are, much more than those of goods trade, determined by the definition of

residence, since residence, rather than an observed movement of a final product, determines what

is an export or import. The problem is illustrated by the case of trade in educational services,

because the determination that an ostensibly domestic transaction is an import or export rests on

a difference in residence between the provider and the acquirer of the service. A paradoxical

aspect of this definition is that, especially in the United States, much of the “exported”

educational service never leaves the United States because the recipients decide to become U.S.

residents. What would be necessary to close this gap between the service trade measure and

reality would be an account for flows of human capital which would show the service imported

into the United States in the form of human capital. An alternative would be to treat the

educational expenditure as an internal trade within the United States until the recipient crossed

the border to return home, if he or she did so, and then enter it into exports of services. A




                                                                                                    49
drawback of this scheme is that it would not account for the re-import of previously exported

services when the recipient of a U.S. education returned to the United States at a later date.

       The most serious problem for the measurement of service trade is the expanding use of

the placement of intangible assets by parent firms in low tax jurisdictions. Since the assets are

intangible, including financial assets, patents, trade marks, rights to designs, corporate logos,

they have no particular geographical location, and can be attributed by the parent company of a

multinational to any of its affiliates. The result is that the output and exports stemming from

these assets can also be attributed to geographical locations almost at will, subject to some

limited regulation by tax authorities, without any relation to the actual location of any physical

aspect of the production. A large part of service production, exports, and imports can begin to

consist of “phantom” production and trade that makes no use of factors of production actually

resident in the countries to which they are attributed. If that takes place to an important degree,

the measures of the current balance and national income and output begin to lose their meaning.

       Some evidence of the effects of shifts in residence of assets is available for the United

States, because the data are most complete, but the same phenomena must affect the data for

other countries. Furthermore, they are not confined to service trade, but affect measures of

goods trade as well. The only solution that seems feasible is to consolidate the operations of

multinational parents and their affiliates in the data, attributing all operations to the parent

country, and counting as trade only transactions outside the multinational firm, between

segments of the firm and unaffiliated entities. The closest approximation to this is the

“ownership-based” accounts of the BEA, but these are not incorporated into the international

transactions accounts or national accounts in general. Perhaps it is time to take the ownership

accounts more seriously.
