1.   Introduction

       This paper provides a choice theoretic, general equilibrium account

of the balance of payments adjustment process and the determination of

national price levels in a world comprised of countries populated by rational

households. The setting is similar in some respects to that proposed by

Mundell (1968) and Dornbusch (1973) in that households consume and produce

a single good, save by accumulating balances of domestic money, and exchange

domestic for foreign currencies at rates which are fixed by central bank

intervention. However, in contrast to the approaches prevalent in the

modern monetary approach literature (as surveyed by Frenkel and Johnson

(1976) and Frenkel and Mussa (1984)), we study the balance of payments ad-

justment process in an explicit general equilibrium framework in which

expenditure, saving, and money demand relationships are based upon the inter-

temporal, utility maximizations nroblerns of risk-averse, forward looking

households who confront random fluctuations in their labor productivities.

       Non-trivial balance of payments adjustment dynamics arise in the

equilibrium of this model from the Precautionary saving behavior of risk-.

averse households who attempt to self-insure against unanticipated, country

specific productivity fluctuations by accumulating, via balance of payments

surpluses in relatively productive periods, buffer stocks of domestic money

                                                                           2




balances which can be drawn down to finance payments deficits, and thus

a less variable profile of spending relative to income, when productivity

is unexpectedly low.' An appeal of our inventory theoretic approach is that

we are able to derive the typically postualted properties of

savings behavior in a rational expectations general equilibrium framework

which does not require that money holdings yield Dositive utility. In par-

ticular, the balance of payments adjustment process exhibited in the equi-

librium of this model is driven by the precise sort of partial-adjustment-

to-target savings behavior typically postulated in the monetary approach

literature.

       The model developed here is adapted from the work of Foley and

Heliwig (1975) and Lucas (1980) and employs the device of a continuum of

countries which experience independently andidentically distributed pro-

ductivity fluctuations in each period. With no fluctuations in the per

capita world supply of output, there exists a rational exnectations equi-

librium which is characterized by a stationary distribution of international

reserves among countries and constant national price levels which depend

in an explicit way on household's attitudes toward risk and the probability

distribution of productivity shocks. Thus, our analysis makes rigorous

the key role played by the distribution of international reserves among

countries, and not just their aggregate supply, in the determination of

national price levels--a role often emphasized in the monetary approach.

literature Csee especially Dornbusch (1973)).

       The plan of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, we set UP the

general equilibrium model of international trade and reserve flows, estab-

lish the homogeneity and monctonicity properties of optimal expenditure

and savings functions, and establish the existence of a stationary rational
 expectations equilibrium. In Section 3, we show that equilibrium savings

behavior exhibits the partial-adjustment-to-target properties postulated

in the monetary approach literature. In particular, there exists in each

country a unique target stock of money balances at which planned savings

is zero and expenditure equals expected nominal income. We show that risk-

averse households strive to accumulate money balances in excess of those

required      to finance a spending flow equal to expected nominal income. Such
buffer     stocks of liquidity are held in   equilibrium, even though households
discount      future utility, for self-insurance against unexpected productivity

shocks and allow households to attain a less variable profile of consumption

relative to output. However, in equilibrium, self-insurance is not complete:

real expenditure is shown to     be positively correlated with unanticipated
productivity     shocks and is in fact ?darkovian even though shocks are assumed

to be i.i.d. A key result is that, in equilibrium, planned saving in

each country is strictly less than the gap between actual and target money

balances. These properties of equilibrium saving behavior are used to place

restrictions on the non linear stochastic difference equation which is shown

to   govern   the time path of the balance of payments in each country. In

particular, payments imbalances which result from an unanticipated, transi-

tory productivity shock are shown to exhibit persistence which results from

each household's attempt to restore its cash balance position to target

only partially in any given Deriod. Section 4 provides some concluding

remarks.

2.     The Model

          We study a world economy comprised of a continuum of countries, in-

dexed i       [0,1] ,   each with its own central bank and a representative

household. Households have an infinite planning horizon, are risk averse,

and have access to a stochastic, Ricardian technology which transforms labor

into    the single, tradable consumption good. We assume that labor is not
mobile internationally and that no utility is attached to leisure. Time
is   discrete, and in each period t = 0, 1, 2, ...     the   labor input require-

ment in each country is randomly shocked. These shocks are assumed to be

independently and identically distributed both across countries and time

so   that, with a continuum of countries, there is no fluctuation in the per

capita world supply of output. Normalizing the labor endowment in each

country to unity, let          denote the output of country i at date t

Formally,          is a drawing from a finite set of non-negative random vari-

ables from the fixed c.d.f. G such that G(O) > 0        and G()       1 .       The

only asset available to each household is domestic money which is the lia-

bility of the domestic central bank and is backed entirely by fiat inter-

national reserves. Denote by H and R the monetary liabilities and

international reserve holdings of the central bank in i at date t           ,    and

let 1/el be the rate at which that bank stands ready to exchange reserves

for balances of its monetary liabilities acquired by central banks in other

countries as the asset of foreign purchases by domestic residents. The

balance shett of the central bank in country i is given in Figure 1.

         Trading arrangements are as follows. At the beginning of each period,

before the realization of the productivity shock is known, each household

makes a spending-savings decision. Nominal spending is constrained by

beginning-of-period money balances. One member of each household, the shopper,
                                                                                5



 takes a portion of the beginning-of-period money balances and visits other
 countries to purchase the consumption good. Purchases must be made in the
 seller's                             -      .             .
            currency. Upon arriving in a foreign country with goods to sell,
                                                                                    2


 the shopper exchanges domestic for foreign balances with that country's

 central bank at the rate of 0f,0h units of foreign currency per unit of

 domestic currency. The shopper then uses the foreign currency acquired

 to purchase the consumption good in that country. The process continues

until each shopper exhausts the money balances with which he began. While

the shopper is away, the worker in each country learns the productivity

shock and produces output which is sold to shoppers from other countries who

exchange their home currencies for domestic money balances with the domes-

tic central bank. At the end of the period, shoppers return home, divide

their purchases with workers, and consume, while central banks settle claims

among   themselves. Central banks in countries in which sales (exports) ex-
ceed purchases (imports) gain reserves since foreign currencies acquired
through trade are convertible to reserves at fixed rate. Given our assump-.
tion that monetary liabilities are backed entirely by foreign exchange
reserves, the fixed exchange rate regime is sustainable with certainty.

        Denote by p the money price of goods in i at t         .   We shall

assume sufficient goods market arbitrage so that national price levels are

linked by the purchasing power parity condition

tion of (1) is that the implicit rate of exchange between reserves and the

consumption good

is   equal across all countries i                       [0,1] in each period t = 1, 2, .,.

Following      Lucas (1980), we shall study a world economy with a constant per

capita supply of international reserves                          and seek an equilibrium in which

national price levels are constant. We note, however, that the equilibrium

time paths of spending and the balance of payments will fluctuate in equi-

librium as countries are continually shocked by new drawings of c .                        In
Section 3, we investigate the persistence of these fluctuations, However,

we must first establish the existence of a stationary rational expectations

equilibrium. We begin with the intertemporal optimization problem of a

representative household.

where 0 <        <1      is the rate at which future utility is discounted,

                                       pc        nominal spending at time t

        Let     v(H;    p; G) be the value of (2) for a household which begins

the period with nominal balances H                      ,   faces the constant domestic price
level p in the current and all future periods, and behaves optimally.

The household's current period decision problem is
                                                                                       7




          v(H;p;G) =      max   u(c/p) +8fV(H-cz+pc; p; G)dG()        .           (7)
                       O<a<H



 The following proposition, which is proven in the appendix, establishes the

 relevant properties of optimal spending behavior implied by (7).


 Proposition 2.1: Under the assumptions on u and G              ,    there exists a
unique, Continuous, strictly increasing, and strictly concave value func-

tion and a unique, continuous, linearly homogeneous expenditure function

ci(H;p;G) which solves (2). The marginal propensity to spend is strictly

positive and less-than unity. That is, for all A > 0


               0 < a(H+A; p; G) - cz(H;p;G) <     A     .                        (8)

          We note that expenditure depends upon money balances, the price level,

and the probability distribution of productivity shocks, since actual produc-

tivity and thus output is unknown at the time the spending decision is made.

          Let s(H;p; ;G) p - a(H;p;G) denote the household's planned ac-
cumulation   of money     balances over the period where            Ec , and denote
by   s(H;p; ;G)      pe   -cL(H;p;G)   realized accumulation of money balances.
Planned   and actual saving will differ whenever actual productivity differs

from mean productivity. The following corollary follows immediately from

Proposition 2.1.


Corollary 2.2: There exists a unique, continuous savings function

s(H;p; ;G) which is linearly homogeneous in H and p . The marginal

propensity to save is strictly negative and less than unity in absolute

value. That is, for all A > 0


              0 <   s(H;p;c;G)   -   s(H+A; p; G) < A       .                    (9)
                                                                                                 8



          As demonstrated in the appendix, the result that the marginal propen-
sity   to spend is strictly less than unity follows from the Inada condition

on preferences and     the     assumption that there is a strictly positive prob-

ability that the household will have no output to sell at the end of the

period. Under these conditions, it is never optimal to allow the stock of

money   balances to be drawn down to zero, or to consume all                  of any invest-

ment to   money balances. If u'(O) <              or G(0) =        0   ,   it will be optimal
for   a household to spend all of its beginning-of-period money balances when.

the latter falls below the threshold level                   11   , where     11   is   the unique
solution to u'(ll/p) =         fv'(pE)dG(c)
         The international reserve holdings of each central bank evolve accord-

ing to the Markov process


                   =       -
                       R       Kc(R/K;   G) +
                                                Ket   ;                                     (10)

where we have used the fact that H/p = R/K                and the result, established

in   the appendix, that optimal consumption--real expenditure--is a time in-
variant function of real balances. In equilibrium, the per capita demand
for reserves by all central banks must equal the given supply                           at the
assumed constant national price levels and implicit rate of exchange be-
tween reserves and the consuinption.good. The per capita end of period
demand for reserves depends upon the beginning-of-period distribution of
reserves among central banks, J(R) .            Given     J ,     the per capita demand
is
                                                                                             9



               ff(R- uc(R/K; G) +Ke)dJ(R)dG(c) .                                          (11)


Substituting m H/p               = R/K      into (11) and   letting    F(m)   J(Km) denote

the   beginning-of-period distribution of real balances among countries, we
obtain the following equilibrium condition

               ff(m_c(m;G) +c)dF(m)dG(e) =               R/K                              (12)

         From the goods-market arbitrage relationship (2), we know that na-
tional price levels are proportional to K ,                    the   implicit reserves price

of goods. The value of K which satisfies (12) will depend upon the dis-

tribution of real reserves F(in) over countries. For households' expecta-

tions that national price levels be constant over time to be rational, we

require that F(m) be a stationary distribution for the Markov process

which governs the evolution of real balances in each country


                      =          -
                          flit       c(m;    G) +                                         (13)


The existence of a stationary rational expectations equilibrium is estab-

lished in the following proposition.


Proposition 2.3: There exists a unique, stationary rational expectations

equilibrium.       The equilibrium distribution of international reserves among
countries does not change over time and is given by J(R) =                    F(R/ K)   where
F    is the unique stationary distribution for (13) and K is the equilibrium
(implicit) rate of exchange between reserves and the consumption good

               K   = L'ff(m-c(m;G) +c)dF(m)dG(c)                                          (15)

In   equilibrium,   national         price   levels   are constant and satisfy, for all

I     [0,1]
                                                                                       10



                    =   e'/ff(m_c(m;G)    +c)dF(m)dG()                                (16)



Proof: Foley and Heliwig (1975), Proposition 4, pp. 335-336, establish

the existence of a unique stationary F for the Markov process (13) in a

two-state model in which Prob(c = 0) = q          ;   Prob(c =       = 1-q   .    The ex-

tension to the case in which c takes on more than two values is trivial

and will be omitted. Given F ,            K   is uniquely determined by (15). Given

the equilibrium K ,           the unique stationary distribution of international

reserves among      countries     is defined by J(R) = F(R/K)    .   Since       F is a

stationary distribution, we have


               fmidF(m) - fmdF(m)         =   - fc(m.;   G)dF(m) = 0   ;              (17)



for all t = 0, 1, 2, ...           so that the goods market clears in every period

at the constant national price levels p1 = 01K            and exchange rates

for all i, 5            [0,1] .                                                     Q.ED.

       The interpretation of the stationary equilibrium established in

Proposition 2.3 is as follows. If international reserves are initially

distributed among countries according to J ,             then national price levels
p' = 01K   ,            [0,1] will clear the goods and asset markets in each

period t =     0,   1, 2, ...     and the distribution of international reserves

among countries will not change. In this equilibrium, the balance of pay-

ments in each country will be shown to fluctuate in a persistent manner

as national productivities are continually shocked. These payments imbal-

ances will induce reserve flows among countries, but in the aggregate, the

fraction of countries with international reserves less than or equal to
any particular value will remain constant. Alternatively, if international
reserves are initially distributed according to some other J0(R) J(R) ,
                                                                                 11




the system will converge to the stationary rational expectations equilibrium

if households have static expectations. Of course, in this case, static

expectations will only be rational in the limit.5 This convergence under

static expectations is exactly analogous to the properties of the two-country

model studied by Dornbusch ((1973); 1980, Ch. 8) based upon postulated ex-

penditure and savings functions and static expectations.          However, in

Dornbusch's analysis the long-run equilibrium in which static expectations

are rational is characterized by a zero balance of payments in each country..

We now investigate the balance of payments adjustment process exhibited

in the rational expectations equilibrium of our model.



3. The Balance of Payments Adjustment Process

         In the stationary, rational expectations equilibrium, the time path

of   the balance of payments in each country is completely characterized by
the following     non-linear stochastic difference equation



              s1 = s((s;       )   + s; cr1)     ;                              (18)



where    +(s;c)     s(s(H;p;c;G) + p(p—c))   =   s(s(H;p;;G)     = H   .   The bal-

ance of payments is not Harkov: knowledge of s alone is not sufficient

to determine the probability distribution of
                                                     s÷       However given

{s = s;
              =      we can calculate



              Prob{s1 <s'ls = s;         =       = G((s(s')   -s—(s;c))/p). (19)


        In order to obtain sharper results, we must first establish additional

properties of optimal precautionary savings behavior. We now show that

saving in each country exhibits the precise set of partial-adjustment-to-
                                                                                                12



target behavior typically postulated in the monetary approach literature

(Dornbusch (1973)). We begin with the following proposition.


Proposition 3.1: There exists a unique target stock of money balances,

Ht    ,    at which spending equals expected nominal income c&(Ht; p; G) =
and       planned    saving is zero, s(H; p; i'; G) = 0             .   (See Figure 2.)


Proof: We seek a fixed point to the transition equation


                     Hi = Ht         -
                                          c1(H; p; G) +   pu    .                              (20)


From Proposition 2.1, the rhs of (20) is a continuous, strictly increas-

ing function of H with slope less than unity. It follows that there is

exactly one H such                   that      (see Figure 3)


                          T
                     s(H      ; p; .i;    G) = 0   .                                           (21)

Furthermore, since saving is a strictly decreasing function of money bal-

ances, planned saving is strictly positive (negative) when H < (>)                         H
                                                                                          Q,E.D.


Corollary 3.2: Target money balances strictly exceed target expenditure:
     >    cz(H'r;   p;   G)



             In the economies studied in this paper, money serves both as a

medium of exchange and                   as   a buffer stock against future unanticipated pro-

ductivity disturbances. For this reason, risk averse households strive

to accumulate money balances which are more than sufficient to finance a

spending flow equal to expected nominal income. In the event of an unan-

ticipated, transitory decline in productivity, households are able to draw

down their inventories of cash balances in excess of target expenditure
                                                                                         13



to finance a less variable profile of consumption relative to productivity.

However, in equilibrium, self-insurance is not complete: expenditure is

strictly positively correlated with unanticiapted productivity shocks.

This is most easily seen by expressing expenditure at time t as a func-

tion of time t-l desired end-of-period money balances and the unantici-

pated productivity shock


         c$(H; p; G) =        cz(Hti +s(H          p; p; G)   +p(1 —n); p; G) .        (22)


The observation follows from the Proposition 2.1 result that expenditure is

a strictly increasing function of H and thus P(c..1 -
         We   now investigate the extent to which households attempt to close

the gap between actual and target money balances via planned saving. The

following proposition establishes that planned saving (in absolute value)

is strictly less than the difference between actual and target money

balances.


Proposition 3.3: Planned saving is strictly less (in absolute value) than

the gap between actual and target money balances. That is, for all
H H       (see Figure 4)


               o      s(H;p;ji;G)       1
                                                                                       (23)
                        Ht - H


Proof: H +     s(H;p;;G)          is strictly increasing in H with slope less than

unity. Thus, for H < Ht             ,   H1 = H +   s(H;p;p;G)   > H   and
  +   s(H1;p;i.i;G)    > H1   .
                                  Exactly   similar argument applies for H >      Ht
                                                                              Q.E.D.
                                                                                   14



            The derivation of a partial-adjustment accumulation policy from the

intertemporal optimization problem of a risk-averse agent who receives no

direct unity from asset stocks and who faces no cost of adjusting these

stocks is, to our knowledge, new.               Dornbusch and Mussa (1975) obtain an

optimal     partial-adjustment policy in a         deterministic, interteniporal maxi-

mization      framework in   which money balances yield positive utility and show

that saving is actually proportional to the gap between actual and target
money balances.       We again note that the individual         saving behavior derived
above is consistent with a general equilibrium in which aggregate saving
is zero in each period at the constant national price levels given by (16).

         These results place restrictions on the non linear stochastic dif-

ference equation (18) which characterizes the equilibrium time path of the

balance of payments in each country. These restrictions are now summarized

in the following propositions.


Proposition 3.4.1: The expected current-period balance of payments surplus

is of the same sign and of smaller absolute magnitude than last period's

payments surplus if, last period, there was no unanticipated productivity

shock   ,
                o<
                     E(st 1Ic =       i;   St = s)/st < 1   .                      (24)


Proposition 3.4.2: The expected current-period balance of payments surplus
is   of the opposite sign and of smaller absolute magnitude than last period's

payments surplus if, last period, the balance of payments was equal to the

innovation     in nominal income (planned savings was zero);

                —l < E(st+il      =    c; s =   p(_.i))/s < 0 .                    (25)
                                                                                     15




 Proposition 3.4.3: The expected current-period balance of payments surplus

 is   zero if, last   period,    there   was no   unanticipated productivity stock and

 the balance of payments was zero;


                           =    i;   St = 0) = 0   .
                                                                                    (26)


Proposition 3.4.4: The expected current-period balance of payments surplus

 is of Opposite sign and of smaller absolute magnitude than last period's

nominal   income innovation if,         last period, the balance of payments was zero;


              0 < E(s1k = c; s =                              < 1 .
                                 O)/p(P_c                                          (27)


         The intuition behind the non-Markovian behavior of the balance of

payments is now apparent. If last period's payments surplus was positive

because the household was attempting to replenish its money balances to

target, this period's surplus will, on average, be positive (but smaller)

since only a partial adjustment to target is planned in any given period.

If however, last period's surplus was             positive   due to an unanticipated in-

crease in exports, this period's payments surplus will, on average, be

negative as the household temporarily raises spending above expected

nominal income, attempting to draw down only gradually its excess cash

balances to target (c.f. Frenkel and Mussa (1984), p. 6). Thus, it is

necessary to know both               and s to determine the distribution of
                                                                                    s11
         Although   the conditional distribution of s1 depends upon the
realizations of          and s. ,        we   now show that the expected asymptotic
balance of payments surplus in each country is zero.
                                                                                             16




Proposition    3.5: The expected asymptotic balance of payments surplus is
zero in each country:

               urn E(StISt = s;                  =     =0                                   (28)




Proof: E(s+Is = s;                       =   = pE(m++i!mt)       -
                                                                     pE(m+!1nt)   where

for   any initial      distribution of real          balances including

Prob(m =    •/p    +   s/p)   = 1    .                                                    Q.E.D.


4. Concluding Remarks

         This paper has provided a choice theoretic account of the balance of

payments adjustment process in a stochastic, general equilibrium. Clearly,

the model abstracts from much which is relevant to the functioning of actual

fixed exchange rate regimes: capital mobility, the possibility of exchange

crises, the choice of a reserve currency to name just three. Yet, we would

argue that our approach provides a useful first step towards more refined

general equilibrium models which capture these and other features.

where a = H/p     .    Facing a constant price level, household consumption in
each period is constrained by real balances which evolve according to the

stochastic difference equation (3). Schechtman ((1976);                     )

and Foley and Hellwig ((1975; Proposition 1, p. 330) prove that there is a

unique value function


            v(rn) =      max {u(c) .4-fv(m-c+c)dv(c)}                      (4)
                        0<c<m


which solves (4). v inherits all the properties of u except that it is

not necessarily twice differentiable; it is strictly concave. It follows

that the optimal      consumption       policy is uniquely defined by


            u'(c) = 8fu'(m—c+c)dv(c)                  .                   (5)

Furthermore,    c(in) < m   ,       Viii > 0   (Foley and Hellwig (1975); Proposition
                                =

H and p .      The results in Section 3 on optimal partial adjustment savings

behavior are new since Foley and Hellwig consider a two state model in which

it is never optimal to hold.the existing stock of cash balances.
