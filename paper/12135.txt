Political Risk Versus Market Risk in Social Security

                                            ABSTRACT

Pay-as-you-go Social Security is typically characterized as a universal defined benefit pension
program. Implicit in this characterization is a sense that the participant’s investment in future
benefits is somehow guaranteed, or safe from risk. This study develops the concept of “political risk”
as the possibility that some future legislature will be forced to change the tax and benefit provisions
of pay-as-you-go social security programs, when there are changes in the demographic and
macroeconomic variables that support it. Thus there is a “political risk” to participants that might
be compared to the “market risk” in a personal accounts retirement scheme. In this paper, we carry
out a detailed quantitative analysis of political risk in the U.S. Social Security system, as well as an
overview of policy reforms in several European countries that demonstrate political risk more
broadly across social security systems. For the U.S., we compute the internal rates of return (IRRs)
from Social Security for various age groups and income levels, using the existing law in effect each
year since 1939. We find considerable variation in IRRs through time for any birth cohort.
Participants experienced significant declines in IRRs as a result of adjustments made to restore the
system’s solvency in 1983 and 1994. If the system were brought into actuarial balance in 2005,
younger cohorts would experience another significant decline in their lifetime IRR. Our review of
other countries demonstrates political risk in other social security systems as well. Law changes
necessitated by actuarial imbalances pass demographic risk on to participants. The debate over
personal accounts, therefore, is not one of “safe” versus “risky” benefits, but one of portfolio choice.

    I.      Introduction
         Pay-as-you-go Social Security is typically characterized as a universal defined
benefit (DB) pension. With this characterization, the debate surrounding the creation of
personal accounts then becomes a choice between a safe DB plan and a risky defined
contribution (DC) one. While no one can argue against the fact that stock and bond
returns are risky, the long-run rate of return from traditional Social Security depends on
the future course of fertility rates, immigration rates, mortality rates and the growth rate
of real wages. There is considerable uncertainty about all four of these variables and
hence traditional Social Security cannot be considered a safe asset. The three
demographic variables, for instance, produced a number of surprises in the last half of the
twentieth century (the baby boom, the baby bust, the uneven pace of mortality
improvement, etc.). Shifts in demographics and macroeconomic variables render
traditional Social Security vulnerable to political risk because legislated changes in taxes
and benefits are required to restore actuarial balance. Such adjustments undermine the
“safe” benefits promised by traditional Social Security.
         We will argue that the characterization of traditional Social Security as a defined
benefit retirement program is inappropriate. An essential element of defined benefit
pension programs is that the participants do not bear the funding risk. That is, if the fund
becomes underfunded (due to poor returns or a deviation between what actually happens
and the actuarial assumptions), the funding inadequacy is not borne by the participants,
but by the employer or an insurance entity. The risks are transferred from the participants
to others, leaving the workers with a safe benefit. Of course, this is a characterization of
DB plans; reality is somewhat different. DB benefits remain risky because they are not
indexed for inflation and because the risk transfer is incomplete. The point here is that
the funding risk (or at least most of the funding risk) is not borne by participants.
         Social Security doesn’t even approximate a DB plan. The funding risk is borne
by participants. It isn’t transferred to anyone else. In fact, since it is a nearly universal
plan, it is impossible to think of who could insure the benefits for the participants. What
we are calling political risk in this paper could be thought of as funding risk. The
fundamental risks of Social Security are not being generated by politicians; they are




                                                                                                1
being generated by the demographic and economic factors affecting funding. The
politicians are simply an intermediary in the transmission of underlying risks.
        There exist several studies that have attempted to study and quantify various
aspects of political risk. Harris, Meyerson, and Smith (2001) and CBO (2001) study the
impact of demographic and wage-growth risk on the trust fund balances. Harris,
Myerson, and Smith also do a comparative analysis of the risks of traditional Social
Security and systems in which part or all of the trust fund assets are invested in private
securities. How the variability in the system’s finances translates into risk for individual
participants is a more difficult question. In our earlier work on this topic (Nataraj and
Shoven 2003), we assumed that the Social Security system is run on a purely PAYGO
basis, in which the payroll tax rate is fixed and all its proceeds are distributed in a lump-
sum fashion to the current elderly. Within this framework, we ask whether individuals
are better off with a pure PAYGO Social Security system (which is subject to political or
funding risk because benefits are adjusted to reflect revenue), a pure defined contribution
funded plan (which is subject to financial risk), or some combination of the two.
Elementary portfolio theory suggests that “some of each” is the right answer. Indeed, this
is what we conclude: even very risk-averse participants desire a system with an
individual accounts component.
       In reality, however, the Social Security system is not a pure PAYGO system.
Both benefits and taxes are legislated for the indefinite future, with any excess revenue
going into a trust fund. We have argued (Nataraj and Shoven 2003) that the presence of a
trust fund cannot serve as an effective smoothing device for individual returns – that is,
the full impact of demographic and wage-growth risk must ultimately be borne by the
system’s participants. A persistent trust fund deficit will force policymakers to raise
taxes or cut benefits. The U.S. has already effectively cut promised benefits several
times (e.g., by raising the normal retirement age and making part of benefits taxable) and
similar adjustments have been necessary in many countries (e.g., Germany has increased
the retirement age). However, in order to understand the nature of political risk, it is
important to investigate how governments respond to a divergence between assets and
liabilities, and how this response passes demographic risk on to the system’s participants.




                                                                                                2
       Existing studies that attempt to quantify individual-level political risk include
McHale (2001), Blake and Turner (2003), and Schnabel (1998). These papers examine
the impact of particular law changes on measures of participants’ lifetime benefits.
McHale shows that recent reforms undertaken by the U.S. and various European
countries significantly reduced the social security wealth (defined as the present value of
promised social security benefits) for a representative 45-year-old worker. On the other
hand, since reforms were phased in, workers who were at retirement age at the time of the
reform were not affected much. Blake and Turner examine the impact of recent law
changes in the U.K. and the U.S. on the internal rates of return promised to 25-year-old
workers. The Schnabel paper is most like this one. Schnabel calculates internal rates of
return for different cohorts of participants in the German Social Security system. He
finds that returns decline for younger cohorts. Real rates of return for those born in 1980
range from zero to one percent, depending on assumptions. He finds that roughly 80
percent of contributions are implicit tax rates for this cohort. He asserts that this is
leading to compliance problems that threaten the stability of the German system.
       In this paper, we carry out a detailed analysis of political risk in the U.S., and an
overview of recent law changes across several European countries. For the U.S., we
compute internal rates of return (IRRs) for various age groups under existing law in each
year since 1939. We find a considerable amount of variation in IRRs through time for a
given birth cohort, a finding that is inconsistent with the characterization of Social
Security as safe. Participants experienced significant declines in their IRRs as a result of
adjustments made to restore the system’s solvency in 1983 and 1994. We also find that,
if the system was brought into actuarial balance in 2005 (by raising the payroll tax),
younger cohorts would experience a decline in their lifetime IRR of approximately 80
basis points (0.8 percent).   We also confirm McHale’s finding that, historically, those at
or near retirement age bear less political risk than younger workers. It is not true,
however, that retirees and those near retirement have always been exempt from benefit
cuts. In particular, increasing the income taxation of benefits is equivalent to reducing
benefits. Those steps, taken in the 1980s and 1990s in the U.S., applied to current and
future beneficiaries alike. Our study of recent law changes in European countries reveals
that workers there also bear considerable demographic risk. Germany, France, Sweden,



                                                                                               3
and Italy have all made fairly large benefit cuts in recent years and are faced with the
prospect of making more. Given the evidence of what has happened in the U.S. and in
Europe, it is impossible to continue the notion that traditional Social Security is a defined
benefit program with safe benefits.
         Our analysis suggests that political risk is inevitable in traditional Social Security.
When a private employer runs a DB pension plan, both demographic and financial risk
are borne by the firm’s shareholders. Since shareholders must make up any funding
shortfall in the system, workers can reasonably expect their benefits to be safe. In a
universal retirement system like Social Security, however, there is nobody outside the
system to bear the funding risk. Any funding shortfall must be paid by raising payroll
taxes or cutting benefits. Alternatively, the costs can be passed on to taxpayers; however,
taxpayers and Social Security participants are essentially the same group. Thus,
demographic and economic risk makes it impossible to design a universal DB system.
This fact is gradually being recognized in the design of pension systems. The best
example of this is Germany’s most recent reform, which explicitly links benefits to the
dependency ratio through the use of a “sustainability factor.” This means that
participants not only bear the funding risk in the long run, but also that this risk is
automatically transferred to them via the sustainability factor.
         This paper is organized as follows. Section II presents our detailed analysis of
law changes and their impact on returns for U.S. Social Security. Section III describes
recent law changes in Germany, France, Sweden, and Italy. Section IV concludes.
   II.      Political Risk in the United States
         It is well known that internal rates of return (IRRs) in the U.S. Social Security
system vary considerably by cohort; in particular, the earliest cohorts to retire under the
system received significantly larger returns than more recent ones. A less emphasized
fact is that each individual cohort experiences variation over its lifetime in the IRR
promised by the law. Law changes often occur in response to accumulated demographic
changes and therefore can be viewed as a reflection of demographic risk in the system.
We define political risk as variation in IRR promised to Social Security participants
under the law. Another possible measure of political risk is variation in replacement rates




                                                                                               4
(e.g., McHale 2001). However, we feel that IRR is a more appropriate measure because
it also considers tax changes, which may be quite significant for young workers.
           We consider all law changes to the Social Security retirement program from 1939
to the present. Towards the beginning of this period, most of the law changes worked to
expand the system: a series of tax and benefit increases occurred between 1939 and 1972.
There was a number of ad hoc benefit increases intended to compensate participants for
inflation. The form of these benefit increases was often a reduction in the number of
years used in the computation of average monthly earnings. In 1973, benefits were
explicitly indexed to inflation, albeit in a flawed manner. In 1978, wage indexation was
introduced in the computation of average monthly earnings. In response to demographic
changes that shifted Social Security’s actuarial balance, tax increases were necessary in
1977 and benefit cuts (in the form of subjecting benefits to income taxation) and further
tax increases were introduced in 1983 (the Greenspan Commission reforms). A greater
proportion of benefits became taxable in 1994. All of these recent reforms clearly reflect
demographic risk being passed on to workers. The 2005 Social Security Trustees Report
estimates that an immediate 3.5 percentage point increase1 in the payroll tax is required to
bring the system into balance over the infinite horizon. Again, this represents
demographic risk that must be borne by the system’s participants.
           We study how these legislative changes have altered real IRRs for participants.
For our base case, we consider single males from various birth-year cohorts from 1900
through 1985. We assume each individual is born on January 1 of the relevant year,
starts working at age 20, retires at the normal retirement age, and lives until age 80. The
fixed lifespan is a simplification. The rate of return variation due to individual mortality
experience is not our central concern. We are more concerned about the impact of tax
and benefit law changes and changes in the expected rate of growth of real wages. A
more complete analysis would factor in the impact of changing mortality.
           We consider three types of wage earners – average, high (90th percentile), and low
(10th percentile). In order to simulate wage histories, we use Outgoing Rotation Groups
from the 2001 and 2002 Current Population Survey to compute the wage for each of the
three income levels for each age group. We then divide this by the wage for the

    This 3.5 percent number is for the intermediate set of economic and demographic assumptions.


                                                                                                   5
corresponding income level across workers of all ages. These ratios are shown in Figure
1 for male, female, and all workers with average earnings; we use the male ratios in our
simulations. We take the wage for the relevant income level in each year of the worker’s
life and use the age-wage ratio to arrive at a wage for the worker. For example, consider
an average male 30-year-old in 1950. The national average annual wage in 1950 was
$2,763. According to our computations, a 30-year-old male earns 1.13 times the national
average. Therefore, our imputed wage for him in 1950 is ($2,763)(1.13) = $3,122.
       In computing the IRR for workers under a particular piece of legislation, we make
several assumptions. In our base case (“rational expectations”), workers assume that
future inflation (measured by the CPI) and aggregate wage growth will be equal to the
geometric average of the past 5 years. After 1978, wage growth expectations are
especially important because they are used to calculate expectations regarding the
earnings cap, bend points, and indexing of past wages. After 2005, inflation and wage
growth are assumed to be 2.8 and 3.9 percent respectively, as per the Social Security
Administration’s intermediate scenario in the 2005 Trustees Report. There is, however,
no uncertainty about the path of the individual’s wages; this allows us to isolate the
impact of aggregate demographic risk, as opposed to individual-level earning risk. Prior
to 1972, benefits were not explicitly indexed to inflation. It is reasonable that workers
might expect adjustments to occur in the event of inflation. However, this was not
written into the law. In the base case, our computation of IRRs in this pre-1972 period
embodies the naïve expectation that no further changes will be made to the law to
compensate for inflation or otherwise.
       The 1983 and 1993 law changes reduced benefits by subjecting them to income
taxation. In 1983, up to 50 percent of an individual’s benefit was subject to taxation; this
proportion was raised to 85 percent in 1993 (taking effect in 1994). However, benefits
are only taxable for retirees with income above a certain level. We assume that our
average and 90th percentile earners have sufficient retirement income to trigger income
taxation, while our 10th percentile earner does not. The income tax rates are assumed to
be 20 and 30 percent for average and 90th percentile earners respectively.
       Since current Social Security is unsustainable, participants will certainly face
benefit cuts or tax increases in the future (although the specifics have yet to be



                                                                                            6
determined). Of course, from the perspective of a young worker, it makes little
difference whether the payroll tax is raised or benefits are cut – both changes should have
a similar impact on the IRR. We feel that it is important to include some measure of this
risk in our analysis. This is risk that the politicians have yet to transfer to Social Security
participants. We assume that in 2005, the payroll tax is increased by 3.5 percentage
points, enough to bring the system into actuarial balance over the infinite horizon.
       Our base case results are shown in Figures 2, 3, and 4 (for average, 90th
percentile, and 10th percentile earnings respectively). As is well known, earlier cohorts
received significantly higher IRRs than more recent ones. Moreover, higher income
individuals receive lower IRRs. The variation in the promised IRR over a cohort’s
lifetime is significant, and this degree of variation does not appear to be related to
income; that is, while the system is progressive, low-income individuals do not appear to
be particularly insulated from political demographic risk. Fluctuation in IRRs occurs for
two reasons: law changes and changing expectations of future inflation and wage growth.
The magnitude of the fluctuations is considerable. For instance the IRR for the 1975
cohort average earning single male (from Figure 3) was -0.95 percent in 1993; it rose to
+2.04 percent by 2000 and fell to -0.39 percent by 2004. Workers’ expectations were
updated to reflect strong real wage growth in the late 1990s, resulting in higher IRRs
through wage indexation. On the other hand, the impacts of the law changes are clearly
seen in 1983 and 1994. The IRRs for the average and high earners fall significantly as
their benefits become subject to taxation. Even the 10th percentile earner is hurt by the
1983 reform due to increases in the retirement age.
       The link between IRRs and wage growth raise an important point. The main
source of income to most Social Security participants is their human capital, or labor
income, which is highly susceptible to aggregate wage growth risk. Traditional Social
Security forces its participants to take on even more of this risk by tying their return on
their Social Security wealth to wage growth. This is undesirable from a portfolio choice
perspective. In our previous work (Nataraj and Shoven 2003), we have argued that
portfolio diversification makes a two-tier system, which combines demographic and
financial risk, preferable to traditional Social Security. Even if Social Security wealth is
modeled as the present value of future benefits, it is not tied to the returns on capital.



                                                                                               7
       An alternative to our rational expectations assumption is that workers perfectly
foresee all future inflation and wage growth. In this “perfect foresight” scenario, the only
source of risk is law changes; macroeconomic variables are predicted with perfect
accuracy. We feel that this assumption is less realistic, as Social Security does expose
participants to risk from changing inflation and wage growth. However, the perfect
foresight computation is useful as a sensitivity analysis and to isolate demographic risk
that is passed on through law changes. The perfect foresight results are shown in Figures
5, 6, and 7 for average, high, and low earners respectively.
       Note that the changes in IRRs are more discrete than in the base case. With
perfect foresight, expectations do not get updated on an annual basis; therefore, the
promised IRR changes only when the law does. Again, it is clear that earlier cohorts
were promised higher returns at any stage in their lives, and that low earners receive
higher returns. Moreover, the results also make it clear that low earners were relatively
insulated from the most recent cuts in benefits (1983 and 1993). This makes sense as the
cuts took the form of (progressive) income taxation of benefits for high earners only.
       Our broad conclusions from the base case still stand. Social Security participants
face a significant amount of variation in the returns they get as a result of law changes.
Law changes – necessitated by actuarial imbalances – pass demographic risk on to
participants. This risk can be considerable, which casts doubt on the characterization of
traditional Social Security as safe. One might wonder how political risk compares with
the financial risk that participants would face with a system of individual accounts. In
our previous work (Nataraj and Shoven 2003), we showed that a 60-40 stock-bond
portfolio provides a mean lifetime IRR of 6.2 percent with a standard deviation of 2.03
percent. In contrast, a pure pay-as-you-go system (in which benefits are updated every
year to reflect demographic changes) generates a mean lifetime IRR of 1.02 with a
standard deviation of 0.55 percent. The risk and returns calculated in this paper are
similar. Between 1977 and 2004, the average IRR for an average earning single male in
the 1960 birth cohort was 0.525 percent, while the standard deviation of the time series of
IRRs was 0.8 percent. There can be no doubt that the deal offered by Social Security has
changed over the years. The debate over personal accounts, therefore, is not one of
“safe” versus “risky” benefits, but one of portfolio choice.



                                                                                             8
   III.      Political Risk in Europe
          In Europe as well, many law changes have taken place – and more are still
required – in order to deal with changing demographics. In this section, we describe
recent reforms in Germany, Italy, France, and Sweden. A detailed list of the legislative
changes can be found in Tables 1-4.
Germany
          Germany’s demographic problem is significantly more severe than that of the
U.S. As discussed by Börsch-Supan and Wilke (2004), Germany has experienced a faster
increase in life expectancy and a more dramatic “baby bust.” As a result, more than 25
percent of the German population in 2030 will be over the age of 65; the dependency
ratio is projected to be 43.3 percent. At the end of the 1980s, policy makers realized that
the existing replacement rate of 70 percent could only be maintained by raising the
payroll tax from 19.5 to 40 percent by 2035.
          These demographic shifts have resulted in a number of reforms to the public
pension system (see Table 1). The first set of reforms was passed in 1989 and took effect
in 1992. The main change was to index benefits to net, rather than gross, wages. The
legislation also increased the normal retirement age and introduced benefit reductions for
early retirement and benefit increases for late retirement, although these adjustments were
less than actuarially fair. A second set of reforms was enacted in 1997 and scheduled to
take effect in 1999. These reforms were supposed to introduce a “demographic factor”
into the computation of benefits in order to index them to life expectancy. However, this
reform was revoked in 1998 before it took effect. Only one part of the 1997 legislation –
a gradual increase in retirement ages – was actually implemented as scheduled. A third
major reform was passed in 2001 and took effect in 2002. This legislation curtailed
increases in the payroll tax, constraining it to stay below 20 percent until 2020 and 22
percent until 2030. The replacement rate was lowered from 70 to 67 percent (of net
wages). In addition, a second funded tier was established; workers were given the option
of investing 4 percent of their gross earnings into this system. The definition of net
earnings was adjusted to reflect this 4 percent contribution, making the effective fall in
the replacement rate more than the stated 3 percentage points. Using the old definition of
net earnings, the new replacement rate is 63.5 percent. The most recent set of reforms



                                                                                             9
was passed in 2004. The main change was to index pensions to the dependency ratio by
including a “sustainability factor” in benefit computations to reflect shortfalls in funding.
       These reforms have made it clear how vulnerable the German system is to
demographic and funding risk. Indeed, the “sustainability factor” introduced last year is
an explicit recognition of this vulnerability. German workers have begun to appreciate
this risk as well: in recent years, there has been an increasing awareness that traditional
pension benefits are not, in fact, safe. As Börsch-Supan and Wilke (2004) explain:
       In the past, stability of [the benefit] formula has created a sense of
       actuarial fairness, so that workers perceived the contributions largely as
       insurance premia. However, this has changed when the formula was
       altered several times since 1992 … Surveys show that by 2001,
       contributions were largely perceived as taxes (p. 15).

Fehr and Habermann (2004) compute the impact of the “sustainability factor” reform on
future replacement and contribution rates. They find that the reform increases the
variability of the replacement rate (by tying it explicitly to the dependency ratio) and
reduces the variability of the contribution rate (as it will no longer have to vary as much
to meet the replacement rate target).
France
       In France, a study in the early 1990s showed that the contribution rate for the
PAYGO system (then 17 percent for the private sector) would need to rise by 50 to 100
percent by 2040 to sustain the average replacement rate of 80 percent of net wages
(Blanchet and Legros 2002). The first major reform occurred in 1993 (see Table 2). The
main provisions of this reform were to index pensions to prices rather than wages; to
increase in the number of years used in the computation of average wages; and to
increase the career length required to receive full benefit. Each of these measures
constitutes benefit reductions. According to Blanchet and Legros (2002), the first two
provisions substantially lowered the cost of the program, while the impact of the third
was minimal. They further state that after the reform, the contribution rate would still
need to rise by 70 percent by 2040.
       Additional reforms took place in 2003 and included increases in the required
career length for full benefits; bonuses for working beyond the age of 60 or the required
minimum career length; and an increase in the minimum pension for low-wage workers.



                                                                                              10
The main effect of the reform was to increase retirement ages (Benallah et. al. 2005). As
the system continues to face a substantial long-run actuarial deficit, further tax and
benefit adjustments appear inevitable.
Sweden
        Sweden’s traditional PAYGO system faced severe demographic pressures,
particularly from low birth rates and rapidly improving life expectancies. The roughly
18.5 percent payroll tax rate was projected to rise to as high as 36 percent by 2025 in
order to maintain the old benefit structure (Normann and Mitchell 2000). The Swedish
parliament agreed to sweeping reforms in 1994 and passed the implementation legislation
in 1998. The new system completely replaces the traditional system of formula-based
benefits with a two-pillar system consisting of a PAYGO notional defined contribution
component (with a 16 percent contribution rate), and a fully funded individual account
system (with a 2.5 percent contribution rate). The notional DC individual accounts still
operate on a PAYGO basis, with the “account balance” being credited with “earnings”
tied to the growth in per capita wages. Participants can choose from a variety of pension
funds for their 2.5 percent funded individual account.
        The effect of switching to a combination of defined contribution accounts
(notional and funded) means that the system is automatically adjusted to changes in life
expectancy (through the annuitization of the accounts at retirement), that longer careers
and later retirement are rewarded, and that fluctuations in the rate of growth of real wages
are borne by participants through the crediting of their notional accounts. The notional
accounts, thus, reflect risk in the growth of real wages while the funded accounts are
subject of capital market returns. Rather than face the prospect of 36 percent tax rates,
the total contribution rates are now scheduled to remain fixed at 18.5 percent.
Interestingly, Sweden’s system of employer provided pensions has largely converted
from DB to DC plans in tandem with the reform.
Italy
        Italy’s pension faces financial problems because of its low fertility rate (1.2 births
per woman of childbearing age) and the resulting increase in the dependency ratio, which
is expected to reach 48 percent by 2030 (Franco 2002). Reforms were undertaken in
1992 (see table 3) and included an increase in the retirement age; an increase in the



                                                                                            11
number of years of earnings used in the benefit computation; a shift from wage to price
indexation of benefits; and an increase in the required career length for receiving a
pension. These reforms collectively reduced the liabilities of the system (and therefore
the retirement wealth of its participants) by 25 percent. Reforms passed in 1996 included
the introduction of a defined contribution component, the indexation of benefits to life
expectancy, and the abolition of a guaranteed minimum pension level.
         The reforms undertaken thus far are still inadequate to restore balance to the
system. Two current proposals are to allow policymakers to revise the benefit formula
more frequently, and to add additional demographic factors to the benefit formula. Both
of these proposals reflect recognition of demographic risk, which is inevitable in a
traditional Social Security system. While not as explicit as Germany’s “sustainability
factor”, Italy’s proposed reforms make an implicit commitment to revise benefit formulas
in the case of funding shortfalls.
   IV.      Conclusion
         The main point of the paper is that traditional PAYGO Social Security such as the
systems in U.S. and Europe are not comparable to private sector defined benefit
retirement plans. There is no third party insuring the benefits of the participants in these
plans. Workers are never vested in their benefits. The benefit formulas and the
contribution rates can, have been, and will be changed as necessary for financial
sustainability. The result is that traditional Social Security programs offer risky returns to
their participants, with most of that risk stemming from demographic and productivity
(real wage) factors. Once the riskiness of traditional Social Security is recognized, then
the discussion of funded individual accounts should become one of asset diversification.
         We have shown the fluctuations in the rate of return offered by U.S. Social
Security have been considerable due to periodic law changes and changes in the growth
of real wages. We have also reviewed the relatively fast pace of change in European
systems. The two most dramatic examples of change (and risk borne by participants) are
in Germany, where a sustainability factor has been added to the benefit formula (and
where payroll tax rates have been capped), and in Sweden, where the entire defined
benefit system has been replaced with a two-tier defined contribution plan.
