   THE EXIT-VOICE TRADEOFF IN THE LABOR
  MARKET: UNIONISM, JOB TENURE, QUITS, AND
                              SEPARATIONS*
                             RICHARD B. FREEMAN

      This paper examines the effect of trade unionism on the exit behavior of workers
in the context of Hirschman's exit-voice dichotomy. Unionism is expected to reduce
quits and permanent separations and raise job tenure by providing a "voice" alternative
to exit when workers are dissatisfied with conditions. Empirical evidence supports this
contention, showing significantly lower exit for unionists in several large data tapes.
It is argued that the grievance system plays a major role in the reduction in exit and
that the reduction lowers cost and raises productivity.


      In the exit-voice model of the social system [Hirschman, 1970,
1976] individuals react to discrepancies between desired and actual
social phenomena in one of two ways: by the traditional free market
mechanism of "exiting" from undesirable situations; or by directly
expressing their discomfort to decision-makers through "voice." While
little attention is paid to the labor market in Hirschman's book [1970],
the exit-voice dichotomy provides a potentially fruitful framework
for analyzing the major employee institution of capitalist econo-
mies—the trade union. From the perspective of the dichotomy, voice
is embodied in unionism and the collective bargaining system by
which workers elect union leaders to represent them in negotiations
with management, while exit consists primarily of quits. A major
feature of the model is a predicted tradeoff between the two adjust-
ment mechanisms: when workers have a voice institution for ex-
pressing discontent, they should use the exit option less frequently
and thus exhibit lower quit rates and longer spells of job tenure with
firms.
    Is unionism associated with lower quit rates and higher job tenure
of workers, as predicted by the model? Po what extent can any re-
duction in quits due to unionism he attributed to union "voice" as
opposed to other routes of union effects, notably wage gains?
     Despite a sizeable literature on labor turnover and on the eco-
nomic effects of unions, extant empirical evidence provides no clear
answer to these questions. The turnover literature has focused on quit
rates for aggregated manufacturing industries, which provides only

weak evidence on the behavior of individuals; has not treated job
tenure or permanent separations as dependent variables; and has only
rarely sought to estimate the effect of unionism (see Parsons [1972]
for a useful summary). As a result, the impact of unionism on turnover
has been at best estimated imprecisely, differing with sample and
control variables (Burton and Parker [1969]; Stoikov and Raimon
[1958]; Pencavel [1970]; Parsons [1977]; and Kahn [1977]). The union
literature has dealt almost exclusively with union wage effects.
Summarizing the state of knowledge in his textbook, Reynolds con-
cluded that "it is questionable whether collective bargaining has
produced a major change in the pattern of labor turnover" [1974, p.
568].
     To provide a better test of the relation between unionism and
exit behavior, this study analyzes data on individuals from three
surveys—the National Longitudinal Survey (NLS), the Michigan
Panel Survey of Income Dynamics (PSID), and the Current Popu-
lation Survey (CPS)—which contain detailed information on the
personal attributes of workers and characteristics of jobs that is better
suited for analysis of individual behavior than industry aggregates.
Longitudinal data in the NLS and PSID and retrospective data on
the CPS allow for the analysis of the effects of union status and other
variables on actual quits or separations over time, while survey
questions relating to job tenure provide information on past exit be-
havior. By examining several bodies of information, each of which has
certain weaknesses and strengths, I hope to obtain a better fix on the
hypothesized behavioral relation from that given in previous
studies.
     The principal finding of the paper is that, with wages and other
measures of pecuniary rewards held fixed, trade unionism is asso-
ciated with significant, large reductions in exit behavior. Diverse
calculations designed to adjust the union effect for potential omitted
variable biases relating to union monopoly power or selectivity do not
eliminate the union effect. While interpretation of the impact of
unionism in terms of "voice" is open to some question, the empirical
analysis provides support for the hypothesis that trade unions alter
work place relations and worker behavior in ways not captured by
standard monopoly wage models of the institution. Some evidence
is presented that the observed reduction in exit is at least in part at-
tributable to the operation of unions as a voice institution in the job
market, though the fact that all collective bargaining involves voice
in negotiations and in day-to-day work activities makes any definitive
separation from the other components of unionism exceedingly
difficult.

     The paper is divided into five sections. The first sets out the
reasons for expecting unionism to reduce exit. The second develops
the methodology for the empirical analysis. Sections III and IV
present the empirical results, with the former focusing on the effect
of unionism on exit, and the latter probing the voice interpretation.
The paper concludes with a brief evaluation of the economic conse-
quences of the union-induced increase in the attachment of workers
to firms.

                   I. UNIONISM AND EXIT BEHAVIOR
     Trade unionism can be expected to reduce exit behavior through
"monopoly routes" of impact and through "voice routes" of
impact.
      In the context of the standard monopoly model of unions, exit
is likely to be lowered by union-induced improvements in wages,
 fringes, and work conditions. Since the union wage effect is nonne-
 gligible and high wages are likely to reduce quits significantly, the
 "monopoly wage" route of impact may be quite potent, and must be
controlled in empirical analyses seeking to isolate the voice channels
of concern. The major empirical problem in this study is to hold fixed
monopoly wage effects of unionism, some of which may be unob-
served, so as not to produce biased estimates of the union voice-exit
tradeoff.
     There are several ways in which the operation of unions as an
institution of worker "voice" is likely to reduce exit behavior, pro-
ducing the exit-voice tradeoff that is central to the model.
     First, unionism creates distinctive mechanisms for treating in-
dustrial relations problems that offer a substitute for classical exit
behavior. Perhaps the most important such institution is the grieL'-
ance and arbitration .system, which offers dissatisfied workers who
 are considering quitting an alternative means of expressing discontent
 and possibly changing work conditions. Ninety-nine percent of major
 U. S. collective bargaining contracts provide for grievance procedures
 and 95 percent for arbitration [U. S. department of Labor, 1977, p.
 94], making grievance and arbitration virtually synonymous with
 trade unionism. By contrast, only 30 percent of nonunion firms in the
 Bureau of National Affairs Personnel Policies Forum have formal
 grievance procedures, and only 11 percent allow outside arbitration
 to settle grievances not resolvable at lower levels [Bureau of National

      1. For a detailed discussion of unions as a voice institution, see Freeman 119761
 and Freeman and Medoff, lorthcoming.
  646                QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS

 Affairs, 1968, p. 21. The potential impact of a grievance system is clear:
 workers who feel themselves unfairly treated or who believe their
 supervisors erred in interpreting work rules will seek a solution
 through the grievance procedure before invoking the more drastic exit
 remedy. If the grievance is successful, the incentive to quit will be
 removed. Even if it is not and the aggrieved ultimately leaves, the
 overall rate of exit will be reduced as a result of the delay in the quit
 decision during the grievance procedure.2
      The regular process of collective negotiation of labor contracts
 can also be expected to reduce exit behavior. Workers wanting new
 conditions who, in the absence of a bargaining alternative, might have
 quit will instead seek first to obtain the particular changes through
 bargaining. If some of the worker demands are met, quits are likely
to be lower than would otherwise be the case. For work conditions and
rules that are "public" to the enterprise, where standard publicgoods
arguments suggest that enterprises would have great difficulty in
eliciting true worker preferences, considerable mobility might be
needed in the absence of unionism for these conditions and rules to
be provided. Unions might obtain and aggregate preferences in such
a manner as to produce the desired arrangements more efficiently,
and with lower mobility in the market.
     Union "voice" may also reduce exit by creating particular work
rules and conditions of employment (which may or may not be costly
to employers, once unionism is "in place") that are desired byworkers,
particularly what industrial relations experts call the industrial ju-
ris prudence system. Under this system managerial authority is di-
luted by requiring that many work place decisions be made on the
basis of negotiated rules, for instance seniority, as opposed to su-
pervisory judgment (or whim). By straightforward application of
compensating differential arguments, if workers desire these condi-
tions and if they are provided largely by unions, then with pay and
other pecuniary benefits held fixed, separation rates should be lower
for union workers.
Voice in the Absence of Unions
    If "voice" institutions such as grievance/arbitration and indi-
vidual jurisprudence are desirable work conditions that reduce
      2. There are two conditions for the delay effect to operate. First, there must be
some nonzero probability ofredressing the grievance, so that the worker is willing to
try the option. Second, the length of employment must be finite, for otherwise delays
will not affect the steady-state solution. If, on average, the length of employment were
initially, say ten years, then a delay in quitting for, say one half year, would reduce the
quit rate from 0.10 to about 0.095, a nonnegligible though by no means large effect.

Lirnover, the question naturally arises as to why nonunion enterprises
o not generally adopt them as part of a profit-maximizing
trategy.
     One reason for the general absence of voice or industrial juris-
 rudence practices in the nonunion sector is that the essence of voice
  to reduce managerial power and create a dual authority channel
'ithin the firm. Such a change in power relations would be difficult
o attain in the absence of a genuine independent union or union-like
 rganization. During the 1920s many firms experimented with so-
ailed "employee representation" plans designed to provide a nonu-
tion voice mechanism for workers (see National Industrial Conference
oard [1933]). Many of these plans ended in failure, despite the best
ntentions, as workers are unwilling to express their desires for fear
f retaliation by management and because of their own lack of power
o affect decisions. Other plans led to the formation of company
inions, which, in several industries, became the building blocks of
ndependent unionism in the 1930s [Galenson, 1963]. Under current
aw, of course, company unions are illegal. The dilemma is that if
nanagement gives up power, it creates seeds of genuine unions; if it
loes not, employee representation plans face severe difficulties. This
s not to say that no nonunion firm will have a grievance/arbitration
;ystem, for some have such systems, in part to reduce worker desire
r uflionS. The point is that it is more difficult (costly) to institute
tn effective system in the absence of unions or union-type
)rganizations.
     A second more subtle reason for the concentration of voice in-
;titutions in the organized sector relates to the nature of price signals
n unorganized and organized markets. In the unorganized market,
Lhe desire of workers for a given condition of work is conveyed by the
[Tiarginal evaluation of the condition by the marginal worker, as re-
ilected in the reduction in wage he would take to obtain the condition.
In the union market, the desire for the condition is conveyed by some
average of preferences of workers: in a median voter model, by the
(marginal) desire of the median worker; in a "consumer (worker)
surplus"-maximizing model, by the average intensity of preferences
for the condition. Assuming that "inframarginal" workers have greater
desire for voice and industrial jurisprudence or that such systems
generate worker surplus or both, there will be a more intense demand
for the condition under trade unionism. Given fixed costs to setting

reported that the system was instituted in part to reduce worker desires for unionism

up voice institutions, the profit calculus might reject their develop-
ment, while a benefit-cost calculation using the benefits to the median
worker or taking account of consumer surplus would favor their
development.4

                          II. EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS
     Exit behavior is measured in this study by three variables: by job
tenure, defined as the number of years a worker remains with a firm;
by quits in a specified period; and by total separations in a period.
Each of these variables has certain strengths and weaknesses for
analysis of the exit-voice tradeoff. Tenure has the advantage of re-
flecting longer run and more permanent behavior than quits or sep-
arations because it relates to attachment between workers and firms
over an extended period of time. The main disadvantage is the absence
of data on characteristics of the job years earlier. Quits are useful
because they measure worker behavior, which is at the core of the
union voice model, but face the problem that the distinction between
worker and employer-initiated changes is at least partially arbitrary
(an employer may harass a worker to quit; a worker may quit because
of potential plant closings or may perform poorly until fired). Sepa-
rations do not have this problem but include such forms of mobility
as those due to plant closings, which are not directly relevant to the
model. By examining each measure, we are able to obtain a firmer set
of conclusions than would otherwise be the case.
     The decision to exit is analyzed in the framework of a probability
model in which each person has a specific propensity to exit in a given
year Q, dependent on a set of explanatory factors X, including
unionism. Because exit is a dichotomous variable and probabilities
are bounded by 0 and 1, the logistic provides an appropriate functional
form for the relation:
                                              1
(1) Q = (1 + exp — (BX1)])                         with 4- = B1Q(1              —
                                                                                    Q).

Tenure is treated as a backward waiting time variable dependent on
Q. When Q is fixed, the probability that tenure in year n, T,, is a

      4. This argument can he put more formally. Let L( W,C) l)e the supply curve facint
the firm, where C = desired condition of work, and Lw, Lc > 0. Then the "supply price"
for the condition, defined as the wage that is needed to maintain a given work force
L at various levels of C can be written as W(L,C), where Wc <0. The marginal evalu-
ation of the condition is Wc(L,C); the median worker evaluation is Wç(Lm,('). where
L,,, is the median. The average of worker marginal evaluations is [j W(-(X,C)dX/L]/L.
If, as assumed in the text, WCL <0, then W('(L,C) < W(L,('). and J
< W((L,() so that whether the union represents the median worker or the average
desire of workers, it will place a greater weight on the condition than the competitive
signal. See Viscusi [197SJ for elaboration of models of this type.
       THE EXIT-VOICE TRADEOFF IN THE LABOR MARKET                 649

specified value t can be written as
                     PR(T = t) = (1 — Q)tQ,
which is a geometric distribution. Since T reflects behavior over t
+ 1 periods of time, while changes in one time interval reflect behavior
over only one period, T conveys greater information about exit
propensities than dichotomous quit or separation measures.
    The mean of the completed tenure (T) distribution has a well-
known relation to Q, which can be fruitfully used in analysis:

                  E(T) =   (1      = exp
                                           (   B1X).
If Q depended on the X's as in (1) and was independent of past tenure,
the appropriate function form for T would be the exponential, T =
exp(BX) + U, where U is a random error. With a fixed Q, re-
newal theory guarantees that the mean of the distribution of incom-
pleted tenure equals the mean of the distribution of completed tenure,
justifying use of the completed spell functional form. When, as ap-
pears to be the case, Q is not constant but depends on the length of
tenure (separations fall as tenure increases), the exponential is no
longer appropriate. The functional form of the tenure equation will,
depend on the slope of the hazard function (the relation between
cumulated tenure and the probability of separation) and can be quite
complex. The most useful way of analyzing tenure in this case is to
use the linear form, which can be viewed as a first-order Taylor series
approximation to more complex functions:

                           T= B,X+ U.
Calculations show that the linear function is much superior statisti-
cally to the exponential, presumably because of the dependence of
Q on tenure.
Controlling for Monopoly Compensation Effects
   To isolate the nonmonopoly wage impact of unionism on exit,
it is necessary to control carefully for other determinants of exit
(themselves correlated with unionism), such as pecuniary and non-
pecuniary compensation at the current job and at alternative jobs and
personal characteristics like age or sex, which affect the transactions
cost of mobility.
     There are three problems in controlling for compensation at the
current job. First, the surveys of individuals to be analyzed lack ad-
equate information on fringe benefits, which are increased by
unionism [Freeman, 1978a] and can be expected to reduce exit. This
 650                QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS

problem is dealt with by adjusting estimated coefficients on unionism
for the omitted fringe variable using standard omitted variable bias
formulae and outside information on the effect of unionism on fringes.
Second, measures of nonpecuniary work conditions (above and be-
yond those represented by the voice or industrial jurisprudence
 conditions) are notoriously poor. Detailed industry and occupation
dummies are used to narrow some of the possible range of variation
among workers. In addition, measures that might be taken to reflect
worker evaluation of nonpecuniary conditions, such as indicators of
job satisfaction, are entered when available. Some effort is also made
to control for omitted work conditions (and other factors) in the
context of an unobservables model to be described shortly. Third,
when tenure is the dependent variable in the analysis, there is a clear
dual causal relation with tenure raising wages at the same time that
high wages reduce Q and raise tenure. Because of the likely magnitude
of the coefficient on tenure in the wage equation, simultaneity can
be expected to bias upward the estimated coefficient ofwages on
tenure.5 This in turn is likely to bias downward the estimated re-
     5. More precisely, let W = wages, T = tenure, U,,, error in the wage equation
and U, error for tenure equation. Then, ignoring other factors for simplicity, we have
the equation with wages as the dependent variable:
(1)                                      W=aT+U,,,,
or rewritten with T as the dependent variable,
(2)                     T (1/a)W— (1/a)Lç =a'W+ Vt.
We also have the equation with tenure as the dependent variable:
(3)                                  T=W+U,.
Now the OLS estimate is
(4)                        _>2WT                1/N>2WU,
                                                 1/N >2W2
where N    = number of observations. So

gression coefficient on unionism. As inclusion of wages in the tenure
calculations tends to work against the exit-voice hypothesis, I shall
operate as if the causality were uni-directional and ignore the si-
multaneous bias.
      Since the set of options facing a worker cannot be measured di-
rectly but must be inferred from his or her general characteristics, it
is more difficult to obtain adequate measures of alternative com-
pensation. The major indicators of alternatives are education, which
should (wages fixed) raise exit propensities due to the better oppor-
tunities of the more educated or, in the context of a model of specific
human capital, as a result of the inverse link between general and
specific human capital at any fixed wage level; years of work experi-
ence, which should raise outside earnings and thus exit; and the state
 of the local labor market. Occupation and industry dummy variables
 can also be interpreted as reflecting outside opportunities. Because
 standard earnings regressions that include such variables as education,
 experience, and occupation rarely explain more than one-third of the
 variance in log earnings, however, it is unlikely that these variables
 will adequately index alternative opportunities. If, as seems reason-
 able, the unobserved components of alternative opportunities are
correlated with current wages, as both current and alternative
possibilities depend on omitted human capital or personal charac-
teristics, statistical analyses will understate the negative effect of
current compensation on exit and bias the estimated coefficient on
unionism even if the unobserved alternative opportunities are Un-
correlated with unionism.
      The effect of the omitted components of alternative compensa-
tion on the estimated impact of wages and unionism on exit can be
analyzed with regression formulae that do or do not control for the
 omitted factor. Let W = compensation on the present job; WA =
 coml)eflsatiOfl in other jobs; U = unionism; and Q = the propensity
 to exit. Then, using subscripts to specify partial regression coefficients
 with the first subscript reflecting the dependent variable, the second
 the independent variable, and additional subscripts reflecting con-
 trols, the least squares coefficient relating Q to W and with WA
 omitted [b(wl,] and the coefficient relating Q to U with WA omitted
 [bQ(Jw] are linked to the "true" coefficients with WA included
 (bqwuw and bQuwwA) as follows:
 (5)            b(wLJ = bQWtJWA + (bQwAtw)(bw4wu)

  (6)           buw = bquwwA + (bQWAUW)(bw4uw),
652                QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS

where all of the coefficients are conditional on the other variables in
the equation. The difference between the estimated and "true"
coefficients, (bQwu — bQwuwA) and (bQuw — bQuwwA), depends on
the signs and size of bQwAuw, bwAwu, and bwAuw. Increases in WA
should increase exit, making bQwAuw positive. The term bwAwU is
positive, by the assumption that the omitted factors are positively
correlated with current pay. With bQ'vAuw > 0 and bwAwu > 0, there
will be a downward bias in the estimated coefficient on wages. To
obtain some notion of the magnitude of the bias, assume that Wand
WA have similarly sized but oppositely signed effects on exit (bQ%vUWA
= —bQw4uw). Then (5) can be rewritten to obtain the "correct"
coefficient:
(7)                   bQwuwA = bQwu/(1         —
                                            brAvU).
If the coefficient from the regression of WA on W, conditional on U
and all other variables is sizeable, say 0.5 to 0.7, then the true coeffi-
cient will be significantly above the estimated coefficient, suggesting
that the coefficient on wages be raised considerably to estimate better
the true wage effect.
      The bias in estimating the effect of unionism on exit in (6) de-
pends on b WAUW, whose sign is unclear. If union workers are more able
than others, in ways not captured by W, bw4uw will be positive,
producing a downward bias in the absolute value of the estimated
coefficient. Conversely, if union workers are, for whatever reason,
less able than others, the absolute value of bQuw will overstate bQUWA.
Assuming, as before, that bQwL,A = —b(v4ulv, we obtain for the
relation between the estimated and true coefficients on unionism
(8)              bQ(TWWA    = bQ(;w + (bwAuw)(b.uvA).
If, other factors fixed, bwAuw is about equal to the union wage effect,
say 0.10 to 0.20, the bias would be relatively modest, unless bQu7uyz
were extremely large.

 the CPS sample; and the NLS younger male sample. Maximum
 likelihood calculations are used to estimate the determinants of quits
 and separations; nonlinear and linear least squares are used to esti-
 mate the determinants of tenure. The analysis finds a sizeable effect
of unionism on all of the indicators of exit propensity, which is
maintained after the various adjustments and corrections suggested
in Section II.


 Older Male NLS Results

       The estimated effect of unionism and other important explan-
atory variables on exit behavior in the older male NLS sample is given
in Table I. The table records the mean and standard deviation of the
measures of exit for union and nonunion workers8 and the coefficients
on unionism (measured by an 0—1 dummy variable for workers whose
wages are set by collective bargaining), log earnings, dummy variables
for presence of a retirement plan (= 1 when a firm has a plan), an index
of job dissatisfaction, and on lagged tenure, entered as an explanatory
variable in some quit or separations equations. As specified in the
notes to the table, the sample is limited to workers who remained in
the labor force in the period and thus excludes persons who
retired.
     What stands out in the table are the differences in the exit pro-
pensities of union and of nonunion workers. The means and standard
deviations show that union workers have considerably more tenure
than nonunion workers (17.4 years versus 13.2 years) and have much
lower quit rates (a miniscule 1.0 percent compared to 7.2 percent for
nonunion workers) and lower separation rates (7.0 percent for union
workers versus 14.0 percent for nonunion workers). Since the absolute
difference in quit rates between union and nonunion workers (6.0)
is almost equal to the absolute differences in the total separation rates,
which also include employer-initiated changes, there are essentially
no differences in other separations between union and nonunion
workers.
    In the multivariate statistical analysis, where a wide variety of
other factors is held fixed, the different exit propensities of union and
nonunion workers are evinced in the sizeable significant coefficients
accorded unionism.
    In the linear tenure calculations, unionism obtains a coefficient
     8. Note that we can compare the exponential and linear forms directly because
they have the same dependent variable T. Thus, the R2 is the correct measure of fit.
        THE EXiT- VOICE TRADEOFF IN THE LABOR MARKET 655

that ranges from 1.8 to 3.6 years, indicating that upward of half of the
mean difference in years of tenure is, in fact, attributable to trade
unionism, other factors held fixed. Introduction of the retirement
variable in line 2 reduces the union coefficient in the linear form but
still leaves a sizeable significant effect. By controlling for retirement
plans, which are more prevalent among union workers, the analysis
assumes that all of the effect of unions on pensions represents mo-
nopoly wage gains and that none represents the effective transmission
of worker preferences via voice, possibly understating the voice
component of the union impact. The job satisfaction index, also en-
tered in line 2 as a crude indicator of unmeasured nonwage aspects
of the work place or of alternative opportunities (which, if especially
good, should decrease satisfaction, all else the same), obtains an in-
significant effect. In both lines 1 and 2, the coefficient on log earnings
is large, of a similar magnitude to that on unionism. The estimated
exponential tenure equation (equation (5)) in line 3 yields a smaller
coefficient on unionism than on earnings but fits the data so poorly
as to be readily rejected in favor of the linear form.9
      The estimated effect of unionism on the probability of quits or
total separations in lines 4—8 tells a similar story. In line 4, unionism
obtains a sizeable highly significant coefficient of —2.17, which implies
that unionism causes a sizeable reduction in the probability of
quitting. Addition of the index of job dissatisfaction, which signifi-
cantly lowers quits, and of the retirement plan variable in line 5 re-
duces the coefficient on unionism modestly. Comparable results are
obtained in the logistic separation equations in lines 7 and 8, where
the estimated effect of unionism varies from —0.81 to —0.87 with a
standard error of 0.21. Given the higher level of separations in the
sample (a mean of 0.11), these parameters translate into differences
in the probability of separation of about 0.08. In sharp contrast to the
sizeable significant impact of unionism, both the quit and separation
calculations accord a small insignificant effect to wages, which makes
the union exit tradeoff look quite powerful by comparison.
      In lines 6 and 9, the log of tenure in 1969 has been added as an
additional control in the quit and separation calculations. inclusion
of tenure can be interpreted in two possible ways. In the simplest in-
terpretation, tenure is just another control variable, reflecting the
 dependence of exit propensities on cumulated tenure. Alternatively,
 however, tenure can be taken to represent unobserved factors that

     9. A potential problem with this procedure is that it ignores possible selectivity
bias in the group that separate from their job.
 656            QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS

 affect both future quits and separations and past employment sta-
 bility. Formally, let T and Q depend on some omitted person or job-
 specific factor (F1) as well as on unionism:

 (9)                    T = aTUN. + F1 + EiT
 (10)          Q = 1/[1 + exp(—cEUN — XF + fjQ)1,
where T superscripts are used to denote coefficients in the tenure
equation. In (9) and (10) the residuals have two parts: F1 which reflects
the omitted factor (given a unit coefficient in (9) and a scaling of A in
(10)) and equation-specific components EiQ, EiT, which are themselves
uncorrelated and are uncorrelated with the independent variables.
The econometric problem is that F1 is correlated with unionism (and
possibly other explanatory variables also).
    Solving (9) for F1 and substituting into (10) yields

(11) Q = 11(1 + exp[—(a — aTX)UNj — AT + fjQ + ET]),
which removes the correlation between UN and the residual but
introduces a correlation between T and the residual since E(T€1T) >
0. If an instrument for T could be found, such as an independent
variable that does not enter Q, consistent estimates of the coefficient
on tenure could be made. In the absence of instruments, A will be
underestimated in (11), and given a positive correlation between UN1
and T, the coefficient on unionism overstated. As can be seen in (11),
however, the coefficient on unionism with the inclusion of tenure is
a — a"X, rather than a itself. Given aT> 0, this implies an under-
estimate of the effect of unionism on quits. Inclusion of tenure in the
regressions does not totally resolve econometric problems but does
set up a difficult test of the Union impact. From this perspective, the
continued sizeal)le effect of unionism in lines 6 and 9, where tenure
is entered as an explanatory factor, can he viewed as highly supportive
of the postulated union-exit tradeoff. Unionized workers are much
less likely to quit or separate from employers than nonunionized
workers who have the same job tenure and thus having the same
"stability" history.
     To analyze the magnitude of biases due to inadequate controls
on alternative opportunities, it is necessary to obtain estimates of
bwAwu and hw4uw. With such estimates, (7) and (8) can be used to
evaluate the effect of the omitted part of alternative opportunities.
The link between alternative wages and current wages and between
           THE EXIT-VOICE TRADEOFF IN THE LABOR MARKET 657

alternative wages and unionism can be estimated, albeit crudely,'° by
examining workers who changed employers from 1969 to 1971, with
WA measured by wages on the new 1971 job. Regressions of log wages
in 1971 on log wages in 1969 and union status in 1969 and the other
1969 control variables for the 11 percent of the older male NLS sample
who changed employers yield the following coefficients (standard
errors in parentheses):" tWAWU = 0.32 (0.09); IS WAUW = 0.12 (0.11).
Using equations (7) and (8), these values of bwAwu and bwALJw imply
a sizeable increase in the estimated effect of wages on exit and a
modest increase in the effect of unionism on exit. Adjusting the figures
in line 2, where wages were accorded a sizeable effect on tenure, for
example, yields bQWUWA = 1.47 (2.47) = 3.54 and bQUWwA = 2.96 +
3.54 (0.12) = 3.38. Even with the adjustment, the estimated impact
of unionism on tenure is large relative to the estimated impact of
wages Ofl tenure. Adjusting the quit and separation equations has even
less effect on the results.
     In sum, the data on the effect of unionism on job tenure, quits,
and separations in the older male NLS sample show union workers
to be much more attached to their firms than comparable nonunion
workers.
Michigan PSID Data Set
     Table II presents estimates of the effect of unionism on tenure
and quits using data from the Michigan PSID sample. This data set
covers the entire population and thus gives a more inclusive picture
of the trade union impact than that in the older male NLS sample.
In the PSID, information on unionism and mobility is available on
an annual basis for the years 1968 to 1974, which provides data on exit
in each of five separate years (1968—1969, 1969—1970, and so forth).
To obtain a single large sample covering all of the years, individual
year observations were pooled into one data set, with observations
      10. This equation included the same controls as in Table!. The R was 0.462 and
the SEE was 0.552. Tenure was included as an explanatory variable. There were 207
observations.
      11. 'liwse are based on 525 separations from 1969 to 1970. Comparable estimates
for other years give smaller coefficients on unionism and, except in one case, on In wages

In each regression, all of the control variables listed in Table II were included in the
calculations. Tenure was excluded.

       THE EXIT-VOICE TRADEOFF IN THE LABOR MARKET 659

consisting of dichotomous exit variables from year t to t + 1 linked
to the characteristics of the worker and job in year t. The pooled
sample contains 21,173 observations, with certain individuals deleted
in particular years due to changes in the survey sample. Since quits
can be treated as independent from year to year while tenure cannot,
tenure is examined in the initial year 1968 and in the intermediate
year 1972.
     The calculations in Table II confirm the basic finding of a sig-
nificant union-exit relation. The mean values of tenure and quits for
union workers and nonunion workers show substantially less exit
among unionists, uncorrected for differences in other factors. Union
members had 4.4 years more tenure in 1968 and 2.2 years more in 1972
(when the sample was somewhat smaller due to deletions). Over the
period 1968—1973 union workers had an average annual quit rate of
5.8 percent compared with 9.0 percent for other workers, a quanti-
tatively large and statistically significant difference. The separation
rates also differed noticeably, with a rate for union workers of 9.2
percent compared with 13.0 percent for nonunion workers. In the
regressions, which include controls for wages, years of schooling, oc-
cupation, local labor market conditions, age, sex, race, and industry,
as specified in the table, unionism is always accorded a significant
impact. In the OLS tenure regressions, the union coefficient varies
noticeably between 1968 and 1972, but is large absolutely and relative
to its standard error in both cases. While the linear form fits better
than the exponential, the fit of the exponential in line 3 (limited to
a smaller sample due to computational problems) is much superior
to that in Table I and yields a union coefficient somewhat larger at
the mean value of variables (1.32) then from the better-fitting linear
form (1.06). In the pooled quit equations in lines 4 and 5, which first
exclude and then include tenure in the precedent period, the esti-
mated impact of unionism on the probability of quitting ranges from
0.036 to 0.038 points at the mean level of quits. Comparable results
 are obtained in the pooled separation equations in lines 6 and 7, with
 the union coefficient estimated to lower separation at the mean level
 by 0.044 with tenure excluded from the equation and by 0.040 with
 tenure included as an explanatory variable.
      The magnitudes of the union and wage coefficients in the quit
 and separation equations in Table II differ noticeably from those in
 Table I. The impact of unionism is smaller in the Michigan PSID than
 in the NLS Older Male sample, possibly because of the inclusion of
 younger workers and women whose exit behavior is less likely to be
 affected by unionism than that of older men; the impact of wages on
660               QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS

exit is significantly negative in lines 5—8 of Table II, in contrast to its
weak effect in the estimates of Table I. With a smaller union and larger
wage coefficient, the union-exit tradeoff becomes relatively more
moderate compared with the wage-exit relation.
     The wage and union coefficients in Table II can be "corrected"
for potential bias due to lack of adequate data on alternative oppor-
tunities in the same fashion as done previously. Regressing log wages
of persons who changed jobs in the Michigan sample on their previous
wage and union status and other aspects of the job for each year
yielded the following estimates for 1969—1970: bw4uw = 0.13 (0.05);
and bwAwU = 0.38 (0.04) and comparable (somewhat lower) estimates
for other years.12 These figures suggest that in the tenure equation
of line 2 the wage coefficient be raised to 4.19 and the union coefficient
raised to 1.60, while in the quit and separation equations in lines 5 and
7 the wage coefficients be changed to —0.39 and —0.33 and the union
coefficients be changed to —0.52 and —0.42, respectively. Even with
these adjustments, the union impact is sizeahie relative to the wage
impact: an increase in wages of over 100 percent is needed to reduce
quits (separations) by as much as unionism, while an increase in wages
of over one-third is needed to raise tenure by as much as unionism.
     Because the PSID sample lacks any information on fringe ben-
efits, it is also important to adjust the coefficients for the potential
bias due to absence of fringe data. To obtain some notion of the
magnitude of the bias, consider the least squares equation linking
partial regression coefficients to the coefficients that are not partial
for the omitted variable:
(12)                bQUF = (bQu       —
                                          bj'bj.r)/(1 — r'),
where
            = the coefficient corrected br the omitted fringe variable
      b1u = estimated coefficient on exit
            = the regression coefficient linking fringes to unions
            = the regression linking exit to fringes
      rj.1i = the correlation of fringes and unionism,


      12. Adjusting for W, we have
                                     = t.61(—ft57) = —0.92
and
                        bq(JWWA = 0.52 +   0.13(0.92) =   —0.74.

Adjusting for the effect of fringes on the union coefficient yields
                             = [—0.74 —0.13(0.92)1/0.91 = — 0.08.

and where all the coefficients are partial with respect to the other
variables in the model.
     Available information and the likely magnitudes of the coeffi-
cients in (12) suggest only a moderate upward bias in the estimated
effect of unions, of at most 25 percent. For bFu and rj, estimates in

 obtained on log wages in the regressions: since fringes constitute no
 more than one-third of the wage bill, this implies that a dollar of
 fringes is three times as effective in reducing exit. as a dollar of' wages.
 With these estimates, the union coefficient in line 2 of Table II (where
 wages have their greatest impact relative to unionism) is reduced to
 0.79, while there is virtually no impact on the coefficients in other
 lines. Unless the magnitudes of the estimated coefficients linking
 unionism to fringes and fringes to exit are markedly off, correction
 for the omission of fringes still leaves a sizeable union coefficient.

CPS Data Set
    The largest data set with information on union status and quit
behavior is the Current Population Surveys for the month of May,
 which contain information on persons who quit and are unemployed
at the time of the survey, an extreme form of exit, since most quitters
have ajob in hand, and information on unionism on the past or current
job. These surveys have the advantage of offering an especially large
sample size, which permits many industry, occupation, and area
control variables but the disadvantage of relating to a distinct and
relatively small group of quitters. To obtain as large a sample of un-
employed quitters as possible, I amalgamated the May 1973, 1974,
and 1975 CPS surveys into a single sample with over 98,500 persons.
With this size of the sample and with numerous controls for occupa-
tion and detailed industry, maximum likelihood estimation of the
logistic function became computationally infeasible. Instead, a linear
probability model was fit. The linear coefficients can be transformed
to obtain a first-order inverse Taylor series approximation of the lo-
gistic parameters by multiplication by n/SSR, where n = sample size,
SSR = estimated sum of squared residuals (see Nerlove and Press
[1973] for a discussion of this transformation).
     Estimates of the effect of unionism, earnings, schooling, and age
on quits in the CPS sample are given in Table III. The linear regres-
sion coefficient on union status gives the, by now familiar, result of
a negative significant coefficient that is of approximately the same
magnitude as the coefficient on log wages. With diverse characteristics
fixed, unionism is associated with a 0.26 percent lower quit (into un-
employment) rate, which is of similar magnitude to the effect of
earnings in the sample. Transformed into logistic curve parameters,
the coefficient on unionism is about 50 percent larger than that ob-
tained in the quit calculation of Table II while the coefficient on
earnings is roughly twice as great. Still, it would take almost a 100
percent increase in the log of average hourly earnings to reduce the
probability of quitting by as much as the switch from nonunion to
union status.
     If the partial correlations between W, WA, and UN from the
Michigan sample are taken to apply to the CPS sample as well (since
both samples cover the entire population) and the CPS estimates
adjusted for omission of WA, the wage and union coefficients are
raised noticeably. In the logit form the coefficient on wages rises to
—0.74, while the union coefficient rises to —0.71. If, in addition, the
union (but not the wage) coefficient is reduced for the omission of
fringe benefits using the same procedure and data as before, the union
       THE EXIT-VOICE TRADEOFF IN THE LABOR MARKET 663

impact drops to —0.68.' Even with these adjustments, the finding
of a steep union-exit tradeoff remains; the switch from nonunion to
union status reduces quits by as much as 0.92 log wage increase.
Young Male NLS Sample
   Estimates of the effect of unionism on exit behavior were also
made with the young male NLS survey, which contains information
on the union status arid tenure of men aged 17—27 in 1969 and in 1971.
Because of a lack of direct information on the causes of job changes
between 1969 and 1971, the analysis is limited to tenure and to sep-
arations, defined as having a different job in 1971 than in 1969. The
analysis eliminates students and focuses on regular workers.
     The discussion of the difference between the supply price in
union and in nonunion markets of Section I suggested that unionism
represents older "average" workers to a greater extent than younger
mobile workers. This in turn suggests that the impact of unionism on
exit would be weaker among younger, more mobile workers than
among others, and might even possibly be positive rather than neg-
ative. The calculations summarized in Table IV show the expected
weaker effects. The differences in mean tenure and separation rates
between young union and young nonunion workers are proportion-
ately smaller than in the previous samples. The estimated effects of
unionism in the linear tenure regressions in columns 1 and 2 and in
the logistic separation calculations in columns 3 and 4 also yield rel-
atively small and moderate union effects, both absolutely and relative
to the estimated effects of wages. While the coefficient on unionism
 in the 1969 tenure regression is larger than the coefficient on wages,
 in all of the other calculations, the coefficient on wages is larger, which
 contrasts to the general pattern in previous analysis. Adjustments in
 the coefficients for the omission of major components of alternative
 compensation enhance this greater effect of wages than of unionism
 on the exit behavior of the young. In the young male NLS sample,
 regressions of the log of wages of persons who changed employers from
 1969 to 1971 on unionism, log wages in 1969, and the control variables
 in Table IV yield estimates of bwAwu of 0.43 (0.04) and of bw4rw of
 0.005 (0.03), where numbers in parentheses are standard errors.14

      14. When a person never quits, the best estimate of his individual propensity in
 the fixed logit is that he has a constant term that is —. When a person quits always,
 the model fits best with an individual constant of . Hence, these persons drop from
 the sample.

raises the estimated effect of wages by 75 percent but leaves the union
coefficients essentially unchanged. Because deferred fringes are likely
to be received too far in the future to affect the young, further ad-
justments are not warranted. The principal conclusion to be drawn
from Table IV is that unionism has a smaller impact on the exit be-
havior of young workers than on the exit behavior of older workers.
Selectivity versus Behavior
     The analysis thus far has shown that with monopoly compen-
sation gains fixed, unionism raises tenure and reduces quits. Is the
estimated reduction in exit, with wages held fixed, due to unionization
of relatively more stable persons, or is it due to actual changes in be-
havior caused by the specific work relations associated with the union
institution?
      The longitudinal data files provide a possible means of differ-
entiating between these two effects and isolating the behavioral as-
pects of unionism of concern. With longitudinal data on the same
person over time, that person's exit behavior when he or she is un-
ionized and when he or she is not unionized can be compared, thereby
eliminating the personal propensity to be a stable worker. The most
direct way of controlling for individual effects is to add individual
 constants to the logistic probability function and estimate a "fixed
 effect logit model" (see Chamberlain [19781 and Freeman E197SbI for
 detailed discussions of this model). The fixed effect procedure has
 the advantage over possible random effect models of not requiring
 knowledge of a particular distribution for the individual propensities.
 The fixed effect model yields consistent estimates regardless of the
 distribution of individual propensities, whereas random effects models
 based on specific distributions yield inconsistent estimates when that
 distribution is incorrectly specified.
       The Michigan PS1D data set provides sufficient number of ob-
 servations on individuals over time for the fixed effect logit to be es-
  timated and has, accordingly, been used to test the selectivity inter-
  pretation of the union effect. Since, with individual constants in the
  equations, the behavior of persons who remain in their job over the
  whole period or who quit in each period is explained entirely by the
  constant, the sample drops from that used in Table II to 1,232 cases,
 consisting of 877 cases of a single quit, 276 cases of two quits, 67 cases
 of three quits, and 12 cases of four quits.'5
      15. The differential effect of the individual constants on the union and wage
 coefficients may reflect the fact that wages are more person-related than unionism,
 which is much more ot a social phenomenon.

      The results of the calculations, given in Table V, yield coefficients
on unionism of similar magnitude to those obtained in Table II but
show a marked change in the coefficient on log wages, which changes
from significant negative to insignificant positive.'6 Since controlling
for individual propensities to quit has essentially no effect on the
coefficient on unionism, we conclude that the union impact appears
to operate by changing the behavior of the same person rather than
by unionization of innately more stable persons. In an organized work
place a given individual is less likely to quit than in a nonorganized
work place, wages held fixed.


                 IV. THE UNION VOICE INTERPRETATION

     The analysis thus far has documented the existence of a signifi-
cant inverse relation between trade unionism and various measures
of exit behavior, which exists separate from the effect of unions on
wages and the selectivity of innately more stable workers by unions.
Because of the lack of a direct measure of "voice" components of
unionism, however, the voice interpretation of the relation rests on
the inability of other factors to explain the union effect, rather than

      16. The highly satisfied group in the PSID consist of persons who responded "very
or mostly enjoyable" (n = 2,566); the moderately satisfied group were those who re-
sponded "somewhat enjoyable" (n = 868); the rest were labeled dissatisfied fri = 293).
In the NLS older men, highly satisfied persons answered "like it very much" (ii = 8991;
moderately satisfied said "like it fairly well" (ii = 734); while the rest were dissatisfied
(ci = 102). Numbers in parentheses are the number of respondents in those catego-
ries.

on positive support for the hypothesis. This section considers some
direct evidence on the link between one of the major components of
union voice, the grievance and arbitration system, and exit behavior,
and finds some support for the hypothesis.
     One direct test of the voice interpretation is to compare the effect
of unionism on the exit behavior of workers more or less likely to use
the grievance system. Persons with grievances should evince a sharper
drop in the propensity to exit under unionism than persons relatively
pleased with their job. Empirically, in terms of the information on the
longitudinal files under study, workers who report themselves dis-
satisfied with their jobs are most likely to raise grievances and thus
be affected by the grievance procedure. Does unionism reduce the rate
of exit of dissatisfied workers more sharply than that of satisfied
workers?
    To answer this question, the quit rates of workers with varying
expressed levels of job satisfaction were tabulated for union and
nonunion workers separately from the Michigan and NLS older male
surveys. In the 1972 Michigan survey, workers were asked, "in general,
would you say that your job is vefy enjoyable, mostly enjoyable,...
not enjoyable at all?" with five possible answers. In the NLS a similar
question was asked ("How do you feel about your job?") with four
categories of responses. For ease of presentation and to obtain a rea-
sonably sized sample of dissatisfied workers (few express extreme
dissatisfaction), the categories have been grouped into three classes:
highly satisfied workers, moderately satisfied workers, dissatisfied
workers; with the result shown in Table VI.
     Measured by absolute differences in quit rates, unionism clearly
has a greater effect on dissatisfied than on other workers. In the PSID,
quit rates are 4.8 points lower for "highly satisfied" union workers
than for highly satisfied nonunion workers and 6.2 points lower among
the "moderately satisfied," and 8.1 points lower among the dissatis-
fied. In the NLS older male sample, the greater impact of trade
unionism is even more marked, with a 4.7 point difference in quit rates
among the satisfied rising to differences of 6.5 and 22.1 points with
increased dissatisfaction. Measured as logits of the rates, the picture
is less clear. The logit of the quit rate of union workers increases more
slowly than the logit of the quit rate of nonunion workers as dissat-
ist action increases Irom highly satisfied persons to dissatisfied persons
and from highly satisfied persons to moderately satisfied persons.
However, the logits increase more rapidly for union workers in corn-
parisons of moderately satisfied and dissatisfied persons. Interpre-

-   they include seven occupation dummies, and a sex dummy and excluded the retirements benefit variahie. l'he ft2
    was 0.400.




    tation of the evidence depends on the metric and group used to
    evaluate the differences.
         A second way of evaluating the effect of grievance and arbitration
    on exit behavior is to compare the exit behavior of unionized workers
    in sectors of the economy having different types of grievance systems.
    The more inclusive or stronger the system, the greater should be the
    reduction in exit. While detailed knowledge of the operation of
    grievance machinery is needed for a definitive evaluation, readily
    available data on collective bargining clauses from the Bureau of
    Labor Statistics can he used to obtain a rough measure of the scope
    of grievance systems. The B.L.S. divides grievance clauses into those
    with "unrestricted" coverage (43 percent of the total), defined as
    expressing or implying "that any dispute or complaint could be pro-
    cessed as a grievance" and those with "restrictive" coverage (57 per-
    cent) because "they limit the grievance process to disputes arising
    under or relating to specific terms of the contract" IB.L.S. Bulletin
    1425-1, p. 6]. The percentage of workers covered by unrestricted
    clauses varies sufficiently across industries to provide some indication
    of industrial differences in the scope of grievance procedures. Ac-
    cordingly, the percentage of contracts with nonrestrictive grievance
    clauses reported by the B.L.S. IBulletin 1425, table 1, p. 2] for
    thirty-one separate industries was added to the NLS and PSII) data
    tapes and the effect of' the new variable on the tenure of union workers
    estimated by linear regression analysis. To eliminate the possibility
    that "favorable" results would result simply from the distinctive work
    arrangements in construction (low tenure, limited grievance system),
  670               QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS

 construction workers were deleted from the sample. To reduce the
 danger that the effect of other union work conditions correlated with
 nonrestrictive grievance systems might underlie any statistical results,
 two other measures of contracts were also entered in the calculations:
 the percentage of contracts with explicit layoff provisions; and the
 percentage with seniority provisions.17 All of the various control
 variables used earlier, except for industry dummies,were also entered
 into the equation. The resultant coefficientson the grievance clause
 variable are given in Table VII. While the crudemeasure of differences
 in grievance procedures makes the results no more than suggestive,
 the positive impact of the scope of the grievance system on tenure is
 consistent with the model.
      More direct evidence on the impact of a grievance system on
 turnover is given, for a limited number of hospitals, in a study by
 Sargent and Clawson [1974]. In their data set, hospitals witha written
 grievance procedure had a yearly separation rate of 0.50 while hos-
 pitals without a grievance system had a separation rate of0.81; the
 simple correlation of separation rates with the presence of written
 grievance procedures is —0.72; the partial correlation between sepa-
 ration and grievance procedures is —0.74, conditional on bed size of
 hospital and distance from the center of the nearest city.18 While
 absence of other control variables makes these relations suggestive
 rather than definitive, the significant relation between turnover and
 grievance procedure supports our interpretation of the evidence on
 the data tapes for individua1s
      Finally, the voice interpretation of the apparently sizeable
nonwage effect of unionism on exit, while novel in some respects, is
consistent with the corpus of industrial relations analyses and find-
ings. Industrial relations studies of Unionism have traditionally
stressed the importance of grievance, arbitration, and related factors
in the impact of the institution [Slichter, Livernash, and Healey,
1975; Dunlop, 1970; and Kerr, 1978]. Analyses of why workers join
Unions almost invariably find that worker grievances, usually with
specific managerial policies rather than possible higher wages, mo-
tivate organization [Seidman, Landon, and Karsh, 1957]. Companies

that face organizing drives are usually advised by labor-management
legal consultants to concentrate on personnel policy issues relating
to what could easily be labeled voice issues. At the other end of the
spectrum, AFL-CIO propaganda places great stress on the role of
unions as the "voice" of workers. These pieces of information suggest
that the interpretation of the depressant effect of unionism on exit
given in this study is broadly consistent with the industrial relations
picture of the operation of trade unions in the United States.


              V. CONSEQUENCES AND IMPLICATIONS

    The evidence that trade unionism appears to reduce the exit
propensity of workers, with at least some of the effect due to the op-
eration of unions as an institution of collective voice, has implications
for the functioning of the job market and for future research on trade
unions. It suggests that unionism is a major force in the creation of
a relatively permanent enterprise work force and thus of the types of
market arrangements and adjustments to which permanent attach-
ment gives rise (see Feldstein [1976] and the literature cited therein).
For example, with quits playing a lesser role in labor force adjustments
in the union sector, one would expect organized firms to make greater
use of layoffs and recalls, as appears to be the case [Medoff, 1979]. At
the same time, permanent attachment of workers can be expected to
reduce wage adjustments over the business cycle and enhance em-
ployment fluctuations [Feldstein, 19761. The composition of the
compensation package is also likely to be affected, with the greater
likelihood of remaining with a firm raising the deferred compensation
share of the wage bill [Freeman, 1978a]. Investments in firm-specific
human capital may also be increased by union-induced reductions
in exit. In terms of productivity, the increase in job tenure and re-
duction quits can be expected to raise the efficiency of organized es-
tablishments by lowering the costs of turnover in the form of hiring
and training expenses. Brown and Medoff [1978] find that a sizeable
proportion of the relation between unions and productivity among
two-digit manufacturing industries across states is, indeed, due to the
lower quit rates of unionized workers.
     Finally, with respect to research, this study has taken only a first
empirical step in analyzing the nonmonopoly wage effects of unionism.
The model and findings suggest that greater attention be given to the
672                QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOAIICS

economic effects of unionism beyond the monopoly wage gains that
are at the center of most modern empirical work.
