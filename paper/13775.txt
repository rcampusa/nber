                                             ABSTRACT

We analyze the role of three aspects of HMO market structure -- HMO penetration, HMO plan concentration,
and HMO for-profit share on explaining hospital cost and revenue growth during the HMO expansion
period (1994-1999) and backlash period (2000-2005). We find that HMO penetration effects differ
over time: a 10 percentage point increase in HMO enrollment leads to 2.5 percent reduction in cost
and revenues in the expansion period but only 0.4-1 percent reduction in the backlash period. Furthermore,
this HMO backlash effect can be attributed to HMO dis-enrollment as well as the changing nature
of HMO product. We find that revenue increases at a slower rate (by about 5 percent) in markets with
relatively concentrated HMO markets power and more competitive hospital markets. Finally, increased
for-profit HMO presence is associated with smaller cost and revenue growth, and the effect differs
between low and high penetration markets.

                     The Changing Effect of HMO Market Structure:
      An Analysis of Penetration, Concentration, and Ownership Between 1994-2005

                                         1. Introduction

       With the introduction and growth of managed care, the intense growth in US health care

spending since post-war has subsided for the first time in the 1990s. More recently, however,

health care spending has accelerated again after a decade of moderate growth. The causes of this

increase are not well understood. Some observers suggest that the significant structural changes

that managed care has gone through could have an important effect on the overall spending.

Over the last fifteen years, managed care industry, in particular, health maintenance

organizations (HMO), has experienced an expansion, competition period throughout the 1990s,

during when enrollment exploded and many new plans entered the market. It was followed by a

contraction, consolidation period that started in the late 1990s and continues to date, when

consumers are leaving HMOs and health plans merged or exited completely. The early

competitive environment also cultivated for-profit ownership interest: enrollment in for-profit

plans rose to dominate the HMO sector in the latter 1990s and continues to increase throughout

the 2000s (Figure 1).

       Despite the rapid restructuring in the managed care industry, empirical literature has not

kept up with these recent changes. Most of the previous work centers on only one aspect of the

HMO competition: the effect of HMO penetration (see Miller and Luft, 1994, 1997, 2002;

Morrisey 2001; and Scanlon et al, 2006, for reviews). However, these studies either pre-dated

the HMO backlash beginning around 1999, or did not differentiate HMO effects before and after

the backlash. Moreover, despite the significant activities and the controversy surrounding them,

empirical evidence on the effects of managed care backlash, consolidation, and for-profit health

plans on the health care system is very limited.



                                                                                                    1
       Our study explores the impact of changing managed care market structure on hospital

performance during this turbulent period. We focus on the dominant health plan type, HMO,

because it is the only form of health plan with reliable data on different aspects of its market

structure. This research extends the existing literature in two ways. First, unlike others that

focused on one single characteristics of the HMO market, our study analyzes simultaneously

three measures that characterize different aspects of the HMO market in one model. Second, this

study examines whether and how these three effects differ in the expansion, competition period

(henceforth expansion period) vs. the contraction, consolidation period (henceforth backlash

period). Specifically, we address the following research questions:

       1. Do different aspects of the HMO market (in particular, penetration, concentration,

           and for-profit share) have independent effects on hospital cost and revenue growth?

       2. Do these HMO effects differ between the expansion period (1994-1999) and the

           backlash period (2000-2005)?

       3. Does the magnitude of these HMO effects depend on the level of overall HMO

           penetration?



                        2. Conceptual Framework and Research Design

       In this section, we develop a conceptual framework that incorporates the existing

literature and the research design for studying three aspects of HMO markets – HMO

penetration, HMO plan concentration and HMO for-profit share .

       Effect of HMO Penetration: The growth of managed care plans can have numerous

direct and indirect effects on hospital performance. Miller and Luft (1994) developed a

framework for understanding the various effects of managed care growth, including: (1)




                                                                                                   2
increased purchasing power on the demand side through selective contracting and concentrated

buying power which can lead to lower prices and improved cost efficiency, (2) reimbursement

through capitation which rewards providers for lower utilization, (3) delivery system

consolidation which can lower costs through increased technical efficiency and economies of

scale and scope, and (4) increased use of information technology which can improve both cost

efficiency and quality. In addition, HMO penetration can affect the performance of non-HMO

health plans and thus the overall performance of health insurance market. For example, HMOs

compete with non-HMOs for enrollment, thus providing the opportunity for competitive pressure

on non-HMO products and plans. Further, to the extent that HMO penetration reaches a

sufficient level such that HMO penetration induces broad changes in providers to deliver care

more efficiently, this efficiency gain may accrue to non-HMO health plans in the form of HMO

spillover effects.

        HMOs can reduce the level of health care spending by reducing both price and quantity

relative to FFS plans (Chernew et al, 1998). As such, switching enrollees from fee-for-service

(FFS) plans into HMOs may lower the level of spending whereby a change in HMO enrollment

is related to change in costs or revenue. In addition, HMOs can affect the growth of spending by

(1) slowing down the diffusion of new high-cost medical technologies (Cutler and Sheiner, 1998;

Baker, 2001), (2) spillover effect of FFS plans adopting HMO’s more conservative treatment

practice to other patients (Baker 1997, 1999; Heidenreich et al, 2002; Bradford and Krumholz,

2003; Bundorf et al, 2004; Meara et al, 2004), or that (3) change of HMO enrollment may affect

spending with a lag (Cuter and Sheiner, 1998). Therefore, a higher level of HMO enrollment

will result in lower rate of growth in cost or revenue. Consequently, both the level and change in

HMO penetration might influence the change in spending.




                                                                                                 3
        The empirical literature shows that the level of HMO penetration can affect different

aspects of provider performance (Zawnziger and Melnick, 1988; Robinson 1991, 1996; Gaskin,

Hadley, 1997; Baker, 1994, 1999; Santerre and Adams, 2002; Hadley and Mitchell, 2002; Meara

et al, 2004; Mitchell and Schlesinger, 2005). A number of these studies rely on cross-sectional

variation by comparing high and low HMO penetration areas and, as a result, may suffer from

omitted variable bias, with the few exceptions that employed plausible instrumental variable(s).

Other studies use longitudinal variation to identify the effect of change in HMO enrollment on

the change of spending/behavioral outcomes (Baker and Shankarkumar, 1997; Connor et al

1998; Bamezai et al 1999; Currie and Fahr, 2004; Kaestner et al, 2005; Morrisey et al, 2003;

Shen and Melnick 2004, 2007; Zwanziger and Mooney, 2005).

        In this study, our research design follows the latter approach that employs a more robust

hospital/market fixed effect using a 12-year panel of hospital data. However, to allow for an

effect to be related to the level HMO penetration, we specify a log-linear relationship to take into

account the initial level of penetration. In addition, we allow for differential HMO effects in

high and low penetration markets by running separate regression in those markets. Our design

also allows us to consider how the HMO penetration effect might differ between the expansion

and the backlash periods. It is clear that the HMO backlash effect is not just the reverse of HMO

penetration effect: consumers can respond to their dissatisfaction with a firm’s performance by

“voting with their feet” and switching out of managed care plans into other insurance products,

or by ”voicing” their preferences and pressuring plans to change (Hirschmann 1970).1 Our

design allows us to differentiate between the “dis-enrollment” and “product change” effects by

categorizing markets by their decline or growth in enrollment during the backlash period (details

 Studies have documented that HMO plans today bear limited resemblance to those plans of the early 1990s (Lesser
et al, 2003), and many are looking more like PPOs (Federman and Siu, 2004).


                                                                                                              4
in the results section). We hypothesize that cost/revenue containment effects will be smaller in

markets with substantial dis-enrollment (the backlash markets) than in markets that maintain

their enrollment level (the stable markets), because the backlash markets suffer both “dis-

enrollment” and “product change” effects, whereas the stable markets would only suffer from

“product change” effects.

         Effect of HMO Concentration. Market concentration is a well-grounded economic

measure of market structure with differential effects depending on whether it is on the selling

(monopoly power) or buying side (monopsony power) of the market. Pauly (1998) posits that

health plans with more concentrated buying power can exert more power to force price discounts

and/or restrict output and as such, more concentrated insurance markets may be better able to

inject price competition into hospital markets, leading to reduced cost and revenue growth2.

         The empirical literature on HMO market concentration and hospital performance is

limited. Studies reported no relationship between HMO market structure and hospital prices

(Zwanziger and Mooney, 2005) or cost per adjusted admission (Younis et al, 2005). Mitchell

and Schlesinger (2005) found that greater HMO competition leads gender disparity in coverage

and access to care while others show that HMOs in more concentrated markets are less likely to

contract with a safety-net hospitals (Zwanziger and Khan, 2006) and are more likely to increase

the cost of treating non-HMO patients (Bradford and Krumholz, 2003).

         Empirically we do not expect a simple HMO concentration effect on hospital

cost/revenue for several reasons. For example, it may be important to consider the level of HMO

penetration; there may need a critical mass of market share before the health plan can

successfully exert its countervailing power. Further, it may be important to consider the

2
 However, HMO concentration may not be a very precise measure of managed care’s bargaining power, as a
payer’s ability to direct patients to lower-priced hospitals (which increases hospitals’ price elasticity of demand) is
also critical in determining discounts (Dranove and Satterthwaite, 2000; Sorenson, 2003; Wu, 2005).


                                                                                                                          5
structure of hospital markets as well given the wave of hospital consolidations throughout the

1990s which may endow hospitals with countervailing bargaining power in concentrated

insurance markets. Our design includes both HMO penetration and HMO concentration at the

same time to allow for a scale effect of penetration on HMO market concentration (e.g., a very

concentrated HMO market with only 5% HMO penetration may not have much influence). We

expect HMO concentration effects cost/revenue growth to be either negative or small but not

positive.

       For-Profit Ownership. Under the classical microeconomic framework, a for-profit

organization can achieve higher production efficiency than other forms of ownership, even when

applied to health care. For example, to help meet cost and revenue targets, for-profit health plans

offer managers profit-sharing and stock option plans based on performance leading for-profit

health plan managers to be more motivated than nonprofit managers to obtain hospital price

discounts. For-profit plans are also more likely to use hospital risk sharing strategy (Ahern and

Molinari, 2004). These economic incentives are cited by opponents of for-profit health plan

conversions who have argued that for-profit plans may be too aggressive in negotiating lower

prices with providers to reduce health plans’ operating costs. However, some have argued that

for-profit health plans are no more effective than nonprofit plans at improving health system

efficiency (see discussion in Weisbrod 1988). Despite heated debate on the merits of for-profit

health plans, there is little empirical evidence on the relative performance of for-profit HMOs.

Schramm (2001) and Town et al (2004) both reported that conversion of HMO plans to for-profit

status does not result in demonstrable economic efficiency in the health plans. Wholey et al

(2006), in a descriptive analysis of HMO plans between 1985 and 2001, even found for-profit

HMOs to be less productive than not-for-profit plans. Shen and Melnick (2004) directly tested




                                                                                                    6
whether for-profit HMOs exert more financial pressure than not-for-profit plans on hospital cost

and revenue growth between 1989 and 1998. They found that hospital cost and revenue grew at

a slower rate with increasing share of FP HMO penetration in the area; and this evidence is

stronger high HMO penetration areas. Given the retrenchment of overall HMO penetration in

the 2000s, our current study will examine whether for-profit HMO effect changes in the backlash

period.

          In sum, our approach is designed to examine these behavioral issues over time. First, we

analyze the HMO penetration effects by examining both changes and levels. Second, we further

decompose the HMO backlash effect by examining dis-enrollment and product change effects in

the backlash period. Third, we test the HMO concentration and ownership effects while taking

into account the overall HMO penetration level. Of course, there are other market and

organizational factors (such as hospital ownership, size, patient mix) that can influence hospitals’

financial performance besides the health insurance markets. In the next section, we provide

more details on these other factors that are controlled in the empirical models.



                                3. DATA AND METHODOLOGY

3.1 Overview

          We examine hospital costs and revenues among all short-term, general, non-federal

hospitals located in MSAs in the United States between 1994 and 2005. The year 1994 is the

earliest year where for-profit health plan information is available to us, and the year 2005 is the

latest available year of data. We focus on three types of HMO effects (overall penetration,

concentration, and for-profit share) in two distinct periods: 1994-1999 and 2000-2005 which

represent the expansion and backlash periods of overall HMO enrollment (Swartz 1999,




                                                                                                      7
Robinson 2001, Marquis et al, 2004, Shen and Melnick 2007). We utilize all years of data to

capture the effect of changes in HMO characteristics on changes in hospital cost and revenue for

each period. The unit of observation is the hospital, and we include hospital and market (MSA)

fixed-effects to remove bias that might result from time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity

across hospitals and MSAs. Our main model includes all hospitals in the full sample. We then

estimate the same model separately for hospitals located in low and high HMO penetration

markets. This allows us to capture potential differential effects of for-profit HMO and HMO

competition across different levels of HMO penetration.



3.2 Data

        Data were drawn from a variety of sources. Hospital data are primarily from Medicare

hospital cost reports and the American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Surveys include

detailed information on hospitals’ financial performance, inpatient and outpatient utilization, and

other characteristics such as teaching status, multi-hospital system membership. In addition, we

obtained the edited multi-hospital system information from Drs. Kristin Madison and Sujoy

Chakravarty. HMO data were obtained from two sources. The HMO penetration and

concentration data were provided by Dr. Laurence Baker of Stanford University.3 The HMO

ownership data were obtained from Interstudy. We supplemented these with data from the Area

Resource File and the County Business Patterns (MSA characteristics such as per capita income

and population size) and the PPS Impact file (area wage index).4

3.3 Empirical Methods

         The dependent variables include the logarithm of total operating cost for the cost

regression and the logarithm of net patient revenue for the revenue regression. We use the

standard translog function to account for the highly skewed distributions of cost and revenue. In

our main analysis, we implement the following model:

LnEit = α i + γ t + β (ln(Oit , Pit , I it )) + β ( X it , HMO _ P * Bt , HMO _ C * Bt , HMO _ FP * Bt , HOP _ Cit * Bt ) + ε it
         (1)

Where

         E=annual operating costs or net patient revenue

         α i =hospital/market fixed-effects for each hospital i

         γ t =year dummies

         HMO _ Pit =Overall HMO penetration rate in each year.

         HMO _ Cit =HMO Herfindahl index in each year.

         HMO _ FPit =For-profit share of HMO enrollment in each year.

         HOP _ Cit =Herfindahl index of the hospital market based on patient flow (more in the

         next section).

         transformed)

         I=demand for hospital care (proxy by log per capita income)

         X=hospital and market characteristics (hospital ownership, hospital system membership,

         financial pressure index from Medicaid and Medicare as defined below, percent for-profit




                                                                                                                             9
         and government hospitals in a market).



         The year dummies capture the average growth rates for hospitals over the entire period.

The key variables of interest are the three HMO market measures and their interaction terms with

the backlash period dummy. Take the HMO penetration variable for example. The main effect

of HMO_P captures the effect of overall HMO penetration on hospital cost in the expansion

period (1994-1999). The interaction term between the backlash period indicator and the HMO_P

variable tests whether the effect of HMO penetration on hospital costs is different in backlash

period (2000-2005) compared to the expansion period. Because the HMO variables are

measured at the MSA level whereas our unit of analysis is hospital, we adjust the standard errors

of our estimates to account for the clustering at the MSA level.



3.4 Variable Definition

         Hospital Cost and Revenue. In our analysis we focus on annual total operating costs

and total annual net patient revenue5, because health plan policies have a more direct effect on

operations than on non-operating activities such as income from investments.6

         HMO Penetration, Concentration, and For-Profit Share. Building on the work of

others (Baker 1999; Hymen and Kovacic, 2004; Shen and Melnick 2004, 2007) we capture the

effects of HMO penetration (HMO_P) by calculating the share of MSA total population enrolled

in HMOs in a given year. HMO concentration (HMO_C) is captured by a Herfindahl-Herfindahl

index using the MSA as the geographic market and is constructed by summing all squared value


5
  Net patient revenue is total patient revenue minus contractual allowances and discounts on patients’ accounts.
Both net and total patient revenues are reported in the Medicare hospital cost reports.
6
  Using total cost and total revenue yield very similar results, since operating cost and patient revenue are the major
components of total cost and revenue.


                                                                                                                     10
of individual HMO market shares in each MSA. In sensitivity analyses, we also tested other

HMO competition measures such as 1-plan and 2-plan concentrations. For-profit share of HMO

(HMO_FP) is measured as the ratio of HMO enrollees in for-profit plans over the total number

of HMO enrollees in each MSA. We estimate model (1) on the full sample, as well as on

hospitals in low and high HMO markets separately. To categorize HMO markets, we calculate

the average HMO penetration for MSA over the entire time period, divide the hospitals into three

equal samples based on this average and run separate regressions for hospitals in low HMO

markets (<17% HMO penetration) and high HMO markets (>25% HMO penetration).

       Hospital Competition. Using the 1994-2005 Medicare discharge data extracted from the

MEDPAR file, we construct annual, hospital-specific Herfindahl-Hirschman indices (Hosp_C)

that takes into account each hospital’s geographic market and adjusts for hospitals that are part of

multi-hospital systems with other members in the same geographic market. Individual hospital

geographic markets are defined using actual zip code level patient flow data, following the

detailed method described in Bamezai et al. (1999). We broadly outline the approach here. First,

competing hospitals are identified on a zip code level as those facilities that draw at least one

discharge of a zip code area’s total discharges. If two hospitals belong to the same system within

the same geographic market, they are treated as a single entity and not as competing entities.

Next, an HHI is calculated for each zip code based on the share of total discharges among all

competing hospitals in the zip code. Finally, the degree of competition facing each hospital is

captured by estimating a weighted average of the zip code area’s HHIs in its market, with the

proportion of discharges it draws from each zip code area serving as the weight. Though this

measure is based on Medicare patients only, previously, a comparative correlation analysis was

done using data from several states with all payor data, and the two HHI measures were highly




                                                                                                    11
correlated (Bamezai et al 1999).

         Medicare and Medicaid Financial Pressure. The study covers periods in which

Medicare underwent several major payment changes for general acute hospitals including, for

example, the 1998-Balanced Budget Act (BBA) that included payment reductions for general

acute hospitals. To capture the changes in financial pressure by Medicare on each hospital over

time, ted by, we construct a hospital specific Medicare fiscal generosity variable based on

previous studies including Staiger and Gaumer 1992, Cutler 1998, and Shen 2003.

Conceptually, the Medicare fiscal generosity index is calculated as the difference between a

hospital’s actual payments compared to the payments that it would have received under the new

reimbursement method if the hospital did not change its behavior at all in response to the

changing reimbursement policies from Medicare. This measure is then weighted by a hospital’s

Medicare share of patients. Further details of the variable construction can be found in Shen

(2003) and Wu (2005).

         A Medicaid financial pressure variable was constructed using a measure the generosity of

state’s Medicaid program. We use the state-level Medicaid physician fee index from Norton and

Zuckerman (2000) and the follow-up study by Lewin Group (2003) as the Medicaid financial

pressure index. The index is the ratio between each state’s physician fee schedule for primary

care to the median physician fee of the nation. If a state has an index above 1, it is a more

generous state compare to the rest of the nation. If a state’s Medicaid financial pressure index is

below 1, then it is a less generous state than the median state.7 In addition, we include hospital’s

share of Medicaid patients to capture the Medicaid pressure for individual hospitals.

7
 Ideally, we would like to have a Medicaid hospital payment index instead of the physician fee index. However,
such measure is not available. What we were able to establish is that state’s per capita Medicaid spending on
hospital care and on physician services are highly correlated (based on state health expenditure account, the
correlation is about 0.6). Therefore the physician fee index should be a reasonable alternative to capture a state
Medicaid program’s generosity.

4.1 Descriptive Statistics

       Trend data describing the three HMO market measures are presented in Figure 1. HMO

penetration (i.e, total HMO enrollment divided by MSA population), represented by the bars,

grew continuously from about 21 percent in 1994 to a peak of 28 percent in 1999, followed by a

steady decline to a low of 23 percent in 2005. FP share of HMO enrollment (the dashed line)

grew throughout the period from 57 percent in 1994 to 68 percent in 2005. The HMO HHI

weighted by population (the dotted line) is U-shaped. In 1994, it was 0.29 and then dropped to

0.21 in 1999 and by 2005 the HMO HHI climbed to 0.27.

       Table 1 provides summary statistics of all variables in the empirical models for all years,

and separately for the expansion and backlash periods. Panel 1 in Table 1describes changes in

the HMO market structure variables. The 1994-1999 period can be characterized growing HMO

enrollment and increased competition along with consolidation in the hospital market. During

this period, ninety percent of HMO markets experienced positive enrollment growth while at the

same time about 70 percent of HMO markets had increased competition as measured by HMO

HHI. Most of the HMO markets had stable or increased for-profit presence in the 1994-1999

period and about two-thirds of MSAs had increases in their average hospital HHI values,

indicating hospital consolidations in those markets. In contrast, between 2000 and 2005 over

three-quarter of the MSAs experience substantial enrollment backlash (enrollment drops of more

than 2.5 percent) while about 9 percent of HMO markets had stable enrollment and the

remaining 13 percent of markets continue to attract enrollees into HMOs. At the same time,

HMO consolidation increased for two-thirds of the MSAs. Growth of FP share grew at the same

pace as was in the previous period and the wave of hospital consolidation in the 1994-1999




                                                                                                 13
period did not continue in the 2000-2005 period, with only 10 percent of the market experience

an increase in hospital HHI values.



4.2 Hospital Fixed-Effects Regression Results

       Table 2 shows the hospital fixed-effects model estimates for cost and revenue measures

on the three HMO market variables (complete results on the whole sample are included in the

Appendix). The dependent variables are the log of operating cost and log of net patient revenue.

The first column of Table 2 shows the coefficients and standard errors for model (1) estimated on

the entire hospital sample. The next 2 columns are the results for model (1) estimated separately

for low and high HMO penetration markets. All standard errors are adjusted to reflect the

clustering of HMO measures at the MSA levels.

       Results on HMO Penetration. The coefficient of -0.25 on HMO penetration in the first

column (total sample) indicates that a 10 percentage point difference in HMO penetration is

associated with a -2.5 percent difference in operating cost between 1994 and 1999. The positive

coefficient on the interaction term between HMO penetration and the backlash indicator indicate

a statistically significant weakening cost containment effect: during 2000-2005 a 10 percentage

point difference in HMO penetration is associated with a smaller cost difference compared to the

base period (-0.25+0.14=-.11). When we allow for the log-linear relationship to differ by the

level of HMO penetration (columns two and three) the change in HMO penetration has no effect

on the change in cost in the low HMO markets, while the cost containment effect is very strong

in the high penetration area (-.47) throughout the 1994-2005 period. The same pattern of HMO

penetration effect was observed in the revenue regressions (bottom panel of Table 2). In general,

we find a modest effect of reducing net patient revenue with the growth of HMO penetration,




                                                                                                14
and this effect weakens substantially in the backlash period.

           The observed -1.1 percent HMO penetration effect in the cost model in the backlash

period is a combination of two potential effects: a weakening of the HMO cost containment

effect (HMO effect) and the cost increase due to enrollees switching out of HMO plans to other

more expensive plans (product change effect). To estimate these two different effects, we re-

categorize HMO markets based on the enrollment changes between 2000 and 2005. MSAs that

lost more than 2.5 percentage points of enrollment are labeled “backlash markets” while “stable

markets” contain MSAs where enrollment has remained roughly constant (within ±2.5

percentage points), and the “growing markets” are areas whose HMO penetration continued to

rise. We estimate model (1) separately on these three markets and the results are presented in

Table 38. We find that in the stable markets, the HMO cost containment effect weakened

substantially in the backlash period, suggesting that even without dis-enrollment, the ability of

HMOs to control costs is getting weaker. Among the backlash markets, the effect of losing

HMO market share is not symmetric to the effect of gaining market share. Specifically, during

the expansion period, every 10 percentage point increase in HMO penetration leads to a 2.8

percent drop in cost and revenue; whereas in the backlash period, every 10 percentage point drop

in HMO penetration leads to only 1.2 percent increase (-0.28+0.16=-0.12) in cost. The growing

markets only represent 8 percent of the hospital sample in 33 MSAs and we do not find any

HMO effect, possibly due to the small number of markets.

           Results on HMO Concentration. Controlling for HMO penetration, we did not find any

association between HMO concentration and hospital cost or revenue (Table 2). Coefficients on

the HMO HHI and its interactions with the backlash indicator are both small in magnitude and

                                                                                                    15
insignificant statistically. We also experimented with other concentration measures such as 1-

plan and 2-plan concentrations and have similar insignificant findings. Although we do not find

average HMO concentration effect on hospital costs or revenues, we suspect that the relationship

may not be linear. For example, the HMO concentration effect might only appear in markets

where insurers have relatively stronger market power compared to the hospitals they are

negotiating with. To investigate this possibility, we modified model (1) by introducing a

“dominant HMO market” indicator variable. This indicator captures markets where HMO

markets are highly concentrated and hospital markets are highly competitive: we assign a value

of 1 to markets where the average HMO concentration across all years is high (HMO HHI is

above 0.32, representing upper 50th percentile of HMO Herfindahl distribution) and the average

hospital concentration is low (Hospital HHI is below 0.32, roughly lower quartile of hospital

HHI distribution).9 Using these criteria, 8 percent of the hospitals fall into this category. We

augment model (1) by adding this indicator as well as its interaction with overall HMO

penetration and backlash dummy. Results on the key variables are presented in Table 4. We

find that in the backlash period location of a hospital in dominant HMO market matters.10 In

particular, hospital cost and revenue growth is slower in dominant HMO markets than in other

markets by 4-7 percent.

           Results on HMO For-Profit Share. The regressions on the overall sample suggest that,

on average, increase in the share of for-profit HMO does not affect the change in hospital cost or

revenue (first column, Table 2). However, there is differential FP effect by levels of HMO

penetration. In the low HMO penetration markets, there is no statistically significant relationship

in the expansion period. However, in the backlash period, an increase in for-profit share of

    Notice that because the dominant market indicator is time-invariant, the main effects drop out of the model.


                                                                                                                   16
HMO by 0.1 (i.e., 10 percentage points) leads to 0.5 percent reduction in cost or revenue holding

all else equal (second column, Table 2). By contrast, in high HMO penetration markets, the

effect of for-profit HMO persists throughout the entire 1994-2005 period. Specifically, a 10

percentage point increase in for-profit share of HMO plans leads to a reduction in cost by about

0.9 percent and a reduction in revenue by 1.1 percent (these effects are significant at the 0.05

level).

          Study limitations. One concern with this type of analysis is that the relationship

between HMO market characteristics and hospital costs and revenues performance might be

endogenously related. That is, HMO plans might selectively enter markets where they see the

biggest bargaining advantage (for example, high-cost provider markets). Previous studies used

labor market characteristics as instruments for cross-sectional variations in HMO penetration

(Baker 1997, Shen and Melnick 2007). In this study we use fixed-effects models to remove

potential bias from time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity across MSA and hospital markets.

In previous work, we found that the fixed-effects approach produced similar results as the

instrumental-variable approach for the coefficients on managed care penetration. However, there

are currently no published instruments for HMO concentration and for-profit shares beyond

what’s available to instrument for overall HMO penetration rates, and it is possible that time-

varying omitted changes in concentration and FP shares can be endogenous to cost and revenue

growth.

          Another potential limitation to this study is that the panel data do not include measures

for PPOs and as such we analyze HMO markets instead of the more general managed care

markets. Given that HMO is known to have the most aggressive bargaining practices, our

estimates of the for-profit and penetration effects can be viewed as the upper bound of their




                                                                                                      17
effects on hospital.



                                 5. Discussions and Conclusions

       In this study, we examine the effects of three aspects of HMO market structure (HMO

penetration, HMO concentration, and for-profit HMO ownership) on hospital costs and revenues

between the HMO expansion and backlash periods. We find that all three dimensions have

independent effects on hospital cost and revenue growth. Among the three measures, HMO

penetration has the strongest effect on hospital costs and revenue. We find that both the change

and the level of HMO enrollment matter. In the HMO expansion period, a 10 percentage point

increase in HMO enrollment lead to an approximate 2.5 percent decrease in cost and revenue. In

the backlash period where enrollment declined, a 10 percentage point HMO loss in enrollment

led to a smaller, 1.1 percent increase in cost and 0.4 percent in revenue. The results are

consistent with previous work (Gaskin and Hadley 1997, Shen and Melnick 2007).

       Furthermore, we provide some evidence that the weakening cost and revenue

containment effect in the backlash period can be attributed to both dis-enrollment from HMOs to

other, possibly more expensive products, and a weakening of the HMO cost containment effect

as a result of HMO product changes. The fact that hospitals in HMO markets that maintain

stable enrollment in the backlash period still rebounded their cost and revenue growth suggest

that HMOs are loosening their cost containment strategies. In the backlash market, enrollees

switching out of HMO plans have contributed to the observed cost increase in the 2000-2005

period. However, this effect is smaller than the reverse HMO enrollment expansion effect in

earlier years. This finding is consistent with the possibilities that (1) FFS plans are also adopting




                                                                                                  18
some cost containment strategies these days, so that switching back to FFS means less cost

growth; or that (2) there is still some spill-over effect across different types of health plans.

       The rise and decline in HMO concentration is not directly associated with hospital cost

and revenue performance and is consistent with previous literature (Younis, et al 2005). We

probed the possibility that there might be a threshold effect of HMO concentration and found

that hospitals in more competitive hospital markets located in highly concentrated HMO markets

experienced slower cost and revenue growth than hospitals in other markets. This finding

suggests that health plans that have a critical mass of concentration and face a less competitive

provider markets may exert greater leverage over providers.

       We find evidence that for-profit plans are still more aggressive in pursuing cost saving

strategies relative to not-for-profit plans, especially in markets with high overall HMO

penetration. The economic magnitude, however, is relatively small compared to the effect of

HMO penetration. In addition, the for-profit effect did not materialize until backlash period for

low penetration markets. We suspect that the for-profit HMO effect might be entangled with the

changing landscape in hospital market competition. After 2000, hospitals in low HMO markets

experience a small but noticeable decline in market power (the average HHI is still higher than

that in high HMO markets). As a result, for-profit health plans in low HMO markets might be

able to take advantage of the more competitive hospital markets in the backlash period.

       Since 2000, health care spending has accelerated again after a decade of moderate

growth. Can we still rely on HMO, and more generally the managed care industry, to keep

spending under control? It is clear that HMOs has played a significant role in slowing down

health care spending growth during its expansion period, and has lost its grip in the backlash

period due to dis-enrollment and changes in their approach to control cost. Such change in




                                                                                                    19
managed care industry might be welcome if it is accompanied by higher patient satisfaction and

quality of care. There is no evidence to suggest either way. A natural extension of this work

would be to examine other aspects of patient care to provide a more comprehensive picture.

However, without reversing their product nature back to the expansion period, we would need to

look for other ways to achieve the cost control. We also establish that the managed care’s

countervailing power and ownership are important and future work examining such bargaining

needs to focus on the interactions between health plan and provider market structures. Given

that health insurance market consolidations and changing ownership are still occurring, more

work is needed to understand the consequences of such market re-structuring on other aspects of

the provider markets.
