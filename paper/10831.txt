Why Do Computers Depreciate?

                                            ABSTRACT

The value of installed computers falls rapidly and therefore computers have a very high user cost.
The paper provides a complete account of the non-financial user cost of personal computers –
decomposing it into replacement cost change, obsolescence, instantaneous depreciation, and age-
related depreciation. The paper uses data on the resale price of computers and a hedonic price index
for new computers to achieve this decomposition. Once obsolescence is taken into account, age-
related depreciation – which is often identified as deterioration – is estimated to be negligible. While
the majority of the loss in value of used computers comes from declines in replacement cost, this
paper shows the second most important source of decline in value is obsolescence. Obsolescence is
accelerated by the decline in replacement cost of computers. Cheaper computing power drives
developments in software and networks that make older computers less productive even though their
original functionality remains intact.

Personal computers rapidly lose economic value. Within two years after purchase, the price of a

used computer falls to one-third of its price when new. This rapid loss in value occurs even

though the two-year-old computer can do exactly the same computations it did when it was new

and suffers only small changes in reliability, physical appearance, or in other observable

attributes. The two-year-old computer can typically produce the same documents, run the same

regressions, and connect to the same server as it did when new. Hence, by most measures, it can

produce the same output. Thus, economic depreciation takes place with little or no physical

deterioration or loss of productive capacity.

       The general source of this economic depreciation is not a puzzle. New computer models

are typically both cheaper and more powerful than older ones. Hence, the value of old

computers falls to bring the value of the computing power they can deliver in line with its current

replacement cost. Computers also become obsolete because they become incompatible with new

operating systems or software, or do not have hardware that becomes standard in new models

(e.g., CD readers, Internet adapters).

       Though the economics of depreciation of computers is relatively clear, there are

substantial gaps in measuring this phenomenon. Specifically, we know of no research that

explicitly links new and used personal computer prices to measure depreciation rather than

presuming a rate of depreciation from the change in prices of new computers.1 The estimates of

  Oliner’s (1992, 1993) important work on computer depreciation focuses on mainframe
computers and computer peripheral equipment. Berndt and Griliches (1993) use hedonic price
regressions based on new PCs only. Since this paper was presented at the conference in 2003,

depreciation of computers in the National Income and Product are based, for example, on

changes in the price of new computers. In this paper, we estimate directly the change in value of

personal computers by comparing the price of used computers to the price of the same computer

when new. Our data set links new and used prices of several thousand computers, the years sold

when new and used, the age, and a precise description of important characteristics. The richness

of our data allows us to overcome a common problem in the measurement of depreciation—that

the effects of vintage, age, and time are typically not separately identified. [See Hall (1968),

Hulten (no date).] The method of this paper extends the procedure of Ramey and Shapiro

(2001), which estimated such changes in value of used equipment as a function of age and

measures of flexibility of the equipment in alternative uses, by including measures of the

obsolescence of the used equipment. This paper also presents estimates of a hedonic price index

of new computers that is an important ingredient in the calculation of depreciation and user cost.

       Precise measurement of the change in value of existing computers, as well as a precise

decomposition of its sources, is important for addressing several economic issues. First,

depreciation estimates are a necessary ingredient in the measurement of the value of the capital

stock. Personal computers have become an increasing fraction of both business and household

capital. As measures of depreciation are important for estimating the net value of capital, our

estimates should be useful for this purpose.

       Second, it is important to understand the change in value of computers to understand

investment in new computers. The user cost of computers is among the highest for any type of

equipment because of the rapid fall in replacement cost and the high rate of economic

depreciation. For investment to be positive, computers must have very high marginal products to


data source as used in this research. Wykoff (2003) presents estimates of obsolescence of laptop



                                                 2
balance the high cost of owning them. That is, computers are purchased with the knowledge that

investment in them will have to be amortized over a short period of years. This paper will

provide a decomposition of the user cost of computers into change in replacement cost and

economic depreciation, with economic depreciation decomposed into age-related deterioration

and into obsolescence.

       Third, to calculate an index of capital services for total factor productivity measurement,

it is necessary to have a reliable estimate of the user cost of the various types of capitals

(Jorgenson and Griliches, 1967). Given the importance of information technology investment in

the recent acceleration in total factor productivity, having a good estimate of the user cost of

computers can make an important contribution to measuring the pace of technological change.

       Fourth, the estimates of the impact of obsolescence on the value of installed capital can

provide valuable insights into the propagation and effects of new technologies. Our results

suggest that part of the estimated rate of obsolescence is directly related to the decline in the

hardware prices. Thus, the estimates imply that a slowdown in the rate of technological progress

would reduce the depreciation rate on used computers.

       The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 1 sketches our theoretical

framework. Section 2 discusses our data. Section 3 outlines our empirical implementation.

Section 4 presents the estimation results. Section 5 presents their implication for user cost.

Section 6 gives our conclusions.

1.     Theoretical Framework

The work of Hall and Jorgenson (1967) on user cost and the work of Hall (1968, 1971), Hulten

and Wykoff (1981, 1996)), Oliner (1993), Jorgenson (1996) and others on depreciation provides

the framework for this analysis. Consider first the definition of user cost,

                                        R K ≡ P I (r + δ − π I ) ,                                  (1)

where P I is the constant-quality price of new investment goods in period t, r denotes the nominal

opportunity cost of funds, δ is the depreciation rate, and π I is the rate of change of P I . The

user cost relationship is derived from an intertemporal arbitrage between purchasing new

equipment currently versus purchasing new equipment in the future, in which the capital stock

evolves according to K = I − δ K where I is gross investment.2 Absent adjustment costs, the

marginal product of having a unit of capital installed at time t should equal the user cost, that is,

the sum of the opportunity costs of funds, the economic depreciation, and the capital loss from

selling the equipment in the future.

       This paper will use a second arbitrage, between new and used equipment, to quantify the

economic depreciation component of user cost. Specifically, the paper will use the wedge

between the new and used price of the same computer to quantify economic depreciation.

Consider, qtNOM
            ,t − v , nominal ratio of used to new computer prices,



                                                         PtU,t −v
                                              ,t − v ≡
                                            qtNOM                   ,                               (2)
                                                         Pt −Nv

  This equation may be derived from a continuous time dynamic optimization problem. It can
also be viewed as an approximation from a discrete time problem. In the case of computers,
though, the rates δ and π are so large that the approximation is not very good.

where PtU,t −v is the price of a used piece of equipment at time t that was new at time t-v and Pt −Nv is

the price of the equipment when it was new. Note that in our analysis, the prices refer to a

specific piece of equipment, not to a price index.

        What makes qtNOM
                     ,t − v deviate from unity? Suppose that the only change in the environment



were the change in the replacement cost of new equipment. That is, suppose that the same piece

of equipment were available at time t as at time t-v and there were no technological change

except for potentially a change in the cost of the new equipment. (In the computer example, this

would correspond to a decline in the price of a CPU or RAM of a given quality.) Moreover,

suppose that the used piece of equipment suffered no deterioration whatsoever, and that there

were no costs of adjustment, installation, or resale. In this case, contemporaneous arbitrage

would require that the price of the used computer fall by the amount that replacement cost had

                                                                                                PtU,t −v       Pt N
declined. That is, with no economic depreciation, q                               NOM
                                                                                 t ,t − v   ≡              =          . In practice, we do not
                                                                                                Pt −Nv         Pt −Nv

typically observe Pt N , the current price of the new good, and instead substitute the constant-

quality new (replacement) investment good price index Pt I . Hence, if there is no economic

                          PtU,t −v       Pt I
                                                                                                           t

depreciation qtNOM                   =           ≡ exp(π tI,t −v ) . Note that π tI,t −v = ∫ π I ( s )ds denotes the

cost formula (1).

        To create a variable that adjusts for this change in the price of new goods, define q as

                                                                                  ,t − v exp( −π t ,t − v ) .
                                                                                                  I
                                                                                                                                             (3)
                                                  P  t −v




                                                                          5
Under the special circumstances just outlined, qt,t-v would be equal to one and user cost would

come only from the change in replacement cost.

         Now consider the more general case, where new and used equipment are not perfect

substitutes because of economic depreciation. The variable q measures the fraction of original

real value left, so under the assumption of exponential but not necessarily constant decay, it is

linked to the depreciation rate δ by



                                                qt ,t −v = exp(−δ t ,t −v ) ,                          (4)

                     t
where δ t ,t −v =    ∫ δ (s)ds
                    t −v
                                 and δ(s) is the depreciation rate at instant s. We will decompose


economic depreciation into three components.

         Age-related depreciation or deterioration, denoted δ v , captures the wedge in value

between new and used equipment that is strictly a function of age. It is frequently modeled as a

geometric function of time. We will consider that specification, as well as more general cases.3

         Age-zero depreciation, denoted δ 0 , captures the loss in value the instant that a piece of

equipment is sold. This instantaneous depreciation can arise from lump-sum costs of adjustment,

installation costs, and transactions costs.4 Additionally, it may also represent the discount from

customization, i.e., that a purchaser of a new computer may get to choose its precise

configuration while the buyer of the used computer does not.5



3
  Deterioration may also be a function of intensity of use. Depreciation in use does not appear,
however, to be an important factor for computers, and is not considered in this paper.
4
  Adjustment costs are another reason for q to differ from one. We believe these are well-
captured by the instantaneous depreciation.
5
  The instantaneous depreciation could also represent a lemons discount owing to adverse
selection. As with the case of machine tools (Ramey and Shapiro, 2001), we argue that lemons


                                                             6
       Obsolescence, denoted δ s , represents the change in value of used computers because

they have fallen behind the current technology. Our empirical strategy is to use measures of

obsolescence to quantify δ s . We discuss in detail below how we implement this empirical

strategy.

       We will treat the three components of depreciation as additive in rates of change, so

                                                 δ = δv + δ0 + δs .                                      (5)

Obsolescence is in no sense a residual. The average discount of used relative to new computers

that we cannot account for with observed measures of obsolescence or with age will be counted

as age-zero depreciation.

       Scrappage is another source of user cost. Old computers are often discarded or given

away. Our data set, which contains information on the value of computers that are sold, does not

provide any information about computers that are disposed of by other methods. Since the value

of scrapped computers is zero (or even negative if there is a cost of disposal), our estimates will

not account for the entire user cost of the computers. Our discussant Daniel Sichel makes this

point clearly, and we agree with it. Dunn, Doms, Oliner, and Sichel (2004) use the same data as

used in this study, together with parametric assumptions about scrappage rate, in order to account

for this important component of user cost.

       We can combine equations (3), (4), and (5) to characterize the decomposition of the

components of nominal q as
                                       t                         t

that is, q equals cumulative economic depreciation. The use of the contemporaneous arbitrage

between new and used prices to quantify depreciation in (6) provides a link to the intertemporal

arbitrage in the user cost relationship (1).

        It is important to emphasize that technological change can impact user cost through two

very different channels. First, technological changes can make new capital goods cheaper over

time. This first channel for technological change is captured by π I in the user cost expression.

When the price of replacement investment goods is falling, this channel adds substantially to

user cost even if there is no deterioration or obsolescence.

        Second, technological change can lead to obsolescence of old capital by making new

capital goods better over time. This change does not directly reduce the intrinsic productivity of

existing capital; it can still perform its previous functions (e.g., a steam locomotive can still pull

a train in the age of diesel). Nonetheless, technological progress can make existing capital

obsolete. There are three separate effects within this channel. First, new capital might perform

the same tasks faster, better, or with less labor input. Second, the new capital may be able to

work with complementary inputs, such as software, in a manner that is impossible for the old

capital. Third, the new capital may have better network abilities, such as sharing documents,

exchanging data, and connecting to the Internet. All three of these effects are potentially

important for computers. The IBM AT computer that this paper might have been written with 15

years ago would have gotten the job done almost as well as the Pentium IV laptop. Certainly, the

current statistical software and word processing software is easier to use and runs faster, but the

15-year-old technology would have sufficed to get the job done, presumably with no effect on


and because the rare lemon is easy to detect.
                                                                 8
the quality of the analysis or quality of the writing. Using the 15-year-old technology to write

this paper now would, however, be considerably more difficult. Media for storing and

transferring data have changed. Old software does not work with new printers. The old

computer cannot run new software, and new software might have been necessary to read a

dataset. Hence, even though the old AT could have once performed the task and is still

physically operational, i.e., has not depreciated physically, its productivity has declined. As

technology evolves, a serviceable old technology becomes unproductive as the network and

infrastructure for operating it vanish.6

         Obsolescence as a result of technological change is not well modeled either as physical

deterioration or as a reduction in the price of new computers owing to the decline in production

costs of delivering computing power. One of the main goals of this paper is to measure this type

of obsolescence and to quantify its role in the user cost of computers.



2.       Data

The data consist of information on used computers gathered from the Orion Computer Blue

Books. The Orion Research Corporation has been publishing used pricing guides for a wide

range of consumer products since 1973. The products covered by the guides include

audio/visual equipment, cameras, musical instruments, copiers, vintage collectibles, and

televisions. They have been publishing their computer price guide quarterly since 1982. The

Orion Blue Books are currently used by retail dealers, insurance companies, computer

manufacturers (including Dell, Gateway, and Micron), and the Internal Revenue Service to

provide an accurate reflection of the used computer market.

       Orion determines used computer prices through surveys given to used computer dealers

nationwide. Dealers are asked to provide the asking price, selling price, and days the computer

was in stock before it was sold. The used price listed in the book is the average price of a

computer that was sold in less than 30 days. Computers which were sold after being on the

market for longer periods did not have their selling prices included in this computation. The

Orion Blue Books also include a retail price (price when new) of the used computers listed in the

book. Using computer company advertisements in back issues of PC Magazine and PC World

we were able to determine that the retail price listed reflects the new price of the computer

approximately nine months to one year after the model was first introduced. The range of dates

the specific computer model was manufactured is also given, as are the specific attributes of the

model, including monitor type and size (if one was included in the purchase price of the

computer), speed, amount of random access memory (RAM), hard drive storage space, type of

hard drive, type and speed of CD-ROM or DVD-ROM, Ethernet card or modem, and type of

processor (Pentium, Celeron, 286, AMD Athelon, etc.). They include prices from nearly 700

manufacturers, including all major computer companies.

       We limit our analysis to Compaq and Gateway computers. Many manufacturer listings in

the blue books were inconsistent from year to year in which models were included in the pricing,

making analysis of the same model’s used price over a long period of time difficult. This

problem was encountered for many major computer manufacturers listings, including IBM and

Dell. Compaq and Gateway have a thorough listing of prices across numerous models and over

a long time period, making it well suited for our analysis.

       We coded the attributes of the computer available from the blue books. These include the

dates the model was sold, the new price, the used price, and some characteristics of the




                                                10
computer. These include the amount of RAM, the size of the hard drive, the speed of the CPU,

the type of CPU, the speed of the CD drive (if any), and the make. After deleting computer

models with missing data, we have 3,112 observations. Some models are observed in several

years; we have observations on 1,170 distinct models. We observe used prices in years from

1990 to 2001 (excluding 1991 and 1994, years for which we could not obtain the source data).

The computers we observe were produced between 1984 and 2001. The computers range in

price when new from a minimum of $499 to a maximum of $32,880. The median new price of a

computer was $2,490. Used prices range from $7 to $14,140. The median used price is $333.

The computers ranged in speed from 8 to 933 megahertz (MHz), with the median computer

having a 100 MHz processor. Random access memory (RAM) varies from 512 kilobytes (KB)

to 256 megabytes (MB), with a median of 16 MB. Hard drive space ranged from 1 to 40

gigabytes (GB). The median size 1 GB. We exclude diskless machines from the sample.

         These data are summarized in Tables 1, 2 and 3. Table 1 shows the attributes by year

when the computer was new. Several aspects are noteworthy. The rate of quality improvement

in computers is striking. From 1984 to 2001 (with adjustments for 2001 where the medians are

affected by the small numbers of computers produced in 2001 and resold in the same year), the

median RAM in our sample rose 250 times, the median speed rose 87 times and the median hard

drive capacity rose 1000 times. At the same time, the median price fell 72 percent.

Interestingly, median prices rose during the 1980s, and then started plummeting during the

1990s. The speed up in technological progress during the late 1990s is also evident from the

table.

         Tables 2 and 3 show the data from the vantage point of when the computer was sold.

Table 2 shows the attributes by the year that it was sold. The values for q (the ratio of used to




                                                 11
new price, adjusted for the change in the price of new computers) show that in most years, the

average computer sold used had lost close to 70 percent of its value. (See Appendix Table 1 for

averages.) Table 3 shows the attributes by the age when it was sold. One-year old computers lost

34 percent of their real value on average and two-year old computers lost 42 percent of their

value, as shown by the values of q in the last column.



3.     Empirical Framework

3.1.   Hedonic model for new computer prices

For goods such as computers, where the quality of new goods is changing rapidly, much of the

decline in the resale price of existing capital derives from competition with new models that are

both better, and possibly cheaper, than the older models. This environment does not alter

conceptually the user cost framework, but it does provide a substantial measurement challenge.

A constant quality, e.g. hedonic, price index can be used to adjust the acquisition price of a used

computer to make it comparable to a new computer.

       While not the focus of the paper, we use our data set to estimate a hedonic model of new

computer prices. We regress the log of new computer prices, log( Pt −Nv ) , on a constant, year

dummies, and attributes to measure the quality. These attributes include the log of the CPU

speed, the log of the size of the hard disk drive, the log of the size of the random access memory

(RAM), a dummy for whether the computer has a CD drive, a dummy for whether the computer

is made by Compaq, and a set of dummies for six generations of CPU (Intel 80286, 80386,

80486, Pentium I, Pentium II (and non-Intel competitors AMD K-6, Celeron, Duron, Cyris), and

Pentium III or IV or AMD Athelon).




                                                 12
             We experimented with allowing the prices of the attributes to vary with time as

recommended by Pakes (2003). The estimates (fitted values) were extremely noisy. (Estimation

error is also given substantial attention by Pakes.) Our data set is not designed for estimating

hedonic models along lines Pakes suggests, i.e., it is relatively small and not designed explicitly

so that competing models of different attributes are marketed simultaneously, so it is not a good

test bed for Pakes’s recommended procedure. Therefore, we use time-dummy estimates, which a

recent National Academy panel has labeled as Griliches-neutral (see Schultze and Mackie, 2002,

p. 151).

             Table 4 reports the estimates of the hedonic equation for new computer prices. Even this

simple model explains two-thirds of the variance of the log of price. The year dummies show a

sharp and relatively steady rate of decline in prices.



3.2.         Modeling depreciation

The estimation equation we consider follows from taking logarithms of both sides of equation (6)

or (6’) and then considering alternative functional forms for the various components of

depreciation. Noting that cumulative change in constant value replacement cost is
 t

 ∫π        ( s )ds = log( Pt I / Pt −I v ) , the basic equation is
       I

t −v


                                                                              t
                                log(qt ,t −v ) = log( Pt / P ) −           ∫ (δ       ( s ) + δ v ( s ) + δ s ( s))ds
                                       NOM               I          I
                                                                  t −v            0                                     (7)
                                                                          t −v



or
                                                              t
                                         log(qt ,t −v ) = − ∫ (δ 0 ( s ) + δ v ( s ) + δ s ( s ))ds                     (7’)
                                                             t −v




                                                                         13
where log(qt ,t −v ) = log( PtU / Pt −Nv ) − log( Pt I / Pt −I v ) . Recall that the used and new prices, PtU and

Pt −Nv , are specific to a particular observation, while the constant-quality price index Pt I is either a

function of time only (in the case of the BEA index) or of time and attributes of the computer (in

the case of our hedonic index). We will estimate relationship (7) or (7’) over our sample of

computers.

         We observe the same computer models at two points in time, so our data have a panel

structure. Note, however, that the theoretically-mandated specification above takes the

difference (used versus new price) as the dependent variable rather than differencing an

expression in the level of price, so the coefficients of time-invariant parameters (such as

characteristics of the computer) are identified, and time-invariant unobserved effects of the

computer remain in the disturbances. These disturbances are implicit in the integrals of the

components of depreciation in the expressions above. They will be made explicit in what

follows. Though we observe different computers at different points in time, our econometric

specification is a cross-section of changes of price from new to used because we do not follow

particular computers at more than two points in time.7

         The following subsections consider alternative parameterizations of the economic

depreciation function.




7
  For many models, we observe linked new/used prices at different dates when the used computer
was sold. In our econometric specifications, it is reasonable to assume that these observations
within model are correlated across time. Accordingly, we correct standard errors in our
regression estimates for clustering by model.


                                                         14
3.3.1. Age-related depreciation

To model age-related depreciation, we consider several functional forms for how the value of

qt ,t −v depends on the age of the computer. In the most general formulation, we allow

depreciation to be a general function of the age v of the computer. To do so, consider the

relationship

                                                          V −1
                                    log(qt ,t −v ) = α 0 + ∑ α v D v + ε                     (8)
                                                           v =1



where α 0 is instantaneous (time-zero) depreciation, α v is the cumulative age-related

depreciation as of age v, and D v are dummies that equal one for observations with age v and zero

otherwise, and V is the maximum age of a piece of equipment in our sample. The variable ε is a

mean zero, idiosyncratic disturbance. The α’s in this regression correspond in most cases to the

negative of the δ’s in the depreciation model of the theoretical section.

       In the estimates, we consider a different formulation. Let Dv be a dummy variable that

equals one for a piece of equipment of age v or greater and zero otherwise. We will estimate the

relationship

                                                           V
                                    log(qt ,t −v ) = α 0 + ∑ α v Dv + ε                        (9)
                                                          v=2



where the α v are the annual rates of depreciation between ages v-1 and v. Note that equation (9)

fits the data identically to equation (8), but is easier to compare with annual estimates of

depreciation. There are a few observations in our sample where the year when new is the same

as the year when sold. We have coded these as one-year old pieces of equipment, so that age 1

depreciation is not separately identified from the α 0




                                                     15
        We also consider the restriction that the annual rate of depreciation is constant or a

polynomial function of age. Specifically, we estimate

                                                          K
                                    log(qt ,t −v ) = α 0 + ∑ α k v k + ε                          (10)
                                                         k =1



where K is the order of the polynomial, v k is the kth power of age, and α k are parameters. With

K equal to one, we have standard case of constant geometric depreciation, i.e., that the

coefficients α v in equation (8) are equal. This specification identifies age-related depreciation

for all ages.



3.3.2. Obsolescence

We then generalize equations (8) and (9) to allow for shifters of the discount for used capital

relative to new capital. Ramey and Shapiro (2001) emphasize how specificity of capital can lead

to such discounts over and above physical depreciation. Personal computers are highly fungible

across industry and activity, so these considerations seem very unlikely to be relevant.

Computers may, however, be less fungible over time. As discussed in the introduction,

computers can lose productivity because of changes in technology. This reduction in

productivity relates not to the physical operation of the computer, but to its interoperability with

other computers or with current software. Even before the Internet, such network economies

related to common software, media, and data formats drove much of the value of computers.

        Increasing incompatibility with the current state of technology is a source of

obsolescence and therefore of user cost that is not well modeled either as physical deterioration

or as a reduction in the price of new computers owing to the decline in production costs of

delivering computing power. This paper will attempt to measure obsolescence and quantify its

role in the user cost of computers. Specifically, we augment equation (9) or (10) as


                                                    16
                                  log(qt ,t −v ) = f (age) + X ′β + ε                          (11)

where f(age) is the dummy-variable or polynomial function of age discussed above, X is a vector

of indicators of obsolescence, β is a vector of parameters to be estimated.

       To indicate obsolescence, we consider how the attributes of the used computer—the

speed of its CPU, the amount of its RAM, and the size of its hard disk—stand in relationship to

attributes of current new computers. Again, current software and operating systems are designed

to make use of power and capacity of current new computers. Often, the owner of an older

computer does not have the choice of running new software. The decline of replacement cost of

hardware helps drive the development of new software. Incompatibilities with such new

software accelerate the obsolescence of older computers.

       The specific measures we consider are the deviation of the logarithm of the computer’s

speed, RAM, or disk size from the median log speed, RAM, or disk size of current new

computers. We also consider a composite of these measures, defined as a weighted sum, where

the weights are the coefficients of the attributes in a hedonic regression of new computer prices.

The estimates of these hedonic coefficients are given in Table 4.

       Table 5 reports the mean values of these measures of obsolescence by year sold and age

when sold.8 Table 5 shows how rapidly attributes of computers get out of date. At an age of one

year, the RAM of a used computer is 48 percent that below the median RAM of a new computer,


8
  We have few observations on new computers produced in 2001 because very few were resold
within the year. The median RAM of the 2001 computers that we observe actually fell from
2000. For this calculation only, we recode the median RAM in 2001 to equal 128MB, the same
value as in 2000. For all earlier years, there are sufficient observations of new computers in our
sample to get reliable estimates. Note that the observations of new computers are perhaps not a
representative sample. To get into the sample as a new computer, the computer must have a
resale price. If prices of computers for which there is a secondary market differs systematically
from the representative new computer, this feature of the data set leads to a potential source of
bias.


                                                  17
its speed is 36 percent slower, and its hard disk is 52 percent smaller. The value metric of the

composite attribute shows a 33 percent decline. For older ages, the decline is rapid and

continues for all but the oldest ages.

        The other measure of distance of the used computer from the current technological

frontier is how many generations its CPU is behind the generation of the best CPU available in

new computers. We classify CPUs according to the six generations discussed above in the

specification of the hedonic model. The last column of Table 5 reports the average number of

generations a used computer is behind the frontier by year sold and by age. There is an upward

trend in number of generations the CPU is behind with year sold. In earlier years, there are

fewer generations of CPUs available. With age sold, the number of generations behind increases

from just under one on average for one-year old computers to four generations for the oldest

ones.



4.      Estimates of Depreciation

In this section we present estimates of the depreciation of personal computers based on

estimating how resale price falls as a function of the age of the computer [equations (9) and (10)]

and how this function shifts when the controls for obsolescence are included [equation (11)].



4.1.    Age-related depreciation

Table 6 reports estimates of age-related depreciation for the dummy variable specification (9)

and the polynomial specification (10). The left-hand side variable is logarithm of nominal q.

The right-hand side variables include the change in the new price index. In columns (1) through

(6), the coefficient of the price index is constrained to equal 1, so the regressions have implicitly




                                                 18
the log of q on the left-hand side and no price variable on the right-hand side. The last two

columns relax this restriction.

       Table 6 present estimates using two measures of the price of new computers, the Bureau

of Economic Analysis (BEA) deflator for computers, denoted Pt BEA , and the hedonic price index

reported in Table 4, denoted Pt HED . The index Pt BEA is a function only of year, while Pt HED is a

function of year and the attributes of the computer included in the hedonic equation, so it is more

closely matched to the specific computers in our sample than the BEA index.

       The first column of Table 6 reports the age-dummy estimates of age-related depreciation

using the BEA deflator to measure price change on new computers. All specifications also

include a dummy variable that is one if the used computer is sold without a CRT. The CRT

represents a substantial—approximately one-quarter—fraction of the value.9

       The constant of –0.280 indicates instantaneous depreciation of more then 28 percent.

Depreciation is 29 percent in year 2, 26 percent in year three, 9 percent in year 4, and 19 percent

in year five. (These rates are measured a log differences. In Tables 8 through 10, we convert the

estimates to levels and compute percent changes.) Later years have lower rates on average and

they are more variable. Though the restriction that the annual rates of depreciation are equal,

which is imposed in column (2), is rejected at any standard level of statistical significance, there

is only a negligible reduction in R2 from imposing the restriction. Allowing a quadratic term in

column (3) yields a significant coefficient, but adds only modestly to the goodness of fit. The

annual rate of depreciation of 24 percent is very high—much higher than is plausible for physical



9
 The value of the CRT enters multiplicatively in the specification. An alternative would be to
enter it additively, though that would be more awkward econometrically. We do not know
anything about the quality or value of the original CRT. Our specification assumes that is varies
proportionately with the value of the computer.


                                                  19
deterioration. Together with the constant of 41 percent, these estimates fit the facts that

computers loss over half their value over the first two years of their lives.

          The estimates in columns (4), (5), and (6) based on our hedonic price index yield similar

patterns of age-related depreciation, but point estimates that correspond to about half the annual

rate of depreciation.10 The average geometric rate of depreciation is 13 percent based on the

estimates with our hedonic price index, which, though lower than the estimates based on the

BEA price index, is still very high relative to our priors about the deterioration of computers.

          The last two columns present an informal specification check. We relax the restriction

that the coefficient is one for each of the measures of new computer price change. For the BEA

index, the unrestricted coefficient jumps to nearly one and a half with a substantial downward

effect on the annual rate of depreciation. (With a bigger coefficient on price change, which

increases with age, the coefficient of age takes on a lower value.) Though the coefficient of

price change differs from one when price change is measured with our hedonic index in column

(8), it is much closer to one. Consequently, the annual rate of depreciation is affected less. We

use our hedonic price index in the remainder of our estimation. We will return to the

specification test based on inclusion of the price index in the estimation equation once we have

considered the measures of obsolescence.



4.2.      Obsolescence

As discussed above, an advantage of our data set is its rich detail about the characteristics of the

computers sold. By including measures of computer characteristics in our specifications, we can

separate the effects of age, time, and obsolescence. We explore the effect of several measures of



10
     The R2 falls because the implicit left-hand side variable is more variable.


                                                   20
obsolescence of personal computers on the discounts of used computers relative to their reflated

acquisition cost. These results are reported in Table 7. The first column of Table 7 includes the

quadratic in age specification from Table 6, Column (6), for reference.



4.2.1. Obsolescence of attributes

Columns (2) and (3) of Table 7 present estimates for the determination of depreciation for used

computers by age and by these measures of obsolescence, as measured as deviation of the

attribute of the computer from the median new computer at the time when it was sold used (see

above). Column (2) includes the speed, RAM, and hard disk measures separately. Column (3)

includes the composite measure based on the weighted sum of the three separate measures. In

column (2), the obsolescence measures based on the individual attributes have jointly significant

incremental explanatory power and, except for RAM, are individually statistically significant.

The obsolescence of the attributes has negative effects on depreciation. The effects of

obsolescence can be quantitatively significant. For example, having a CPU that is half the

median speed lowers the value of the used computer by 19 percent all other things equal.

       Imposing the restriction that these measures enter as the weighted sum in column (3) has

only a negligible effect on the fit. The estimated effect of obsolescence on depreciation is

substantial. The average two-year old computer has a composite obsolescence of 0.61, that is,

the hedonic value of the hard disk/speed/RAM bundle has fallen by 61 percent (see Table 5).

Multiplying this amount by the coefficient of –0.538 yields a predicted depreciation from

obsolescence of 33 percent.

       Controlling for these measures of obsolescence has a substantial effect on the estimates

of the age-related depreciation, whether entered individually in column (2) or as a composite in




                                                21
column (3). Age-related depreciation is estimated to be small and insignificant. Hence,

controlling for obsolescence essentially eliminates the age-related component of depreciation.



4.2.2. Distance of Used CPU from Frontier

We construct a variable CPU lag that indicates how many generations the computer’s CPU is

behind the frontier. If the computer has the latest CPU, then this variable is equal to 0. The

number of generations the CPU is behind the frontier is broadly a measure of incompatibility of

an existing computer with current software and operating systems.

       Table 7, Column (4) reports estimates for CPU lag entered as dummy variables for

lagging one to four generations. The zero lag is the omitted category; there are no computers in

our sample sold with a lag of five generation. This set of variables has more explanatory power

than the measures of attributes. A lag of one has little effect on value, a lag of two reduces it by

almost half, and a lag of three or four eliminates most of value.

       Columns (5) and (6) of Table 7 present estimates where both CPU lag and the measures

of obsolescence of the CPU speed, RAM, and hard disk are included as explanatory variables.

Though the speed variable remains significant, as does the composite attribute, these variables

add little to the explanatory power of the CPU lag dummies. The coefficient of RAM has the

“wrong” sign, but given its interaction with other factors such as CPU generation, this coefficient

should not be overinterpreted.



4.3.   Specification test

Recall that in last two columns of Table 6, when the restriction that the new price change has a

unit coefficient is relaxed, the restriction is rejected. If the measures of age and obsolescence are




                                                 22
correctly accounting for depreciation, then the new price change should have unit effect on the

nominal used/new price ratio. Table 7, Column (7) reports an estimate that allows us to test this

restriction. When the coefficient of log ( Pt HED Pt −HED
                                                       v ) is freely estimated, it is 0.871, with a



standard error of 0.05, close to the theoretically mandated value of one. Hence, the attributes we

include in the equation are appropriately controlling for change in value insofar as they are

correlated with the change in replacement cost measured by the deflator.



4.4.     Age-related depreciation revisited

Once obsolescence is taken into account, age-related depreciation of personal computers is

negligible. In contrast, when obsolescence is not controlled for, age-related depreciation is

substantial. Given that the physical deterioration and failure rates of computers are very small,

our finding of low rates of age-related depreciation once obsolescence is controlled for brings the

econometric estimates in line with what one would expect. The results also demonstrate the risk

of estimating depreciation from age alone, and then identifying that estimate with loss of

productive efficiency. Computers lose value long before they become unable to do the tasks for

which they were designed.

         Even controlling for obsolescence, computers have a substantial instantaneous

depreciation of about one quarter of their value. We attribute this instantaneous depreciation to

installation and resale costs, and the value of customizing a new system to the specifications of a

4.5.   Premia for oldest computers

Though there are powerful factors pushing down the price of used computers, there are aspects

of our results that older is not uniformly less valuable. First, the quadratic term in age-related

depreciation is positive, so the rate of depreciation falls with age. In the next section, we will see

that the quadratic term indeed dominates the negative linear term for the older vintages. Second,

the coefficient of the CPU generation for lagging four generations is about the same as those

lagging three generations. Hence, for surviving older models, there are factors pushing against

deterioration and obsolescence that add to value. Ramey and Shapiro (2001) found similarly that

there was a premium for some very old machine tools that were no longer manufactured. This

finding could be accounted for by survivorship bias in these very old models or the value of

being able to run older applications.



5.     Decomposing the Decline in Value of Used Computers

Using the estimates from the last section, we can now decompose the decline in computer value

into its key components: (i) the change in price of new computers; (ii) instantaneous

depreciation; (iii) age-related depreciation; and (iv) obsolescence. Specifically, the decline in

value of used computers can be decomposed as

              ,t − v ) − log( Pt
        log(qtNOM                           v ) = log( qt ,t − v ) − π t ,t − v = log( qt ,t − v ) = − (δ 0 + δ v + δ s ) + ε ,
                                 HED
                                     / Pt −HED           NOM            I
                                                                                                                                  (12)

that is, instantaneous depreciation, age-related depreciation, obsolescence, and a residual. Tables

8, 9, and 10 summarize the key findings of the paper through this decomposition of user cost.

For these tables, we convert the variables on the left-hand side and the fitted value on the right-

hand side of equation (12) to levels by exponentiation, compute percent changes for individual

observations, and then average. Tables 8, 9, and 10 then report the average cumulative or



                                                                 24
annualized percent change in value. The average exponentiated values differ from the

exponentiation of the averages because of heterogeneity. The appendix tables give the averages

in terms of logarithms, the units in which equation (12) is estimated.

       Table 8 gives the cumulative and annualized values of the variable by age sold. The

average nominal decline in value for a used computer relative to its nominal acquisition cost in

our sample is 77 percent.11 The decline in replacement cost is 66 percent on average over the

interval between acquisition and sale, or 32 percent per year of age. The decline in q is 41

percent over this interval, or 18 percent per year.12 Hence, the decline in replacement cost

looms very large in the loss in value of used computers.

       The last three columns of Table 8 decompose the q, the discount of used price relative to

new price adjusted for the change in replacement cost. On average, age-related depreciation δ v

is 7 percent cumulatively and 3 percent per year of age. This accords with the prior that

deterioration of computers is negligible. Instantaneous depreciation of 21 percent is substantial,

but is much less than what is found for other capital goods. For example, Ramey and Shapiro

(2001) find that the instantaneous discount for forklifts, the most fungible of the aerospace

equipment they study, was about 40 percent.

       The majority of economic depreciation, 28 percent of value cumulatively or 8 percent per

year of age, is attributable to our observed indicators of obsolescence. Recall that this loss of

value owing to obsolescence of used computers is above and beyond the loss of value because of

11
   The annual rate of decline per year of age is 45 percent. The average cumulative change in
value is –2.19 in logarithms (see Appendix Table A-1). Exp(–2.19) is 0.11, which corresponds
to an 89 percent decline in value. The difference between the 77 percent value in Table 8 and
this value illustrates the importance of taking into heterogeneity in taking averages.
12
   The percent changes in Table 8 are multiplicative and corrected for heterogeneity, so they do
not add up either across columns or down rows. The log changes in the appendix tables are



                                                 25
the decline in the replacement cost of a computer of constant quality, which is controlled for by

         P HED 
the log  t HED  term in equation (12) shown in the third column of Table 8.
         Pt −v 

       Table 8 also shows the user cost decomposition by age sold. Age-related depreciation

depresses value in the first years of the computers life by a modest amount. It accounts for

approximately a 10 percent cumulative decline in value in the first two to three years of life. The

rate of decline in value attributable solely to age then gets smaller. At high age, the quadratic

term dominates, so the age-specific component adds to value. As noted above, this finding can

arise from selectivity or a premium (other things equal) for old models that can operate old

software. Given the thinness of markets for very old computers, the results for the earlier ages

where the linear term dominates are of greater interest and are also more reliable.

       Obsolescence increases substantially with age. The rate of increase, shown in the lower

panel of the table, increases for moderate age, but then levels off. Obsolescence accounts for

most of the decline in q at all ages once instantaneous depreciation is taken into account. This

finding is clearest in the logarithmic results shown in Appendix Table 1, which are additive

across columns and down rows. For example, a five year old computer changes in value by –

0.82 on log scale. Of this, –0.12 owes to age-related depreciation, –0.23 owes to instantaneous

loss of value, and –0.55 owes to obsolescence.13

       Table 9 shows the cumulative components of user cost by year sold. The corresponding

results in logarithms are reported in Appendix Table 2. Our hedonic price index declines on




additive. Note that first three columns in the appendix tables do not add to the last three columns
because of the residual in equation (12) except for the averages.
13
   Note that these figures do not sum to –0.82 because of the residual in equation (12), which
only averages to zero for the whole sample, not for a particular age.


                                                 26
average of 32 percent per year.14 Our estimate bounces around somewhat from year to year.

There is no clear trend in the rate of change of the index. While the estimates of obsolescence

also have a lot of variation from year-to-year, its rate increases somewhat over time. Recall that

the coefficients of the measures of obsolescence are time-invariant, so this increase in

obsolescence with time is coming from the declining relative attributes of used computers.

Given that personal computers were relatively new products at the beginning of our sample, this

pattern is not surprising, and would not be expected to apply to mature products.

       Table 10 takes a closer look at obsolescence by time, age, and CPU generation. The top

panel shows how the increase in obsolescence with age gets more pronounced over time. The

bottom panel shows how obsolescence increases over time within generation of CPU. There is a

distinct pattern of slow aging of CPUs until the next generation is introduced, and then higher

rates of obsolescence within several years of the introduction. The 80286 had experienced

substantial obsolescence at the beginning of the sample. (The 80386 was introduced in the mid-

1980s.) The obsolescence of the 80386 becomes significant in 1993. The 80486 does not

become significantly obsolete until 1998 while the Pentium I becomes significant obsolete one

year later in 1999. We do not discern a pattern of faster or slower obsolescence of computers

over time.



6.     Conclusion

This paper has sought to provide a detailed answer to the question of why computers lose their

economic value so quickly. In order to answer the question, we gathered data on the



14
  The BEA price index for personal consumption of computers declined at an annual rate of 25
percent over the 1990 to 2001 time period. We do not have an explanation of the differences in
these rates.


                                                27
characteristics of over 3,000 computers, including the new and used price, detailed features of

the computer, and age. By linking the ratio of the used and new price of the computer to

observable characteristics, we were able to estimate the key components of the user cost of

computers.

       The typical computer, when it is sold, has experienced about a 77 percent decline in value

compared to its price when new. About half of this decline in value can be accounted for by the

decline in replacement cost of computers of constant quality. That is, even if nothing intrinsic

has happen to the computer, it can be replaced at much lower cost. What accounts for the

remaining decline in the value of this computer? This paper shows that obsolescence accounts

for most of the remaining decline. Though instantaneous depreciation is important (accounting

for a 20 percent decline in the used price relative to the new price), age-related depreciation is

small. By using a parsimonious set of variables to quantify obsolescence, we can account for the

remaining quarter of the decline in the value of computers to when they are sold new, or over

half of the drop in the q of a three-year old computer. Without accounting for obsolescence, the

estimated age-related depreciation is between 15 and 25 percent per year. Therefore, the

standard procedure of attributing all age-related depreciation to deterioration can be seriously

misleading.

       The paper has identified the forward movement in the technological frontier as the source

of obsolescence. The interactions of the improvements in hardware with the design of software

magnify the effects of technological progress. The high rate of obsolescence during the period of

study is in large part the outcome of the unique interaction of hardware and software in

computers. During this time period, technological change in hardware manufacturing drastically

lowered the cost of RAM, speed and hard disk space. The lower cost by itself would not cause




                                                 28
obsolescence. For example, the real price of new microwaves has also fallen over time, but

obsolescence of existing microwaves has been minimal because the only network component of

microwaves is electricity, which has not changed. In contrast, the lower cost of computer

hardware spurred software designers to write more versatile programs that were more demanding

on the hardware. The newer software does not run well on the limited capabilities of older

machines. Moreover, one cannot simply set up two or more older machines to achieve the same

capabilities of a newer machine: if a program needs 400 MHz to run well, setting up two 200

MHz machines will not solve the problem.

       Without the decline in replacement cost, it is unlikely that obsolescence would have

proceeded so quickly. If the rate of technological progress in the production of computer

hardware slows down, one would expect the rate of obsolescence of used computers to decrease

as well.

Note: The first four columns report means of log deviation of the attribute of the used computer
relative to the median log attribute for the new computer in the year when sold. Composite is the
weighted average of Hard disk, Speed, and RAM, with the weights taken from their coefficients
in the hedonic regression reported in Table 4. The CPU lag is the number of generations the
CPU of used computer is behind the latest CPU being marketed when the used computer is sold.
Generations defined as 80286, 80386, 80486, Pentium I, Pentium II, and Pentium III or IV.

[Notes to Table 6]

Note: Dependent variable is the log of the ratio of the used to new price. Pt BEA and Pt HED are the
BEA’s and the authors’ hedonic price indexes for new computers. In columns (1) through (6),
the price index for new computers is included in the regression with a coefficient of one. Taking
the price index to the left-hand side of the equation makes the dependent variable the log of q.
Standard errors corrected for heteroskedacity and clustering by model are in parentheses. Age
dummies are defined so the coefficient is the annual age-related depreciation (log difference).
Age (v) is measured in years. No CRT is a dummy for the used computer being sold without a
monitor. 3112 observations.

Note: Dependent variable is the log of the ratio of the used to new price. Pt     is the authors’
hedonic price indexes for new computers. In columns (1) through (6), the price index for new

left-hand side of the equation makes the dependent variable the log of q. Standard errors
corrected for heteroskedacity and clustering by model are in parentheses. Age (v) is measured in
years. Hard disk, RAM, and CPU speed deviation are the median value of those variables for the
year when the used computer is sold minus the value of those variables for the used computer.
The composite deviation is the weighted value of those variables using the hedonic coefficients
reported in Table 4 as weights. The CPU lag variable are dummies for number of generations
the CPU of the used computer is behind the most recent CPU in production when the used
computer is sold. The generations are defined as 80286, 80386, 80486, Pentium I, Pentium II,
and Pentium III or IV. No CRT is a dummy for the used computer being sold without a monitor.

Notes to Table 8: The percent decreases are calculated by exponentiating the logarithmic values
and then averaging. The first panel contains averages of cumulative percent decreases. The
second panel contains averages of percent decreases per year of age. The first column is change
in nominal q, the second column is the change in the new price holding attributes constant, the
third column is the change in q (the difference of the first two columns), and the last three
columns gives the estimates of components of depreciation from the regression in Table 7,
column (6).
