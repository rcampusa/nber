                                          ABSTRACT

We measure inequities from the COVID-19 pandemic on mortality and hospitalizations in the
United States during the early months of the outbreak. We discuss challenges in measuring health
outcomes and health inequality, some of which are specific to COVID-19 and others that
complicate attribution during most large health shocks. As in past epidemics, pre-existing
biological and social vulnerabilities profoundly influenced the distribution of disease. In addition
to the elderly, Hispanic, Black and Native American communities were disproportionately
affected by the virus, particularly when assessed using the years of potential life lost metric. For
example, Hispanic and Black Americans in 2020 saw 39.5 and 25 percent increases in excess
mortality relative to trend, compared to a less than 15 percent increase for Whites; we find losses
in potential years of life three to four times larger among Hispanic and Black compared to White
Americans. Individual-level data from a commercially insured population show that otherwise
similar Black and Hispanic enrollees were hospitalized due to COVID-19 at a higher rate than
White enrollees. We provide a conceptual framework and initial empirical analysis which seek to
shed light on contributors to pandemic-related health inequality, and suggest areas for future
research.

Introduction
When SARS-CoV-2 first appeared it was discussed as an equal opportunity pathogen: no one was
immune, and therefore all potentially affected (Mein 2020, Krishnan et al. 2020). Early cases of
COVID-19 disease among elites in entertainment, politics, and industry such as actor Tom Hanks,
U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Morgan Stanley chief executive officer James Gorman gave
credence to this view.
   Yet historical episodes of infectious disease are generally not experienced evenly across social
strata. Rudolf Virchow, the founder of modern cellular pathology and a proponent of medicine as a
social science, noted that "statistics will be our standard of measurement: we will weigh life for life
and see where the dead lie thicker, among the workers or the privileged" (Virchow, 1848). Figure
1 demonstrates that for prominent novel infectious disease threats across the last two centuries in
the United States, the dead indeed "lie thicker" among those less privileged. The upper-left panel
shows that when cholera struck Boston in 1849, the mortality gap between native-born Bostonians
and Irish immigrants and their children was about 50 percent larger than during a non-epidemic
year like 1854. The upper-right panel illustrates how the age-adjusted mortality gap between White
and non-White Americans rose during the influenza pandemic of 1918. The bottom-left panel dis-
plays how the HIV/AIDS pandemic worsened disparities in mortality between Black and White
Americans. Finally, the lower-right panel shows that the age-adjusted difference in all-cause mor-
tality rates between non-Hispanic White Americans and non-Hispanic Black Americans widened
by over 80 percent during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic.1
   This paper discusses the initial health effects of COVID-19 in the United States. During 2020,
the first year of the pandemic, COVID-19 was recorded as the underlying or contributing cause
of 378,000 deaths nationwide (Ahmad et al., 2021). The impact of COVID-19 on health, however,
extends beyond its direct toll on mortality. We begin by discussing the various ways by which
COVID-19's health effects have been measured, as well as the role pandemic-induced changes in
the demand and supply sides of health care may have played in affecting mortality from causes
other than the virus itself. Comparing the overall increase in mortality from 2019-20 to the number
of recorded COVID-19 deaths in 2020 indicates that the pandemic has had substantial indirect
effects on health.
   We next turn to examining inequality in the effect of COVID-19 on the health of different popu-
lation groups. Infectious pathogens exploit both biological and social vulnerabilities, and the pre-
sentation of medical statistics can render gradients more or less conspicuous. Older age groups are
particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, raising health risks for population groups with higher aver-
age ages, such as non-Hispanic Whites. Mortality rates conditional on age, however, are consider-
ably higher for historically disadvantaged groups such as Black, Hispanic, and American Indians
­ especially due to their young average ages, these groups account for a disproportionate share of
COVID-19 deaths.

    The third section of the paper examines different explanations for why COVID-19 has had such
unequal health effects, with a focus on racial and ethnic disparities. We provide a simple frame-
work for organizing factors that contribute to the observed gradients, and consider whether they
are driven by pre-existing differences in health risks and socioeconomic factors, or by differential
impacts from the same across advantaged versus disadvantaged groups. We conclude by pointing
out that the patterns of health inequality seen during the pandemic mirrored those that existed in
the United States prior to COVID-19, and offer thoughts about how the evolution of these gradients
and resilience for the next pandemic will depend on technology, health policy, and broader social
policy.


Measuring the Overall Initial Health Impact of COVID-19
The first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the United States was reported on January 20, 2020 (Hol-
shue et al., 2020). From then to the end of the year, there were an additional 20.4 million confirmed
infections nationwide (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021c). Of these cases, 378,000
resulted in death from COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. By the measure of confirmed
deaths from disease, the COVID-19 pandemic ranks among the deadliest in United States history,
comparable to the 1918 influenza and HIV pandemics (Goldstein and Lee, 2020).
    While the health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have clearly been significant, quantifying
them is complex. A first challenge in measurement is data quality, which varies substantially by
outcome of interest. Case reports of COVID-19 are often submitted with little information on pa-
tient demographics or their severity; 37.5 percent of cases in the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention's (CDC) COVID-19 surveillance system are missing race/ethnicity data and 88.4 per-
cent lack information on underlying health conditions.2 Although reports of "long COVID" indi-
cate that the disease may have persistent health effects among some of those infected, systematic
data on the morbidity impacts of COVID-19 are scarce (COMEBAC Study Group, 2021). In light of
these data constraints, we focus on COVID-19's effects on mortality, which is a key health outcome
of interest and reported by law to the CDC (National Research Council, 2009).3
    Quantifying the impact of COVID-19 on mortality still has challenges. While the number of
deaths attributed to COVID-19 disease in 2020 indicates the effects have been substantial, this fig-
ure may be an underestimate of the pandemic's mortality impacts. An estimated 3.4 million deaths
occurred in the United States during 2020, an increase of 504,000 from the 2.9 million deaths which
occurred during 2019. Evolving and variable clinical presentations alongside failures in testing,
both of which characterized the early pandemic, may have resulted in deaths from COVID-19 go-

     We also do not compute period life expectancy at birth. As discussed in Goldstein and Lee (2020), "in the context
of epidemic mortality, life expectancy at birth is a misleading indicator, because it implicitly assumes the epidemic is
experienced each year over and over again as a person gets older." Estimates of reductions in US life expectancy during
2020 are nevertheless striking: Andrasfay and Goldman (2021) project a 1.13 year decline in 2020 life expectancy at birth
compared to a scenario without COVID-19.

ing unrecorded (Wu et al., 2020).4 Spillover effects of COVID-19 also increased pandemic-related
mortality. We describe these factors below.


Effects of COVID-19 on the Demand for Health Care
Widespread avoidance of health care facilities early in the pandemic has been documented. The
CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report from September 2020 estimated that 41 percent
of U.S. adults had delayed or avoided medical care due to concerns about COVID-19, including
12 percent who had avoided urgent or emergency care (Czeisler et al., 2020b). In a nationally
representative survey of 1337 adults conducted in July 2020 by researchers at Johns Hopkins, 29
percent of respondents who reported needing care forwent it due to fear of viral transmission, with
7 percent forgoing care due to financial repercussions of the pandemic (Anderson et al., 2021).
    Similar results are found in the Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey, a repeated cross-
section of 1.8 million U.S. adults from the Bureau's Master Address File (United States Census
Bureau, 2020b). Of those surveyed between April and December 2020, 37 percent reported having
delayed medical care over the previous four weeks due to the ongoing pandemic. The Pulse data
indicate that delay of care followed the general contours of national COVID-19 prevalence, reaching
a peak through the spring of 2020, declining in late summer, and plateauing at a lower level in early
autumn before rising again. The share delaying care, however, topped 30 percent in every week the
Pulse survey was fielded, and stood at 35 percent in December -- nine months after the nation's
national emergency began.


Effects of COVID-19 on the Supply of Health Care
On the supply side, many non-emergency interventions were suspended due to the pandemic.
Shortly after President Donald Trump declared the COVID-19 outbreak a national emergency in
March 2020, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) recommended the cancel-
lation or delay of most elective surgeries and non-emergency medical, surgical, and dental proce-
dures (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 2020). National and state-level policies sought
to curtail patient volume in order to conserve scarce personal protective equipment, free up beds
and personnel for COVID-19 patients, and reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission. These changes may
have elevated non-COVID-19 morbidity and mortality (Chen and McGeorge, 2020).
    The sharp reductions in volume and increased costs providers faced during the pandemic re-
sulted in financial distress for many. The $187 billion in federal aid allocated to providers during
the crisis exhibited little relationship to COVID-19 disease burden or hospital financial health, and
failed to save many struggling providers even as well-resourced hospital networks, their losses
cushioned with aid, engaged in a renewed wave of consolidation (Kakani et al. 2020, Abelson
2021). The closure of an estimated eight percent of physician practices and a record number of
    4
     Symptomatic COVID-19 disease varies from mild to severe and can lead to death in a variety of ways. Pneumonia
and respiratory failure are prominent final pathways, but cardiac conditions, embolic events and systemic inflammation
are also possible (Gupta et al. 2020, Malas et al. 2020, Jose and Manuel 2020, Long et al. 2020).


                                                          4
rural hospitals, along with the higher prices and lower quality of care generally accompanying
provider consolidation, may affect patient outcomes in the longer term (Physicians Foundation
2020, Basu et al. 2019, Gaynor 2018).
   On net, the pandemic's impact on the supply and demand channels described above resulted
in extraordinary declines in health care utilization. Non-COVID-19 medical admissions fell by 40
percent during the first wave of COVID-19 and remained depressed nearly a year later (Birkmeyer
et al. 2020, Heist et al. 2021). The implementation of policies such as stay at home or business
closure orders may have contributed to the fall in outpatient visits (Ziedan et al., 2020). While
substitution to telemedicine partly offset the drop in in-person care, important preventive services
such as vaccinations and screenings could not be shifted online and saw precipitous declines ­
one study using data on over 5 million individuals with employer-sponsored insurance found de-
creases of 22 percent in vaccinations among children aged 0-2, 67 percent in mammograms among
women 46-64, and 70 percent in colonoscopies among individuals aged 46-64 (Patel et al. 2021,
Whaley et al. 2020). The consequences of these delays in care will likely reverberate in the form
of delayed diagnosis of non-communicable disease, preventable cases of infectious disease, and
strain on providers, long after the pandemic ends.


Additional Spillover Effects
The COVID-19 health crisis is also an economic crisis. Based on prior recessions, Ruhm (2000)
has noted that mortality tends to be procyclical. Since the opportunity cost of leisure declines,
individuals have more time to exercise, prepare healthy food and, in non-pandemic times, seek
medical care. The quality of healthcare, particularly in nursing homes, may also display cyclical
fluctuations (Stevens et al., 2015). Declines in economic activity and mobility during the pandemic
recession may have led to reductions in non COVID-19 deaths, compensating in part for the rise
in mortality from infectious disease and delayed care. While there is some suggestive evidence of
declines in air pollution and motor vehicle deaths from the early months of the pandemic, as well
as a decrease in seasonal flu deaths resulting from reduced social interaction, averted deaths are
likely small in number (Cicala et al. 2020, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2021a).
   Unlike in most recessions, protective measures taken by governments and individuals to limit
disease transmission during the pandemic resulted in unprecedented levels of social isolation. Dis-
ruptions in daily routines, community life, and support systems were accompanied by a troubling
increase in substance use disorder, with the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report from
August 2020 estimating that 13 percent of US adults had started or increased substance use to
cope with the pandemic's effects (Czeisler et al., 2020a). Following three years of relative stability,
drug overdose deaths nationwide sharply rose beginning in April 2020, the first full month of the
COVID-19 national emergency, and grew through October 2020 (National Center for Health Statis-
tics, 2021b). The rise in substance abuse deaths concomitant with the pandemic suggests another
avenue through which the COVID-19 crisis may have indirectly elevated mortality.

Excess Deaths: A Summary of COVID-19's Mortality Effects
The many ways through which the COVID-19 pandemic affected mortality renders precise attri-
bution to any one cause challenging. Indeed, as individuals are often at risk for more than one
type of death, some deaths recorded as due to COVID-19 disease would have occurred even in
the absence of the pandemic (Gichangi and Vach, 2005). Figure 2 illustrates how the process of
assessing the mortality toll of COVID-19 is complicated by the phenomena of substitution between
different causes of death (competing risks), indirect deaths (spillovers), and averted deaths. The
intractability of individually ascertaining the number of deaths resulting from each possible cause
has motivated the use of "excess deaths" to capture the overall effect of the pandemic.

   Excess deaths refer to differences between observed deaths in a particular time period and
historical or expected deaths in a similar time period (National Center for Health Statistics, 2020d).
As Figure 1 suggests, years in which the United States experienced an infectious disease epidemic
demonstrate higher death rates than contemporaneous non-epidemic years, with the increase in
deaths attributable to both mortality among infected individuals and a net increase in deaths from
other causes. The sum of recorded deaths from the disease and the difference in deaths from all
other causes compared to proximate time periods provides a summary statistic of the epidemic's
total effect on mortality. This number of excess deaths, which can be adjusted to account for pre-
existing mortality trends, is typically then divided by the size of the population to yield a rate of
excess mortality.
   Following Polyakova et al. (2020, 2021), we estimate excess mortality as the deviation from a
linear mortality trend. Figure 3 plots all-cause mortality rates among all Americans for each year
from 2011 to 2020, using death data from the National Center for Health Statistics and popula-
tion estimates from the American Community Survey (National Center for Health Statistics 2021a,
United States Census Bureau 2020a). After declining throughout much of the 20th century, mor-
tality rates in the United States have generally risen since 2010, in part due to the nation's aging


                                                         6
population. The number of deaths recorded in 2020, however, was far above the number expected
based on prior trends. The deviation in the 2020 all-cause mortality rate from the 2011-19 trend
was 1.39 deaths per 1000 population, or a 15.4 percent increase relative to trend. By comparison,
the mortality rate from COVID-19 disease in 2020 was 1.08 per 1000 population, suggesting that
spillovers contributed to elevated mortality during the pandemic.

    Source: Authors' calculations from National Center for Health Statistics (2020a, 2020e, 2021a) and United States Census Bureau (2020a).

    Note: Figure plots mortality rates from all causes for the United States from 2011 through 2020. The difference in the 2020
    mortality rate compared to the 2011-19 linear trendline is labeled. Mortality rates are not adjusted for age.


Measuring COVID-19 Health Inequality
The health consequences of the COVID-19 crisis affected Americans of all backgrounds, with over
half of respondents in a Pew Research Center survey reporting that they knew someone personally
who had died or been hospitalized due to the disease (Pew Research Center, 2020). The toll of the
pandemic, however, fell most heavily on Black, American Indian, and Hispanic individuals, who
disproportionately bore the total mortality burden of COVID-19 in at least two ways: they died
almost always at greater rates, and they died at younger ages. We examine inequality in pandemic-
related mortality, with a focus on inequality by race and ethnicity, in the section below.




                                                                                       7
Excess Mortality by Race/Ethnicity and Age
Having estimated all-cause excess mortality during the first year of the pandemic for all Amer-
icans, we replicate this approach by race/ethnicity and age. Panel A of Figure 4 reports excess
mortality rates in 2020 for non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic
Asian Americans within six age groups (0-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65-74, 75-84, and 85 and over).5

Asians age 0-44 is omitted as this group did not experience excess mortality.

     While American Indians and Alaska Natives (AIAN) experienced high rates of COVID-19 infection during the
pandemic, we do not assess excess mortality among these populations due to known data quality issues (Yellow Horse
and Huyser 2021, National Center for Health Statistics 2021c). Using data from a limited set of states, a CDC Morbidity
and Mortality Weekly Report from December 2020 found that disparities in COVID-19 death rates between AIAN and
non-Hispanic White individuals were large and particularly so at younger ages (Arrazola et al., 2020).


                                                                                                                                                                         8
    Pandemic all-cause excess mortality rises sharply with age, largely because age is the strongest
single determinant of mortality from COVID-19 (Petrilli et al., 2020) and because avoided non-
COVID-19 healthcare is more likely detrimental to the oldest adults. Appendix Table 2 shows how
Americans age 70 and above experience case fatality rates (rates of death conditional on diagno-
sis) about 200 times higher than those below age 40. Rates of excess mortality at any given age,
however, vary sharply by race and ethnicity. Panel B of Figure 4 plots the ratio of non-Hispanic
Black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic Asian excess mortality rates to the non-Hispanic White excess
mortality rate for each age group.
    The rate ratios presented in Panel B point to two dimensions of mortality disadvantage that
Black and Hispanic Americans faced. First, the Black-White and Hispanic-White ratios are above
one at every age, indicating that Blacks and Hispanics experienced elevated rates of excess death
compared to non-Hispanic Whites. Indeed, when all age groups are pooled and excess mortality is
computed for each race and ethnicity as a whole, it is evident that Black and Hispanic populations
suffered the highest rates of excess death in 2020. Panel A of Figure 5 shows that Black Americans
experienced excess mortality of 2.14 deaths per 1000 population in 2020, or a 25.0 percent increase
in mortality relative to trend, while Hispanic Americans in 2020 saw excess mortality of 1.44 deaths
per 1000 population in 2020, or a startling 39.5 percent rise relative to trend. Non-Hispanic Whites
and Asians experienced increases in mortality of 1.29 and 0.58 deaths per 1000 population respec-
tively, which are both increases of less than 15 percent relative to trend. As Panel B of Figure 5
indicates, these disparities widen further when excess mortality rates are age-adjusted to account
for differences in age distributions between races and ethnicities -- namely, the younger Hispanic
and older non-Hispanic White age structures.6
    Second, the ratios in Panel B of Figure 4 are strikingly higher at younger ages compared to
older groups. The Black-White ratio in excess mortality is above four for the youngest age group
of 0-44, and above three for all age groups through 65-74. Similarly, the Hispanic-White ratio in
excess mortality is above 2.5 for all age groups from 0-44 to 65-74. By contrast, the Black-White and
Hispanic-White excess mortality ratios for individuals age 85 and over are a comparatively low 1.5.
The steep age gradient in excess mortality disparities indicates that the already high number of
Black and Hispanic pandemic-related deaths disproportionately occurred among the young.
    Mortality rates, whether age-adjusted or unadjusted, do not differentiate between deaths at
younger or older ages. Examining death rates alone therefore overlooks an important dimension
of inequality: differences in the number of years individuals in each group would likely have lived
had they not died due to pandemic-related causes.




    6
      Age-adjusted statistics are computed by weighting deaths in different age groups among a given race or ethnicity
in a manner that matches the share of each age group in the general population. Under age-adjustment, races and
ethnicities with an age distribution younger than the general population have deaths at older ages weighted relatively
more and deaths at younger ages weighted relatively less, whereas the converse would be true for races or ethnicities
with an age distribution older than the general population.

Disparities in Lost Years of Life
The concept of years of potential life lost, or YPLL, is used in the public health literature to quantify
premature mortality (Gardner and Sanborn, 1990). As premature death is typically defined as a
death occurring before age 65, the years of potential life lost for an individual who died prematurely
is calculated by subtracting their age at death from 65, with those dying at age 65 or older assigned
a years of potential life lost value of zero. The total years of potential life lost in a population is then
computed by summing up the years of potential life lost among all individuals in the population
who died early. This sum is usually normalized by dividing it by the number of individuals in the
population under age 65. The aim of the years of potential life lost statistic is to measure life lost
in years of life foregone as opposed to deaths incurred, providing a complementary measure to
mortality rates.
                                                                             As with excess death rates, we estimate "excess" years of potential life lost during the COVID-19
pandemic as the deviation in 2020 from the 2011-19 linear trend. Panel C of Figure 5 plots excess
years of potential life lost from all causes per 100,000 individuals under age 65 by race and ethnicity
during 2020. Among all Americans, rates of YPLL rose by 12.8 percent in 2020 compared to trend.
Similarly with mortality rates, however, this increase was again concentrated among Black and
Hispanic Americans. Black rates of YPLL rose in 2020 by 1350.3 per 100,000 individuals under 65,
or an increase of 19.5 percent relative to the 2011-19 trend. Among Hispanics, YPLL rose in 2020 by
925 per 100,000 individuals under 65, or 29.2 percent relative to trend. By comparison, YPLL rates
among non-Hispanic Whites increased by 316.2 per 100,000 individuals under 65, or 8.4 percent,
and among Asian Americans YPLL rates fell slightly relative to trend.
                                                                             Examining ratios of Black and Hispanic excess YPLL rates to the non-Hispanic White YPLL
rate, in a similar manner to Figure 4, underscores the mortality disadvantage Blacks and Hispanics
have faced during the pandemic. The Black-White ratio in excess years of potential life lost is 4.2,


                                                                                                                                                                                                                     10
whereas the Hispanic-White ratio in excess years of potential life lost is 2.9. In contrast, the Black-
White ratio for age-adjusted excess mortality is 2.6, and the Hispanic-White age-adjusted excess
mortality ratio is 2.5. The elevated YPLL ratios suggest that not only have Black and Hispanic
Americans died at greater rates during the pandemic, but those who died on average had many
more years of life left to live. Far from being an equal opportunity pathogen, SARS-CoV-2 has
exposed societal cleavages between less privileged and more advantaged groups.


Understanding the Unequal Health Effects of COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic affected some groups, particularly Black and Hispanic Americans, more
than others. Why was this the case? Our goal in this section is twofold: to provide a simple frame-
work for organizing the main factors that contribute to the observed disparities, and to present the
results of a decomposition that examines the relative importance of some of these factors.


A Simple Framework for Understanding COVID-19 Health Inequality
We begin by focusing on deaths directly associated with COVID-19. Inequality in COVID-19 dis-
ease may be due to social determinants (such as differences in occupation, income or education),
medical determinants (including differences in comorbidities, health care quality and insurance),
and long-standing institutional features that perpetuate systemic racism and intergenerational
poverty (Snowden and Graaf, 2020). These factors are not exhaustive nor are they mutually exclu-
sive. They can, however, be mapped into an expanded model of disease transmission.
    The probability of death from COVID-19 is the product of the probability of SARS-CoV-2 in-
fection and death from COVID-19 conditional on infection. Following standard epidemiological
models, the probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection can be written as P(SARS-CoV-2 infection) =
1 - (1 - p)ni (1-mi ) , where i refers to an individual, p represents prevalence, n is the number of
contacts, and m is the proportion of mitigated contacts (Halloran, 2009). All else equal, the prob-
ability of infection rises as prevalence in the community increases, and also increases if one has
more contact with others. An individual's infection probability, however, declines if more mitigat-
ing measures, such as mask-wearing, physical distancing, and vaccination, are taken.
    Prevalence (p) in an individual's community and their number of contacts (n) can be affected
by social inequality, population density, and local policies.7 Black and Hispanic populations both
live in areas with higher COVID-19 prevalence and face higher costs of reducing their number of
contacts. Black and Hispanic Americans live in larger households that are often multi-generational,
and often have poor housing conditions (Pew Research Center, 2018). They are also more likely
to be frontline workers who must work in-person despite the risk of infection, and cannot stop
working or cut back on hours due to relatively low wealth levels or, particularly in the case of
Hispanics, challenges in accessing federal benefits (Blau et al., 2020).

    7
     Prevalence can be expressed as a function of the behavior of others around the individual (p(n-i (1 - m-i ))), which
in turn is affected by the factors noted above.


                                                           11
   Mitigation (m) can help offset the risk associated with labor or leisure-related interactions.
However, ability to follow public health guidance depends on access to public health information,
complementary tools such as vaccines and masks, and beliefs in the credibility of such information.
A survey of approximately 5000 Americans conducted early in the pandemic showed that Black
and Hispanic individuals, younger people, and men were less likely to have accurate information
about COVID-19 transmission than other groups (Alsan et al., 2020a). Mitigation behavior by in-
dividuals during the pandemic has also been shaped by the dissemination of misinformation and
features of the messenger, such as whether they are of the same race or ethnicity as the individual
or whether they are an expert or peer (Simonov et al. 2020, Alsan et al. 2020b, Alsan and Eich-
meyer 2021). Although communication with Black physicians has been shown to raise take-up
of preventive health among Black Americans, just 4 percent of physicians in the United States are
Black (Alsan et al., 2019).
   As discussed above, mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic can be conditional on infection
(i.e. direct) or due to spillover effects. Access to quality health care is important in determin-
ing mortality, direct and indirect, from COVID-19. While higher-quality hospitals are associated
with lower mortality rates, low-income, Black, and Hispanic Americans obtain health care from
lower-quality facilities (Jha et al. 2011, Doyle et al. 2019, Chandra et al. 2020). Elevated COVID-19
caseloads in Black and Hispanic communities also contribute to non-COVID-19 excess deaths by
reducing the ability of health care facilities to treat non-COVID-19 patients and causing individu-
als to avoid or delay necessary care due to fear of contagion. Black and Hispanic adults were also
less likely at the start of the pandemic to be covered by health insurance, potentially contributing
to care delays (Cohen et al., 2020).
   The distribution of pre-existing conditions differs by race and ethnicity, raising the probabil-
ity of death conditional on COVID-19 infection and the inability to receive needed care for other
chronic illnesses. Relative to non-Hispanic Whites, rates of diabetes are 1.7 and 1.8 times higher
among Black and Hispanic populations (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020). Rates
of obesity and hypertension are similarly elevated among Black and Hispanic individuals as well
(Reeves and Smith, 2020). Diabetes, obesity and hypertension are conditions that increase the risk
of death from COVID-19 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021b).


COVID-19 Health Inequality: A Decomposition
The potential drivers of health disparities seen during the COVID-19 pandemic are manifold. Black
and Hispanic Americans are disadvantaged socioeconomically relative to non-Hispanic Whites
and tend to have a greater number of comorbidities that heighten the risk of severe COVID-19
disease. To what extent are racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 health outcomes driven by
differences in these characteristics? Or, are Black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic White individu-
als differentially impacted by COVID-19 even when they possess the same attributes? We aim to
examine the relative importance of each of these factors through a decomposition exercise. As
CDC datasets largely lack detailed comorbidity data or information on individuals who have not


                                                 12
contracted COVID-19, we obtain the necessary data from the Optum Clinformatics® Data Mart
(CDM), a comprehensive commercial and Medicare Advantage claims database. In addition, we
shift focus from the relatively rare outcome of mortality to COVID-19 hospitalizations.
    The Optum database includes approximately 67 million unique lives of all ages across 2007-
2020 and is broadly representative geographically. We include adults age 21 or older who identify
as either non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, or Hispanic, enrolled prior to July 2019, and
filed a medical claim at least once during 2019 (thus avoiding cases where comorbidities have been
undiagnosed and allowing us to have three quarters of data prior to the peak of the pandemic's
first wave). Our analysis sample includes all enrollees who were hospitalized for COVID-19 during
the first three quarters of 2020, along with a five percent random sample of those not hospitalized
for COVID-19 as a control group.8 Our final sample includes approximately 322,000 non-Hispanic
White, 50,000 non-Hispanic Black, and 61,000 Hispanic enrollees.
    We first measure whether sampled enrollees were previously diagnosed with medical condi-
tions that increase the risk of severe illness from COVID-19.9 We also extract social and demo-
graphic information including age, sex, average educational attainment in the enrollee's Census
block of residence, and Census division of residence. We conduct a "threefold" Oaxaca-Blinder de-
composition that parcels out racial and ethnic differences in the likelihood of hospitalization due to
COVID-19 into three components (Jann, 2008). The first component captures how much of the gap
is from group differences in the predictors (the "endowments"). The second component captures
the part due to differences in the coefficients (the "return to endowments"). The third component
is the interaction between endowments and returns to endowments.
    Furthermore, we perform a "detailed" decomposition, as we track two sets of predictors: comor-
bidities, which are indicators for the medical conditions we measure, and sociodemographics.10
The decomposition is formulated from the viewpoint of Black or Hispanic enrollees. Although it
is well-known that the reverse decomposition from the White perspective may provide different
results, our approach is designed to produce two relevant counterfactuals. First, what is the ex-
pected change in hospitalization rates for Black and Hispanic Americans if the relevant minority
group had the majority group's predictor levels? Second, what would be the expected change if
the minority group had the majority group's coefficients?11
    Table 1 presents the decomposition results. The left panel displays results for non-Hispanic
Black vs. non-Hispanic White enrollees and the right panel displays results for Hispanic vs. non-
Hispanic White enrollees. The hospitalization rate for COVID-19 in our constructed sample is

     8
       COVID-19 testing and results are not reliably included in claims data; moreover, testing was not necessarily evenly
distributed across groups (Rubin-Miller et al., 2020).
     9
       We extract information on hypertension, diabetes, obesity, cancer, heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease based on diagnosis codes in claims filed between January 1 and December 31, 2019.
    10
       For categorical variables, such as census block educational attainment and census division, we follow Yun (2005)
to normalize the effects of categorical variables to avoid the issue of varying coefficients due to the choice of omitted
group.
    11
       We estimate with a linear probability model following Montenovo et al. (2020), but note that a logistic model
provides similar results in terms of the importance of coefficients. See Data Appendix for additional data and method-
ological details.


                                                           13
7 percentage points higher for Black than White enrollees and 4.6 percentage points higher for
Hispanic that White enrollees. For both groups, coefficients contribute much more to the overall
difference than predictors. Perhaps surprisingly, the presence of comorbidities explains a much
smaller share of the overall difference than the return to sociodemographics for both Black and
Hispanic groups. Indeed, the return to sociodemographics is the single largest contributor to the
overall gaps in hospitalization, accounting for 28.6 percent of the raw gap for Black compared to
White enrollees and 56.7 percent of the raw gap for Hispanic compared to White enrollees.12 The
results indicate that the same predictors exert a more damaging impact on Black and Hispanic
sampled enrollees. As an example, Black or Hispanic male enrollees might be more likely than
White male enrollees in similar situations to be engaged in work-related activities that place them
at higher risk of contracting the disease and/or have less access to care and therefore present at a
later stage, thus requiring hospitalization.
   In sum, the decomposition results suggest that the stark differences in COVID-19 health out-
comes for Black and Hispanic Americans compared to non-Hispanic Whites cannot be attributed
to a greater prevalence of pre-existing conditions, lower neighborhood levels of educational attain-
ment, or (broad) geographical disadvantage alone. Rather, otherwise similar Black and Hispanic
individuals, all of whom are insured in our sample, are hospitalized due to COVID-19 at a higher
rate than non-Hispanic Whites. These results are specific to our sample and decomposition deci-
sions we have taken, but they are consistent with the broader narrative that Black and Hispanic
individuals face institutional disadvantages including inconsistent providers, lower-quality care,
and systemic racism, that worsen their returns to similar endowments and contribute to COVID-19
health inequality.

       The difference in intercept contributes negatively to the differences in returns to sociodemographic variables.

     Notes: Table reports results from a threefold Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition from the perspective of the minority
     group. Sociodemographics includes age and age squared, gender, education dummies, and census division fixed
     effects. Effects of education and census division are normalized. Comorbidities represent a series of dummy
     variables for hypertension, diabetes, obesity, heart disease, cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
     The difference in intercepts is included in the difference in returns to endowments of sociodemographics.
Conclusion
This paper has drawn on history, medicine and economics to place the initial health effects of the
current pandemic into broader context. That COVID-19 disproportionately killed the frail and
disadvantaged could be expected based on viral dynamics, past epidemics and marked differences
in the ability of individuals to protect their health during the crisis. Yet the heightened salience of
these patterns, along with the stark mortality burden of the pandemic, may serve as a catalyst for
change -- in particular, for changing how Americans view the importance of public health and the
social safety net (Rees-Jones et al., 2020).
   The initial health effects we outlined may have consequences for years to come. Most directly,
a growing body of evidence suggests that a substantial proportion of individuals infected with
COVID-19 suffer a range of long-term health consequences, including cognitive dysfunction, fa-
tigue, and injury to the heart and lungs (COMEBAC Study Group 2021, del Rio et al. 2020). The
pandemic's long-term effects, however, will likely reach past those who contracted the disease and
extend beyond health alone. Disruptions in screenings and routine health care may beget future
premature morbidity and mortality from other communicable and non-communicable diseases
(Chen and McGeorge, 2020). Scarring in utero exhibited in the influenza pandemic of 1918 and
other epidemics of infectious disease may emerge with consequences for disability, educational at-
tainment, and earnings (Almond, 2006). The disruptive effects of the COVID-19 crisis on education
could widen inequality in income and health for future generations. These factors may exacerbate
immediate economic disparities already experienced through labor markets as a consequence of
the pandemic (Montenovo et al., 2020).
   With the introduction of recently approved vaccines against COVID-19 has come hope that
the disruption the disease has wrought on health and society will soon cease. The same health
gradients seen during the country's descent into the pandemic, however, are likely to be observed
as we emerge from it. Reports suggest that vaccination distribution by race and ethnicity has not
been aligned with who has been affected most by the virus, placing vulnerable individuals at risk
of adverse outcomes during a time in which SARS-CoV-2 continues to mutate (Ndugga et al. 2021).
The medium and long-run health effects of COVID-19 -- as well as the consequences of future novel
infectious disease outbreaks which will assuredly emerge -- will be shaped by how effectively and
equitably policymakers respond to these formidable, yet not wholly unprecedented, challenges.

      Note: Table shows the number and percent of missing elements indicated as column headers in the CDC COVID-19 case surveillance database.
      Of cases, hospitalization, and deaths reported to the CDC, Columns 1 to 4 show the number and percent of missing age, sex, race/ethnicity,
      and comorbidities data, respectively. Column 5 shows the number and percent of missing data on any of the four elements. Percentages are
      reported in parentheses. Note that we do not investigate the extent to which cases are missing entirely from this data source, relative to the
      counts present in other standard sources of COVID-19 data.

      Note: Table reports COVID-19 related case-fatality rates (CFRs) by age groups (Panel A) and race/ethnicity (Panel B). Population and death
      shares by race/ethnicity are computed as shares of population and deaths with race/ethnicity recorded as non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic
      Black, Hispanic/Latino, non-Hispanic Asian, or non-Hispanic American Indian. For clarity of presentation, Alaska Natives are included in the
      American Indian category, whereas Pacific Islanders are included in the Asian category. Of the 303,211 deaths recorded in the CDC COVID-
      19 case surveillance database, 3.20% are among individuals of races/ethnicities other than those noted above, while 17.34% do not contain
      information on race/ethnicity.
