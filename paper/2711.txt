              CARBON MONOXIDE IN THE AMBIENT AIR AND BLOOD PRESSURE:
                  EVIDENCE FROM NHANES II AND THE SAROAD SYSTEM


                                       ABSTRAct




In this paper data from the National Health and Nutrition Exaaination

Survey,   1976—1980,   and from the U.S. Environmental     Protection   Agency's

SAROAD system are used in an empirical analysis of the effects of carbon

monoxide in the ambient air on blood pressure.          There is evidence in these

data of a positive effect of carbon monoxide exposure on diastolic and

systolic blood pressure.      This effect is stable and statistically       important

across a large number of alternative specifications,           including those with

additional    criteria air pollutants.     There is little evidence of rela-

tionships between the other criteria pollutants and blood pressure, which

is   consistent with epidemiological     literature that identifies carbon

monoxide as the primary threat to cardiovascular health among ambient air

pollutants.     The carbon monoxide effect on blood pressure implied by the

regression results     is small,   but likely biased toward zero by measurement

error.

                  Evidence from NHANES II and the SAROAD System

    The effects of atmospheric air pollutants            on human cardiovascular

health are not well established. Evidence that exposure to ambient air

pollution    adversely   affects cardiovascular health is strongest          in the case

of carbon monoxide (Hackney, 1975).        There    is   evidence that carbon monoxide

exposure    increases myocardial ischemia in patients with coronary artery

disease,    aggravates angina pectoris,    contributes       to nonfatal and fatal

myocardial     infarction and sudden death from coronary artery disease, and

plays a role in atherosclerotic disorders          (Aronow, 1983).     There is also

some evidence of an association between carbon monoxide exposure and higher

blood pressure.     In their study of foundry workers,          Hernberg,   et al. (1976)

found higher diastolic      and systolic blood pressures        in those occupations

(furnacemen and casters) with the greatest carbon monoxide exposures.

These differences     were statistically   significant.        Shiotsuka,   et   al.   (1984)

reported that long term exposure to carbon monoxide enhanced the develop-

ment of hypertension among Dahi rats bred for sensitivity to systemic

hypertension    induced by sodium chloride.        Ahinad   and Ahmad (1980) argued that

the higher rates of hypertension among residents             of Bombay and Delhi born

in a rural   Indian village as compared to residents           of the same village with

similar diet, smoking habits, and "genetic stock" could only be due to the

high concentrations      of carbon monoxide in the urban areas.1

    In this paper we provide further evidence on the relationship between

carbon monoxide in the ambient air and blood pressure.              To do so we combine

data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1976-1980,
                                         —2—


with data from the U.S. Environmental        Protection Agency's SAROAD system.

Our methodology     is similar to Omtro and Anderson (1981), Ostro (1983),

Portney and Mullahy     (1983, 1986) and Qerking    and Stanley (1984, 1988) in

that we use health, socioeconomic,       and demographic data on individuals          in

conjunction     with ambient air pollution   data from stationary monitors to

assess the impact of air pollution on health.         We find in this research

that there is a statistically important        relationship between carbon

monoxide and blood pressure in the NHANES tI—SAROAD data that is mzaole

across   a   large number of alternative   specifications.


I.   The Data

     The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1976—1980,               is a

national probability sample of the U.S. noninatitutionalizedcivilian popu-

lation, ages 6 months through 74 years.        It contains health, demographic,

and socioeconomic     information   on approximately 20,000 individuals.

Persons with low income, preschool      children,   and the elderly were over-

sampled.2     Each individual in the sample was given a detailed physical            exa-

mination that emphasized potential       health problems in the cardiovascular,

respiratory,    and neurological systems and included the measurement          of

systolic and diastolic blood pressure.3        Medical   history,   dietary,   and

socioeconomic characteristics questionnaires        were also administered to each

subject.

     We have augmented WHANES II with air pollution variables from the U.S.

Environmental    Protection Agency's Storage and Retrieval of Aeromatic Data

System (SAROAD).     This is an automated processing system used by EPA for
                                         —3—


the storage of data measuring concentrations       of six criteria air

pollutants:     carbon monoxide,   lead, sulfur dioxide,    total suspended par-

ticulates,     nitrogen dioxide, and ozone.    These are pollutants    for which

National Ambient Air Quality Standards have been established as part of the

Clean Air Act.      Each subject in NHANES II residing in a census tract4 was

matched to all air pollution monitors within a five, ten, and twenty mile

radius of the 1980 population centroid of his census tract.6

    The raw data in SAROAD take the form of hourly concentrations of carbon

monoxide,     sulfur dioxide,   nitrogen dioxide, and weekly concentrationsof

lead and total suspended particulates.        Ozone concentrations are recorded

hourly,     but only in the "ozone season," which varies aaong      regions.   For

each monitoring station that satisfied        the EPA standard for completeness of

data in a given year (at least 75 percent of all potential readings

present),    we computed annual hourly arithmetic averages of carbon

monoxide,    sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide, annual arithmetic averages

of daily maximums of ozone concentrations,       and annual weekly arithmetic

averages of lead and particulate concentrations.           These computations were

made for the examination year and for each of the three previous years.

Then six pollutant-specificannual averages for each subject were obtained

as simple averages of the monitor averages.        Finally,   the pollutant-

specific four—year average for the individual was calculated as a simple

average of the four annual averages.       If data were missing for one or two

years, a three— or two—year average was computed.          If an annual average was

available for a single year alone, that figure was used.          The six

pollutant—specific"four—year" averages are the measures employed in the
                                           —4—


multiple regressions presented below.          This algorithm will then smooth out

unusually high   or low short term fluctuations        in monitor   readings due to

technical   failure or other random events.        It also allows for the impor-

tance of monitor proximity to vary by pollutant         and recognizes there may be

tradeoffs   between information gained by including         individuals more than

five or more than ten miles from a monitor and precision            lost by including

individuals   too far from monitors to have meaningful readings for a par-

ticular pollutant.

    Nevertheless,       it is   apparent that substantial   measurement error

problems remain when assigning air pollution data to individuals from air

pollution   monitors within a certain distance of the census tract of resi-

dence.    These problems result from the substantial        variation   in the levels

of some pollutants within narrow geographic areas6 and the substantial

variation in the levels of some pollutants indoors and outdoors in a given

location.7 Thus individuals          in the same census tract can have different


exposures   depending    on their particular geographic location in the tract,

and on the amount of time spent indoors and outdoors.            Additional con—

founding factors are the amount of time spent away from home (e.g. at work)

and the years of residence        in the census tract, an issue to the extent

longer term or cumulative exposure is of interest.           Because econometric

studies   in air pollution      epidemiology traditionally employ a health produc-

tion framework and focus on an ambient air pollution variable as a health

input, measurement error associated with the pollution exposure variable

can be a serious problem to the extent it biases toward zero the pollution

coefficient and its t statistic.          It is possible that the findings of
                                           -5-


negligible health effects for some criteria air pollutants in the research

previously cited are a statistical         artifact resulting     from measurement

error in the exposure variables.


II.    Empirical   Results

      In this paper we also employ a health production framework to examine

the effects of carbon monoxide on blood pressure.            Systolic and diastolic

blood pressure are the health outcome variables.8 Following             the blood

pressure regression literature,      independent variables in the analysis

include age, the square of age, race, sex, education,           body mass, family

income, cigarette smoking,      and alcohol    use, in addition    to the six air

pollution variables.9         Variable definitions and summary statistics are

presented    in Tables 1 and 2.    Blood    pressure   levels are age dependent      and

the analysis was done over three age groups:           12—17, 18—39, and 40-74 years.

The older age group is emphasized here because this is the tradition of

previous studies (high blood pressure         is usually   confined to this age

group) and because the number of observations are larger for this group.

      Ordinary least squares regression results for systolic and diastolic

blood pressure for 40-74 year olds in NHANES II within 20 miles of a SAROAD

monitor are presented in Table      3.     Each air pollutant is considered     separa-

tely, that is no more than one pollutant         appears   in any regression.     These

results probably yield artificially high t statistics for the pollution

variables because collinearity between pollutants           is not allowed   to operate

and because adjustments      for sample design, which      usually lowers t sta-

tistics,    have not been carried out.1° The carbon monoxide coefficients are

 positive      in the diastolic and systolic blood pressure models, with t values

 of 3.9 and 2.9, respectively.11 The sulfur dioxide coefficients are also

 positive in the diastolic and systolic models, with t values of 2.3 and

 2.9.

         The remaining air pollution variables are negatively related to blood

pressure in at least one of the blood pressure specifications and have

generally low t statistics.          In order to allow for more than one pollution

variable in a blood pressure model consider first diastolic blood pressure

regressions that include the independent variables of table 3 with the

pollution variables added one at a time to form the following five pollu-

tion variable combinations: carbon monoxide (repeated from table 3); carbon

monoxide and sulfur dioxide; carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and total

suspended particulates; these three pollutants plus ozone; and these four

pollutants plus nitrogen dioxide.12 The carbon monoxide regression coef-

ficients and t values from these models are: .62, 3.9; .63, 3.5; .64, 3.5;

.84, 4.1 and 1.75, 4.6.          The carbon monoxide coefficients and t values in

systolic blood pressure models with the same independent variables are .83,

2.9;    .77,   2.5;    .86, 2.7; 1.1, 3.0; and 1.1, 1.7.     The coefficients in these

relationships         are obviously quite stable.      In the second specification

(carbon wonoxide and su1fur dioxide are the pollution variables),            the

sulfur dioxide coefficients and t values fall by half in both the diastolic

and systolic regressions in comparison to the sulfur dioxide results in

table 3.       The other pollution variables show no consistent relationship to

diastolic blood pressure in multi-pollution variable specifications. The

results of this empirical        exploration are consistent with the general view

that    carbon monoxide is more deleterious to cardiovascular health than the

other criteria air pollutants.'3

       Learner's (1978) SEARCH algorithm can be used to further test the sen-

sitivity of the carbon monoxide results to equation specification.              In

addition to other statistics,        SEARCH generates the bounds of regression

coefficients constrained to lie within 95% confidence ellipsoids.             These

bounds depend on which independent variables are designated as "free" or

certain to appear in the model and which independent variables          are


designated as doubtful      .   These bounds can be quite different   than those

derived from simple sensitivity analysis that includes and then omits

doubtful variables       because the parameterizationof the doubtful variables

is not artificially restricted.           Rather all linear combinations of the

doubtful variables are considered in a "global sensitivity anaysis."13

The application of SEARCH to diastolic blood pressure models with the

intercept, weight/(height)2,        sex, and carbon monoxide as free variables and

with the other pollution variables and other independent variables as

doubtful   variables     yields the following upper and lower bounds of the 95

percent confidence ellipsoids for the carbon monoxide variable:           .81    and

1.04,    .83 and 1.03,    .78 and 1.06,    .77 and 1.06, and 1.98 and 2.33.     Five

sets of bounds result because the doubtful pollution variables are added in

the order indicated       in the preceding paragraph.     The bounds are relatively

narrow and stable and indicate a positive effect of carbon monoxide on

diastolic blood pressure.        Application of SEARCH to systolic blood pressure

on this manner also indicates coefficient stability.           Using SEARCH in the

same way for the other criteria pollutants (each pollutant allowed to be a

 free    variable    in the   company of the other pollution variable combinations

 specified as doubtful)         yields no instances where the upper and lower bounds

 are both positive,       except in the case of sulfur dioxide.             The bounds for

 the 95 percent confidence ellipsoid          for this variable with carbon monoxide

 doubtful       are .01 and .03.    The other pollution variable combinations result

 in positive and negative 95 percent bounds for sulfur dioxide as a free

 variable.

                                                                   pressure

 implied by the regression results consider the effects of a one standard

 deviation reduction       in   carbon monoxide (1.4       mg/rn3)   on diastolic blood

 pressure.       Since the carbon monoxide regression coefficient             is approxima-

 tely one, such a reduction         in average carbon monoxide exposure would reduce

diastolic blood pressure by about one and one—half Units.                   This is a small

change in blood pressure -—         the   mean and standard deviation of diastolic

blood pressure for this age group are 82.2 and 12.0.
                                                                       However, this is not

to say that such a reduction          in carbon   monoxide would have inconsequential

public health consequences.

       The Pooling Project results        indicate that a one unit fall in diastolic

blood pressure across 40-74 year olds males would reduce the number of

major coronary events (first time heart attacks and strokes) by approxima-

tely tho for every 1,000 men in this age group over an 8.6 year period

(Pooling Project Research Group, 1978).                This implies an annual reduction

of about 10,000 major coronary events among males in this age group in the

U.S.    Also,    the reader is reminded that the carbon monoxide regression

coefficients are biased toward zero because of the previously described

measurement error.

III.    Summary and Conclusion

       To summarize,   there is evidence from the NHANES   II and SAROAD data     of

a positive effect of carbon monoxide exposure on diastolic and systolic

blood pressure.      This effect is stable and statistically important14 across.

a large number of alternative specifications,      including   those with addi-

tional criteria air pollutants.      There is little evidence of relationships

between the other criteria pollutants and blood pressure,       which   is con-


sistent with epideniological literature     that identifies carbon monoxide as

the primary threat to cardiovascular health among      ambient air pollutants.

The carbon monoxide effect on blood pressure implied by the regression

results   is small   and this research must be considered exploratory    because

of the difficulties in accurately measuring carbon monoxide exposure with

these data.    However,   because even small reductions in blood pressure might

have important    implications for cardiovascular health, it is important that

future research establish the strength of the carbon monoxide-blood

pressure relationship.

      1Ahmad and Ahmad (1980) provide two possible explanations for the asso-

ciation between carbon monoxide exposure and hypertension.             The first of

these is that "chronic stimulation         of the cardiac chemoreceptor    and adrenal


glands by serotoniri could contribute to the pathogenesis of hypertension"

(p.   565).     The idea here is that the human body responds to the risk of

carbon monoxide exposure by increasing blood pressure as a protective

measure.      The second explanation is that the association of carbon monoxide

with arteriosclerosismay produce higher blood pressure because a stif-

fening of the baroreceptor area may result in partial denervation.

      2For a detailed description of NHANES II, see National Center for

Health Statistics (1981).          The exact sample size is 25,285.     Of these sub-

jects, 20,322 received the physical examination.

      3problems with the blood pressure data in NHANES II have recently been

acknowledged by the National Center for Health Statistics (1986).             In their
                                       F—2


description of trends   in blood   pressure in the United States from 1960 to

1980, it is pointed out that the large proportion of diastolic blood

pressure measures with an end digit of zero in NHANES II may be indicative

of a lack of concentration or of hearing impairment among the examining

physicians during the measurement of diastolic blood pressure.       This is


possible because the examining physicians in NHANES II were almost all

retired practitioners and because     hearing acuity diminishes with age.

Systolic blood pressure measurement was thought not to be adversely

affected by physician hearing loss or carelessness.       The end digit zero


problem characterized the latter part of the NHANES II period with blood

pressure data from five primary sampling units in particular being of

questionable quality (Coate and Fowles, 1987).       Deleting data from these

PSUs from the samples used below lowers slightly the coefficients and t

values of the carbon monoxide variables      in models reported below.

    4All counties in SMSA's have census tracts.      Whether or not a county

outside an SMSA has census tracts is a local government decision.

Approximately two—thirds of the NHANES II subjects resided in counties

with census   tracts.
    5Because of the large number of total suspended particulate monitors,

readings for this pollutant were never taken from monitors more than ten

miles from the population centroid of the subjects'     census tract.    Note

also that at a given monitor location data may be recorded for only a

single pollutant.

    6Gerking and Stanley (1984) found ozone to be the air pollutant most

uniformly spread across the St. Louis metropolitan area.       Pairwise Pearson
                                          F—3

correlation coefficients of hourly readings among 25 monitors in the St.

Louis metropolitan area ranged from .33 to .90.          However,   the highest Sta-

tion specific mean ozone reading was about double the lowest station speci-

fic mean reading.     Carbon monoxide levels are apparently subject to greater

geographic variation.      Pairwise Pearson correlations among the 25 monitors

in the St. Louis study     ranged from .0005 to .90.      Nitrogen dioxide corre-

lations ranged from negative values to .62.         Sulfur dioxide correlations

reached     .26 with a substantial    number of negative correlations.


     7Exposure    levels of the criteria air pollutants are generally      much

smaller indoors than outdoors at a given location.

    8There are other health outcome data available in NHANES II that might

be related to ambient pollution       exposure,   in particular annual school loss

and work loss days from chronic heart and respiratory disease, but these

variables    have very low response rates and come from health history

questionnaires which are subject to recall error.         Also exploratory

regressions    with these health outcome variables with the independent

variables described below yielded insignificant F statistics.

    9See, for example,     Fortmann et al. (1983), Gordon and Kannel (1983),

and Pirkle et al. (1985).      Gordon and Kannel find in the Framingham data a

negative relationship between own cigarette smoking, which might be con-

sidered one form of carbon monoxide exposure,        and blood pressure.     They
attribute the finding to the lower weight of smokers, although the rela-

tionship apparently holds up in some instances after controlling for

weight.     Our regression results,    presented below, also show a negative and

significant relationship between cigarette smoking and blood pressure in
                                        F—4

some specifications,    with body mass held constant.      The inclusion of both


family income and education in the set of regressors is consistent with the

economics literature on the determinants of health (for example, Grossman,

1972, 1975; Gerking and Stanley, 1986; Portney and Mullahy,        1986).   In this


literature,    family income is viewed as a measure of Command over real

resources,    while education   is viewed as a measure of efficiency in health

production and tastes.     The simple correlation coefficient between these

two variables of .25 is low enought so that problems associated with multi-

collinearity do not arise when both are used as regressors.

   l0Adjustments    for sample design lower t statistics because they incor-

porate a positive (in most cases) correlation among the regression distur-

bance terms of individuals who reside in the same primary sampling units.

Adjustments for sample design have not been carried out because the

sampling weights provided with the NHANES      II   data are not appropriate for

the various subsamples considered in this paper.

   11Carbon monoxide coefficients were nearly identical to those reported

in table 3 when the diastolic and systolic blood pressure models were esti-

mated over separate samples of males and females.         For the 12-17 year olds

and 18-39 year olds carbon monoxide coefficients are positive and t values

exceed three in the case of diastolic blood pressure and one in the case of

systolic blood pressure.

   12The ordering of the last three pollutants was fixed so as to maximize

the number of observations in each regression.        The carbon monoxide-sulfur

dioxide ordering was based on their statistical       significance as indicated

by the t values in table 2.      The number of observations for the six
                                       F-S


regressions    in the order listed in the text are: 2,342; 1,975; 1,932;

1,582; 826.     Because observations with missing data are deleted,      the number

of observations falls as pollutants are added because data completeness

requires a subject to be within twenty miles of a monitor for each pollu-

tant included in the regression.      The results for the regression with lead

and the other    five pollutants are not presented because of the small sample

size (N less than 150).

   13The carbon monoxide results are not consistent with the blood

pressure—carboxyhemoglobinrelationship in the NHANES        II data.    Car—

boxyhemoglobin concentrations were determined for     a   half sample of NHANES

II participants from laboratory     analysis of blood samples.    These levels

are very sensitive    to the cigarette smoking status of NHANES    II   subjects

(the simple correlation    between carboxyhemoglobin levels and daily

cigarette   smoking is .66) but are negatively related to blood pressure even

among non smokers.     The problem with using carboxyhemoglobincon-

centrations,    however, as even a short term indicator   of carbon monoxide

exposure,   is the precipitous   fall in this measure that occurs with the

decline or cessation of carbon monoxide exposure.      Carboxyhemoglobin       con-

centrations    in NHANES II subjects would primarily reflect recent smoking

behavior or carbon monoxide exposure at the examination site or in the exa-

mination trailers.

   14The t values of the carbon monoxide coefficients are well above two in

most specifications but these values likely overstate statistical signifi-
