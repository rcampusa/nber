                                          ABSTRACT

Do financial markets properly reflect leverage? Unlike Gomes and Schmid (2010) who examine
this question with a structural approach (using long-term monthly stock characteristics), my paper
examines it with a quasi-experimental approach (using short-term a discrete event). After a firm
has declared a dividend (i.e., after the news release), but in the few days that precede the payment
date, an investor in the traded equity owns a claim to the dividend cash plus the remaining firm
equity within the corporate shell. After the payment date, the shell contains only the dividend-
sans-cash firm equity. The empirical evidence confirms rational increases in volatilities but shows
unexpected decreases in average returns. The best explanation is behavioral.

   For common projects, levered assets should be riskier and—if risk-taking is rewarded—
offer higher average returns than equivalent unlevered assets. These leverage implications
are even more basic than common equilibrium models. They should apply not only in any
common factor structure but even if risk-averse investors are unable to diversify. Gomes and
Schmid (2010) similarly characterize these leverage predictions as fundamental insights of
rational asset pricing:

      Increases in financial leverage directly increase the risk of the cash flows to
      equity holders and thus raise the required rate of return on equity. This re-
      markably simple idea has proved extremely powerful and has been used by
      countless researchers and practitioners to examine returns and measure the cost
      of capital across and [sometimes] within firms with varying capital structures.
      Unfortunately, despite, or perhaps because of, its extreme clarity, this relation
      between leverage and returns has met with, at best, mixed empirical success.

   They then provide an intuitive answer: an omitted variable. Leverage is endogenous.
Riskier firms with more growth options (reflected in market equity but not book equity)
presumably choose lower leverage. Thus, they have both lower market leverage and higher
expected returns. Their explanation is theoretically appealing, and it makes plain sense. If
there is a shortcoming in Gomes-Schmid’s “corporate supply side” argument, it is that it
fails to embed less appealing “investor demand side” alternatives. For example, what if
investors simply “liked” levered firms more, resulting in higher prices and lower returns?
What if financial markets simply did not respond (appropriately) to financial leverage?
What if the relationship between leverage and average returns was not due to optimal
corporate leverage choice in the presence of growth options, but only due to realized cash
payment patterns? (Pharmaceutical and technology companies happen to have been more
profitable.) Could one decompose empirical evidence into “corporate supply” and “investor
demand” forces?

   My own paper follows an alternative identification strategy to shed a different light on
the relation between net leverage and returns. It explores a setting in which it is easier
to test whether risk and returns increase or decrease with leverage, because there is a
discrete change in leverage that is not accompanied by a change in projects. The purpose
of investigating this limited setting is not an attempt to fully explain the long-term slow-
frequency relation between leverage and stock returns, but instead to focus only on a
smaller piece of the puzzle for which a clearer answer can be found.


                                             2
       This particular setting are the discrete cum-to-ex day transitions associated with pre-
viously-announced dividend payments.1 Any systematic news about projects associated
with dividend payments should already have been revealed earlier at the firms’ dividend
declarations. After the declaration but before the payment, the firm has already committed
to the dividend cash outflow. Its stockholders in effect then own a low-risk claim on a cash
payment plus a higher-risk claim on the remaining equity components of the projects, both
inside the corporate shell. After the payout, investors still own the same claims, except that
the low-risk asset component has shifted from inside the corporate shell to the outside. The
public stock return quotes are henceforth only for the residual riskier project assets. From
the owners’ perspective, public equity quotes prior to the payment are for both claims;
quotes after the payment are only for the more levered claim. Note that leverage here is
net leverage, with cash subtracted off obligations, and it can take on negative values.

       This is all true regardless of the firm’s underlying investment policy. It is true even if
the firm invests the dividend-required resources in risky projects up until the moment of
payment: any post-payment equity risk would attach to the residual traded firm equity
net of the risk-free dividend payment. The dividend cash was—repurposing an accounting
term—de-facto defeased at the moment of declaration and merely quoted together in the
public stock price as part of a bundle for a few more days.

       Unlike earlier dividend literature (explored and reviewed in, e.g., Michaely, Thaler,
and Womack (1995) or Allen and Michaely (2003)), my paper explores the stock returns
around neither the dividend announcement dates nor the dividend payment dates. Instead,
it compares the behavior of stock returns just before to just after payment dates, excluding
payment dates themselves, and while restricting the sample to days on which the declaration
had already been made public many days earlier. A timeline can illustrate the return
windows. The payment day itself is ignored, because there are known (tax) regularities at
work. All results are robust to reasonably different event windows.

    For convenience, I refer to the ex-date as the payment date. The actual payment date, e.g., as in CRSP, is
never used.

   The empirical findings are as follows:

  1. Stock return volatilities increased when leverage increased. Stocks paying more
      dividends experienced more volatility increases. The increases were almost perfectly
      in line with the predictions of the rational leverage theory.

  2. The leverage-induced increases in volatilities were accompanied not by (small) in-
      creases but by decreases in average rate of returns, and firms paying higher dividends
      experienced stronger decreases. This average return effect dissipated within about
      two to four weeks.

   As noted, the point of the experiment is not to assess the complete leverage asset-pricing
association, but to find a clean setting in which there is a discrete leverage change without
contemporaneous project changes. Yet, the documented dividend-leverage average-return
pattern turns out to be nontrivial (and not close-to-zero). With about a 30-bp mean return
difference in the total two weeks around the payment, firms that paid dividends four times
a year would have experienced declines in average rates of return of about 0.5-1% (relative
to the prepayment stock return patterns) for increased leverage of about 3-5%. (This is
excluding both the announcement and the payment rates of return.) Discrepancies that
were any higher would have violated reasonable risk-arbitrage limits (Lamont and Thaler
(2003)).

   The paper now proceeds as follows: Section I explains the setup, model, and data.
Section II presents the primary empirical findings about volatilities and average returns,
as well as some secondary related evidence. Section III discusses some conceptual and
empirical issues. And Section IV concludes.

I        Setup

A        The Rational Model

Dividend payments are (small increasing) shocks to net leverage. For intuition, start with a
simple example. Consider a firm that invests $1 in a stock-market index fund. Assume a
risk-free rate of zero and no imminent bankruptcy to simplify the notation. Now consider
the declaration of a dividend DV to be paid in the next period. In one case, assume the
firm keeps the money in the index up until the moment of payment, when it sells index
shares to satisfy the payment promise. At the moment of the declaration, the firm becomes
a composite of one risk-free claim worth DV and one levered claim worth 1 − DV . If the
market has a rate of return of r M between the announcement and the payment, the risk-free
claim will pay DV and the residual firm will be worth $1 · (1 + r M ) − DV . The entire risk is
on the residual claim, which is riskier than $1 · (1 + r M ). In the other case, in which the firm
immediately sells some index shares to defease the dividend, the intuition is even simpler.
In net terms, the cum-dividend stock returns were less levered than the ex-dividend stock
returns and the split was determined at the moment of declaration, not at the moment of
payment.2

        Because the approach is quasi-experimental, the model itself is simple. In the rational
finance framework,

                Equitypre      =      EquityEquity-Other          + (EquityRisk-free = Dividend) ,
                   R̃pre       = (1 − δ) · R̃Equity-Other +                  δ · RRisk-free ,
                Equitypost =         EquityEquity-Other ,
                   R̃post      =           R̃Equity-Other ,

where δ is the single-event dividend yield paid at the event date. Therefore, the expected
rate of return on equity should increase by the dividend-yield scaled expected rate of return
on the prepayment equity above the risk-free rate,

                                                1                     δ
                                                                      
                            E(R̃post ) =             · E(R̃pre ) −         · RRisk-free ,
                                               1−δ                   1−δ

which is strictly greater than E(R̃pre ) if E(R̃pre ) > RRisk-free . For small δ and risk-free rates,
E(R̃)post − E(R̃pre ) ≈ δ · E(R̃pre ). For daily stock returns, this is a tiny increase, but strictly

positive and quantitatively pinned down by the model. An empirical change larger or
smaller rejects the model.

      Because risk-free dividends have zero variability, the equivalent implications on second
moments are simpler:
                                                    1
                                                      
                                σ(R̃post ) =             · σ(R̃pre ) .
                                                   1−δ
Similarly, βpost = (1/(1 − δ)) · βpre . For ordinary firms, the model predicts that volatilities
and market-betas increase roughly one-to-one in accordance with the increase in dividend
yields. For small δ, 1/(1 − δ) ≈ (1 + δ).


A.1     Measure Sufficiency and Magnitudes

Note that the leverage and cash ratios are not inputs into the equity-risk increase. This is
because the pre-payment equity risk is a sufficient statistics for equity stock return effects
(with the dividend yield for the change therein). Of course, an high-cash zero-leverage firm
experiences exactly a zero increase when paying a dividend, while a low-cash high-leverage
firm experiences a large increase. But this is captured by th messaye. There is neither a need
nor a desire to include leverage or cash measures (e.g., as control). This is a great advantage:
the calculations are agnostic with respect to the measures of leverage—including whether
these measures are operational or financial. Attempts to use financial statements to tease
out leverage are theoretically neither necessary nor helpful.

      Because both the volatility and the means tests are scaled by the dividend yield, they
both have positive predictions but the volatility predictions are quantitatively stronger. This
is because the factor multiplies the initial value, and the average daily volatility is about
1%, while the average daily mean is two orders of magnitude lower—positive but near
zero. The theory predictions are quantitative.


B     Data

The main data in my study comes from CRSP. The results are therefore immediately and
universally replicable.

      I define the (one-payment) dividend yield as an ordinary cash dividend payment,
distribution code 1232, divided by the market price of the stock at the start of the event




                                                    6
window (either 5 or 9 days before the payment); and winsorize it at 50%.3 The signal-to-
noise ratio for detecting the effects of dividend payments on stock returns is necessarily very
small. Stock returns are very volatile on a daily basis (1-3% per day) relative to their means
(1-3 bp per day). The dividend payment yields are typically under 1%.4 Consequently,
dividend payments predict only very small changes in stock return moments. Fortunately,
there are many observations. CRSP identifies 494,643 ordinary cash dividends distributions
from 1962 to 2015. Unfortunately, dividends from before 1962 had to be excluded because
CRSP does not report their declaration dates.

                [Insert Table 1 here: Timespan From Declaration to Payment (Ex-) Date]


       The distribution of days between the declaration and the payment is in Table 1. The
CRSP database reports no cases in which a firm declared a dividend but failed to pay it, nor
are any cases familiar to me. (For further discussion of selection biases and their possible
effects, see Section III.)

       The primary data restriction in most of my study is the requirement of a specific number
of days between the dividend declaration and the dividend (cum-to-ex) payment date. This
is because the maintained assumption in the experiment is that any information about the
leverage change, projects, or dividends must have been released and thus already known.
My event window never begins earlier than three trading days after the declaration. Events
in which the payments occurred more closely to the declaration dates were excluded.

       This raises a complication. The availability of stock returns in the window could
change the composition of firms. In other words, some (but not other) stocks with shorter
declaration notices should not mix in the averages on different days. Permitting this could
cause spurious differences in stock return moments. Thus, my paper’s main specifications
are based on stocks with 5-day and 9-day windows that have full data throughout their
entire event windows.

       The imposition of the requirement of availability of rate of return data from two days
after the declaration through the payment date is not a concern, because the declaration-
to-payment timespan is a known ex-ante (pre-event) criterion. (It does affect the kind of
dividend events from and to which the findings obtain—only distributions that would occur
   3
     Winsorization affects about 300 dividend events. The results are similar if yields are winsorized at 10%,
20%, or if such observations are completely removed. (This is valid, because the declaration has already
occurred and therefore this criterion is based on an ex-ante known characteristic.)
   4
     They are on the order of 1% of equity per payment in an unweighted portfolio and 1.5% of equity in the
dividend-weighted portfolio. The inference is the same, regardless of weighting.


                                                      7
no sooner than in 7 or 11 days.) Stocks that disappeared from the CRSP data set before the
dividend payment dates are not included in CRSP. Thus they cannot affect my study, either.

   The imposition of the same-firm-set requirement could have introduced a bias if large
attrition had occurred just after the payment date. This turns out not to be a concern. Out
of 434,923 distribution events with a stock return at the payment date, 433,375 had a
stock return five days after the payment date. This is just the normal background attrition
of stock returns on CRSP.

   Robustness checks indicate that the results remain very robust when all stock returns
on any available dates are used, which means (for example) including stocks that were
delisted during the window and even mixing different stocks into different days.

   The event study requires little sophistication. The event dates are not (greatly) clustered,
and the time intervals are short (i.e., daily returns for about 1-2 weeks). Moreover, the
main adjustment methods subtracts off the contemporaneous equal-weighted stock market
rate of return. The averages and standard errors can be presumed to have been (nearly)
independent draws. (The results are not different if the standard errors are calculated from
the event time-series.) Heteroskedasticity could be an issue, and thus my paper reports
both plain and White heteroskedasticity-adjusted standard errors.

   The computer programs were rewritten independently to reduce the chance of inadver-
tent selection issues or programming bugs. The reported results are robust to all considered
variations.

                            [Insert Table 2 here: Descriptive Statistics]


   Table 2 provides general background statistics. In the two event windows around
dividend dates, stock returns had average rates of return of 5-6 bp above the prevailing
30-day Treasury bill and 1-2 bp below the equal-weighted stock market. In the normal
variation, stock returns were winsorized at –20% and +20%. The volatility of stock returns
was about 2% per day. Dividend yields were about 0.75% per event.




                                                 8
II     Results

A     Volatility

The first prediction of the rational theory is that, ceteris paribus, more levered stocks should
have higher volatilities. The simplest measures of risk (which should not be priced in terms
of higher expected rates of return) are absolute returns and standard deviations, either
plain or market-adjusted.

      [Insert Table 3 here: Explaining Volatility Around Previously declared Dividend Payments]


     Table 3 provides test statistics for comparing the volatility of stock returns before and
after the dividend payments. The inference is always through the coefficient on a dummy
that takes a value of 0 before the payment and 1 after. (It can be considered NA during the
payment.)

     Each row shows the coefficients of one panel regression. There are variations as to
whether (a) the measure is the standard deviation of the rate of return (relative to the
own pre-window mean or post-window mean) or a simple absolute rate of return, (b)
whether the window is five days or nine days (always excluding the payment day and the
two surrounding days), (c) whether the return is net of the 30-day Treasury yield or net of
the equal-weighted rate of return on the market, and (d) whether there are one or multiple
intercepts (year fixed effects or dividend-event fixed effects). It turns out that specification
differences barely mattered.

     The coefficients on the “after-payment” dummy (excluding all days outside the window
and the payment-plus-one days themselves) suggest that the volatility increased by about
0.01%/day (from a basis of about 1.5%/day). When the metrics and models have better
adjustments, the coefficients tend to be higher. The strongest results obtain when the
abnormal return adjustment is the equal-weighted market rate of return. With an average
dividend yield of about 0.9% (see Table 2), the magnitude of the volatility increase was
well in line with the leverage-theory prediction.

     [Insert Table 4 here: Explaining Volatility Around Previously Declared Dividend Payments, By
                                              Dividend Yield]


     Table 4 runs the same regressions, but includes the dividend yield itself and a cross-
variable on the dividend-yield before versus after the event. The leverage-theory prediction

                                                  9
becomes even better aligned with the theory. The cross-variable subsumes almost the entire
effect—only the higher-dividend payment events showed the marked increase in volatility.
The intercept becomes insignificant.

           [Insert Figure 1 here: Explaining Volatility around Previously Declared Payment Dates]


        Figure 1 illustrates the observed and predicted volatility change. Regardless of adjust-
ment, the average volatility increase was in line with the theory. There is measurement
noise, and the effect measures were not perfect: The volatilities four days and seven days
before the payment were about as large as the average volatilities after the payment. All in
all, the rational-leverage theory performs very well.

 [Insert Figure 2 here: Explaining Volatility around Previously-Declared Payment Dates, By Dividend
                                                  Yield]


        Figure 2 illustrates how the leverage volatility increase was larger for higher-dividend
yield stocks, just as predicted and also suggested by Table 4. Again, we can conclude that
volatilities behaved just as the leverage theory predicts. The payment of a dividend was
associated with an approximately linear increase in stock return volatility.


B       Average Returns

The second prediction of the rational theory is that, ceteris paribus, more levered stocks
should have a tiny bit higher daily expected rates of returns. The simplest measures of
expected returns are realized average returns.

    [Insert Table 5 here: Explaining (Average) Rates of Return Around Previously Declared Dividend
                                                Payments]


        Analogous to Table 3 for volatilities, Table 5 provides statistics comparing the average
rates of returns before and after the dividend payments. Again, each row shows the
coefficients of one panel regression. The “after-payment dummy” coefficients here suggest
that the average return decreased by about 3-6 bp per day. This average-rate-of-return effect
is the opposite of that predicted by the rational leverage theory.5 Over a window of 10 days,
    5
    A functional explanation for the discrepancy between risk and reward is that the market offered too high
a rate of return before and at the payment dates themselves. Of course, means and standard deviations do
not necessarily need to move together.


                                                    10
this implies a cumulative rate of return before the payment date that was, on average, about
30 bp higher than it was after the payment date. This is just within reasonable bounds:
30 bp is high enough to be economically meaningful, but not high enough to attract more
(risky) arbitrage to eliminate it (Lamont and Thaler (2003)).

[Insert Table 6 here: Explaining (Average) Rates of Return Around Predeclared Dividend Payments, By
                                            Dividend Yield]


       Table 6 shows the analogous regressions for average returns that Table 4 showed for
volatilities. They include the dividend yield itself and a cross-variable on the dividend-yield
before versus after the event. The rational leverage theory again predicts the opposite
of what the empirical evidence shows; and the cross-variable again largely subsumes the
after-dividend dummy: Only the higher-dividend yield stock events showed the marked
decrease in average returns.

                    [Insert Figure 3 here: Explaining Returns Around Payment Dates]


       Figure 3 illustrates that the average rate-of-return effect was even more consistent than
the volatility effect. Plotted by event days, every single pre-event average rate of return was
higher than every single post-event average rate of return. The drawn arrows are almost
flat, because the rational-leverage theory has a quantitative prediction about expected
returns that is very near zero. This is not born out by the data.

[Insert Figure 4 here: Explaining Returns around Payment Dates, By Dividend Yield, With Sensitivities
                               to Stock Return Availability Requirements]


       Figure 4 illustrates how the effect was concentrated in the high-dividend yield stocks.6
There is no clear effect for stocks paying low dividends (i.e., dividends of less than 1% of
the stock price at the start of the window). There are strong effects only for firms paying
significant dividends. The average return also reverted modestly with each day after the
event. This is as it must be: Over longer intervals, the change-in-leverage average effect
must become less pronounced.

       In sum, we can conclude that the rational leverage theory predicts exactly the opposite
of what occurred. Known payments of dividends were associated with approximately linear
   6
    There was moderate year clustering, but the reported results are not driven by the year of payment. They
were similarly not driven by day-of-week effects or day-of-month effects. Including individual dummies does
not change the reported means and standard deviations to the level of accuracy reported in my paper.


                                                    11
decreases in volatility. The stock price had increased “too much” before and through the
payment, thus reducing post-payment average rates of returns relative to prepayment
average rates of return.


C        Other Dividend-Related Evidence

Before discussing the evidence and interpretation caveats (in Section III), it is useful to
look briefly at some further empirical data.

[Insert Figure 6 here: Explaining Patterns For High Dividend-Yield-High-Stock-Volatility Distributions]


        High-Volatility High-Dividend Yield: It is possible to examine subsets of distributions
that are likely to show larger effects. For example, there were 52,861 distributions by firms
with dividend yields above 1% and a sum of absolute returns from days –9 through –6 of at
least 2%. (Note that the volatility event selector was not based on any plotted information,
but on volatility measured earlier.) The volatility itself is a more powerful a priori selector
than leverage, because it should include the net effect of both leverage and underlying asset
volatility.7 Figure 6 focuses only on these dividend distributions in which both the dividend
payment and the prepayment volatilities were higher. Again, the same conclusions obtain:
Volatilities increased and means decreased.


         [Insert Figure 5 here: Explaining Market Betas Around Previously Declared Payment Dates]


        Market-Beta: Figure 5 looks at market-betas from a cross-sectional regression of the
event-window return on the contemporaneous equal-weighted market return. Unlike the
clear directional findings for volatilites and means, there is no solid evidence that market-
betas changed (or increased, as predicted by the rational leverage theory). The higher
market-betas four and eight days before the dividend distributions suggest the appropriate
caution. If there was an impact of leverage on market-factor loadings, priced or not priced,
it was not robust. Because the leverage theory made a clear positive prediction, it can be
viewed as not supported by the data.8
    7
     The number of dividend distributions per year ranged from (the absolute low of) 390 in 1962 to 644 in
2015, with local maxima of around 1,800-2,500 from 1973 to 1982, and above 1,000 in 1990, 1991, and
2008. Thus, even though the cutoff was in nominal terms rather than in quantile terms, the results are robust.
   8
     In portfolio time-series, Braun, Nelson, and Sunier (1995) found that, while volatility was related to
leverage, market-beta was not.


                                                     12
       Taxes: Dividends are taxed. The surprising finding of my paper is that investors
“overpriced” shares before the dividend date. My paper always excludes the payment date
itself, when tax preferences should matter most. Any tax-caused preference would be an
investor-demand-side preference which, as far as my paper is concerned, would be one
good imperfect-market explanation for the origin of these price preferences—perhaps one
among others. Plainly put, tax-arbitraging investors may not just have purchased and
thereby driven up the price of dividend-paying stocks before the payment date; but they
may have done so cautiously over a number of days, perhaps in order not to trigger further
IRS scrutiny.

            [Insert Figure 7 here: Year by Year Highest Individual Dividend Income Tax Rates]


       However, this does not seem broadly consistent with the year-by-year post-dividend
effects coefficients, as well as the preliminary observations in the context of seasoned equity
offerings (in Subsection D).

       Figure 7 shows that the highest Federal income dividend tax rates were fairly steady
around 65-70% from 1962 to 1982, declined all the way down to 15% from 1982 to 2013,
and finally increased again to 20% and then 24%. In 1986 and 2003, there were particularly
sharp declines in tax rates.

[Insert Figure 8 here: Year by Year Coefficients Explaining Stock Return Moments After the Payment]


       Figure 8 plots the most interesting OLS coefficients (on the bivariate-only after-payment
dummy and on the multivariate cross-variables) when run year by year. It shows that
although a tax-related phenomenon may have contributed to the coefficients, the relation
between the dividend tax rates in Figure 7 and the before-after dummy was weak. The
dummy and the cross-coefficients show moderate—but not clear or pronounced—trends
corresponding to changes in the prevailing dividend income tax rates.9 However, with no
direct measure of tax-based trading and endogeneity of the tax rates, this evidence is not
perfect.

       If tax effects (but possibly also other payment-related demand effects) were responsible,
then including the payment (not announcement) stock rate of return should help explain
   9
    Unreported regressions explaining the volatility of year-by-year “after the event dummy” coefficients
(and cross-coefficients) with dividend taxes have adjusted R2 s that are negative. Regressions explaining the
average return year-by-year “after the event dummy” coefficients (and cross-coefficients) with dividend taxes
have adjusted R2 ’s of 3-5%.

the reduced cum-to-ex rate of return and reduce the expected return differential. The
cum-to-ex average rate of return was about 25bp—implying an average effective tax rate
of about 25/90 ≈ 28%—with a standard deviation of 212bp. This test is also imperfect,
because the tax-trading measure is noisy. Finance researchers do not have access to actual
tax-trading patterns, which tax-exempt traders are not eager to share.

    [Insert Table 7 here: Explaining (Average) Returns around Previously Declared Payment Dates,
                             Controlling for Cum-To-Ex Day Stock Returns]


     Table 7 shows that firms with higher cum-to-ex rates of return also had lower post-event
mean returns. However, controlling for the payment-date stock return has no effect on
the inference about the difference between pre-payment and post-payment rates of return.
This evidence again suggests that although tax effects may have contributed, they seem
unlikely to have played the main role.


    [Insert Figure 9 here: Explaining Average Trading Liquidity Patterns around Previously Declared
                                             Payment Dates]


     Liquidity: Dividend or tax trading should also have left an imprint on enhanced trading
patterns before and after the payment date. Table 9 plots the day-by-day average log
number of trades and log dollar volume (also obtained from CRSP). There were the tiniest
of up-blips in liquidity on days –1 and 0, but there were no increasing or decreasing trends
either before or after the payment. In the event windows used for calculating volatilities and
average returns, there was no increasing buying pressure before the payment or decreasing
selling pressure after the payment. Not shown, in unreported regressions, the after-payment
dummy regression coefficients in panel regressions explaining either liquidity variable were
insignificant.


D     Some Preliminary Seasoned Equity-Issuing Evidence

Are there corporate events other than dividend payments that are similarly suitable to
studying the effects of leverage?

     Equity repurchases are unfortunately not suitable for an analogous experiment, because
they tend to be spread over long time windows. Similarly, equity shelf-offerings are not



                                                  14
suitable for lack of clear event dates.10 The only other equity-related events with sharp
pre-announced event dates are seasoned equity offerings.

    There are some analogies. The dividends and issuing events are similar in that cash
is moved through the corporate wall in both cases, with specific predictions on leverage,
volatility, and average return. For intuition, consider a firm that has committed to keep
the raised funds for x days in cash and then purchase risky assets—say, for example, a
stock-market ETF. There are two cases to consider. On the one hand, if the purchase has
not yet been committed, the asset purchase price is floating, and the holding company
stock should be less risky for x days until the asset purchase and more risky thereafter. The
volatility and average return should be low (that of cash) until the asset purchase date and
high after (that of the market). On the other hand, if the asset purchase price has been
committed and fixed beforehand, as in a forward contract, then the volatilities and means
should not change. Thus, the leverage theory weakly predicts decreases in volatility and
average returns when equity offerings are executed.

    Yet the analogy breaks down in other ways. First, firms often issue both debt and equity
at the same time. Second, the ultimate decision to move the cash is not with the firm, but
with the investors. The probabilities that the event is canceled in the days before it occurs
is higher. If an offering is canceled, it could be good or bad news. If execution beliefs
had increased in the days before the actual issues, and equity offerings were bad news
per se (and not just via the irretractible signaling value through announcement of intent),
then firms could have first experienced abnormally low average returns that would not
have continued after the execution. This could have created a selection-based increase in
average returns after the actual issue.

    With these caveats, it is still interesting to look briefly at pre- and post-execution stock
returns for equity offerings. In early 2016, the Thomson SDC global issue database listed
1,131,497 offerings, of which 130,349 were corporate equity offerings. Removing IPOs
yielded 97,440 offerings, of which 20,010 occurred in the United States, 17,862 were not
privately placed, and 16,995 were identified as the issue containing the entire filing amount.
The need for a stock ticker, CUSIP, a filing date, an issue date, complete filing amount,
specific issue filing amount, primary shares sold, at least 10 days between filing and offering
date, and a merge with CRSP by CUSIP, left 9,569 corporate equity offerings.11 The WRDS
  10
     This is also why exchange offers, as in Korteweg (2004), are not suitable for this experiment. An exchange
offer is usually not executed on one sharp day, but over multiple weeks.
  11
     Some hand-checking revealed that the CRSP data are not a good data source for the number of shares
outstanding. CRSP is more (but not greatly) reliable at picking up reasonable number-of-shares estimates at
month-ends than mid-months. This is also why I did not attempt to measure the dilution.


                                                     15
event-study program yielded 7,859 offerings that had complete or near-complete stock
return histories from seven days before the offering to seven days after the offering, with
about 7,600–7,800 stock return days per event day.

  [Insert Table 8 here: Explaining Market-Adjusted Stock Returns Around Actual Share-Issue Dates,
                              Given Previously Declared Issue Intentions]


   Table 8 shows the results when I repeat an analogous-to-the-dividend study on these
identified equity issues in the set of same-issue market-adjusted stock returns around the
execution dates. The leverage theory predicts a decrease in average returns and volatilities.
Again, the theory is born out at conventional statistical significance levels for volatilities but
not for average rates of returns. The former decreased; the latter increased. The chosen
window from –6 to –3 versus +3 to +6 is conservative, in that pulling it one day closer to
the issue date would further increase the difference. A visual inspection reveals a pattern
similar to dividend payments: The leverage theory works well in predicting the decreases
in volatilities but not in predicting the increases for average returns.

   Again, I emphasize that equity issues are a more “sloppy” experiment than dividend
payments: The data are less reliable; other securities are more likely to be issued simultane-
ously; raised cash may have already been committed to risky projects and thus effectively
may be risky beginning on the day of the offering; and, while it is the firm that announces
the event, it is the investors who can choose not to participate. The equity offering experi-
ment is only mildly suggestive. It is interesting only to the extent that the stock returns
happened to exhibit the analogous patterns for equity issues as for dividend payments.




                                               16
III       Discussion

The empirical evidence in my paper is not disputing the evidence in Gomes and Schmid
(2010). Indeed, their study of long-term returns used book-to-market measures and the
stock returns from many calendar days that I did not even use in my study. My quasi-
experiment provides plausible inference on my short-term bases (i.e., a few days) but not on
their long-term bases (i.e., months).12 It requires that the dividends have been declared and
committed to, but not yet paid. The days around the payment have to be ignored, because
there could be first-order effects due to other aspects (e.g., tax or dividend-preference
trading). The studies simply explore the same hypothesis from different angles, and the
two angles yield different inference from different empirical data. Economic theories often
hold in some contexts, but not others.

       Stepping back, the leverage theory had made strong predictions about both risk and
return in this experiment. Even if they had been borne out, my paper’s findings would still
have been interesting. If anything, I would have preferred to find rational market behavior
akin to that in Gomes and Schmid (2010). The rationality aspect of the theory here was
neither sophisticated nor deep. It was simply that investors should have demanded and
earned more expected return for more risk.

       This leaves us with a mystery: Even if the average rate of return had stayed the same
(rather than declined), the leverage theory would have been rejected. But, worse: we
need an explanation not just for why financial markets ignored changes in leverage in their
determination of average returns, but even for why expected rates of return declined. Why
did the stock price appreciate too much before the payment?

       In this section, I discuss a number of possible theories (or “issues”) that could explain
the lower averages after the payment, even if these would have had to be strong enough
to overcome any simultaneously-present rational leverage force. But my conclusion is
that I cannot identify plausible non-behavioral theories that can explain both the volatility
increase and the average mean decrease at the same time.


Intrinsic Preferences: Perhaps, investors had intrinsic preferences about dividends or
         leverage. In the absence of independent measures of preferences, such a theory
         can explain any kind of pattern. It seems implausible, except perhaps as an ex-post
  12
    Indeed, when firms pay dividends every quarter, after 6 weeks, the post-payment period from the previous
payment becomes the pre-payment period for the next payment. Of course, the pattern already evens out after
a shorter time-frame. The design is also simply not amenable to testing long-term average return patterns.


                                                    17
     statement of finding. Investors behaved as if they had wanted to be present just in
     time to receive the dividends.

Timing: Even if corporate managers had the forecasting ability to time their dividend
     payments to occur on days when average stock returns would then be lower (which
     is dubious), naive versions of this hypothesis would require that investors would not
     have recognized this already at the moment of announcement. Dividend catering,
     as in Baker and Wurgler (2004), should similarly be reflected on the announcement
     date and not occur around the payment date, either. It seems implausible.

Selection Design and Survivorship Concerns: I am not aware of any cases in which a
     publicly-traded company retracted its dividend declaration (and such events would
     not have appeared in my CRSP sample). An increasing belief that the payment would
     occur in the days before the payment date could have been good news. Even if the
     dividend payment had not been paid but instead was completely dissipated, in order
     to explain the documented lower average returns, non-payments would have had
     to occur about 1-in-100 times, with hundreds of companies failing to pay declared
     dividends every year. It seems implausible.

Cash Holdings: Although it is the defeasance of the dividend that should matter and not
     the actual underlying risky investment patterns (see Pages 2 and 5), we can speculate
     about whether firms liquidated risky projects to pay dividends just days before the
     payment date.
     Realistically, it is likely that liquidation of ordinary risky projects into cash would
     occur more than 5-10 days before the payment, and dividend payments would be
     paid out of cash and short-term investments. Over time, firms would then replenish
     cash, either through cash flow or external financing. Farre-Mensa, Michaely, and
     Schmalz (2014) show that about a third of the dividends were externally financed.
     However, these were long-term finance patterns, and not likely to occur exactly at
     the dividend payment date. And, again, even if such managerial choices had had any
     influences on the average rate of return patterns, it is difficult to see how such an
     explanation could explain both averages and volatilities. It seems implausible.

Underlying Investment Activities: As with the previous point, although it is the defea-
     sance of the dividend that should matter and not the actual underlying risky invest-
     ment patterns, correlated changes in risk patterns—other than those directly due to
     the leverage change—seem unlikely. And again, even an explanation based on the


                                            18
       firm aggressively buying stock futures before the dividend payment and liquidating
       them afterwards cannot explain both means and volatilities.13 It seems implausible.

(Changes in) Growth Options: Again, as with the two previous hypotheses, growth op-
       tions are unlikely to explain simultaneous increases in variance and decreases in
       means. It is mentioned separately only because it was the explanation put forth in
       Gomes and Schmid (2010). While plausible and consistent in their contest, it seems
       implausible in this context.

Negative Loadings on Price-Relevant Factors: Dividend-paying stocks could have been
       the equivalent of extremely low-beta stocks, providing insurance to investors. By
       paying out dividends, the stocks become even better insurance instruments on factor-
       loadings against the unknown factors. (Market-betas, whose levels hovered around
       0.9-0.95, cannot be this factor.) It seems implausible.

Random Noise: The results could have been the draw of the sample, despite huge T-
       statistics, strong robustness in all specifications, years, event days, etc. Similarly,
       perhaps the ex-post outcomes happened not to reflect the ex-ante outcome by chance.
       It seems implausible.

Volatility Preferences: One unappealing hypothesis is that investors liked increases in
       idiosyncratic volatility so much that they bid up the price, leaving lower average rates
       of return after the payment-induced risk-increase.
       In unreported regressions, if the rate of return is explained with the absolute rate
       of return and the cross-effect post-payment dummy, it appears that it is the stocks
       with the higher post-event volatilities that experienced lower average returns after
       the payments.14 This suggests again that investors earned lower average rates of
       return when volatility increased because of the payment, and perhaps specifically
       because the payment increased volatility (Goyal and Santa-Clara (2003)). Although
       such a theory would also suggest that managers could increase shareholder value by
       gambling more aggressively, the problem here is still that the option-induced higher
       expected rates of return should have been reflected at the announcement. It seems
       implausible.
  13
     Besides, if firms could follow strategies with higher average returns and lower risk, why would they stop
doing so after the dividend payment?
  14
     When the mean is not-zero, then there is an association between returns and absolute returns. It should,
however, be weak.




                                                     19
       The design of the experiment suggests that the prevailing force was unlikely to have
been a firm-caused change. Instead, it was more likely an investor-caused effect. But what?
Quoting Sherlock Holmes, ”When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains,
however improbable, must be the truth.”

       The improbable theory in this context is that investors became infatuated with dividend
payments and bid up the price a little too much before the dividend. The historical
average rates of return were thus not reflective of investors’ true expected rates of return
because investors were naive and non-anticipatory. Put differently, the return patterns
could have been caused by a financial market which was non-blissfully ignorant of risks
and outlooks, with more levered companies having been exposed to more post-payment
risk (and malaise) more frequently. Thus, they could have had lower average rates of
return, with financial market prices not taking this added risk appropriately into account.
This explanation seems unappealing, but it is not entirely implausible—Lamont and Thaler
(2003) document even stranger law-of-one-price violations probably also due to investor-
demand effects. Their evidence appears in a small number of isolated stocks with close-to-
indisputable value evidence (and, of course, absence of easy arbitrage). It is sometimes
discounted as mere “aberrations” when investors were particularly irrational. The effects
documented in my paper are smaller but also more pervasive. Moreover, the findings
have direct implications for the broader issue of dividend payments—often considered
important corporate events—and the generic questions about the effects of leverage, risk
and return changes.15 Interestingly, although Baker, Hoeyer, and Wurgler (2016) (BHW)
explore Gomes-Schmid-like long-run performance and have overlapping implications (e.g.,
riskier firms choosing lower leverage), BHW interpret the evidence as suggestive of risk-
leverage mispricing. They then consider both the perspective and optimal behavior of the
corporation.




  15
    Benartzi, Michaely, and Thaler (1997) also conclude from stock return responses to dividends that the
financial markets do not seem rational, but their context and inference do not seem directly related.


                                                  20
IV        Conclusion

My paper has offered a direct quasi-experimental test for one of the clearest predictions of
classic rational asset-pricing theory—the effect of leverage.16 The empirical evidence in the
days around pre-declared dividend payments was consistent with the rational leverage-
theory view that risk should also have increased. However, the evidence was inconsistent
with the view that average rates of return should have increased. Investors did not receive
higher but lower average (expected) rates of return for equally risky projects with higher
leverage. This is not plausibly attributable to (news about) the underlying projects.

       The experimental design was “clean,” in that Gomes and Schmid (2010) simultaneous
changes in the investments or opportunities correlated with payment decisions should
have been incorporated into the traded equity prices at the moment of the dividend
announcements and not later—i.e., just before and just after the actual payment dates.

       In the context of the days around the dividend payments, it appears that the financial
markets were driven more by mysterious investor-demand forces than corporate-asset-
supply forces. More levered corporate assets seemed to have yielded lower average rates
of return, not because of growth options and type-of-firm selection effects, but because
investors either seemed to have “preferred” the less-levered pre-dividend corporate assets
for some reason, or they seemed to have bid up prices too much and thus were regularly
disappointed. Post-leverage change stocks earned lower average rates of return. In this
context, it should be noted that this “perverse” negative association between leverage and
expected rates of return in my short-term stock-return study is also in line with some—but
not all—earlier long-term monthly stock return regressions. It is also not inconsistent with
the view expressed in Hoberg and Prabhala (2009) that the volatility increase in Campbell
et al. (2001) could have had direct corporate finance implications—though perhaps in the
opposite direction.

       Yet, the behavioral investor preference here and in Baker, Hoeyer, and Wurgler (2016)
should not be viewed as mutually exclusive with respect to the rational growth-option
hypotheses in Gomes and Schmid (2010). More than likely, they both play roles in the
association of leverage with risk and returns. My paper does suggest, however, that
  16
    Kaplan, Moskowitz, and Sensoy (2013) provided perhaps the most prominent exception and a “gold-
standard” study—a real experiment in U.S. financial markets on the effect of short-sales constraints. Although
event studies have been quasi-experimental in design and have been in use for decades, more recent event
studies have not sought to test basic asset-pricing implications other than stock market efficiency at the
announcement. Moreover, it is not even clear how one would test factor asset pricing with an event study.
What would pre-identified exogenous shocks to equity factor betas in isolation of other changes be?


                                                     21
caution is appropriate when interpreting the empirical evidence. Before concluding that
the associations between leverage and returns are solely or primarily due to rational
responses to growth options based on book-to-market moments—especially in the absence
of direct empirical measures of the underlying within-firm growth options rather than
indirect inference measures from the book-to-market ratios—it seems appropriate not to
ignore non-arbitrageable, collectivist, imperfect-market (tax) and/or behavioral investor
preferences. Rational-leverage theories like Gomes and Schmid (2010) require stronger
tests that measure growth options more directly and/or break out other possible investor
demand-based forces, as observed in my paper and in Baker, Hoeyer, and Wurgler (2016).

   Future research could expand the scope of tests for the effects of leverage on stock
returns. The fact that average rates of return declined with leverage yields makes it possible
to contrast and/or embed the predictions of the rational-leverage theory with those of the
behavioral-finance theory. For example, one could jointly investigate the discrete short-term
evidence together with the slow long-term rate-of-return evidence. Did those instances in
which stocks showed certain patterns in short-term volatilities and average stock returns
around their dividend payments also show the same patterns in their year-long monthly
stock return volatilities and averages? To what extent were growth firms merely riskier,
and to what extent were they merely more disappointing? And, within and across book-
to-market stock-type portfolios were the high volatilities responsible for the low average
returns? In changes? Would it be possible to identify specific investor preferences for
leverage and growth firms from other contexts (e.g., analysts’ opinions) in order to give
more “bite” to the “demand preference” or “investor surprise” alternatives? Unlike the
short-run sharp evidence provided by the dividend-payment quasi-experiment in my paper,
such investigations will require many more assumptions.

Explanations: This table describes the time span between the declaration and the ex-date
in the sample. For simplicity, the ex-date is referred to as payment date in the paper. The
data source is CRSP. Only ordinary cash payment dividends (code 1232) are used.

Explanations: The samples are all CRSP “1232” (ordinary cash dividend) distributions with stock
return, price, and dividend yield data, from 1926 to 2015. The pre-window was either from –5 to
–2 or from –9 to –2, given that the payment was declared at least 7 days or 11 days, respectively,
before the payment. The post-window was either +2 to +5, or +2 to +9. The ex-day, the day before,
and the day after were always excluded. There were 2,343,728 (3,087,488) daily stock return
observations in the 5-day (9-day) window. When winsorization (Wnsr) was applied, it was for daily
returns at +20% and –20%. “ewretd” lines are stock returns net of the CRSP equal-weighted return.
“tb30ms” are net of the prevailing 30-day Treasury bill rate (from FRED). The absolute returns are
measures of volatility. The last row in Panel A (“Stddv”) is a statistic relative to the stock distribution
events means before and after the event separately (i.e., the 5d standard deviation is calculated
before the distribution over four days only). The dividend yield is with respect to a single dividend
distribution (never annualized) and always calculated once at the outset of the event window. The
windows and samples remain the same throughout most of the paper. Robustness checks later
confirm that neither is critical.

Explanations: Samples and variables are described in Table 2. Each line contains the
coefficients of one panel regression. The “after-dividend” dummy is 0 for days from −T
to −2 (inclusive) and 1 for days from 2 to T (inclusive). Other days were excluded. The
dividend declaration must have occurred at least two days before the start of the window.
The “stddv” rows explain the standard deviations of the rate of return (with respect to 4-day
averages). The more common “abs” rows explain the adjusted absolute rates of return.
The column labeled “Stdzd” coefficient is the plain coefficient multiplied by sd(x)/sd(y).
The column labeled “se-het” is the heteroskedasticity-adjusted standard error on the plain
coefficient.
Interpretation: The volatility after the dividend payment was higher, by about 1 bp per
day.

        Explanations: Samples and variables are described in Table 2. The regressions are the same as in Table 3, except that they
        include as regressors also the dividend-yield at the start of the event-window and the “cross”-variable, i.e., the Dividend Yield
        times the “After Dividend” Dummy.
        Interpretation: The volatility after the dividend payment was higher for higher-dividend yield events.

Explanations: The left plots required 11 days of data around the payment date (here defined as
the ex-date), the right plots required 19 days. Distributions in which the declaration dates were
less than 7 (11) days before the payment dates were excluded. Unlike the regressions in earlier
tables, the portfolios here were weighted based on the dividend-yield. The black arrow from days
–1 to +1 shows the expected change under the rational leverage hypothesis. The blue line shows
the post-payment mean.
Interpretation: Post-payment volatilities were higher than the pre-payment volatilities in line with
the theory.

           Black: Dividend Yield 1.0% to 2.0%.                       Blue: Dividend Yield > 2.0%

Explanations: Samples and variables are described in Table 2. The plot is similar to the
5-day market-adjusted window from the preceding Figure 1, but broken out by dividend
yield. For visual focus, the (regression-excluded) event-date volatilities are blotted out.
Interpretation: Post-payment volatilities were higher than the pre-payment volatilities
only for high-dividend yield events, roughly—but not perfectly—in line with the theory.

 Explanations: Samples and variables are described in Table 2. The sample is the same as
 that in Table 3, except that there is no absolute-value transformation on the dependent
 stock return variable.
 Interpretation: The average rate of return after the dividend payment was lower by about
 2-5 bp per day. With 4-8 day windows, this amounts to about 20-30 bp over the full
 windows.

       Explanations: Samples and variables are described in Table 2. The regressions are the same as in Table 5, except that they
       include as regressors the dividend yield and the cross variable of the “dividend yield times the post-payment dummy.”
       Interpretation: Only the cross-effect mattered. Firms paying more dividends appreciated more at the payment and then
       delivered lower returns thereafter. The dividend payment reduced the average daily rate of return by about 3bp for every 1%
       dividend yield. Over 4-8 day windows, this amounts to about 20-30bp.

Explanations: Samples and variables are described in Table 2. The four plots are, in
clockwise order, low-, mid-, high-, and all dividend payments. For each event day, the
average rate of return above the market is plotted, conditional on there having been at
least x days (with plot point size x) of data around the payment. Thus, for the –20 event
day, there is only a (size 20 px) rate of return of 0.05% in the high-dividend-yield, but
for the –2 event day, there are (slightly) different average rates of return depending on
whether one requires 2, ... 20 days of available rates of return on both sides of day zero.
For visual focus, the (regression-excluded) –1, 0, and +1 event-day volatilities are not
y-scaled and only –1 and +1 event-day volatilities are plotted but in red. The gray lines
are the selection-unconditional event-day means, where changes in composition in firms
are ignored.
Interpretation: Post-payment average returns were lower than the pre-payment volatilities
for high-yield dividend events, contrary to leverage theory. The selection window influences
the reported average return, but only moderately so. Even the selection-unconditional mix
of firms produces roughly the same inference.

Explanations: Samples and variables are described in Table 2. The plotted coefficients
are from cross-sectional market-model regressions—i.e., each event day, one regression
between the stock return and the equal-weighted market rate of return is run.
Interpretation: Post-payment market-betas were not higher than pre-payment market
betas. There is no clear pattern.

Explanations: Variables are described in Table 2. The sample here includes only 52,861
distributions in which the dividend yield was at least 1% and the sum of absolute returns
from eventdates -9 to -6 (inclusive) was at least 2%. Otherwise, the plots are identical to
earlier plots.
Interpretation: Average returns were higher before the payment date than after.

Explanations: Samples and variables are described in Table 2. These are the regression
coefficients of interest when each year is run by itself for the market-adjusted 5-day window.
The blue lines are for volatility: The solid blue line is on the “after-payment” dummy in a
bivariate regression, as in Table 3. The dashed blue line is on a multivariate regression for
the “cross” variable, as in Table 4. The red lines are for average returns: The solid red line
is on a bivariate regression “after-payment” dummy, as in Table 5. The dashed red line is
on a multivariate regression for the cross variable, as in Table 6. To fit on the same scale,
the cross-coefficients were divided by 100.
Interpretation: Although there may have been a contributions of personal dividend income
tax-related preferences to the dividend-payment effect, they could not have been too
powerful.

Explanations: The panel contains 81,058,017 observations, balanced to have an equal
number of stock returns on either side up to 21 days and with the requirement of knowledge
of the declaration. The regressions predict the market-adjusted event day rate of return
with the post-event dummy, and the payment day cum-to-ex return.
Interpretation: Events with more positive cum-to-ex returns also had (modestly) lower
post-dividend average returns. However, this makes no difference to the inference about
lower average rates of return after the dividend has been paid.

Explanations: This table explores stock return responses net of market returns around
seasoned equity offering issues dates, provided the offerings were announced well in
advance. There were about 7,700 per event day (in Panel A), for a sample of about 100,000
stock returns in the days from 3 to 6 days earlier (in Panel B).
Interpretation: As with dividends, the prediction of the leverage theory is born out for
volatilities but not for average returns

     • Assume that the previously-announced dividend to be payed out at time T = 1 is $1, that risky projects will earn an r̃ of either –10%
       or +10%, for a risk of ±10%, and that cash is risk-free. Double numbers in parentheses represent possible random outcomes.

     • If risk is zero or leverage is zero, these are the margin cases in which equity risk does not increase.

     • If risk is low, the assumption of a minimum rate of return of –10% assures full payment.

     • If leverage is low, the assumption of a minimum rate of return of –10% assures full payment.

     • Consider high-risk, high leverage. The debt face value of $100.8 is pinned down by the debt-equity ratio of $95-to-$5 and consistency
       of the example. The equity receives $98 · (1 + r̃) + $2 − $5 from a $5 investment for rates of return of ≈(−10.32%, +10.32%) with
       equal probability. After the payout, the equity is worth $94 (not $95), and the equivalent calculation yields (−10.43%, +10.43%).
