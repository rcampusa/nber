                                          ABSTRACT

This paper uses a lifecycle model to study household finance in China, focusing on the high
savings rate, the low stock market participation rate and the low share of stocks in wealth. We
control for important regime changes in China in the estimation of structural parameters, and
examine their impacts on household finance patterns. Relative to the US, the distinctive financial
choices of households in China are driven by institutional factors, such as labor market risks and
costs of asset market participation, as well as by differences in preferences. Specifically, large
stock market participation and adjustment costs along with high stock market volatility in China
lead to the relatively low stock market participation rate and the low share of stocks in wealth
conditional on participation, but they contribute little to the high savings rate. The high savings
rate in China is driven mainly by high labor market risks and the patience of households. Given
the estimated differences between China and the US in preferences, the model predicts that
households in China would continue to save more than their US counterparts even if institutional
differences disappear.

          This paper uses a lifecycle model to study household finance in China, focusing on the high savings rate,
      the low stock market participation rate and the low share of stocks in wealth. We control for important regime
      changes in China in the estimation of structural parameters, and examine their impacts on household finance
      patterns. Relative to the US, the distinctive financial choices of households in China are driven by institutional
      factors, such as labor market risks and costs of asset market participation, as well as by differences in preferences.
      Specifically, large stock market participation and adjustment costs along with high stock market volatility in
      China lead to the relatively low stock market participation rate and the low share of stocks in wealth conditional
      on participation, but they contribute little to the high savings rate. The high savings rate in China is driven
      mainly by high labor market risks and the patience of households. Given the estimated differences between
      China and the US in preferences, the model predicts that households in China would continue to save more than
      their US counterparts even if institutional differences disappear.



1     Introduction
As is well documented, the household savings rate in China is high, compared to most developed economies such
as the US. The average wealth-to-income ratio is about 14.67 in China compared with 4.46 in the US.1 This high
savings rate has drawn considerable attention as it impacts trade flows, international financial flows, the demand
for US Treasuries, the level of world economic activity, etc.
    This paper extends the literature on the high savings rate in China in two ways. First, it enriches the standard
household intertemporal optimization problem to include the interaction between savings, asset (stock) market

   1 The wealth-to-income ratio is defined as total wealth (including housing equity) divided by family income. It is calculated from the

2011 wave of China Household Finance Survey, and the seven waves of the Survey of Consumer Finance in the US between 1989-2007.
In the calculation households with zero income are excluded. The high wealth-to-income ratio in China reflects the high savings rate
in China as studied in, e.g., Chamon and Prasad (2010) and Chamon, Liu, and Prasad (2013).



                                                                   1

participation and portfolio composition. This adds an extensive margin to the standard model, allowing us to
study the extent to which the high savings rate comes from asset market participation decisions rather than just a
high savings rate by market participants. Further, the expanded model includes a portfolio choice dimension which
potentially interacts with wealth accumulation.
    Second, the paper looks forward and asks: what will the household savings look like in China as the country
further develops its financial market and labor market? Specifically, we take the US as the economy to which China
will eventually approach and study how household financial choices will evolve. This is an important exercise for
evaluating whether the high savings rate, with its various implications for the rest of the world, will persist.
    The analysis builds a lifecycle model to jointly study the following features of Chinese household financial choices:
(i) the low stock market participation rate, (ii) the low share of wealth in stocks conditional on participation,
and (iii) the high wealth-to-income ratio. We estimate the model parameters for both China and the US via
Simulated Method of Moments (SMM hereafter), exploiting country-specific variations of household finance patterns
by educational attainment and age. We distinguish preference parameters from institutional factors, including stock
market participation and adjustment costs as well as the exogenous processes for labor income and stock returns,
since we expect the latter to change as China further develops while the former may evolve slowly if at all.
    The structural estimation uncovers three key differences between the US and China. First, households in China
are more patient than those in the US.2 Second, the costs of stock market participation and portfolio adjustment
are larger in China. Third, the consumption floor which captures a country’s social safety net is lower in China.
These differences, along with the differences in labor income processes and in stock return process, are the main
drivers of the observed between-country disparity in savings rate and portfolio choice.
    Estimation of the model is challenging due to cohort effects in the data moments which may bias our estima-
tion and predictions. These cohort effects stem from the significant regime changes experienced by the Chinese
households at different stages in their lives.3 The traditional approach to address this issue uses cohort dummies
and long repeated cross sectional data to purge the data of cohort effects. This approach is infeasible in our setting
as there is only one cross section of data publicly available in China with enough details and coverage to study the
financial choices of households – the 2011 wave of China Household Finance Survey (CHFS hereafter).4 Instead,
our innovative approach is to incorporate cohort effects into the model rather than to purge them from the data.
We solve the lifecycle optimization problems of different cohorts in the 2011 CHFS, taking the regime changes
that occurred at cohort-specific ages explicitly into account. Thus the resulting optimal decision rules reflect the
cohort-specific impacts of regime changes. We pool the simulated data for various cohorts together to calculate the
household finance moments in 2011 that are comparable to the moments calculated from the 2011 CHFS.
    This estimation strategy allows us to study the impacts of historical regime changes on household finance
patterns in China. We show that both housing reform and labor market reform have led to higher wealth-to-
   2 Given the long agricultural tradition in China, the low time preference and high savings rate seem consistent with Galor and Ozak

(2016).
   3 For example, the cohort aged 40 in a 2011 survey should be strongly affected by the housing reform around 2000 when they were

30, while the cohort aged 65 in 2011 should be strongly affected by the re-opening of the stock market around 1990 when they were 45.
   4 CHFS conducted several follow-up surveys since 2011, but only the 2011 wave is publicly available.




                                                                  2

income ratios. In the future, when the economy is unaffected by these regime changes, we predict that Chinese
households will save even more, have much higher participation rates in the stock market, and have higher stock
shares in total wealth.
    Our analysis uncovers interactions between savings and portfolio composition that provides new insights into
the financial choices of Chinese households and helps to predict future developments. On the one hand, the level
of savings and thus wealth accumulation strongly affects portfolio composition: wealthier households have lower
per unit costs of stock market participation and adjustment. On the other hand, some factors influence asset
market participation and portfolio composition, but affect savings only marginally. For example, imposing the US
stock return process on China significantly changes stock shares but has only a limited impact on the wealth-to-
income ratio. Overall we find that asset market underdevelopment in China, as captured by the large stock market
participation and adjustment costs and the low Sharpe ratios, does not contribute to the high savings rate.
    We perform a series of counterfactual experiments in which China adopts the US institutions. We show that
if China adopts the US labor market that features lower income uncertainty and a larger consumption floor, then
Chinese households on average will lower their wealth-to-income ratio by more than 50%. Alternatively, if China
adopts the US financial market but preserves its own labor market features, then about 90% of households will
participate in the stock market due to the higher Sharpe ratio and lower stock market related costs which are
further dwarfed by the large wealth accumulation. Further, if China converges to the US in terms of both the
labor market and the financial market, then stock share in total wealth of the Chinese households will be close to
the US data, and the wealth-to-income ratio will be lowered but is still significantly higher than in the US data.
In other words, Chinese households will continue to save more than their US counterparts even after institutional
differences completely disappear, unless their preferences change.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents data facts about household finance in China
and compares them with US patterns. Section 3 introduces the structural model where the optimization problem
of households and the key market frictions are laid out. Section 4 discusses the estimation strategy and reports
estimation results, including the impacts of regime changes. Section 5 focuses on the interaction between wealth
accumulation, asset market participation and portfolio composition. Section 6 discusses what drives the large US-
China disparity in household finance patterns, and predicts the patterns in China as the country approaches the
US in terms of its financial market and labor market. Section 7 concludes.

                       This table reports the participation rate (Part.), the share of stocks in household
                       portfolio for participants, the mean wealth-to-income ratio (W/I) for Chinese and
                       US households by educational attainment. Data for China are from the CHFS (2011).
                       Data for the US are from the SCF (1989-2007). Households whose heads have at least a
                       high school diploma are defined as high education households In calculating Share(h)
                       and W (h)/I housing equity is included in wealth. Standard errors are reported in
                       parentheses.


    We focus on three dimensions of household financial decisions: (i) the stock market participation rate, (ii) the
share of stocks in household portfolio conditional on participating in the stock market, and (iii) the wealth-to-
income ratio. A household is considered a stock market participant if it holds stocks either directly or indirectly
through mutual funds. Throughout the paper, calculation of the wealth-to-income ratio is based on total family
income which includes the sum of family members’ labor income and transfers from the government that are not
needs-based.6
    The table presents two measures of wealth: financial wealth and total wealth (the sum of financial wealth and
net housing equity). Correspondingly, ‘share(h)’ is the stock share relative to the total wealth while ‘share’ is
relative to financial wealth. Likewise, ‘W(h)/I’ is the ratio of total wealth relative to income, while ‘W/I’ is defined
on the basis of financial wealth.
    As shown in the table, the average wealth-to-income ratio is about 3-4 times larger in China than in the
US when housing is included in wealth. Once housing is excluded from the wealth measure, the wealth-to-income
ratios naturally are lower and the differences across countries are less pronounced. In both countries, more educated
households have higher wealth-to-income ratios, and this education gradient of the wealth-to-income ratio is larger
in the US than in China. It is also noteworthy that housing is a more important component of wealth for the less
educated households in both countries.
    The stock market participation rate is much lower in China. This is the case for both education groups. In
both countries participation rises with educational attainment.
    5 Only 12.4% of the population is in the high education group in China based on the 2010 census data. The corresponding number

is 58.9% in the US, as reported in https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2016/demo/p20-578.pdf. A
finer breakdown by educational attainment is not feasible due to the limited observations of households with college or post-graduate
education in the CHFS sample.
    6 Needs-based transfers are included in the “consumption floor” in our structural model. The wealth-to-income ratio is calculated

based on after-tax income for China but before-tax income for the US. The CHFS reports after-tax income only, while the SCF reports
only before-tax income.


                                                                 4

    For stock market participants, the stock share in total wealth in the US is 2-3 times larger than in China.
Excluding housing, stock share in financial wealth is close to 50% in both countries. For both countries, the stock
share rises with education.



3     Household Dynamic Optimization
To understand the above household finance patterns, we build a dynamic optimization model of saving and portfolio
choice over the lifecycle. In the presentation of the model, there is no explicit index of education nor any indicator
of the country. It is implicit that a household from country i with education e will face the labor market and
financial market conditions for that education and country pair. For simplicity of notation the cohort index of the
Chinese households is also omitted.


3.1     Basic Assumptions
Households live up to T periods with some death probability in each period, and work for the first T r < T periods of
life conditional on survival. During the working phase of life, households earn stochastic income. During retirement,
households receive deterministic income, but face stochastic out-of-pocket medical expenses.7 In our quantitative
analysis, we assume households work for 40 years, between age 21-60 in China and 26-65 in the US, and assume
households die with probability one by age 91.8 .
    Households have access to two types of assets: bonds and stocks. Bonds are risk-free and perfectly liquid,
but stocks are risky and illiquid in the sense that it is costly for households to enter the stock market and costly
to adjust stock holdings. Thereby the model emphasizes two key discrete choices of households: stock market
participation and portfolio adjustment.
    Housing is bundled with the traditional risk-free and low-return assets such as bank deposits to form a composite
asset, i.e. the bonds. Housing returns in China have a very low standard deviation which provides justification for
this bundling.9 The implied costless housing adjustment assumption is assessed in Appendix E.3 where we compare
the bond change rates from the simulated data to the proportion of liquid asset in composite bond holdings found
in the 2011 CHFS data, and show that the liquid proportion in the composite bond is generally sufficient for
households to smooth their consumption against income and medical expense shocks.
    Following Cagetti (2003), for both China and the US, we assume that nondurable consumption, ĉ and housing
services h are combined through a Cobb-Douglas function, c = ĉ1−φ hφ . In this way, housing services are included
in the composite consumption c.10
   7 The importance of income uncertainty and medical expenses in explaining the high savings rate in China is explored in Chamon

and Prasad (2010) and Chamon, Liu, and Prasad (2013).
   8 In the Chinese data the average probability of death is 19.1%, 21.7% and 45.4% for those aged between 90-94, 95-99 and over 100.
   9 The standard deviations of housing return and stock return in China are 0.075 and 0.515 respectively, according to Fang, Gu,

Xiong, and Zhou (2015).
  10 We set φ = 0.24 in the quantitative analysis and note that the value of this parameter is not important for our moments.

3.2       Participant
Let Ω = (y, m, A, Rs ) represent the current state of the household where y and m denote income and medical
expense respectively. A = (Ab , As ) summarizes the current holdings of bonds and stocks respectively and Rs is the
return on stocks.
       A household that is currently holding stocks, i.e. a participant, chooses between three alternatives: (i) portfolio
adjustment, (ii) no adjustment, and (iii) exiting the stock market by selling all stocks. This choice is given by:


                                                 Vt (Ω) = max{Vta (Ω), Vtn (Ω), Vtx (Ω)}                                 (1)


for all Ω. The subscript t in the value functions denotes the age of households. Value functions are age-dependent
due to the finite horizon of households in the model. For both the state variables and control variables, we omit
age subscripts but use primes to denote variables of the next period.
       If the household adjusts its portfolio, it chooses the holdings of stocks and bonds to attain a value of:

where c is the current period consumption, νt+1 is the death probability between age t and t + 1. Et denotes the
expectation with respect to future income, medical expenses and stock returns. Bt+1 is the bequest value if the
household dies, and γ is the relative risk aversion. The household’s future value is summarized by the term in the
brackets which depends on the degree of uncertainty and risk aversion.
       θ is the elasticity of inter-temporal substitution (EIS) that determines the substitutability between the current
consumption the future consumption summarized in the future value. With this recursive representation following
Epstein and Zin (1989) and Weil (1990), two key aspects of household choices, namely risk aversion and the EIS,
are estimated independently.11
       The bequest value as a function of state variables is given by:

                                                     0       0   0                   0      0   0
                                              B(Rb Ab + Rs As ) = L × (Rb Ab + Rs As ).                                  (5)

                                                                                                                           0
where L determines the strength of bequest motives. This bequest value is stochastic because the stock return Rs
is a random variable. The effect of risk aversion on bequest value appears in the parameter γ in equation (2).
       In the choice set of equation (2), Ab is the lower-bound of bond holdings. In the quantitative analysis below,
we find that treating Ab as an additional free parameter does not improve the fit of the model. Therefore Ab = 0
  11 As   reported in Cooper and Zhu (2016), this recursive utility formulation fits the moments for the US best.

is imposed.
       The F in equation (3) represents the cost of stock adjustment, including fees paid as well as time costs incurred.
In Bonaparte, Cooper, and Zhu (2012) and Cooper and Zhu (2016), this cost is used, in part, to match portfolio
adjustment rates. Although no data exists on adjustment rates for Chinese stock market participants, the stock
adjustment cost leads to lower stock market participation and lower stock share for participants, therefore is
identifiable.
       Equation (4) is the transfer to the household that is associated with the consumption floor of c. This feature
of the model is taken from Hubbard, Skinner, and Zeldes (1995) and DeNardi, French, and Jones (2010). Based
upon the results reported in Cooper and Zhu (2016), this institutional feature is important for matching the
wealth-to-income ratio of relatively poor households.
       A household that participates in the stock market but chooses not to adjust its stock account is able to freely
adjust its bond account. That is, if the household chooses not to adjust its portfolio, then the cost F is avoided

where the return on stocks is automatically reinvested into the stock account, i.e. As0 = Rs As . By assumption,
bond adjustment is costless. Recall that bonds are defined as a composite of the low-return liquid assets (e.g. bank
deposit) and housing asset. If the amount of bond adjustment is larger than the holdings of low-return liquid assets,
then the adjustment involves housing transaction which is clearly not costless. As mentioned earlier, we assess this
assumption in Section E.3.
       A participant may also choose to exit the stock market. This is likely to be optimal when a large negative shock

3.3        Non-participant
A household currently not holding stocks can, at a cost, enter the stock market. Or the household can remain a
non-participant. The values for this participation decision are given by:


                                                  Wt (Ω) = max{Wtn (Ω), Wtp (Ω)}                                       (6)


where Wtn (Ω) is the value of remaining a non-participant and Wtp is the value of becoming a participant.
       The optimization problem of a non-participant who remains a non-participant is:

Though not holding stocks, the household can adjust its bond account to smooth consumption.
       If a non-participant switches its status and decides to purchase stocks, it must pay a participation cost of Γ.
There is no lag so that the household can instantly trade in the stock market. The value of participating for the
first time is given by:

3.4        Preference Parameters and Institutional Parameters
Parameters in the model can be split into two groups. The first group characterizes financial market and labor
market conditions, are hence called “institutional parameters”. Financial market parameters are the stock market
entry cost Γ, the adjustment cost F , the bond return Rb , and parameters related to the stock return process. Labor
market parameters are parameters related to labor income process, medical expense process and the consumption
floor c.
       The second group of parameters, called “preference parameters”, includes the discount factor β, the coefficient
of risk aversion γ, the EIS θ, and the bequest motives L.
       In the quantitative analysis below, parameters related to the income and medical expenses processes, and return


                                                                   8

processes, are estimated from the data directly. That is, they are estimated outside the household optimization
problem. The remaining parameters are estimated via SMM, including the preference parameters, the consumption
floor, the stock market entry cost and the adjustment cost.



4         Quantitative Analysis
For the SMM approach, the vector of parameters Θ ≡ (βi , Γ, F, γ, θ, c, L), solves the following problem:


                                          £ = minΘ (M s (Θ) − M d )W(M s (Θ) − M d )0                                                (7)

where W, the weighting matrix, is the inverse of the variance-covariance matrix of the moments. Note that the
discount factor, βi , is indexed by i = 1, 2 where i = 1 denotes the low education group and i = 2 denotes the high
education group.12 The simulated moments, M s (Θ), are calculated from data created by simulating the decision
rules derived from the household optimization problem.
    In the presence of stock market participation costs, the status of being a participant itself has some value.
Therefore the initial allocation of assets could be important. For the US model we take as an input the joint
distribution of stocks and bonds for households aged between 25-30 in the SCF. For China neither of the two
cohorts in the model has stock holdings when they enter the economy since the stock market became active only
after 1990.


4.1       Regime Changes
In working with the Chinese data there is an important challenge: the available data have a time span that is too
short to use the traditional dummy regression approach to control for cohort effects stemming from multiple regime
changes in China. We consider two cohorts: a young cohort that is 35-45 years old in 2011 and an old cohort that
is 60-70 in 2011. Obviously they have experienced each regime change at different ages, hence their households
finance patterns are affected differently, which makes the inference from a single cross sectional data difficult.
    Figure 1 lists the key regime changes we consider and their timing. As the figure shows, the stock market in
China re-opened in 1990.13 Thus for the old cohort, stock market was simply not accessible until they were 40
years old. However the young cohort has had access to stock markets ever since they first entered the labor market.
    Housing reform is another important regime change. Prior to housing reform there was no active residential
housing market, instead houses were mostly allocated through employment. In 1998, the State Council in China
issued the 23rd Decree which banned work units from developing new residential houses for their employees in any
form. After 2000, house prices started to take off, and the average real growth rates of house prices in many cities
  12 Inexperiments where, in addition to the difference in the discount factor, we also allow difference in either the participation cost
or the adjustment cost, the estimation results indicate that these additional differences are statistically insignificant.
  13 The Shanghai Stock Exchange re-opened on December 19, 1990 after being closed for forty years since 1950. The Shenzhen Stock

Exchange also started to operate on December 1, 1990.

have exceeded 10% per year since 2005. We will return to this point in Section 4.2.3 when we calibrate the return
processes for stocks and bonds.
      The changes in the labor market are related to the rise of private and foreign enterprises, the privatization
of collectively owned enterprises, as well as the reform of state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The reform of SOEs,
implemented mainly by Premier Rongji Zhu, is particularly impactful as shown in He, Huang, Liu, and Zhu
(2014). By the beginning of 2000s, the SOEs had mostly been transformed into so-called “modern enterprises”
that essentially maximize profits, with the freedom to set wages and layoff workers.
      An obvious effect of labor market reform in China is the gradual rise of the college premium which is shown
in Figure 4 in Appendix A.3. This point is also evident in Figure 2 where we plot the age profiles of income
estimated from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) between 1989-2011: the income gap between the
two education groups is clearly larger in the post-2000 era. The figure also shows a significant change in the shapes
of income profiles.
      The stochastic process of income has also changed dramatically in China. Section 4.2.1 describes how we model
and estimate the process, and reports the related parameters in Table 2. Compared to the pre-2000 era, income
shocks are both larger and more persistent after 2000. This is especially true for the more educated group. Similar
changes about income risks are documented in He, Huang, Liu, and Zhu (2014).
      Our approach to estimation is to include the cohort effects from these changes in our model, rather than remove
them from the data. For each education group we solve the dynamic optimization problem, taking each regime
change as a surprise. Using access to the stock market as an example, we assume that prior to 1990 various cohorts
make financial decisions based on the expectation of no stock market in their lifetime. In 1990 the stock market
re-opened and households re-solved their lifetime optimization problem given the new opportunity, assuming the
new regime is to last forever. Clearly this re-optimization is cohort-specific.
      Thus our optimal decision rules incorporate regime changes, and the household finance moments calculated
from the simulated data are comparable to those from the 2011 CHFS data. By matching these model moments
with the data moments, we obtain unbiased estimates of the structural parameters.

4.2      Exogenous Processes
As presented in this section, households in China and the US differ in exogenous income processes, medical expenses
processes and mortality rates. In addition, the asset return processes in the two countries differ, with a significantly
lower Sharpe ratio in China. These country-specific processes are taken as exogenous inputs in the estimation of the
model. In section 6.1 we further study the mapping between these exogenous differences and the between-country
disparity in household finance patterns.


4.2.1     Income

Income processes for the Chinese households are estimated using the panel data of CHNS 1989-2011. Appendix A.3
provides more details about the data. Household income is decomposed into a deterministic component and a
stochastic component. For each education group, we regress the logarithm of household income on a constant,
age, age-squared, year dummies (to remove aggregate shocks and growth) and a set of demographic variables. The
deterministic component is the income predicted using the coefficients on age and age-squared. The stochastic
component is estimated based on the regression residuals.


Deterministic Income Profiles: The deterministic component of income over the lifecycle is shown in Figure
2. Income levels are re-scaled so that the average of the two education groups is one.
      For China, the rising education premium is apparent.14 On average income of the high education group is
18% higher than the low education group in pre-2000 data, but the number becomes 54% in post-2000 period. In
the US the corresponding number is 78% in our PSID sample between 1989-2009. Therefore despite the fact that
education premium has risen considerably in China, it is still small relative to the US.
      Compared with the pre-2000 income profile, the hump shape is less pronounced in the post-2000 regime in
China. Relative to the US data, the hump shapes in post-2000 China are also much less pronounced. This would,
all else the same, lead to less savings in China.


Stochastic Processes: Letting ỹi,t denote the residual from the income regression for household i in period t,
we further decompose it into transitory and persistent shocks:


                                                         ỹi,t = zi,t + i,t
                                                       zi,t = ρzi,t−1 + ηi,t                                                    (8)


where i,t and ηi,t are independent zero-mean random shocks, with variances σ2 and ση2 respectively. The shock
ηi,t is persistent, with the persistence parameter denoted ρ.
      The stochastic income process is summarized in the education-specific parameters {ρ, ση2 , σ2 }. We estimate
them by matching the variances and serial correlations of income implied by the above two equations with those
  14 Note this is not the college premium, but the difference in income between the high education group with at least a high school

diploma and the low education group without.

      After labor market reform in China, income shocks are more persistent and the variances of persistent shocks
are larger, which is evident in Table 2. There are two notable between-country differences. First, the variances of
both persistent and transitory income shocks are much larger in China than in the US. Second, income shocks are
less persistent in China relative to the US. Overall households in China face much riskier income than in the US.15


4.2.2       Medical Expenses and Mortality

For China, data on out-of-pocket medical expenses are extracted from the China Health and Retirement Longitu-
dinal Study (CHARLS). We use the 2011 and 2013 waves of the survey to estimate the deterministic and stochastic
medical expense processes. More details about the data and sample selection are provided in Appendix A.3.
      For each education group, we regress the ratio of out-of-pocket medical expenses to income on a quadratic

function of age. The left panel of Figure 3 shows the predicted profiles for China. Clearly, relative to their income,
less educated households are subject to higher out-of-pocket medical expenses in China, which is in sharp contrast
with the US profiles based on the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) between 1996-2008, shown in the right
panel. Also compared with the US households, the out-of-pocket medical expense in China has much flatter age
profiles, but the average levels are higher, especially for the less educated group.
      The stochastic process of out-of-pocket medical expense is estimated with the same procedure used for the
income process. These results are presented in Table 3. For comparison, we also show the process for the US as
estimated in DeNardi, French, and Jones (2006). Apparently Chinese households are subject to larger and more
persistent medical expense shocks. The more educated Chinese receive larger shocks, but the shocks tend to be
less persistent.
      Another exogenous input in the structural model is the age-dependent death probability. For China the death
probability is obtained from the mortality table based on the 2010 census, available at http://www.stats.gov.
cn/tjsj/pcsj/rkpc/6rp/html/A0604a.htm. For the US it is estimated from the HRS with the same estimation
procedure as in DeNardi, French, and Jones (2010). The between-country difference is small, which is partly
reflected in the average life expectancy of 76.1 in China and 79.3 in the US as calculated by the World Health

4.2.3     Asset Returns

Returns on stocks and bonds, both in real terms, are calculated directly from the data. Details on data sources
and calculation methods are presented in Appendix A.3.1.
      Real stock returns include dividends and capital gains. The mean stock return in China is 10.07% with a
standard deviation of 0.47. The high mean return and high standard deviation are consistent with the findings in
Fang, Gu, Xiong, and Zhou (2015) that reports the mean and standard deviation of stock return to be 7.3% and
0.515 respectively between 2003-2013.
      Bonds in our model are a composite of housing and the traditional low-risk liquid assets such as bank deposits
and treasury bills. Housing is bond-like as an asset since its return has a very small standard deviation.17 The real
return on the traditional low-risk assets is 1.8%, and the average return on housing is 6.28%. In our 2011 CHFS
sample, housing accounts for 81.5% of the sum of housing and the traditional low-risk assets. Therefore we put a
weight of 0.815 on housing and a weight of 0.185 on the traditional low-risk assets to reach a return of 5.45% for
the composite bond.
      In comparison, in the US the average stock return is 6.33% and the standard deviation is 0.155 based on Robert
Shiller’s online data on the S&P 500 for the 1947-2007 period. As discussed in Cooper and Zhu (2016), in the
US the return on similarly defined composite bond is 4.08%. The Sharpe ratio based on our definition of riskfree
composite bond is 0.145 in the US and 0.091 in China.18 Therefore the risk-adjusted return is much higher in the
US stock market.
      Since there is no active housing market prior to the regime change in 2000, we set the return on the composite
bond to 1.8% which is the return on the traditional low-risk assets.


4.3      Moments
China: Data moments for China are summarized in the top panel of Table 4. The “young cohort” and “old
cohort” refer to the two cohorts aged 35-45 and 60-70 in the 2011 CHFS as illustrated in Figure 1. The moments
are obtained by regressing the elements of household financial decisions on the dummies of the following four
cohort-education pairs: young with low education, young with high education, old with low education, and old
with high education, controlling for housing effects.19 The omitted group represents households of any educational
attainment in neither the 35-45 or 60-70 cohort. Using the simulated data which also contain cohort effects, we
run the same regression to obtain the model moments.
  16 Using a similar model Cooper and Zhu (2016) finds that education-specific mortality has only marginal effects on household finance

moments.
  17 Fang, Gu, Xiong, and Zhou (2015) reports a standard deviation of housing return of 0.075 for smaller and median-sized cities

between 2003-2013.
  18 Excluding housing from the bond return, the Sharpe ratio is about 0.30 for the US and 0.16 for China.
  19 The presence of an unmarried son is also a significant regressor and its effect on wealth accumulation is consistent with Wei and

Zhang (2011)), but it does not influence the moments we match.

      Our optimization model does not include a home ownership choice although it influences portfolio decisions
as shown in Cocco (2005) and Yao and Zhang (2005). Therefore in obtaining the moments related to stock
market participation, we include in the regression two housing related variables: a home ownership dummy and
the logarithm of home equity value. By controlling for these variables the data moments are purged of their effects,
hence are comparable with the model moments. The effects of home ownership and home equity on participation
are reported in Table 10 in Appendix A.2 for both China (based on CHFS) and the US (based on SCF).20 The
role of housing as a component of wealth is captured in the moments related to stock share and wealth-to-income
ratio, since we include housing wealth in the composite bond.


US: Following Cooper and Zhu (2016), we regress each of the three household financial decisions on a constant,
age, age-squared, an education dummy, and year dummies.21 For the participation decision, the regression also
includes a home ownership dummy and the logarithm of housing equity. Table 5 summarizes the data moments
obtained from the regressions and used in the estimation of the parameters for the US economy.


4.4        Estimation Results
Table 6 presents parameter estimates for both China and the US. For China, the estimated discount factor of 0.877
for the low education group is considerably lower than 0.959 for the high education group. For the US the discount
factor is also higher for the high education group, though this difference is not statistically significant. Importantly,
the discount factors for China are much higher than for the US.
      The estimated risk aversion is γ = 7.395 for China which is higher than γ=6.469 for the US, though the difference
  20 For both countries, home ownership is negatively correlated with stock market participation, but home equity is positively correlated
with it. The effects of home ownership and home equity on stock share in total wealth are statistically insignificant. These results are
consistent with Chetty, Sndor, and Szeidl (2017).

is not statistically significant due to the relative large standard errors of the two estimates.22 For neither country
is 1/γ close to θ, so the traditional CRRA preference specification is rejected. The estimated bequest motives for
China and the US are fairly close to each other.23
      The estimated EIS for China is θ = 0.493, significantly lower than the θ = 0.893 for the US. The small estimate
for China is partly driven by the small gap in the wealth-to-income ratio between education groups. As shown in
the counterfactual experiments reported in Table 8, imposing a larger EIS on China widens this gap by lowering
ratios of the low education group and raising ratios of the high education group. Intuitively, income of the low
education group falls quickly after middle age, and given a higher EIS, they care less about low consumption in the
old age hence accumulate less wealth. On the other hand, for the high education households who have a larger β
and a relatively steeper income profile, a larger EIS induces them to sacrifice more consumption in the young age
and accumulate more wealth.
      The consumption floor is reported as a fraction of average household income in a country. The estimated floor is
7.9 percent in China or about 736 Yuan. The estimated consumption floor in the US is 26.4 percent, about 3.3 time
larger than that in China. Considering the income disparity between China and the US, the gap in consumption
floors is even larger in dollar value.
      The estimated cost of stock market participation is very high in China: 25.5% of the average income. The high
entry cost is needed to match the relatively low stock market participation rate in China. The cost is considerably
higher than the US estimate of 0.028, i.e. 2.8% of the average US household income. Using an average disposable
household income of $85 thousand for the US and $9.3 thousand in China, the participation cost is estimated at
$2,380 in the US and $2,375 in China, hence the costs are about the same in terms of dollar values.24 The estimated
  22 The estimates of γ of the two countries can be assumed to be independently and normally distributed, thus their difference has a
                      √
standard deviation of 0.6542 + 0.2412 = 0.697, and the t-stat of the difference is (7.395 − 6.469)/0.697 = 1.33.
  23 The bequest motive is identified through the size of wealth at old age which could be driven by purely altruism or selfish preferences.

Horioka (2014) finds that bequests of the US households appear to be more consistent with altruistic preferences while those of the
Chinese households appear to be more consistent with selfish preferences.
  24 The average household income in China is calculated from our sample of the 2011 CHFS which is 58,021 RMB, or about 9,313 USD

using the exchange rate at the end of 2011. For the US, the 2010 wave of SCF shows that the mean and the median family income are

adjustment cost of 0.051 in China is also significantly higher than the cost of 0.016 in the US, but it is actually
smaller in dollar terms.
      Table 14 in Appendix C reports the elasticities of the simulated moments with respect to parameter values.
Obviously moments associated with stock market participation and stock share are very sensitive to stock adjust-
ment cost F , which explains why F is estimated precisely with a small standard error. The wealth-to-income ratio
moments are sensitive to the discount factors and the consumption floor.

           £ is the difference between model moments and data moments as described in equation (7).


      The simulated moments for China are reported in Table 4. The model matches the participation moments
quite well, capturing both the effects of education and cohort. The dependence of stock share on both cohort and
education is relatively small in the data, and so is in the model. The model is unable to adequately capture the level
of the wealth-to-income ratio which is the constant term in the regression, partly because this data moment has
a large standard error so the minimization procedure puts less weight on it. The model does succeed in matching
the higher wealth-to-income ratio for both the older and more educated households.
      The simulated moments for the US are reported in Table 5. The estimated model captures the effects of age
and education on participation, share and wealth-to-income ratio fairly well. The constants from the regressions
are less well-fit, again because these moments have large standard errors.


4.5      Impact of Regime Changes
Since we incorporate regime changes into the structural model, we are able to quantitatively examine the effects
of regime changes on household finance patterns. Table 7 compares household finance moments from the baseline
model with moments from the counterfactual experiment in which each household lives in the completely new
regime without experiencing the regime changes illustrated in Figure 1. Differences in moments are precisely the
cohort effects caused by these regime changes.
      Overall the impacts of regimes changes are economically significant. As shown in the table, without these
regimes changes households in China would have higher stock market participation rates, higher stock shares and
higher wealth-to-income ratios. This is true for each age and education group, but the older and more educated
households are subject to stronger cohort effects. For example, their participation rate would be 50.7% in the
absence of cohort effects, compared with 20.5% in the presence of cohort effects. The higher wealth-to-income
ratios indicate that households would have even higher savings rate in the completely new regime.

               This table compares moments from the baseline model with cohort effects with moments from the coun-
               terfactual experiment without cohort effects. The distance is calculated using equation (9). The total
               distance is the sum of distances in participation, stock share, and W/I. The p-value shows the probability
               that the realized distance is even larger than the calculated distance under the null that the counterfactual
               model is identical to the baseline model.


      More details about how each individual regime change impacts household financial choices are reported in
Appendix D. There it is clear that the higher wealth-to-income ratio in the new regime is mainly driven by the
riskier income processes and the higher return on housing investment. In particular, the change of return on housing
has a sizable effect. The higher wealth level after regime changes diminishes the per unit stock market entry and
adjustment costs, leading to the higher participation rates and stock shares in total wealth.
      Table 7 also reports the distances between the counterfactual moments and the baseline moments, pertaining
to participation, stock share, wealth-to-income ratio, respectively. The distance is calculated as

last column is the simple sum of the three types of distance.
      The p-values of the distances show the probability that the realized distances are even larger than these calcu-
lated distances under the null that the counterfactual model is identical to the baseline.25 As they indicate, both
stock market participation rates and stock shares are significantly impacted by the regimes changes statistically.
The impacts on wealth-to-income are also statistically significant at 10% level.
      Given the significant impacts of regimes changes, we refer to household finance moments from the completely new
regime as “China benchmark moments” in the counterfactual experiments presented below. The China benchmark
moments are purged of the cohort effects, thus are more comparable with moments in the US, and more relevant
to our analysis of how China may evolve in terms of household finance patterns.

4.6      Robustness
The estimation results above for China are quite robust to alternative specifications. We re-estimate the model
using the identity weighting matrix, alternative stock return processes, alternative bond return, and alternative
deterministic income. The resulting parameter estimates are quantitatively similarly to those from the baseline
estimation, and the model moments all exhibit the same patterns as in the data. Details on these alternative
specifications and results are reported in Appendix E.
      Thus far the estimation has exploited variations in household financial choices by educational attainment.
Household finance patterns in China also differ by sector of employment (i.e. state versus non-state sectors) and
by rural-urban status as shown in Table 13 in Appendix B. We also re-estimate the model using these variations
and report results in Appendix E. Since there is a strong correlation between educational attainment and sector of
employment or rural-urban status which is shown in Table 12, it is not surprising to see that parameter estimates
are all very close to the baseline estimation.
      Finally our analysis assumes there is no cost of adjusting the composite bond which includes housing. In reality
households frequently adjust their liquid assets due to various random shocks (e.g. income shocks and medical
expense shocks) on the one hand, and they only adjust the holdings of housing asset occasionally on the other
hand. Our assumption of costless bond adjustment could be too restrictive if the model-implied bond adjustment
exceeds the holdings of liquid assets observed in the actual data. As we show in Appendix E, since the holdings
of liquid asset in the CHFS data are sufficient for households in the model to buffer against income and medical
expense shocks, the model assumption that bonds can be adjusted without costs is not restrictive in the savings
decisions.



5       Interaction Between Wealth and Portfolio Composition
One contribution of our analysis is to go beyond the traditional focus on the Chinese savings rate to highlight the
role of stock market participation and portfolio composition. Here we demonstrate the richness of their interaction
as it helps to understand the factors leading to the high savings rate in China.
      Our approach is to sequentially change model parameters and examine the simulated moments. From this we
gain insights into the interaction between savings decision and portfolio choice. Given our emphasis on China vs
the US, we impose parameters from the US economy for the exogenous changes. Results with more significant
changes in moments are presented in Table 8. Full results for each parameter appear in Appendix F.
      Our experiments demonstrate that the level of savings and thus wealth accumulation strongly affects portfolio
composition. This is seen as we change the discount factors. As the table shows, imposing the smaller US discount
factors cause the wealth-to-income ratios to fall by 33-66% for different groups of households. Stock market
participation rates become near zero, and stock share in wealth falls tremendously for those who remain in the
market. The reason is intuitive: wealthier households have lower per unit costs of stock market participation and
adjustment.

   This table reports counterfactuals from imposing US parameters (one at a time) on the Chinese model, controlling for cohort
   effects. The CN benchmark are simulated from the completely new regime. The US data moments are taken from the SCF data
   between 1989-2007. The distance is calculated using equation (9). The total distance is the sum of distances in participation,
   stock share, and W/I. The p-value shows the probability that the realized distance is even larger than the calculated distance.



   Similarly, when the US θ is imposed on the Chinese economy, wealth-to-income ratios are lowered for the less
educated households but raised for the more educated. Consequently, the former allocates less wealth to the stock
market while the latter chooses to have more stock investment. Note that with the larger θ, households are more
willing to substitute inter-temporally, hence the lifecycle profile of wealth track income more closely. For the more
educated Chinese, the decline of income occurs later and to a less extent as shown in Figure 2, hence their wealth-
to-income ratio is raised by a larger θ. Conversely, wealth-to-income ratio of the less educated are lowered by the
larger θ.
   Our results also highlight a situation where some factors impact asset market participation and portfolio com-
position with relatively little affect on savings and wealth accumulation. Reducing the stock market entry cost Γ to
the US level, participation rates rise by 23-369%, but this institutional improvement generates only a 1-3% increase


                                                                 20

in wealth-to-income ratios. Lowering the stock adjustment cost F to the US level also leads to significantly higher
participation rates, but it causes only a 0.2-0.8% increase in wealth-to-income ratios.26 Imposing the US stock
return process causes participants to hold significantly higher stock shares, but this again generates only modestly
higher wealth-to-income ratios.
    The underdevelopment of asset market in China is partially captured in our model by the high costs associated
with stock market participation and stock adjustment, as well as the high variability of stock returns. The above
experiments indicate that they lead to less (not more) wealth accumulation, and the effects are quite small, thus
they do not contribute to the high savings rate in China.27



6     China vs the US: How May China Evolve?
This section turns to one of the central questions of the paper: how will household finance patterns in China evolve
as the country further develops? Our model neatly distinguishes institutions, i.e. labor and financial markets, from
preferences and thus provides an ideal framework to answer this question. As China develops, it is natural to think
that institutions will evolve to be similar to those in the US. But differences in preferences are less likely to change
over time. Thus we conduct experiments in which China adopts the US institutions partially or fully, and compare
the simulated moments with the US data moments as well as the China benchmark moments.28


6.1     China-US Disparity
We have discussed the large between-country differences in parameters pertaining to both preferences and insti-
tutions. This subsection studies the mapping between these differences and the disparity in household finance
patterns. This is done by checking the distance between the US data moments and the simulated moments in
China, as reported in the last two columns of Table 8.
    As shown in the table, the benchmark distance, i.e. the total distance between China benchmark moments and
the US data moments, is 1198. Imposing the US stock return process, the total distance is lowered to 660. Thus
a large portion of the US-China disparity is attributable to the high risks and the low Sharpe ratio in the Chinese
stock market. Imposing the US stock adjustment cost also lowers the total distance, from 1198 to 971. A closer
look at the breakdowns of total distances reveals that these two experiments bring the portfolio composition in
China significantly closer to the US, but they barely change the disparity in wealth-to-income ratios.
    Imposing the US stock market entry cost increases the overall US-China disparity in household finance moments:
the total distance is 2158 which is much larger than the benchmark distance. The larger overall distance is mainly
because of the larger distance pertaining to participation rates. The low US entry cost along with the massive
  26 As shown in Table 8, lowering adjustment cost does not necessarily increase stock share conditional on participation, because it

causes the participation of relatively poor households who keep a low stock share.
  27 Recall that we impose A = 0 in the model. Chamon and Prasad (2010) shows that borrowing constraint, a form of financial
                               b
underdevelopment, contributes to the high savings rate in China.
  28 As we emphasized in Section 4.5, the China benchmark moments are simulated from an environment without regime changes.




                                                                 21

wealth accumulation in China causes the stock market participation rate in China to be even higher than in the
US on average.
      The much higher wealth-to-income ratio in China relative to the US is attributable to the risky labor income
and the more patience of Chinese households. Imposing the US stochastic labor income processes or the US
discounter factors, the distance of wealth-to-income ratio falls from 132 to 32 and 23, respectively. But stock
market participation rate is also lowered, which widens the overall distance between China and the US. Similarly,
imposing the more generous US consumption floor on China, wealth-to-income ratio in China falls and becomes
closer to the US ratio, but the between-country gap in stock market participation rate is widened.
      From these experiments we draw two conclusions. First, the China-US disparity in portfolio composition is
largely driven by the larger stock adjustment cost and the lower Sharpe ratio in China. Second, the disparity in
wealth accumulation is mainly driven by the larger discount factors, the riskier income processes and the lower
consumption floor in China.


6.2      Looking Forward
Over time, we expect some convergence of China towards the US. This is likely to happen in the labor and financial
markets but not in preferences. Here we explore the implications of this convergence on household finance patterns.


6.2.1     The US Labor Market

Suppose China develops a labor market identical to the one in the US, including the labor income processes,
the medical expense processes, and the social insurance as captured by the consumption floor.29 The resulting
simulated moments are reported in the block labeled “US labor MKT” of Table 9.
      Comparing these new moments with the China benchmark moments labeled “CN Benchmark” in the table, it
is clear that this institutional change dramatically reduces stock market participation rates, stock shares in total
wealth and wealth-to-income ratios in China. Intuitive the results come from the reduced labor market risks as
captured by the less variable income and medical expenses, and the larger consumption floor.
      Next, the new moments in China are compared with household finance patterns found in the SCF data in the
US shown in the top block of the table. Obviously wealth-income ratios in China is still higher than in the US,
indicating higher savings rate in China. The last column of Table 9 reports the distance between the simulated
moments in China and the US data moments. As shown in the table, the benchmark distance pertaining to wealth-
to-income ratio is 132. Adopting the US labor market, the distance is reduced to 13. However, with the US labor
market in China, the distance pertaining to participation rises from 603 (benchmark) to 2279, and the distance of
stock share also rises significantly.
      In conclusion, with the adoption of the US labor market, Chinese households are predicted to save less, but the
savings rate is still significantly higher than their US counterparts. In addition, they will allocate less savings to
 29 This is equivalent to the situation where a Chinese household work full time in the US but invest its savings in the Chinese financial

market.

                        cost (Γ), stock adjustment cost (F ), return on bond, and the stochastic process of
                        stock return. The labor market is characterized by its consumption floor (c), income
                        processes and medical expense processes.


the stock market, hence further lower the stock market participation rate and stock share in total wealth.


6.2.2     The US Financial Market

Now suppose China develops a financial market identical to the one in the US, featuring low stock market entry
and adjustment costs and a high Sharpe Ratio, which is equivalent to the situation of Chinese households investing
in the US financial market while working in China. Here we assume the stock market entry and adjustment costs
are relative to the average income in China rather than in the US since we interpret them as time costs.30
      As shown in Table 9, the stock market participation rates are close to 100% for the more educated households.
 30 The literature generally interprets the costs as information and time costs rather than direct monetary costs. See Bonaparte,

Cooper, and Zhu (2012) and Vissing-Jorgensen (2002) for examples.



                                                                 23

The participation rates are considerably higher than in the US. The wealth-to-income ratios in China are also much
higher than in the US, especially for the young households. Intuitively, households accumulate massive wealth
because of their large discount factors and strong precautionary motives caused by the highly variable income and
the small consumption floor. Such wealth levels make the low costs in the US financial market negligible, leading
to the extremely high participation rates. Stock shares conditional on participation are still lower in China than
in the US, but they are much higher than the shares observed in the China benchmark moments.
      Compared with the China benchmark moments, the adoption of US financial market brings the distance per-
taining to stock shares from 463 down to 116. However, the distance pertaining to participation rises from 603 to
9316. This mis-fit is largely due to the excessively high participation rate. The distance of wealth-to-income ratio
is changed only marginally.


6.2.3     The US Labor Market and Financial Market

Suppose China develops the US institutions in terms of both the financial market and the labor market, the resulting
household finance patterns are reported in the block labeled “US financial and labor MKTs”. The stock market
participation rate and wealth-to-income ratio are again significantly higher than in the US. But they are lower than
the case where China only adopts the US financial market. This is because households in the latter case are subject
to more labor market uncertainty and face a low consumption floor, hence need more precautionary savings.
      Given the full institutional convergence assumed in this experiment, we have much smaller distances pertaining
to wealth-to-income ratio and to stock share in total wealth. In particular the stock share in China on average
becomes fairly close to the US data. However since households in China participate in the stock market much more
than the US households, the distance pertaining to participation is still very large, actually much larger than in
the China benchmark model.
      Overall the disparity in moments remains fairly large, even with the full convergence in institutions. This
reflects differences in preferences. In particular, as we have shown earlier, the large discount factors in China are a
major contributor of the high savings rate.


6.3      Preferences
To gauge the importance of preferences, we conduct the experiment of imposing US preference parameters (i.e. β’s,
γ, θ and L) on China without changing the Chinese institutions. The simulated moments are reported in the last
block of Table 9. Wealth-to-income ratios become much closer to the US data, with the distance lowered from 132
to 8. So indeed preferences explain a large portion of the US-China disparity in savings and wealth accumulation.
Not surprisingly, stock market participation rate and stock share are near zero in this case, due to the low level of
wealth, the large labor market risks, and the underdeveloped asset market.

7     Conclusions
This paper studies the savings and portfolio choice of the Chinese households by estimating and simulating a
lifecycle optimization model. The estimation controls for cohort effects by explicitly taking regime changes in
China into the structural model. The model is able to quantitatively capture key household finance patterns in
China, as well as in the US to which we assume China may converge institutionally.
    The joint study of savings and portfolio choice uncovers interesting interactions. On one hand, a higher wealth
level is associated with more stock investment since the cost per unit of participation and adjustment are lower for
wealthier households. On the other hand, exogenous changes to asset market conditions do not significantly change
wealth-to-income ratios, despite their huge impacts on portfolio composition.
    The paper shows that history matters, and the major regime changes in China have impacted household savings
and portfolio choice. The impacts are more pronounced for the older and more educated households. Without
the regime changes, the Chinese households would have even higher wealth-to-income ratios, and the stock market
participation rates and stock shares would also be significantly higher.
    An important point of the analysis is to understand why household finance patterns differ between China
and the US. For both countries, we identify both preference parameters and institutional parameters. We find
that households in China are significantly more patient, which contributes to the higher wealth-to-income ratio
in China. Institutional differences are also important. Labor market in China features more variable income and
a low consumption floor, leading to stronger precautionary saving motives hence the high wealth-to-income ratio.
Asset market in China features a low Sharpe ratio and high costs associated with stock investment, which leads to
the low stock market participation rate and low stock share in total wealth in China.
    Looking forward, if China adopts the US labor market, the average wealth-to-income ratio will be lowered by
more than 50% due to the reduced labor market risks. Alternatively, if China adopts the US financial market but
preserves its own labor market features, then households still keeps a massive stock of precautionary savings. In
addition, about 90% of the households will participate in the stock market, and the stock share will rise significantly.
Further, if China converges to the US in terms of both the labor market and the financial market, then the stock
share in China will be fairly close to the US data. The wealth-to-income ratio will be lowered, but still 73% higher
than in the US data. Thus, even with the US institutions, the high savings rate in China is likely to continue unless
the preferences change.
    As it stands, the study omits a couple of other key factors influencing savings and housing demand. One,
emphasized in Wei and Zhang (2011), invokes the importance of housing in attracting a spouse. The second is
the significance of family size in determining savings, particularly with a binding constraint on family size, as
in Choukhmane, Coeurdacier, and Jin (2013). Both of these influences on savings and portfolios deserve further
attention.
    Finally, the effects of home ownership status and home equity are clearly present, as seen in Table 10. These
effects have not been the focus of our analysis. An extended model that includes the choice of home ownership and
equity with appropriate transaction costs is an obvious next step.

Household finance patterns in China come from the 2011 wave of China Household Financial Survey (CHFS). The
CHFS is conducted by the Survey and Research Center of China Household Finance, Southwestern University

of Finance and Economics, Chengdu, China. Detailed information about the CHFS is available at http://www.
chfsdata.org/. Gan, Yin, Jia, Xu, Ma, and Zheng (2013) provides a comprehensive description of the survey and
some key statistics found in the survey.
   For each household in the sample, the CHFS identifies a respondent which is defined as the member who knows
the best about a household’s financial situation. For 86.22% of the households in the survey, the respondents and
their spouses make decisions regarding stock market investment according to question [D3112]. A household is
considered a stock market participant if it holds stocks either directly or indirectly through mutual funds that
invest mainly in the equity market. Direct stockholding information is provided in questions [D3101] and [D3103].
Indirect holding information is obtained in answers to questions [D5104] and [D5107].
   The data have some information about transfers. About 5% of the respondents live in a house that is bequeathed
or transferred, although the survey does not specify where the transfers are from. The survey also has questions
about two types of financial transfers: government transfer which is mainly needs-based and private transfer from
parents, relatives, friends and others. These transfers are not regular income, and not included in our income
measure. Among households who receive transfers, the average government transfer is 1582 Yuan and the average
private transfer is 4298 Yuan.


A.2     Housing and Portfolio Choice
Table 10 shows that housing has statistically significant effects on stock market participation and stock share in
financial wealth in both China and the US.

A.3      Data for Exogenous Processes in China
A.3.1     Stock and Bond Returns

Stock Returns: Stock return process is calculated based on Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index, available
from WIND data base (http://www.wind.com.cn/en/Default.aspx). The real return includes dividends and
capital gains weighted by their market values, controlled for inflation using CPI. We calculate the real returns based
on quarterly data, then compound them into annual returns. Between March 1994 - March 2016, the annualized
mean return is 10.07% with a standard deviation of 0.47. These statistics are used in the baseline model. As a cross
check, we also calculated the value weighted average return of all the stocks listed in Shanghai Stock Exchange and
Shenzhen Stock Exchange during the period of 1994-2013, from GTA data base (http://us.gtarsc.com/). The
annualized real return is 12.43% with a standard deviation of 0.492. Consistent with findings in the US market,
we cannot reject the hypothesis that annual stock return follows an i.i.d. process in China.


Bond Returns: We combine the traditional low-risk asset and housing, and call the composite asset bond. We
categorize housing as a low-risk asset since the standard deviation of housing return is only 0.075 for smaller and
median-sized cities according to Fang, Gu, Xiong, and Zhou (2015). The traditional low-risk assets include cash,
current deposits (checking account), fixed deposits (CDs), WMPs, treasury bills, corporate bonds, investment trust,
non-RMB asset, and cash lent to friends and relatives.
    Consistent with our definition of bond, bond return is the weighted average of housing return and return on tra-
ditional low-rick assets. The average annual return on bank deposits are available on the website of People’s Bank
of China (http://www.pbc.gov.cn/zhengcehuobisi/125207/125213/125440/125838/125888/index.html). Be-
tween 1990-2014, after inflation adjustment using CPI, one-year bank deposit has an average annual return of 1.87%.
During the same period of time, 90-day treasury-bill in China has an real annual return of 1.75% using the data
from St. Louis Fed(https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2). Thus we take return on low-risk non-housing
asset to be 1.8%.31
    Wu, Gyourko, and Deng (2016) reports an average real growth rate of house prices of 6.5% per year in 35 major
cities. Including an annual rental return of 2%, the real urban housing return is about 8.5%.32 In the rural area,
housing transactions are limited and real house prices rarely appreciate, thus we assume a housing return of 2.5%.
In the 2011 CHFS 63% of the households are urban residents. Using this as a weight the average housing return is
8.5% × 0.63 + 2.5% × (1 − 0.63) = 6.28%.
    In our CHFS sample, housing accounts for 81.5% of the sum of housing and the traditional low-risk assets. This
ratio is 81.1% for the low education group and 80.7% for the high education group. Therefore we put a weight
  31 Another class of low-risk asset is the so-called wealth management products (WMPs). These are mutual funds issued by state-

owned commercial banks. They are typically considered low-risk products. About 26% of them have returns guaranteed explicitly by
the issuing bank. The remaining do not have guaranteed returns, but banks tend to choose to repay investors even if the products fail
to meet the expected performance set forth by the banks. On average the real return of WMPs is between 2-4%. The WMPs require
a minimum level of fund so the access is limited. Perry and Weltewitz (2015) provides a nice description of WMPs in China.
  32 This low rental return is consistent with Wu, Gyourko, and Deng (2012) and Wu, Gyourko, and Deng (2016). Rent-to-price ratios

are generally between 2-5%. The actual rental return is even lower once vacancies and maintenance costs are taken into account.

of 0.815 on housing and a weight of 0.185 on the traditional low-risk assets to reach a return of 5.45% for the
composite bond in the baseline model.
    In the robustness analysis we also consider a housing return of 11% which is the real return on housing asset in
the third-tier cities in China reported in Fang, Gu, Xiong, and Zhou (2015).33 The corresponding composite bond
has a weighted average return of 9.3%. This is an artificially high return because it does not take the low housing
return in the rural area into account. Nevertheless we use it to gain insights into how a lower Sharpe ratio impacts
household finance moments.


A.3.2      Income Data

Income processes in this paper are estimated based on nine waves of China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS).
CHNS is an ongoing international collaborative project between the Carolina Population Center at the University
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The CHNS conducts
surveys over a 3-day period using a multistage, random cluster process to draw a sample of about 4400 households
with a total of 26000 individuals for each wave. The first wave of survey was conducted in 1989, followed by 1991,
1993, 1997, 2000, 2004, 2006, 2009 and 2011 waves during which surveyed households were revisited.
    CHNS provides detailed income information as well as a rich set of demographic variables of household members,
including age, educational attainment, occupation, region of residence and sector of employment. We use these
demographic variables to filter out predictable component of income. The survey consistently constructs nine
categories of income for each household in each wave of survey – business, farming, fishing, gardening, livestock,
non-retirement wages, retirement income, subsidies, and other income.34 We estimate household income processes
based on the sum of the nine income categories.
    We select households that have valid information on income, rural-urban status, as well as the following infor-
mation for household heads: age, gender, educational attainment, region of residence and sector of employment.
The following are excluded: (i) households that report zero income; (ii) households whose income grow by more
than 2000% between any two surveys; (iii) households whose income drop by more than 2000% between any two
surveys.
    An obvious effect of labor market reform in China is the gradual rise of the college premium, as shown in Figure
4 which uses the CHNS data between 1989-2011.


A.3.3      Medical Expense Data

For the medical expense processes, we use the 2011 and 2013 waves of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal
Study (CHARLS), available at charls.pku.edu.cn/. CHARLS is a longitudinal survey conducted by the National
  33 There are 85 third-tier cities in Fang, Gu, Xiong, and Zhou (2015) that are economically and politically important in their

respective provinces but are not considered either first-tier (Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou) or second-tier (autonomous
municipalities, provincial capitals, or vital industrial/commercial centers). These top three-tier cities have significantly higher returns
on housing.
  34 Detailed information about these household income categories are available at http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/china/data/

   Since 2011 the survey collects a representative sample of Chinese age 45 and older every two years. The
survey data contain information on household demographics, health status, health care expenses, health insurance
coverage, employment, income, consumption and assets. Similar to French and Jones (2004) which uses the Health
and Retirement Study (HRS) data, total out-of-pocket medical expense is the sum of insurance premium, outpatient
expense, hospitalization expense and self-treatment expense. Since CHARLS is designed on the models of HRS,
These two data sources and hence the definitions of out-of-pocket medical expenses are highly comparable.
   We select survey respondents that provide valid information in both waves regarding the following variables:
out-of-pocket insurance premium (variable EA006), total outpatient expense (variable ED006), self-paid outpatient
expense (ED007), transportation cost to medical facilities (ED015 and EE015), total treatment and medication cost
(ED023), self-paid treatment and medication cost (ED024), total hospitalization cost (EE005) and the self-paid
part (EE006), total self-treatment cost (EF002) and the self-paid part (EF003), total cost of dental care (EH003)
and the self-paid part (EH004). We drop respondents without valid information on age, educational attainment,
gender, rural versus urban status, and sector of employment.


A.4    US Data
We estimate the US household finance patterns based on seven wave of Survey of Consumer Finance between
1989-2007. Definition of stock holdings are the same as in CHFS 2011. We use the same sample selection criteria
as in Cooper and Zhu (2016) which studies US household finance patterns by a finer breakdown of educational
attainment.
   The US income processes and medical expense processes are estimated based on the Panel Study of Income
Dynamics (1989-2009) and the Heath and Retirement Study (waves of 1996, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006 and
2008). Details on these processes as well as stock return, bond return and housing return are provided in Cooper
and Zhu (2016).

Table 11 shows the difference in household finance patterns between US and China by age and educational attain-
ment which supplements Table 1. It’s noteworthy that wealth-to-income ratio rises more sharply in old age in the

                            This figure plots the fraction of high education households that live in the
                            urban area or are employed by the state sector in the 2011 CHFS.


   We split the CHFS sample in alternative ways based on region of residence (rural versus urban) and sector of
employment (non-state versus state). The state sector households include those employed by the governments, the
SOEs and the collectively-owned enterprises. The joint distribution of households is reported in Table 12. Clearly,
urban and state sector households are more educated.
   Figure 6 plots the fraction of high education urban households and the fraction of high education state sector
employees against age. These fractions are clearly larger among the young.
   The top panel of Table 13 shows household finance patterns for the state and the non-state sector workers based
on 28.6% of respondents in the 2011 CHFS sample with valid information on the sector of employment. The state
sector workers have a significantly higher participation rate, wealth-to-income ratio and home ownership rate on
average. These patterns are similar to the difference between low and high education groups, which is not surprising
given that the state sector has a much higher percentage of high education workers as shown in Table 12 below.
The stock share is not significantly different between the two sectors.
   The bottom panel of Table 13 summarizes household finance moments by region in China. The participation
rate and wealth-to-income ratio are much higher in the urban region. The difference in stock share is small, which
is likely caused by the selection effect: only wealthy or high education rural households select to participate in the
stock market. The home ownership rate is higher in the rural region where house prices are lower.

              state sector includes employees of governments, state-owned enterprises and collectively owned firms.
              The non-state sector includes farmers, workers in private firms, foreign firms and firms of joint ownership
              with foreigners. Among the 7144 households in our sample, 5103 of them do not have valid information
              on sector of employment. These households are dropped when we calculate the moments by sector of
              employment.

Table 14 reports the elasticities of simulated moments from the baseline model with respect to the estimated

D       Impacts of Regime Changes
This appendix provides more details about experiments that show how the regime changes in China have impacted
household finance patterns observed in 2011. A summary of results here are reported in Section 4.5 of the main
text.
    For each experiment, we calculate the averages of household finance moments for the four groups in the 2011
cross section of the simulated data. The results are shown in Table 15.
    The first experiment imposes the pre-2000 old income processes, including both deterministic and stochastic
components of income, on both the young and old cohorts throughout their lifetimes. This results in significantly
lower wealth-to-income ratios for the young cohort, clearly due to the lower degree of income uncertainty in the old
income process. In addition, for the more educated households, the deterministic income profile in the old regime
falls much more quickly after retirement, which motivates them to save more for retirement, leading to a slightly
higher wealth-to-income ratio.
    With the old income processes, both the participation rate and stock share are lower for each of the four
groups of households. On the one hand, a lower degree of income uncertainty leads to more risk-taking hence more
participation and higher stock share (the direct effect). On the other hand the lower wealth accumulation increase
the per unit costs of entry and adjustment. The quick decline of income with age in the old regime also causes
households to take less risk, creating lower participation rates and stock shares. Our quantitative results reveal


                                                                  34

that the latter two mechanisms dominate the direct effect.
   The second experiment imposes the post-2000 new income process through the lifetimes of both cohorts. Com-
pared with the baseline model, the effects are just the opposite of the first experiment: on average households
accumulate more wealth, participate more, and have higher stock share in total wealth. One exception is that the
less educated young cohort has slightly lower share, likely caused by the selection effect: participants have lower
income on average as more households participate in the stock market. Another exception is that less educated old
households have slightly lower wealth-to-income ratio, because they have much higher income in the new income
regime as shown in Figure 2.
   The third and fourth experiments change the housing return. Recall that in the baseline model, the housing
return is switched from 1.8% to 6.28% in 2000 unexpectedly as a result of the housing return, leading to a return
of 5.45% on the composite bond. For these two experiments, the housing return either stays at the pre-reform level
throughout the lifetimes of both cohorts, “Old Housing Return” case, or is at its new level throughout, the “New

            This table report moments from the baseline model and from the counterfactual experiments. The
            distance is calculated using equation (9). The total distance is the sum of distances in three categories.
            The “p-value” column shows the probability that the realized distance is even larger than the calculated
            distance.


Housing Return” case.
   Keeping the old housing return significantly changes the moments. Relative to the baseline, the wealth-to-income
ratio is much lower. The lower return on composite bond leads to a higher Sharpe ratio, thus the participation rate
and the stock share are both higher for the young cohort, especially the more educated households who are subject
to less income uncertainty. For the old cohort, the participation rate and stock share either decrease or remain at
about the same level, thus the low wealth accumulation has a dominatingly negative effect on stock investment for
the old age households, despite the higher Sharpe ratio.
   Using the new housing return throughout, each group of households has a high wealth-to-income ratio due
to the high return on the risk-free composite bond. Two conflicting effects arise: the lower Sharpe ratio makes
stock investment less attractive, while the the larger wealth accumulation diminishes the stock market entry and



                                                               36
                                                                  E   ROBUSTNESS OF ESTIMATION RESULTS


adjustment costs (wealth effect). The wealth effect is weaker for the young cohorts as shown in the mild increase
in wealth-to-income ratios and the lower stock market participation. But the wealth effect is strong for the old
cohorts, resulting in much higher wealth-to-income ratios and participation rates.
    In the block labeled “Stock Market Always Accessible”, we experiment with the case when both old and young
cohorts have access to stock market throughout their lifetime. This treatment does not affect the decisions of the
young cohort because even in the baseline model it always has access to the stock market. Among the old cohort,
the less educated households are affected only slightly – with slightly higher participation rate, stock share and
wealth-to-income ratio. The weak effect is partly because the stock market re-opens at a time when the old cohort
is about ten years prior to retirement hence they are able to take advantage of the new opportunity in the baseline
model to a large extent.
    In the last experiment, we assume both the young and old cohorts live throughout their lifetimes in the new
regime. The results are reported and discussed in the main text.
    A comparison of the p-values reveals that most of the regime changes lead to significant differences as measured
by the overall distances, with p-values near zero. The only exception is the re-opening of the stock market. Had
the stock market always be accessible, stock participation rate would be significantly higher (p-value pertaining to
the participation moments being 0.01), but other moments would have little changes. The wealth-to-income ratios
appear to be less affected by the regime changes partly because of the low weights they receive.
    Housing market reform significantly changed wealth accumulation: without the reform wealth-to-income ratios
would be much lower for each group of households. Relative to the baseline, ratios are clearly larger in the completely
new regime. The impacts of changes in income process on the wealth-to-income ratio of the more educated group
is also significant.



E     Robustness of Estimation Results
This subsection reports moments and parameter estimates from various alternative specifications and source of
hetergeneity listed in Section 4.6 in the main text. We also examine how the assumption of costless housing
adjustment affects the savings and portfolio decisions of households.


E.1     Alternative Specifications
We re-estimate a number of variants of the baseline model and present the results in Table 16 (moments) and Table
17 (parameters).


Weighting Matrix: The first exercise replaces the weighting matrix used in the baseline estimation, the inverse
of the variance-covariance matrix, with an identify matrix. Both matrices, in theory, generate consistent estimates
of the structural parameters. With the identity weighting matrix, moments pertaining to wealth-to-income ratio
no longer receive lower weights than other moments. As a result, the wealth-to-income ratio moments are better

matched, but the match of moments related to participation and stock share is slightly worse.
      The main features of the baseline model are preserved. In particular, the large gap between the discount
factors of the low and high education households are present, though the differences are slightly less. Further, the
stock market participation cost is quite close. However, with the identify matrix, the adjustment cost is higher
and not statistically significant. As in the baseline model, the estimated consumption floor and the EIS are both
significantly smaller than their US counterparts.


Stock Return Process: Given the short history of stock market in China, it is difficult to precisely measure
the expected return and volatility of stock investment. In the baseline estimation, the stock return is estimated
using the realized return in the period between March 1994 and March 2016. It is likely that households form
expectations about the Chinese stock market based on experiences in the developed countries like the US. It is also
likely that respondents in the 2011 CHFS form expectations based on realizations prior to the survey.
      The row labeled “Earlier Stock Return” uses the realized stock return of the Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite
Index between March 1994 - March 2011. In this case, the mean return is 12.57% and the standard deviation is

This table reports parameter values from alternative estimations. The “US return” estimation imposes US stock return on the Chinese
households. βi for i = 1, 2 refers to the low and high education groups except that for the “Rural-urban” case β1 refers to rural
households, and for the “Nonstate-state” case β1 refers to households in the non-state sector.


0.488. For this specification, the estimated value of adjustment cost is slightly higher, which is needed when stock
return is higher in order to match the moments related to participation and stock share. Important features in
China relative to the US, such as the large and highly differentiated β’s, the high participation cost, the low
consumption floor and the low EIS are all well preserved.
      The experiment of “US return” replaces the stock return process in China with the US process. This leads to
substantially larger participation cost, adjustment cost, and coefficient of risk aversion which are needed in order
to match the moments since a higher Sharpe ratio is imposed. The fit of the model is almost five times worse than
the baseline. Thus the Chinese households do not seem to form their expectation about the Chinese market on the
basis of the US experiences.


Housing Return: The case of “Higher Housing Return” sets the return on housing at 11% annually based on
Fang, Gu, Xiong, and Zhou (2015). This increases return on the composite bond to 9.3%. In this case, the Sharpe
ratio is even lower and stock investment is even less attractive, so a lower adjustment cost and a lower coefficient
of risk aversion are estimated to match the participation and share moments. The high bond return also generates
smaller estimates of β’s and a larger consumption floor. The model fit is much worse than the baseline model,
indicating that an excessively high housing return is not consistent with the expectations of households on average.


CHFS Income: Income level in the 2011 CHFS and the 2011 CHNS differs as shown in Table 18. The mean
income levels of the young cohort are only slightly higher than the old cohort in the CHNS. In the CHFS data,

income levels of the young cohort are significantly higher than the old cohort. The “young/old” rows show that
in CHNS the young cohort has an income level that is 1.034 and 1.18 times larger than the old cohort for the low
and high education households respectively. The corresponding numbers are 1.225 and 1.638 based on the CHFS

                             the young and old cohorts in 2011 from two different data sources in China:

      The much lower income levels of the old cohort relative to the young have implications for household finance
patterns. As demonstrated in Heaton and Lucas (1997) and Cooper and Zhu (2016), income substitutes for bond
holdings in household’s portfolio choice, and lower income of the old cohort implies a lower stock share. To see the
robustness of our baseline results, we re-scale the income profile of each of the four groups (namely the low and
high education groups in the young and old cohorts) to match their relative income observed in the 2011 CHFS,
and re-estimate the model parameters.35 The results are reported in the row labeled “CHFS Income” in Tables 16
and 17. Compared with the baseline results, now the old cohort has much lower stock share. In particular for the
more educated groups that have a larger income gap between the young and old cohorts, the stock share is about
5% lower than the baseline. Most of the features of parameter estimates in the baseline, such as the large entry
cost and small consumption floor, and the discount factor heterogeneity, are well preserved.


E.2      Other Sources of Heterogeneity
As shown in Section B, Chinese household finance patterns differ by sectors of employment and region of residence.
We re-estimate the model based on these alternative dimensions of heterogeneity. For these alternatives, the
moments are created by replacing the education dummy with either urban dummy or the state sector dummy.
Table 19 reports the results. Comparing these results with Table 4 reveals the similarity in both data moments
and model moments from different splits.
      Parameter estimates are reported in the bottom rows of Table 17. Overall, they do not deviate significantly
from the baseline estimates, and the contrast between China and the US remains. The estimated entry cost is
  35 Since we normalize the average income level to one in the economy, what matters is the relative income of different groups. To

adjust the income profiles, we rotate the baseline income profiles of the young cohort, so that the profiles get steeper until the young and
less educated cohort has an income that is 1.225 time larger than the old and less educated cohort, and the young and more educated
cohort has an income that is 1.638 time larger than the old and more educated cohort.

smaller but the adjustment cost is larger. For the sector of employment split, the relative risk aversion and the EIS
are smaller. The low EIS helps generate a relatively small gap in the wealth-to-income ratio between the non-state
and state employees.


E.3       Costly Housing Adjustment
Our analysis assumes there is no cost of adjusting the composite bond which includes housing. In reality households
frequently adjust their liquid assets due to various random shocks (e.g. income shocks and medical expense shocks)
on the one hand, and they only adjust the holdings of housing asset occasionally on the other hand. Our assumption
of costless adjustment could be too restrictive if the model-implied bond adjustment is large and exceeds the liquid
assets observed in the actual data.
      We estimate the proportion of liquid non-housing assets in the composite bond in the 2011 CHFS, and compare
it with the rate of change in bond holdings in the simulated data, defined as (Ab0 − Ab )/Ab . The purpose is to
find out whether the traditional liquid asset in the data is sufficient for households in the model to buffer against
shocks.
      The left panel of Figure 7 shows the proportion of liquid non-housing asset in the composite bond in the 2011
CHFS by age, along with the bond change rate in the simulated data.36 The latter is well below the former for
households between ages 45 and 75, but it is well above the former before 40 and after 80.
 36 Since   the proportion of liquid asset is calculated from one cross section of data, it is also contaminated by cohort effects.

                  The figure shows the rate of change in bonds, (Ab0 − Ab )/Ab , in the simulated data (the
                  circled line) against the proportion of liquid non-housing asset in total composite bond in the
                  2011 CHFS (the starred line). The downward change rate of bond (right panel) is calculated
                  from incidents |(Ab0 − Ab )/Ab | < 0.


    The right panel shows downward bond change rate in the simulated data which is the average calculated from
the subset of data where (Ab0 − Ab )/Ab < 0 at each age. The downward changes are all below the proportion of
liquid assets. The right panel also shows the band of one standard deviation above and below the downward change
rates (dotted lines). Before the retirement age of 60, the whole band is below the proportion of liquid asset. But
after retirement, the band widens considerably and goes beyond the proportion of liquid asset.
    Our main concern is whether the liquid proportion in the composite bond is sufficient to buffer against income
or medical expense shocks. As shown in Bonaparte, Cooper, and Zhu (2012), a important reason for households
to hold bonds despite the high equity premium is to use them to buffer against shocks and smooth consumption.
The above analysis shows that liquid assets are sufficient to buffer against adverse shocks. For those aged below 40
or above 80, upward bond adjustments involve housing to some extent, but these adjustments are unlikely to be
responses to income or medical expenses shocks. In summary, the assumption that bonds can be adjusted without
costs is not restrictive as long as its role as a buffer against income and medical expense shocks are concerned.

This table reports counterfactuals from imposing US parameters (one at a time) on the Chinese model, controlling for
cohort effects. The CN benchmark are simulated from the completely new regime using parameters from the baseline
estimation. The US data moments are taken from the SCF data between 1989-2007. The columns labeled “Total” reports
the sum of distances in participation, stock share and W/I.
