            CORPORATE ?EJSION °OLICY AhID THE VALUE OF PBGC IhIS'iRAhIC




                                     Abstract




    This paper derives the value of PBGC pension insurance under two scenarios

of interest. The first allows for
                                     voluntary plan termination, which aooars
to be legal under current statutes. In the
                                                second scenario, termination is
prohibited unless the firm is bankrupt. Optimal
                                                    pension funding strategy
under each scenario is examined. Finally, empirical estimates of PBGC

liabilities are calculated. These show that a small number of funds account

for a large fraction of total
                                prospective PBGC liabilities, that those total

liabilities greatly exceed current PBGC reserves for plan terminations, and

that PBGC liabilities could be substantially reduced by the prohibition of

voluntary termination.

           CORPORATE PENSION POLICY AN!) THE VALUE OF PBGC INSURANCE




    Title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 197'

established the Pension Benefit uarantee Corporation to insure the benefits

of participants of defined-benefit pension plans. The PBGC now insures the

pension benefits of more than 28 million employees in single-employer plans,

and provides less extensive coverage to participants in multi-employer plans.

irms initially were charged a premium of Z1 per year per employee for this

coverage. This premium structure was meant to be temporary, until the data

required to establish an actuarially balanced plan became available. In 1930,

the PBGC raised the premiums to 2.6O per employee per year. In 1932 the °BGC

requested a further increase in the premium rate to 6.OO, and warned that

even this increase will be sufficient to cover prospective PBSC liabilities

only if several currently precarious large plans regain financial

stability.1 This latest request has led to renewed interest in PBGC pricing

policy and the assessment of BGC liabilities. Although the Multieniployer

Pension Plan Amendment Act of 1930 directed the PBGC to study the possibility

of a graduated premium rate schedule based on risk, such recommendations have

yet to he made, and the current proposals for rate changes are still

independent of risk.

    One approach to valuing PBGC liabilities is provided by the options

pricing framework. The formal correspondence between put options and term

insurance policies has long been noted and the option pricing methodology has

been used to value insurance plans in other contexts (Mayers and Smith [1977],

Merton [1977], Sosin [1981], Marcus and Shaked [1932]).   In fact several
                                      —3—




authors (Sharpe 1:1976], Treynor [1977], da Motta [1979], Langetieg et al.

[1981]) already have used option pricing methodology to study the valuation of

PBGO insurance. The provisions of ERIS allow firms to transfer their pension

liabilities to the BGC in return for pension fund assets plus 30 percent of

the market value of the firm's net worth. Thus, viewing PBGC insurance as a

put option, the pension liabilities play the role of the exercise price while

the fund assets plus 30 percent of net worth play the role of the underlying

asset or stock price.2

   However, while the analogy between put options and the option to terminate

a pension plan appears straightforward, the correspondence between the two is

not at all clear with respect to the effective time to maturity of the pension

put. Taken literally, ERISA rules seem to imply that a firm may terminate an

underfunded plan, transfer its net liability to the PBGC, and reestablish a

new insured plan. Under this reading of the law, firms would immediately

terminate any plan which became underfunded by more than 30 percent of net

worth. The option would have instantaneous maturity and be indefinitely

renewable.

    In practice, however, virtually all terminations of underfunded pension

plans occur as a byproduct of corporate bankruptcy. The lac< of voluntary

terminations suggests that there may be hidden costs to termination. Bulow

(1932) suggests that voluntary termination might lead to unfavorable

government treatment in other matters.3 Other observers (e.g., Munnell,

1982) cite damaged labor relations as an implicit cost of termination. This

seems less convincing, however, since the firm may replace the terminated plan

with another plan of equal value. Both employees and employers can gain at

the expense of the PBGC. More explicit costs of termination might arise
                                      —




from legal entanglements. In one widely cited case, the PBGC brought suit to

block the voluntary termination and reorganization of the underfunded pension

plan of AlloyTek. The two sides ultimately settled out of court in 1981, with

the PBGC assuming the underfunded plan and lloyTek agreeing not to establish

a new defined—benefit plan. Instead, the   firm was   allowed to establish a

defined—contribution plan for its employees y buying Individual etirement

Accounts (IRAs) for them (Munell, 198?).

    Most authors have chosen to avoid the ambiguity regarding termination

provisions. Treynor (1977) analyzes pension finance using a one-period model,

in which the fund automatically terminates at the end of the period. Sharpe

(1975) also uses a one-period model, which effectively transforms the

termination put into a European option. In a similar vein, da Motta (1979)

assumes an arbitrary finite maturity date. His model allows firms to drop out

of the PBGC insurance program at interim loments when pension funding payments

come due, but the firm cannot exercise the PBGC put until an exogenously given

maturity date (p. 93). Harrison and Sharpe (1982) also study a multiperiod

model in which the PBGC insurance is exercised only at the end of the last

period. Bulow (1931, 1983), Bulow and Scholes (1982) and Bulow, Scholes and

Menell (1982) generally pass over the issue of termination date per Se, and

focus instead on contingent liabilities at termination, whenever that may be.

Finally, Langetieg et al. (1981) consider P3GG   insurance   in a general

multiperiod contingent claims framework, but examine only the qualitative

properties of the insurance, and do not derive a valuation function for the

insurance.

    While these models offer several important insights, the issue of the

implicit termination date remains problematic. It is clear that any estimates
                                          —5--




of   the value of °BGC liabilities will be sensitive to the assumed maturity of

the insurance program. The sensitivity of the qualitative conclusions of

these models to the imposition of an exogenous termination date remains an

open question.

     This paper presents models of the pension insurance program which also use

the contingent claims methodology, hut which do not impose an exogenous

maturity date on PBGC insurance. The value of PBGC insurance is derived for

two scenarios. In the first, the possibility of corporate ban'ruptcy is ruled

out, and the pension plan is terminated only when that action is value

maximizing for the firm. This scenario is motivated by the opportunity for

profitable termination which ERISA seems to offer firms. The point of

departure for this model is the AlloyTek case, the resolution of which

indicates that a firm can terminate a pension plan with minimum explicit cost

once, but only once. A one-time-only termination provision makes the pension

put formally identical to an infinite maturity American option, which expires

only upon exercise. The cost of termination is the opportunity cost of not

being able to terminate in the future for possible greater benefits. The

termination decision becomes an optimal-timing problem in which the option is

exercised only if it is sufficiently in-the-money. Such a model potentially

can explain the existence of so many underfunded plans which have not yet

terminated without resorting to unspecified implicit costs of termination.

Given the ability of a firm   to   replace the terminated defined-benefit plan

with a defined-contribution plan, it     is   not clear that those costs would be

significant for most firms.
     The first model yields an upper bound estimate of the value of PT3GO
insurance because the plan is terminated only when that action is optimal for
                                        —5-




the firm. In contrast, the second model will provide a lower bound on the

value of the PBGC insurance. In this model, an underfunded pension plan may

terminate only at the occurrence of corporate bankruptcy. The motivation for

this approach is twofold: First, it is consistent with the empirical fact

that virtually no solvent firms exercise the pension put. Second, it is

consistent with proposals for pension insurance reform which would disallow

termination   of underfunded plans by solvent firms. The value derived for    this

scenario   should represent a lower bound on the   true value of the insurance,

since   it rules out the possibility for firms to choose a value-maximizing
termination rule. The true value of PBGC insurance should lie between the

valuation bounds generated by these two models.

     The models employed in this paper allow for an analysis and valuation of

pension insurance in a model in which plan termination is determined

endogenously. The models also offer a framework for studying corporate

pension funding and investment policy. The implications of these models

confirm and extend those of Bulow (1981) and Harrison and Sharpe (1932), who

analyzed pension funding strategies for plans with a given maturity date.

     The next section presents a model of pension insurance. The valuation of

PBGC liabilities are derived for each scenario, risk-rated pension insurance

premium structures are considered, and optimal corporate financial policy is

examined. It is shown that a fund can be significantly underfunded before a

firm would find termination to be a profitable strategy.

      Section II presents empirical estimates of the value of PBGC insurance for

a sample of Fortune 100 firms. The results of this Section indicate that the

pension    put has significant value for several firms, and that the true value
of   PBGC liabilities can differ substantially from the common measure of such

liabilities, which is accrued benefits less the sum of fund assets plus 30

percent of firm net worth. Finally, the empirical results are used to

evaluate the decrease in PBGC liabilities that would result from the

prohibition    of voluntary terminations by underfunded plans. Section III

I. A MODEL OF PENSION INSURANCE



A. Valuation of PBGC Pension Liabilities:         Voluntary Termination

     For   simplicity, I will assume that all accrued benefits are vested and
fully insured by the PBGC.     In   fact, guaranteed benefits typically    account for

between    90 and 95 percent of vested benefits, while approximately 80 percent

of   accrued benefits are vested (Amoroso, 1982). This simplification is

necessary to derive analytic solutions below; it should not affect the

qualitative properties of the solution.

     Following Bulow, let A denote     the value of accrued benefits, F denote the
value   of assets in the pension fund and .3E denote the firm liability beyond

assets in the pension fund, i.e., 30 percent of net worth. F and E are

measured as market values, while A is the present value        of accrued benefits
calculated by discounting at the riskiess nominal interest rate. The benefits
represent an obligation    which will be paid     with certainty, either by     the   firm
or the PBGC.

     At a termination, if the plan is sufficiently funded (F+.3E >        A),   the firm

gains F and transfers assets of value A to the PBGC. Otherwise, the firm is

liable only up to the amount F.3E. The net proceeds to the firm at

termination therefore equal4
                                              -8-




           F -   min(A, F.3E)                                                   (1)


or equivalently,

           F-A +   max[A—(F.3E),    0].                                         (2)

Expression (2) highlights the nature of the firm's put option. Its net

pension liability is F-A; however, it can default on that obligation and

transfer its liability of A to the PBGC in return for only F+.3E.

      There is no explicit maturity date associated with the insurance plan. In

this sense, it is isomorphic to an merican put option with infinite maturity

and exercise price A. Just as the put can be exercised only once, the firm

can   voluntarily terminate just one defined-benefit plan. Thereafter, it may
offer   its employees only defined-contribution plans. These plans are akin to
mutual funds. They neither require nor recieve PBGC insurance. Part of the

firm's problem will be to choose a rule for voluntary termination which, in

conjunction with its other policies, maximizes firm          value.
      To solve for the value of the pension insurance it is           first necessary to

specify   the dynamics for accrued liabilities and the assets backing the plan.

These will differ from conventional specifications because of the effects of

firm contributions to the pension fund and the effects of new retirees and

deaths on the dynamics for P.

      For convenience, use S to denote the sum ÷.3E.          I will assume that S

follows the diffusion process

           dS      (Cs+as)Sdt +   s5s                                               (3)


where      is the rate of firm contributions into the pension fund net of

payments to retirees expressed as a fraction of S, and where                 is a


standard   drift term attributable to the normal rate of return on the pension
fundassets, F, and       the firm   equity,   E.5   0 will be positive    if firm
                                         -.9-




funding for accruing benefits exceeds payouts from the pension fund for

current retirees., In a steady state with no uncertainty, a constant interest

rate, and a constant number of retirees, the present value of accrued benefits

would be constant over time. A firm administering a fully funded plan could

withdraw    interest earnings from the plan to help it pay benefits to current
retirees and still maintain full funding. In this case, new contributions
into   the plan would fall short of payouts to retirees by the amount of the

interest earnings; C would be negative. In fact if 30 percent of the

firm's equity were not included in the assets hacking the fund, C would

equal the negative of the interest rate. irm contributions would fall short

of current payouts by interest earnings on fund assets, which as a fraction of

assets would simply be the interest rate.

    The dynamics for A are more complicated. As a base case, consider a

situation    in which none of the firm's employees h3ve yet retired and in which
no further pension benefits will accrue. If the interest rate, r, is
constant, then the present value of accrued benefits,       A,   which is the exercise
price   of the pension put, will increase at the constant proportional rate r.

The growth in the exercise price derives from the definition of A as a present

value, and differs from the more conventional situation in which the exercise

price is specified as a dollar amount.

       If long-term interest rates are stochastic, then so will be the present

value of accrued benefits. Denote by            the expected rate of return on a

bond with a payoff stream identical to that of accrued benefits. This will

also be the expected growth rate in the present value of al ready accrued

benefits.     If interest rates were nonstochastic then          would equal r.
       Demographics also affect the evolution of A. Accrued benefits increase
        -                                      -10-


when current workers increase their length of employment and decrease when

plan participants die or have benefits paid to them. In a steady state with

no   uncertainty, and a      constant level of accrued      benefits, newly accruing
benefits plus the increase in the present value of already accrued benefits
would exactly offset the decrease in total accrued benefits due to retiree
deaths. Denoting the net growth rate in accrued benefits attributable to
demographic factors as CA, the total growth rate in             A   would be CA+r. Thus
in   the steady state, C would equal -r and           would remain constant. The

evolution of A can then he sum!narized by the process

The stochastic component of () is due to uncertainty regarding long-term

interest rates and the future pattern of additional net accruals.                    I will

denote the correlation coefficient between dzA and dz5 as o.

      Following the analysis in Merton (197), and letting P(A,S) denote the

value of the pension put, one can show that P must satisfy the partial

differential equation:


            ?AAAA        + P5S2cJ + PASAScIAcYSP - rP   +
                                                            (r+CA)A?A
                                                                        +
                                                                            (r+C5)S°
                                                                                         = 0        5)

where subscripts on P denote partial derivatives and r denotes the rate of
return on instantaneously riskless bonds. Equation (5)                lacks   a   term   involving
calendar time because the put is of infinite riaturity (Merton, 1973). The

terms       and      have effects analogous to those of (negative) proportional
dividends in the standard option pricing model (Smith, 1976).
      The boundary conditions for ? are:
a) At a point of exercise of the put (i.e., termination of the plan), P                        =   A-S.

b) The limit of P as S approaches infinity is zero.

c) The limit of P as A approaches zero is zero.
                                                                  —Il-.



d)    The rule for voluntary exercising is chosen to maximize the value of the

      option.7

     Following the analysis of McDonald and Siegel (1932), the solution to (5)

can be shown to have the general form

          P(A,S) =                (1—K)(S/A)K                                              (6)

where K is the ratio of SR at which the option is exercised. Equation (5)

will satisfy p.d.e. (5) for

                                                                              'S A

These conditions are derived by solving the quadratic equation which is

generated by substituting (5) into (5). Choosing K to maximize the value of

the option results in the condition

                                                                                           (7


     Equation (6) gives the value of the PBGC insurance plan (under the

simplifying assumption of no bankruptcy). Given estimates of the parameters

in (6) and (7) one could assess the value of the insurance to the shareholders

of the firm. These values could serve as the basis for a risk-rated premium

structure. Two such structures are discussed below in Section D.

     Equation (7) gives the condition for voluntary termination of the pension

plan. Second order conditions require that C<l. One must further restrict C

to   be negative since a feasible K* must be positive because                        and S are

always positive). Thus, C<O, which implies O<K*<l so that the put will be

exercised only for S<A, i.e., if fund assets plus 30 percent of net worth fall

below accrued benefits. Parameters which result in non-negative values for

would imply that the option would never be exercised.3

      Equations (5) and (7) generalize the formula for the perpetual American

put option presented in Merton (1973). In the special case that A is

nonstochastic, that C=O and CA=_r (which offsets the growth in A due to

the time value of money and thereby causes the dollar value of the "exercise

price", A, to be constant), e   equals -2r/a2 and (5) reduces to Merton's

equation (52).


A.1 Comparative Statics

      It is possible, although tedious, to show analytically that the value of

the termination option increases with 0A and decreases with Cs.

Conversely, the ratio of S/A at which it is optimal to terminate falls with

CA and increases with C. The intuition for these results is

straightforward: when the gap between the growth rates of accrued benefits

and the assets backing those benefits (S =    F.3E)     increases, the expected

profits from a future exercise of the put option increase and the value of

waiting to exercise correspondingly increases. These results are illustrated

in Table 1, in which optimal ratios, K* =     (S/A)*,   for pension termination and

the value of the pension put are presented for various values of 0A and

C5 and for an interest rate of .10 and a variance rate of .05g. Recall

that the certainty equivalent drifts in A and S are respectively r +       C and
r +         Therefore the parameters presented in Table 1. correspond to
       C.
combinations of sustained growth rates of -.08 to .06.

       The put values in the second panel are calculated assuming that A = S =

1.0.     Therefore these entries may be interpreted as the value of the pension

insurance as a fraction of total asset value when the pension put is exactly

at-the-money, i.e., when the total assets backing the pension fund

obligations equal the present value of those obligations. emember, however,

that this condition does not correspond to full funding of the pension fund

since S includes the contingent liability of the firm of .3E. Of course,

formula (6) could be used to generate actuarially fair values of the

insurance for any initial values of A and S.

     The table demonstrates that the value of the termination put can be sub-

stantial. As a base case, the zero drift configuration of CA and

gives a pension put value of 18 percent of the value of accrued liabilities.

Therefore even fully funded plans (where funding includes the firm's

contingent liability of .3E) can pose significant risk to the PBGC. When Cr

    Cs) is negative (i.e., when pension assets are being depleted because of
payments to retirees) or when Cr ÷
                                      CA)
                                             is     positive,      pension insurance

values increase dramatically.

     It is interesting to note that when CA =
                                                      C   =   0,    e=O and the pension

put will never he terminated. In this case, the "exercise price," A, is:

growing at an expected rate equal to its cost of capital;: therefore, in

contrast to the standard put option, waiting to exercise does not impose a

time value of money cost.

     The table also can be used to examine the effects of equal changes in

Cs and CA. Reading down the diagonals from top left to bottom right

demonstrates that the optimal voluntary termination ratio decreases for

larger (algebraic) values for these growth rates. The value of the pension

put correspondingly increases. These results derive from the effect of scale

on the termination decision. If a pension fund is increasing in size (large

positive CA,CS), then the dollar gain from a termination for any given

ratio of S/A is   larger.   If the fund is growing, it pays to wait to

terminate, and the ratio S/A must be smaller to induce early termination.
                                            —11.—




Thus, one should expect termination decisions to be more frequent in
declining industries in which pension funds are shrinking. These results

also   can be verified analytically: Equal (algebraic) increases in C and
C always increase the value of P(A, S) and lower the termination ratio, K*.


.2     Corporate   pension Funding Policy
     Bulow (1981) and Harrison and Sharpe (1982) examine   pension funding
policy    in a model with taxes and with an exogenous termination date. They

conclude   that a firm should fund its plan either to the maximum or the
minimum level permitted. This razor's edge characteristic is also a property
of the voluntary termination model.
     To confirm this point, compute the first and second derivatives of (A,S)

with respect to pension funding, S:



           =   (l-K)S1AK
           = -[K/(S/A)]                                                 (B)




     ss        c(c1)(1-K)    S2K     > 0                                (9)


where the final form of equation (8) is obtained    by substituting for c from
(7). From (B), for any nonterminated plan (i.e., K<S/A), we have that

            so that each dollar contributed reduces the insurance value by

less than 1 dollar, and by (9), each successive dollar contributed reduces

the insurance value by progressively smaller amounts. In contrast, the

marginal tax shield arising from contributions to the pension fund is

independent of the level of current funding (Black [1980], Tepper [1981]).
                                       —15—




Therefore, the firm will always be forced to a corner solution: t any

interior point, if one dollar of extra funding results in an incremental tax

shield which exceeds the marginal decrease in the value of pension insurance,

then so must the next dollar contribution and so on. Conversely, if

marginally decreased funding is optimal in the interior, then so must be

further decreases until some statutory limit is reached. See figure 1.

    Bulow (1982) has argued that accrued benefits rather than projected

benefits   is the relevant variable for assessing corporate pension
liabilities. The approach taken in this paper leads to an intermediate
position   in this debate. Although it is true that at a termination, the

firm's liability is only accrued benefits, the model shows that in the

presence of PBGC insurance, projected benefits (as represented by CA)

influence the decision to terminate as well as the present values of both

°BGC and firm liabilities.



B. PBGC Liabilities with Termination Only at Bankruptcy

    When the pension plan terminates only if the firm is bankrupt, the firm

loses the special put option conveyed by the current pension insurance

system. Instead, at bankruptcy, the PBGC simply assumes the pension fund.

    The value of the PBGC liability will depend in general upon the exact

conditions which set off a bankruptcy.    I will assume that bankruptcy is

declared when the value of the firm, V. falls below the present value of the

debt obligations of the firm where that value is computed under the

assumption that the obligations will be fully met. (This notion of debt,

rather than market value, is the appropriate one because limited liability

assures that the market value of debt can never exceed V). Although this

       The pension plan is terminated when S/A < K, or at S = KA.   At
   termination, the obligation of the PBGC equals A — S = (1 — K)A. Before
   termination, the insurance is worth P(A,S) . The tangency at S = KA is
   the termination point.

       The present value of tax savings from pension funding increases with
   funding, or, holding E fixed, with S. The present value of tax savings
   is proportional to the level of funding.

       The total increment to firm value is maximized at either the minimum
   or maximum permitted funding levels.

definition of bankruptcy is at odds with the technical definition that a firm

fails to meet a coupon or principal payment, it still seems a useful way to

model bankruptcy for the present purpose. Firms in practice have several

overlapping debt issues outstanding with associated sinking fund covenants

which would make the modelling of bankruptcy in a legal context exceedingly

complex and firm-specific. Economic insolvency is a more straightforward

approach.

    Denote    by D the present value of debt obligations computed by discounting
at the riskless-in-tey,ns-of_default interest rate. Then insolvency occurs at
the first occurrence of V <             D.    t that moment, the PB'C inherits a net
liability of A - F,1o where F denotes               the value of the funds in the pension

plan.   The PBGC's claim to 30 percent of firm net worth is irrelevant in this
instance, since at bankruptcy, when V<D, equity has no value.
    To derive the value of the               PBGC insurance, we proceed   as 5efore. The
dynamics for debt, pension funds and firm value are taken to he the diffusion

where 0F denotes the rate of contributions to the pension fund as a

fraction of F. In a nonstochastic steady state with a constant interest

rate, CF would equal —r. All fund earnings would be withdrawn to help pay

benefits to current retirees so that total fund assets would remain unchanged

over time. The covariances between the instantaneous rates of return on the

variables will be denoted by a, CDV' and So Ofl.

      Optimal corporate pension funding policy in the hankruptcy-only model

resembles that in the voluntary termination model. The partial derivative of

P(D,V,F,A) with respect to the funding level, F, is simply -(DIV)9. which is

independent of F. Thus, we again obtain a razor's edge property: If /V is

sufficiently small, then the tax benefits of additional funding will dominate

the   transfer   of wealth to the PBGC and the firm will fund to the statutory

limit. Otherwise, minimal funding will be value-maximizing.



C.    The General Case

      A general treatment of PBGC insurance would allow for termination either

at the first occurrence of a voluntary termination point or at the first

occurrence of corporate bankruptcy. s a general rule, however, there is no

closed form solution for the value of PBGC pension insurance in this mixed

case. The difficulty arises from the effects of debt on the variance rate of

the firm's equity. Geske (197'fl has shown that the variance rate evolves

stochastically in this situation. Because the assets hacking pension

benefits, S, include 30 percent of firm net worth, G      in   equation (5) could

no longer be taken as a fixed parameter, and the solution for the value of the

pension insurance consequently would need to be modified. This effect,

together with the fact that termination can result from either of two

conditions, appears to make a numerical solution technique necessary. Even

the numerical approach presents difficulties, however, since the problem would

involve four state variables: A, S, V, and 0.

      Jotwithstanding these complications, equations (5) and (10) still can be

of use in valuing PBGC liabilities. (5) should be an upper bound on the value

of pension insurance, since that valuation formula was derived using the
                                        -.19—




termination rule which maximizes the value of the insurance. In contrast, the

termination   only—at--bankruptcy model provides a lower bound on the value of
the insurance. ror firms that are financially healthy but which have severely
underfunded plans, (3) will be a close approximation to the true insurance
value.    In contrast, for firms near bankruptcy, (10) will be fairly accurate.
    tn practice, underfunded plans are associated with financially troubled

firms. Therefore, the true value of the PBGC insurance falls somewhere in the

interior of the valuation bounds. The models provide some clues as to why

troubled firms should tend to maintain underfunded plans. One possibility is

that such firms have low marginal tax rates due to loss carry-forward

provisions, and therefore derive less tax benefit from pension funding.

Another explanation is that underfunding the pension plan represents a source

of implicit financing cheaper than that available in outside credit markets.

This advantage will be greatest for firms with the highest borrowing rates.

Finally, if bankruptcy causes the firm to forfeit the pension assets to the

?BGC, overfunding of the plan would create a potential ban'ruptcy cost to

which troubled firms would be more sensitive. This effect was made explicit

in Section B in which it was shown that firms with large values of 0/V will

find that minimal funding is value-maximizing.



0. Risk-Rated Premiums

    The   valuation equations derived in Sections A and B provide the present
value of PBGC liabilities under different scenarios. They do not, however,

provide explicit means to calculate fair annual premium rates for pension

insurance. Because fund termination dates are stochastic, the premium annuity

which has an ex ante present value equal to the present value of 0BGC
                                       -20-


obligations cannot be easily calculated. One approach which might provide a
reasonable approximation to the fair premium rate would he to first calculate
the expected value of the time to termination, and then calculate the annuity
appropriate to the present value of PBGC obligations using a horizon equal to
the expected time until termination and an interest rate equal to that paid on
the   firm's outstanding debt.

       different approach would require ex post settling up. t the start of

each period, the present value of PBGC obligations would be calculated. At

period end, that value would be recalculated, and the firm would pay (or be

paid) the change in the value of PBGC liabilities. The advantage of this

scheme is that it eliminates most of the moral hazard problems involved in

prespecified rate structures. Any increase in risk would induce increased

premiums. The firm would always pay a fair price for its pension-put option

(or for its limited liability in the bankruptcy model) and would thus lose the

ability and the incentive to underfund at the expense of the PBG(.



II. Empirical Estimates

      Pensions and Investment Age (July ii, 1933) reports pension fund

statistics derived from the 1982 annual reports of the Fortune 100 companies.

The survey includes pension fund assets, vested benefits, and the assumed

interest rate used to derive the present value of vested benefits. This

information can be used for this sample of firms.

      The survey expresses pension fund assets as market values. The market

value of vested benefits can be approximated by multiplying the reported value

 of benefits by the ratio of the plan's assumed interest rate to the actual

 long-term market interest rate for 1932. This adjustment assumes that pension
                                        —21.—




benefit   payout streams have time paths similar to perpetuities. The average

rate on 30-year U.S. government obligations in 1982 was 12.76 percent. The

market value of equity is easily derived from stock market data at year-end

1982,   and total firm value can he approximated as equity plus book value of
long-term debt.    I will calculate the value of PBGC insurance for 3 scenarios:
a steady state scenario, for which there is no expected growth in pension fund
assets or liabilities, a growth scenario, in which a 5 percent long-term

growth rate is assumed, and a declining industry scenario involving a negative

5 percent growth rate.

      The remaining inputs required to estimate the value of ?BGC   insurance are
the variance and covariance rates on   underlying securities. Table 2 presents

the   values assigned to these variables. These values are meant to be
reasonable guesses only. The low variance rates on A and 0 and high
correlation between the two reflect their similar natures as nominal
liabilities. The variance rates on firm value and pension fund assets compare
to a historical value for the SP50O of approximately .05 annually. The
variance rate for V is derived by unlevering the SP500 variance using a
debt-to-value ratio of 1/3 and then by doubling that variance to account for
the lack of diversification of a single stock relative to the index. The
variance rate on fund assets is set equal to that on the SP500. The fund is
probably less well diversified than the index but this effect is offset by
debt held in the fund.
      Tables 3a and 3b present estimates of the value of BGC insurance for 37

of the Fortune 1.00 firms. Thirteen observations were lost because of missing

data. Table 3a presents results based on the 12.75 precent yield on 30-year

T-bonds during 1982, while Table 35 uses a 10 percent interest rate. Columns

I and 2 of the tables are the present value of vested benefits for each plan,

and the level of overfunding of each plan, respectively. 'olumns 3-S are the

ratios of the value of PBGC insurance to vested benefits for the voluntary

termination scenario and the bankruptcy-only scenario under the 3 assumptions

for the growth rate of the olan. These ratios can be interpreted as the

fraction of pension benefits which are financed (in present value terms) by

the PBGC. The ratios thus give a measure of the PBGC subsidy per dollar of

pension benefits.

   The results in the appendices are consolidated in Tables 4 and 5. Table 4

presents summary statistics and Table 5 presents frequency distributions for

the insurance values. The most striking feature of the results is the

skewness of the insurance values, which is revealed in Table 5. Most plans

are sufficiently overfunded as to pose almost no termination risk to the

PBGC. However, a small number of "problem firms" derive considerable value

from the pension insurance. These tend to he the larger firms: the weighted

averages of the insurance values are substantially greater than the means. In

fact for the bankruptcy-only cases, the simple mean of the insurance values is

negative even for r = 10 percent while the weighted average is positive. The

negative values reflect my assumptions that if an overfurided plan terminates

because of firm bankruptcy, the PBGC inherits the plan surplus, and so can

have a negative liability.

    As expected, PBGC liabilities are extremely sensitive to the interest rate

used in calculating vested benefits. Table 4 shows that insurance values in

the voluntary termination scenario are more than twice as large for a 10

percent interest rate as they are for the actual 1982 rate of 12.76 percent.

Average insurance values in the bankruptcy-only scenario become positive as
                                       —23—




the interest rate falls to 10 percent. This reflects the sharp increase in

the   present value of benefits. The total underfunding of all underfunded
pension plans rises from $.48 billion to M.47   billion   as the interest rate
falls.
      Consistent with the comparative statics results above, the value of

pension insurance tends to rise with the assumed growth rates in A, S and .

Insurance values in the voluntary termination scenario more than triple as
growth rates increase from -.05 to .05. As noted earlier, this tendency

reflects the effect of scale on insurance value. cor growing funds, firms can

increase   the insurance value by delaying termination until a larger dollar
gain can he realized.
      The total values of PBGC insurance for the 87 firms are also presented in
Table 4.    The magnitudes of these numbers are quite impressive. Total

insurance   values for the voluntary termination scenario are between 1.25 and
3.6 billion dollars using the 12.76 percent rate and between 3.8 and U)
billion dollars using a 10 percent rate. These values compare with PBGC

reserves for insured future benefits of only 1.14 billion (PBGC nnual

Report, fiscal year 1982). Therefore, if the option to terminate voluntarily

is to be taken seriously, the PBGC reserve calculations are wildly

optimistic. The insurance values for individual firms also differ from the

traditional   measure of underfunding (A-F-.3E) by wide margins, and highlight
the pitfalls of ignoring the option component of pension insurance in
assessing PBGC liabilities. The bankruptcy-only insurance values are, as

expected, far more favorable. In fact, for the higher interest rate, firms

are sufficiently overfunded to drive aggregate net liabilities below zero. As

interest rates decline, the ?BGC is again at great risk although even in this

case,
                                       —2 —




PBGC   liabilities would be halved by a reform in ERIS prohibiting voluntary

termination. The steady state (zero growth) insurance value at a 10 percent

rate is Z2.54 billion. Keep in mind that these insurance values are summed

over only the 37 firms in the sample. PBGC liabilities for all insured firms

must be significantly greater.



III. Conclusion

     This paper derives the value of PBGC pension insurance liabilities under

two scenarios of interest. The first scenario allows for voluntary plan

termination, which appears to be legal under current statutes. The second is

a   termination only-at-bankruptcy scenario, which has been   proposed as a reform

to current law. Optimal pension fund financing decisions are examined;

extreme pension funding policies are shown to he optimal in both settings.

This result corroborates and generalizes those of earlier authors. inally,

empirical estimates of PBGC liabilities are derived. These show that a small

number of funds account for a large fraction of total prospective PB(C

liabilities, and that those total liabilities far exceed current reserves for

plan termination.

     the    plan plus 30 percent of net worth to the PBGC at a "price" equal to
     the present value of pension liabilities. The gain to the firm      equals    the

     of    a termination could be large if it affected the willingness of the
     government to participate in a    bail-out   scheme for the company. Such
     extreme examples are probably rare, however.



'.   If    the fund is overfunded, this equation implies that the firm receives

     CA This might be unrealistic: Bulow and Scholes (1982) cite an example

     of a terminating fund in which the surplus was split between the firm and

     its employees. However, this issue is of limited relevance for this

     paper. The PBGC is unconcerned with termination of overfunded plans and

     presumably would not block the establishment of a new fund. Overfunded
                                         -25-



     plans are not terminated in order to escape liablities and so fall outside
     of the scope of this paper.



5.   1 assume that     is constant. This assumption is necessary to derive

     analytic   solutions below. However, it is unrealistic to the extent that
     firms with underfunded plans are forced to increase funding rates. In
     this case, C would be a function of the funding status, and would
     evolve stochastically. Numerical techniques would he required to compute
     the value of pension insurance.



6.   I will treat     as a constant. This treatment is appropriate when the

     firm has no debt outstanding other than its pension liabilities (Geske,

     1979). Thus, this specification is     suitable   for the voluntary termination

     model, but would need to he modified for the more general case in which

     the firm can go bankrupt.     1 will assume that no dividends are paid out by

     the firm, and that all dividends received by the pension fund are

     reinvested in the fund, so that aS may be equated with the expected rate

     of return on the assets backing the pension liabilities.



7. This condition does not necessarily imply that the firm's goal is to

     maximize the value of the pension option. It implies only that

     conditional on other decisions, the termination rule is option-value

     maximizing. For example, in some situations, tax considerations may lead

     a   firm to pursue pension funding policies that reduce the value of the
     pension put. Nevertheless, the termination rule must maximize the value

     of the put given that funding policy.

8.    The insurance policy could have infinite value in this case.         or example,

      for large 0A and C=0, the option would provide a claim on a payoff

      that would be growing faster than the rate of interest. The value would

      be infinite although the option would never be exercised. Obviously, one

      would not observe values of (constant)        and   leadinq to these

      singular   cases.



9. Using a variance rate for S of .05 (which approximates the historical vari-
      ance of    the SP 500), a variance rate for A of .01 and a correlation
      coefficient   of .1 yields a2 = .05 + .01 -   2L1)L0005)1'2   =   .055.   1



      rounded down to account for the fact that pension funds hold some debt in

      their portfolios. The entries in Table 1 were not extremely sensitive to

      changes in



10. According to this specification, the PBGC would gain by the bankruptcy of

      a   firm with an overfunded pension plan, since it would   simply inherit

      ownership    of that plan. There seems to be some uncertainty as to the
      procedures that actually would be followed in such a circumstance, since
      in practice, bankrupt firms have had underfunded plans.



ii.   Negative values for o or $ would indicate non-finite values for the
      insurance.
