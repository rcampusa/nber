This paper contributes to a literature that studies optimal capital control policy in open economy
models with pecuniary externalities due to flow collateral constraints. It shows that the optimal
policy calls for capital controls to be lowered during booms and to be increased during
recessions. These findings are at odds with the conventional view that capital controls should be
tightened during expansions to curb capital inflows and relaxed during contractions to discourage
capital flight.

1     Introduction
This paper contributes to a literature that studies optimal capital control policy in open
economy models with pecuniary externalities due to flow collateral constraints. A central
question in this literature is whether this type of model can rationalize macroprudential
policy. The concept of prudential capital control policy has two main dimensions. One
dimension concerns the long-run behavior of capital controls and asserts that capital controls
should be positive on average to reduce overborrowing. The second dimension holds that
capital control policy should be used countercyclically. Capital controls should be increased
during booms and lowered during recessions. The existing literature has established that
in open economy models with collateral constraints capital controls are indeed positive on
average. Thus, this class of models is in line with the first dimension of macroprudential
capital-control policy. The goal of this paper is to investigate whether in this class of models
optimal capital-control policy is also consistent with the aforementioned second dimension
of macroprudentiality.
    To this end, we characterize Ramsey-optimal capital-control policy in an open economy
with a flow collateral constraint. We focus on the case in which tradable and nontradable out-
put have collateral value, because it is the type of flow collateral constraint most frequently
studied in the related literature. This model features a pecuniary externality originating
from the fact that the relative price of nontradable goods, which determines the value of
collateral, is taken as given by households but does depend in equilibrium on their collective
consumption and borrowing decisions.
   The existing narrative of how this externality may call for countercyclical capital control
policy is as follows. A positive shock that expands aggregate demand pushes the price of
nontradables up raising the value of collateral and easing access to credit, which in turn
amplifies the expansion in aggregate demand. Similarly, a negative shock that reduces ag-
gregate demand leads to a decline in the relative price of nontradables making the value
of nontradable output in terms of tradable goods fall and the collateral constraint tighten,
which deepens the contraction. It is then natural to expect that a benevolent planner who
internalizes the effect of domestic absorption on the value of collateral would have an incen-
tive to tighten capital controls during booms and to ease them during busts, as a way to
reduce the excess amplitude of the business cycle caused by the pecuniary externality.
    We find that this intuition does not play out in the context of the models analyzed in
this literature. The Ramsey-optimal policy calls for capital control taxes to be lowered dur-
ing booms and to be increased during recessions. The correct intuition has to do with the
way in which the Ramsey planner handles a characteristic of households that is ubiquitously


                                               1
assumed in quantitative models of collateral constraints, namely, that households are impa-
tient in the sense that they discount the future at a higher rate than the market (in the usual
terminology, β(1 + r) < 1). This assumption is needed in all existing models to generate
empirically plausible frequencies of financial crises. The Ramsey planner faces a trade-off.
On the one hand, he wants to accommodate the household’s desire to front load consump-
tion via the accumulation of external debt. On the other hand, he wishes to avoid financial
crises, because they are costly in terms of welfare as they require large cuts in consumption
when the economy deleverages. The Ramsey planner resolves this trade-off by increasing
debt taxes during contractions, because these are times when a financial crisis is most likely,
and lowering them during booms, when a financial crisis is less likely.
   Our baseline environment is identical to Bianchi (2011) along all dimensions, model,
functional forms, driving forces, and calibration. This is an interesting point of reference,
because it is a framework widely used in the related quantitative literature. The Bianchi
model is driven by shocks to the endowments of tradable and nontradable goods. The central
result of our investigation is that in the context of this model optimal capital controls are
lowered during booms and raised during contractions.
   We then extend the model to allow for interest rate shocks in addition to endowment
shocks. This environment is of interest because interest rate shocks have been shown to be
a major driver of business cycles in emerging countries (Neumeyer and Perri, 2005; Uribe
and Yue, 2006; and Garcı́a Cicco, Pancrazi, and Uribe, 2010) and yet are less common in
quantitative models with collateral constraints. The central result of the paper is robust to
this extension. The Ramsey planner finds it optimal to lower debt taxes during booms and
to increase them during contractions.
   This paper is related to a growing literature studying macroprudential policy in the
context of open economy models with collateral constraints. Output-based flow collateral
constraints were introduced in open economy models by Mendoza (2002). The externality
that emerges when debt is denominated in tradable goods but leveraged on nontradable
income and the consequent room for macroprudential policy is emphasized in Korinek (2011).
Bianchi (2011) shows that the pecuniary externality leads to overborrowing and that the
optimal capital control tax is positive on average, but does not characterize the cyclical
properties of optimal capital controls, which is the focus of the present study. Benigno et al.
(2013) introduce production and Benigno et al. (2014) introduce a tax on nontradables that
makes the first best attainable. Uribe (2006, 2007) establishes that overborrowing does not
depend on whether foreign lenders impose collateral constraints at the aggregate level or at
the level of the individual agent. Bianchi, Liu, and Mendoza (2016) introduce noisy news and
regime shifts in the world interest rate in an output-based flow collateral constraint economy


                                              2
and show that optimal debt taxes are decreasing in the precision of news. Bianchi and
Mendoza (forthcoming) and Jeanne and Korinek (2010) show that in open economies with
stock collateral constraints the optimal capital control policy is time inconsistent. Bianchi
and Mendoza characterize time consistent debt tax policy and show that capital controls are
positive when there is a positive probability that the collateral constraint will bind in the
next period.
        The remainder of the paper is presented in five sections. Section 2 presents the model.
Section 3 characterizes the Ramsey-optimal capital control problem. Section 4 shows that
optimal capital-control policy is procyclical in the Bianchi (2011) model, which as mentioned
above is driven by tradable and nontradable endowment shocks. Section 5 establishes that
the procyclical nature of optimal capital control policy is robust to allowing for country-
interest-rate shocks. Section 6 discusses the central results of the paper and concludes.


2         The Model
We perform the analysis in the context of a prototypical theoretical environment, namely,
the one presented in Bianchi (2011).1 Consider a small open endowment economy in which
households have preferences of the form
                                                      ∞
                                                      X
                                                 E0         β tU(ct ),                       (1)
                                                      t=0


where ct denotes consumption in period t, U(·) denotes an increasing and concave period
utility function, β ∈ (0, 1) denotes a subjective discount factor, and Et denotes the expecta-
tions operator conditional on information available in period t. The period utility function
takes the CRRA form
                                          c1−σ − 1
                                               U(c) =
                                                   ,
                                            1−σ
with σ > 0. We assume that consumption is a composite of tradable and nontradable goods
aggregated in a CES fashion,
                                              h                               i1/(1−1/ξ)

                          ct = A(cTt , cN
                                        t ) ≡   ac t       + (1 − a)c t                  ,   (2)

where cTt denotes consumption of tradables in period t and cN
                                                            t denotes consumption of
nontradables in period t. Households are assumed to have access to a single, one-period,
risk-free, internationally-traded bond denominated in terms of tradable goods that pays the

constraint is given by
                                                                     dt+1

                                         t + dt = yt + pt yt +             ,                        (3)
                                                                    1 + rt
where dt denotes the amount of debt due in period t and dt+1 denotes the amount of debt
assumed in period t and maturing in t + 1. The variable pt denotes the relative price of
nontradables in terms of tradables, and ytT and ytN denote the endowments of tradables and
nontradables, respectively. Both endowments are assumed to be exogenously given. The
collateral constraint takes the form

                                        dt+1 ≤ κ(ytT + pt ytN ),                                    (4)

where κ > 0 is a parameter. Households internalize this borrowing limit. Yet, the borrow-
ing constraint introduces an externality, because each individual household takes the real
exchange rate, pt , as exogenously determined, even though in equilibrium their collective
absorption is a key determinant of this relative price.
   Households choose a set of processes {cTt , cN
                                                t , ct , dt+1 } to maximize (1) subject to (2)-(4),
given the processes {rt , pt , ytT , ytN } and the initial debt position d0 . The first-order conditions
of this problem are (2)-(4) and

where β tλt and β t λt µt denote the Lagrange multipliers on the sequential budget constraint (3)
and the collateral constraint (4), respectively. The Euler equation (7) equates the marginal
benefit of assuming more debt with its marginal cost. In periods in which the collateral
constraint does not bind, one unit of debt payable in t + 1 increases tradable consumption
by 1/(1 + rt ) units in period t, which increases utility by λt /(1 + rt ). The marginal cost
of an extra unit of debt assumed in period t and payable in t + 1 is the marginal utility of
consumption in period t + 1 discounted at the subjective discount factor, βEtλt+1 . During

marginal utility of increasing debt falls to [1/(1 + rt ) − µt ]λt , reflecting a shadow penalty for
trying to increase debt when the collateral constraint is binding.
   In equilibrium, the market for nontradables must clear. That is,

given processes {rt , ytT , ytN } and the initial condition d0 .
   The fact that cTt appears on the right-hand side of the equilibrium version of the collateral
constraint (12) means that during contractions in which the aggregate absorption of tradables
falls, the collateral constraint endogenously tightens. Individual agents fail to internalize that
such movements in aggregate absorption are in part caused by their own expenditure choices.
This is the nature of the pecuniary externality in this model.
    From the perspective of the individual household, equations (3) and (4) define a convex
set of feasible debt choices, dt+1 . That is, if two debt levels d1 and d2 satisfy (3) and (4), then
any weighted average αd1 + (1 − α)d2 for α ∈ [0, 1] also satisfies these two conditions. From
an equilibrium perspective, however, this ceases to be true in general. The reason is that
the relative price of nontradables, pt , which appears on the right-hand side of the collateral
constraint (4) is increasing in consumption of tradables by equation (6), which, in turn, is
increasing in dt+1 by the resource constraint (11). To see this, use equilibrium condition (11)
to eliminate cTt from equilibrium condition (12) to obtain
                                                                                1/ξ

It is clear from this expression that the right-hand side is increasing in the equilibrium level

                                                          5
of external debt, dt+1 . Moreover, depending on the values assumed by the parameters κ, a,
and ξ, the equilibrium value of collateral may increase more than one for one with dt+1 . In
other words, an increase in debt, instead of tightening the collateral constraint may relax it.
In this case, the more indebted the economy becomes, the less leveraged it is. Schmitt-Grohé
and Uribe (2016a) show that this feature of the model can give rise to self-fulfilling financial
crises in which the price of collateral falls due to nonfundamental pessimistic sentiments. In
the present paper, however, we limit attention to parameterizations for which the equilibrium
is unique.


3     Optimal Capital Control Policy
The pecuniary externality created by the presence of the relative price of nontradables in
the collateral constraint induces an allocation that is in general suboptimal, not only when
compared to the allocation that would result in the absence of a collateral constraint, but
also relative to the best allocation possible among all of the ones that satisfy the collateral
constraint. As a result, the collateral constraint opens the door to welfare improving policy
intervention. Here, like in much of the related literature (see Korinek, 2011; Bianchi, 2011)
we study capital controls, because they essentially represent a tax on external borrowing,
which is the variable most directly affected by the pecuniary externality. In fact, the optimal
capital control policy fully internalizes the pecuniary externality, in the sense that it induces
the representative household to behave as if it understood that its own borrowing choices
influence the relative price of nontradables and therefore the value of collateral.
   We assume that the government is benevolent in the sense that it seeks to maximize the
well-being of the representative household. Further, we assume that the government has the
ability to commit to policy promises. That is, we characterize the Ramsey optimal capital
control policy in the context of an open economy with a flow collateral constraint.
   Let τt be a proportional tax on debt acquired in period t. If τt is positive, it represents a
proper capital control tax, whereas if it is negative it has the interpretation of a borrowing
subsidy. The revenue from capital control taxes is given by τt dt+1 /(1 + rt ). We assume that
the government consumes no goods and that it rebates all revenues from capital controls to
the public in the form of lump-sum transfers (lump-sum taxes if τt < 0), denoted `t . The
budget constraint of the government is then given by

                                               dt+1
                                         τt          = `t .                                 (15)
                                              1 + rt




                                                  6
       The household’s sequential budget constraint now becomes

                                                                         dt+1
                         cTt + pt cN         T       N
                                   t + dt = yt + pt yt + (1 − τt )             + `t .
                                                                        1 + rt

This expression makes it clear that the capital control tax distorts the borrowing decision
of the household. In particular, the gross interest rate on foreign borrowing perceived by
the private household is no longer 1 + rt , but (1 + rt )/(1 − τt ). All other things equal, the
higher is τt , the higher is the interest rate perceived by households. Thus, by changing τt
the government can encourage or discourage borrowing. All optimality conditions associated
with the household’s optimization problem (equations (5)-(9)) are unchanged, except for the
debt Euler equation (7), which now takes the form

                                        1 − τt
                                                  

       The benevolent government sets capital control taxes to maximize the household’s lifetime
utility subject to the restriction that the optimal allocation be supportable as a competitive

subject to (17)-(23), given processes ytT , ytN and rt and the initial condition d0 . In the welfare
function (24), we have replaced consumption of nontradables, cN
                                                              t , with the endowment of
nontradables, ytN , because the Ramsey planner takes into account that in a competitive
equilibrium the market for nontradables clears at all times.
   The above equilibrium conditions look like a formidable set of constraints. Fortunately,
it is possible to reduce the set of constraints considerably. In particular, it turns out that any
processes cTt and dt+1 satisfy equilibrium conditions (17)-(23) if and only if they satisfy (17)
and                                     "                             1ξ     #

To see this, suppose cTt and dt+1 satisfy (17) and (25). We must establish that (17)-(23)
are also satisfied. Obviously, the resource constraint (17) holds. Now pick pt to satisfy (21).
This is possible, because the process cTt is given. Now use (21) to eliminate pt from (18).
The resulting expression is (25), establishing that (18) holds. Next, pick λt to satisfy (19).
Now, set µt = 0 for all t. It follows immediately that the slackness condition (22) and the
non-negativity condition (23) are satisfied. Finally, pick τt to ensure that (20) holds, that is,

                                              U 0 (A(cTt+1, yt+1

                                                                               N
                                                                                   )

Next, we need to show the reverse statement, that is, that processes cTt and dt+1 that sat-
isfy (17)-(23) also satisfy (17) and (25). Obviously, (17) is satisfied. Combining (18) with (21)
yields (25). This completes the proof of the equivalence of the constraint sets (17)-(23) and
(17) and (25).
   A discussion of why the Lagrange multiplier µt can be taken to be nil at all times in
the above proof is in order. First, it is important to note that µt is the Lagrange multiplier
associated with the individual household’s collateral constraint, not the Ramsey planner’s.
The multiplier µt can be nil even if for the country as a whole the shadow value of collateral
is strictly positive. Second, the result that µt can be chosen to be nil at all times does not
mean that the collateral constraint will never bind in equilibrium. It simply means that
the policymaker can pick the capital control policy in such a way that when the collateral
constraint binds, individual agents feel that they would make the same debt choice whether


                                                     8
they were constrained by the collateral restriction or not. That is, the collateral constraint
binds but individually, given the taxes they face, households do not feel restricted thereby.
   The Lagrange multiplier, µt , need not be zero at all times. In particular, we could have
picked a tax policy such that the private sector’s Lagrange multiplier µt is positive in states
in which the collateral constraint binds. In other words, µt and τt are indeterminate in
states in which the collateral constraint is binding in equilibrium. The proof of this result
is straightforward: if the collateral constraint binds, then the slackness condition (22) is
satisfied regardless of the value of µt . In addition, the Euler equation (20) features both τt
and µt , so any combination of these two variables that makes this equation hold and that
satisfies µt ≥ 0, given the process λt represents a solution. None of the remaining equilibrium
conditions from the set (17)-(23) contains either µt or τt , so this completes the proof that µt
and τt are indeterminate in states in which the collateral constraint binds.
       We can then state the Ramsey problem as2

Note that the constraints of the Ramsey planner’s problem may not be a convex set. That
is, if two pairs (cTt , dt+1 ) satisfy both constraints given dt , then a linear combination of these
two pairs may not. This is because the right-hand side of the second constraint is convex
in cTt for ξ < 1. Nonetheless, generically, the Ramsey allocation is unique because it is the
outcome of a maximization problem.
       An important characteristic of the above maximization problem is that the Ramsey
planner internalizes the pecuniary externality. That is, he understands that individual con-
sumption of tradables affects the relative price of nontradables, pt , and therefore also the
value of collateral. This is evident from the fact that cTt appears on the right-hand side of the
second constraint. This means that endowing the Ramsey planner with a single distorting
   2
    The Ramsey problem is time consistent. This is because in any given period t, the constraints, (17)
and (25), involve only variables that are either predetermined in period t (dt ), exogenous (ytT , ytN , rt ), or
chosen in period t (cTt , dt+1 ), but they do not involve endogenous variables that will be determined in future
periods. By contrast, in models in which assets serve as collateral the Ramsey problem does suffer from a
time inconsistency problem as pointed out by Bianchi and Mendoza (forthcoming) and Jeanne and Korinek
(2010).

policy instrument, namely, the capital control tax τt , allows him to induce agents to fully
internalize the pecuniary externality.
    Given the Ramsey allocation {cTt , dt+1 }, one can obtain the relative price of nontradables
in the associated competitive equilibrium, pt , from equation (21) and the private marginal
utility of wealth, λt , from equation (19).
    If the collateral constraint is binding, then, as discussed above, τt is indeterminate. Be-
cause, the household’s Lagrange multiplier on the collateral constraint, µt , must be nonneg-
ative, µt ≥ 0, equation (20) implies that τt is bounded above by the right-hand-side of (26),
which is less than one, implying a tax rate less than one hundred percent. In principle,
the Ramsey planner could subsidize borrowing (τt < 0), as in those states the collateral
constraint is what determines the amount of borrowing and the value of τt —provided it is
less than the upper bound—is irrelevant.
      In states in which the collateral constraint is slack under the Ramsey allocation, the
Ramsey optimal capital control tax, τt is given by (26). Alternatively, one can express the
optimal capital control tax in terms of the Ramsey planner’s Lagrange multipliers on the
resource and collateral constraints, respectively, as in Bianchi (2011). Under some regularity
                                                                      1         Et λR

This expression provides several important insights. First, when the collateral constraint is
slack in the current state and in all immediate successor states to the current state, that is,
when µR
      t+1 = 0 in all states following the current state, then the optimal capital control tax
in the current state is zero, τt = 0. Second, this expression says that when the collateral
constraint is slack in period t under the Ramsey allocation, then the optimal capital control
tax is bounded below by zero. This follows from the fact that 0 < λt ≤ λR t . Third, the fact

      See the appendix for a detailed derivation of this expression.


                                                       10
that τt ≥ 0 proves that the pecuniary externality induced by the collateral constraints calls
for positive capital control taxes on average—as long as the collateral constraint is binding
in some states in the ergodic distribution of the Ramsey optimal allocation. Thus one can
infer from equation (28) that optimal capital controls are macroprudential in the sense that
they are positive on average. Finally, an implication of the fact that optimal capital control
taxes are bounded below by zero and positive on average is that the interest rate faced by
households in the economy with optimal capital control taxes, (1 + rt )/(1 − τt ), is greater or
equal than the interest rate faced by households in the unregulated economy. This suggests
that debt should be lower in the Ramsey economy than in the unregulated economy, that is,
the unregulated economy should display overborrowing relative to the Ramsey economy.
   The focus of the present paper, however, is to characterize the cyclical properties of opti-
mal capital controls, with an eye on ascertaining whether they are used in a countercyclical
fashion, that is, increased during good times and lowered during bad times. Suppose that in
the current state the collateral constraint is slack and there are some immediate successor
states in which it will bind. We have just shown that in such a state the tax rate is given
by (28) and thus is positive, that is, τt > 0. Consider now a negative shock to the endowment
with the property that the collateral constraint in the current period remains slack. Then
the Ramsey optimal tax rate continues to be given by (28). To first order, the response
of τt is of the same sign as the response of the expected value of µR
                                                                    t+1 Ψt+1 . The negative
endowment shock should, by the permanent income hypothesis, be associated with higher
debt and a decline in the current absorption of tradables. With more debt, it seems intuitive
that the Lagrange multiplier on the collateral constraint next period, µR
                                                                        t+1 , should be higher
or should be positive in more states in period t + 1. Thus, if Ψt+1 were unchanged, then
expression (28) suggests that a negative endowment shock in the current period is associated
with an increase in τt , that is to say optimal capital control policy is procyclical. Yet, Ψt+1
also responds to the negative endowment shock. In particular, if consumption of tradables,
cTt+1 , is expected to contract by more than consumption of nontradables, yt+1
                                                                           N
                                                                               , then, provided
ξ < 1, Ψt+1 will fall, offsetting the increase in µR
                                                   t+1 . For example, suppose that the endow-
ment of nontradables is constant, a case considered in the numerical analysis of section 5
below. In this case a negative endowment shock in the current state would lead to a decline
in cTt+1 and hence to a decline in Ψt+1 . On the other hand, if both ytT and ytN were stochastic,
persistent, and positively correlated, then a decline in the endowments in the current state
should be associated with a decline in both cTt+1 and yt+1
                                                       N
                                                           dampening the decline in Ψt+1.
Thus, in that economy, the optimal capital control tax should be more procyclical than in
an otherwise identical economy with a constant endowment of nontradables. Overall, the
above discussion of the Ramsey condition (28) suggests that the optimal capital control tax


                                               11
is more likely to be procyclical than countercyclical. To provide a more precise assessment,
we will solve for the equilibrium dynamics of the present economy. As they cannot be de-
rived analytically for empirically realistic stochastic driving processes we will we resort to a
quantitative analysis.


4        Is Optimal Capital Control Policy Countercyclical?
The baseline calibration of the model follows exactly the one in Bianchi (2011), which as-
sumes that the economy is driven by endowment shocks. In section 5, we consider an
alternative shock structure in which business cycles are driven by tradable-endowment and
interest-rate shocks.
    The time unit is one year. The natural logarithms of the traded and nontraded endow-
ments are assumed to follow a bivariate AR(1) process. This process is estimated on annual,
HP-filtered Argentine data spanning the period 1965 to 2007. The process takes the form
    "            #       "                   #"             #                          "                     #!

        ln ytN               0.495   0.225            N
                                                  ln yt−1                                  0.00162 0.00167
                                                                                                              (29)
where t is assumed to be i.i.d. This process implies unconditional standard deviations of 6
percent and serial correlations of about 0.5 for both endowments, and a contemporaneous
correlation of 0.8.
    Following Bianchi (2011), we discretize the above driving process using 4 distinct values
for ln ytT and 16 distinct pairs (ln y T , ln y N ). The endogenous state, dt /(1 + r), is discretized
using 800 evenly spaced points ranging from 0.4 to 1.02. The interest rate is assumed to be
constant and equal to 4 percent per year. The subjective discount factor, β, is set at 0.91.
Thus, β(1+ r) = 0.9464, which implies that agents are quite impatient relative to the market
interest rate. This gives them a strong incentive to front load consumption by borrowing
against future endowments. The remaining parameters are σ = 2, ξ = 0.83, a = 0.31, and
κ = 0.32(1 + r). The value of κ is not exactly the same as in Bianchi (2011), namely 0.32,
because we specify the collateral constraint as dt+1 ≤ κ(ytT + pt ytN ), whereas Bianchi uses the
specification dt+1 /(1+ r) ≤ κ(ytT + pt ytN ). Setting κ to 0.32(1+r) in the present model makes
both calibrations equivalent. Table 1 summarizes the calibration and the discretization of the
state space. We solve the unregulated equilibrium by an Euler-equation iteration procedure
and the Ramsey equilibrium by value function iteration.
    As shown in section 3, the Ramsey optimal capital control tax rate, τt , is indeterminate
when the collateral constraint is binding. In this case, we set τt to “Not a Number” (NaN).

That is, we assign a numerical value to the optimal capital control tax only in states in which
it is uniquely determined.


4.1    Optimal Capital Controls During Boom-Bust Cycles
We start by examining the behavior of optimal capital controls and macroeconomic indicators
of interest around boom-bust episodes. That is, episodes in which a large expansion in
aggregate activity is followed by a large contraction. The question we wish to address is
whether the Ramsey planner curbs the expansion in aggregate demand by raising capital
controls during the boom phase and fosters absorption by lowering capital controls during
the contractionary phase.
   We define a boom-bust episode as a situation in which tradable output starts above trend
and is below trend three years later. The assumed discretized endowment process implies
that the economy is on average 5 percent above trend at the peak of the boom and 5 percent
below trend at the trough of the bust. This is a large contraction. The standard deviation of
the log of traded output is 5.6 percent. Thus, from peak to trough tradable output contracts
by 1.7 standard deviations.
   To characterize the typical boom-bust cycle, we simulate the endowment process for
one million years and extract all windows containing a boom-bust cycle. This yields 12
non-overlapping boom-bust episodes every century. We refer to the average dynamics of


                                                13
an economy over all boom-bust episodes as the typical boom-bust cycle. We use the same
sequence of one-million realizations of the endowments and the same initial level of debt to
simulate one million years of data from the unregulated economy (i.e., the economy with
τt = 0 for all t) and from the economy with Ramsey optimal capital control taxes.
   Figure 1 displays with solid lines the dynamics of the unregulated economy during the
typical boom-bust cycle. The exogenous boom-bust cycle in tradable output produces en-
dogenous boom-bust cycles in total output (yt ≡ ytT + pt ytN )), consumption, the relative price
of nontradables, and the value of collateral. External debt, by contrast, is remarkably flat.
The lack of response of external debt to large swings in the endowments is driven primarily
by the fact that agents are highly impatient. So much so that the consumption smoothing
motive is dominated by the desire to front load consumption. Although the contraction
of the economy from peak to trough is quite large, the collateral constraint remains slack
throughout the typical boom-bust cycle. Only fifteen percent of the boom-bust episodes end
in a financial crisis.
   The figure displays with broken lines the behavior of the economy over the typical boom-
bust cycle under the Ramsey-optimal capital-control policy. The predicted booms and busts
in output and consumption of tradable goods are remarkably similar in the unregulated
and the Ramsey economies. This suggests that the pecuniary externality induces little
amplification when the collateral constraint is slack.
       The Ramsey planner moves capital controls significantly over the typical boom-bust cycle
(bottom-right panel of figure 1).4 For this variable we report the median value rather than
the mean value because we found that its distribution is skewed. The unconditional mean of
the tax rate is 4.2 percent and the unconditional median of the tax rate is only 2.5 percent.
The figure shows that the movements in capital controls do not follow a countercyclical
pattern. On the contrary, during the boom phase of the cycle capital controls are lowered
from 2.5 to 0.6 percent, and during the bust phase of the cycle they are increased to 6.3
percent. We interpret these predicted dynamics as suggesting that in the present model the
collateral constraint does not call for tightening capital controls during booms as a prudential
measure. Instead, the prescription of the Ramsey plan is to wait until the economy is in a
recession before starting to discourage external borrowing via increases in capital controls.
   4
     As mentioned above, because the tax rate is indeterminate when the collateral constraint is binding
under the Ramsey policy, in the numerical analysis the capital control tax is given a number only when the
collateral constraint is slack under the Ramsey policy.

  when the collateral constraint binds under the Ramsey policy, it is given a number only when
  the collateral constraint is slack under the Ramsey policy. Replication files: for line 1, table.m in

  4.2     Optimal Capital Controls Around Financial Crises
  We have shown that optimal capital controls do not behave in a countercyclical manner
  during a typical boom-bust cycle. Another perspective to gauge whether optimal capital
  control policy is countercyclical is to consider the behavior of optimal capital controls during
  financial crises. To this end, we characterize the behavior of the unregulated and Ramsey
  economies around episodes in which the collateral constraint binds in the unregulated econ-
  omy. As in the analysis of boom-bust cycles, we simulate the unregulated economy for one
  million years. We then extract all eleven-year windows centered around a period in which
  the collateral constraint binds. This yields 85,242 windows. Thus, the unregulated economy
  suffers on average one financial crisis every 12 years (table 2). We then use the same sequence
  of one-million realizations of the exogenous states and the same initial level of debt to simu-
  late one million years of data from the Ramsey economy. Over these one million periods, the
  Ramsey economy experiences 38,617 episodes of a binding constraint. This means that the
  Ramsey optimal capital control policy cuts the frequency of financial crises from once every
  12 years to once every 26 years (table 2). It follows that the pecuniary externality makes
  the economy more vulnerable to financial crises.
     Figure 2 displays with a solid line the mean across all 85,242 windows in which the
  unregulated economy suffers a crisis. We refer to these average dynamics as the typical
  financial crisis implied by the present model economy. In the figure, the time of the crisis is

     The run-up to the crisis does not feature an unusually large accumulation of debt. Be-
  tween periods -5 and -1, external debt does increase, but not significantly (less than half a

Note. Each line is the mean across all 11-year windows containing a binding collateral constraint
in the center in a one-million-year time series from the unregulated economy. For the capital-
control tax rate, the figure displays the median instead of the mean across windows because this
variable is skewed, with an unconditional mean of 4.2 percent and an unconditional median of
2.5 percent. Because, as shown in section 3, the capital control tax rate is indeterminate when
the collateral constraint binds under the Ramsey policy, this variable is given a number only
if the collateral constraint is slack under the Ramsey policy. Replication file typical crisis.m in

standard deviation). Thus, the typical financial crisis in the present model does not capture
well the narrative that financial crises are preceded by externally financed credit booms.
However, the typical crisis predicted by the model does bear some of the signs of a sudden
stop. Consumption of tradables contracts by more than output causing a large improvement
in the trade balance of more than 10 percent of tradable output. At the time of the crisis,
the economy deleverages, with external debt falling by about 15 percent. This sharp re-
duction in external liabilities requires a similarly large contraction in aggregate absorption,
which in turn causes a Fisherian deflation, with the relative price of nontradables falling by
20 percent. The Fisherian deflation aggravates the fall in collateral, which is already quite
depressed by the fall in both endowments.
    Although the financial crisis is quite severe, it is short lived. Just one period after the
crisis the economy is above steady state and the trade balance reverses sign from a large
surplus to a deficit. Interestingly, this quick recovery happens in a context in which both
endowments are still more than 5 percent below average. The reason for the swift recovery
is that the deleveraging that occurs in period 0 places the economy in a sound financial
position in period 1. In particular, with low levels of debt at the beginning of period 1,
households can afford a higher level of absorption of all goods traded and nontraded. In
turn, the fact that the endowment of nontradables is still quite depressed implies that its
price must increase to ensure market clearing. The relative price of nontradables overshoots
from 20 percent below mean in period 0 to 13 percent above mean in period 1. This large
real appreciation increases the value of collateral and loosens the collateral constraint. These
predicted dynamics are at odds with a growing empirical literature that finds that financial
crises are associated with slow recoveries (see, for example, Cerra and Saxena, 2008; Reinhart
and Reinhart, 2010; and Reinhart and Rogoff, 2014).
    How does the Ramsey planner handle situations that, in the absence of policy interven-
tion, end up in crises? Figure 2 displays with broken lines the implied dynamics under the
Ramsey-optimal capital control policy. The optimal capital control policy manages to fend
off the typical crisis. The right panel on the third row of the figure shows with a thin broken
line the value of collateral, κ(ytT + pt ytN ), under the Ramsey policy and with a thick broken
line the level of external debt assumed in period t, dt+1 , under the Ramsey policy. In both
the Ramsey and the unregulated economies collateral falls sharply in period 0 due to the
collapse in both endowments. However, the Ramsey economy is less exposed to external
debt than its unregulated counterpart, and therefore displays more slack in the collateral
constraint. As a result, the fall in collateral due to the fall in endowments does typically not
end up in a binding collateral constraint in the Ramsey economy. This, in turn, implies that
this economy does not suffer a Fisherian deflation with its negative feedback on the value of


                                              18
collateral. Indeed, the left panel of row 3 of the figure shows that under the Ramsey policy
the relative price of nontradables is little changed in period 0. The Ramsey planner manages
to arrive at period 0 with less debt by a capital control policy whose long-run and cyclical
properties are conducive to avoiding a binding constraint in recessions. Specifically, capital
controls are positive on average (the median value of τt is 2.5 percent), which implies that
on average, the Ramsey economy has 2.3 percent (or 0.7 percent of output) less debt than
the unregulated economy (see table 2). This appears to be a small difference, but it is finely
calculated by the Ramsey planner to avoid a binding constraint. The Ramsey-optimal policy
trades off the desire of impatient households to front-load consumption and accumulate debt
against avoiding a binding collateral constraint.
  The capital control policy displays significant movements around the financial crisis. The
Ramsey planner increases capital controls as the economy enters in recession to discourage
the build up of debt. As the economy falls into an increasingly deep recession prior to period
0, the capital-control tax rate increases from 2.3 percent in period -5 to 11 percent in period
0. In this regard, the optimal capital-control policy is not countercyclical in nature. As
in the case of boom-bust cycles, the planner waits until the economy has entered into the
recession before increasing capital controls.
   The conclusion that optimal capital-control policy is not countercyclical in open economies
with a pecuniary externality due to collateral constraints holds not only for large boom-bust
cycles or financial crises but also over regular business cycles. As shown in table 2, the uncon-
ditional correlation of the optimal capital-control tax with output is -0.8. Thus, the Ramsey
planner lowers capital controls during expansions and raises them during contractions.


5     Interest-Rate Shocks and the Cyclicality of Optimal
      Capital-Control Policy
Thus far, we have considered an economy driven purely by endowment shocks. We found that
in the context of that environment the cyclical component of optimal capital control policy
is not countercyclical, for the Ramsey planner increases capital controls when the economy is
in recession and lowers them when the economy is expanding. We now change the stochastic
environment by introducing interest-rate shocks. The rationale for introducing this type of
shock is twofold. First, movements in the world interest rate and in country spreads, the
two components of the country interest rate, have been shown to be an important driver
of business cycles in emerging countries (Uribe and Yue, 2006). Second, in principle, there
are reasons to imagine that interest-rate shocks may have a significant effect on the cyclical


                                                19
properties of optimal capital control policy. During periods of low interest rates, households
have an incentive to increase consumption and to borrow more. The expansion in aggregate
absorption pushes up the price of nontradables, raising the value of collateral, and thereby
making room for the expansion in external borrowing. At the end of this phase of low
interest rates, the economy is more leveraged and therefore more vulnerable to negative
shocks. In this environment, the Ramsey planner may have an incentive to put sand in the
wheels of capital flows during periods of low interest rates, to avoid a rough landing in the
contractionary phase of the cycle. The purpose of this section is to ascertain whether this
intuition actually plays out when we feed the model with a realistic process for the country
interest rate.
    The structure of the model economy is unchanged, except that now the sources of un-
certainty are the interest rate, rt , and the endowment of tradables, ytT . The endowment of
nontradables is assumed to be constant and normalized to unity, ytN = y N = 1 for all t.
We assume that ytT and rt follow a bivariate AR(1) process. Specifically, we annualize the
quarterly process estimated in Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2016b). There, we use Argentine
quarterly data over the period 1983:Q1 to 2001:Q4.5 The annual AR(1) representation is
"                #       "                   #"                #                          "                       #!

and r = 0.1325, where t is assumed to be i.i.d. The average interest rate of 13.25 percent per
year reflects the fact that Argentina faced high country premia over the estimation period.
The estimated AR(1) process implies high volatilities of both the interest rate and the natural
logarithm of tradable output, of 6.5 percentage points and 11.7 percent, respectively.6 Also,
the interest rate and tradable output display negative comovement, with a contemporaneous
correlation of -0.87. This means that both variables reinforce their cyclical macroeconomic
effects on aggregate demand. Periods of low interest rates tend to coincide with high levels
of tradable endowment, both giving incentives for households to expand spending. Similarly,
periods of high interest rates tend to be accompanied by low levels of tradable endowment,
both inducing a contraction in aggregate demand.
   We discretize the above process using 21 equally spaced points for the natural logarithm
of ytT and 11 equally spaced points for the natural logarithm of (1+rt )/(1+r) (see table 3 for

     The implied process for traded output is twice as volatile as the one implied by (29). The explanation
for this discrepancy is most likely the detrending method. Uribe and Schmitt-Grohé (2017, Chapter 1) show
that the standard deviation of the cyclical component of Argentine annual GDP over the period 1960 to
2011 falls from 10.7 percent under log-quadratic detrending to 6.3 percent under HP-100 filtering.

the respective ranges). The transition probability matrix is estimated using the simulation
approach developed in Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2009). The calibration of the remaining
parameters of the model is unchanged, except for the subjective discount factor, β. We set β
to preserve the relative impatience of the representative household in the endowment-shock
economy, that is, to maintain the difference between the subjective and market discount rates
assumed in the endowment-shock economy. Specifically, we calibrate β so that β(1 + r) is
the same in the present calibration and in the calibration of the endowment-shock economy.
This requires setting β equal to 0.8357. This calibration choice ensures similar debt levels in
both economies (see table 2). Table 3 summarizes the calibration of the present economy.
   Figure 3 displays the dynamics of the unregulated and Ramsey-optimal economies over
a typical boom-bust episode. Here we define a typical boom-bust episode as one in which
tradable output starts below mean, is at least one standard deviation above mean three years
later, and then falls to at least one standard deviation below mean in the subsequent three
years. We are able to give a more precise definition of a boom-bust cycle than was possible
in the endowment-shock economy because the discretization of the endowment is finer (21
versus 4 points). Because ytT and rt are highly negatively correlated, we could have similarly
defined a boom-bust cycle in terms of the interest rate. This is evident from the top panel
of figure 3.
   The main message conveyed by the figure is that, as in the endowment-shock economy,
optimal capital-control policy is not countercyclical. On the contrary, the Ramsey planner

decreases capital controls during booms and increases them during contractions. In addition,
as in the endowment-shock economy, the presence of the pecuniary externality has little effect
on the boom-bust dynamics. The dynamics of the unregulated economy (i.e., the one with
τt = 0 for all t) shown with a solid line are basically the same as the dynamics of economy
with Ramsey optimal capital control policy, shown with a broken line. In this sense, the
graph suggests that the pecuniary externality does not amplify boom-bust cycles in the
economy with interest rate shocks either.
   The Ramsey planner also takes a procyclical policy stands during financial crises. Figure 4
depicts the dynamics of a typical financial crisis in the interest-rate shock economy. As
before, we define a financial crisis as a situation in which the collateral constraint binds.
The typical financial crisis occurs after a combination of large adverse shocks to the country
interest rate and tradable output. The country interest rate increases by almost 8 percentage
points between periods -2 and 0, and tradable output falls by about 12 percent in the same
short period. A financial crisis occurs slightly less frequently than in the endowment-shock
economy (once every 14 years versus once every 12 years; see table 2). As in the endowment-
shock economy, a financial crisis is associated with a large contraction in traded absorption,
a significant improvement in the trade balance, debt deleveraging, and a Fisherian deflation
in the value of collateral as embodied in the sharp depreciation of the real exchange rate
(i.e., the sharp fall in pt ).
   An improvement of the present model over the endowment-shock economy is that now,
in line with the data, financial crises are associated with a slow recovery. Five years after
the crisis, output and consumption remain below trend and the real exchange rate remains
depreciated. However, the reason for the slow recovery is not the presence of the collateral
constraint, but the persistence of interest-rate shocks, which are fully exogenous. As in the
endowment-shock economy, the deleveraging that occurs in period 0 puts the economy in
a better financial standing in period 1, which is conducive to a quick recovery of aggregate
demand. However, in the present environment interest rates remain high for a protracted
period of time, which discourages spending and borrowing.
   Figure 4 also displays the equilibrium dynamics under Ramsey-optimal capital-control
policy, that is, when the pecuniary externality is fully internalized. Most of the time, the
Ramsey planner manages to avoid financial crises. The frequency of financial crises falls from
once every 14 years in the unregulated economy to once every 37 years under the Ramsey-
optimal capital-control policy (table 2). As in the endowment-shock economy, the Ramsey
planner achieves this reduction in the frequency of crises in two ways. First, the capital
control tax rate is positive on average, with an unconditional median of 1.9 percent (table 2).
As a consequence, agents borrow less than in the unregulated economy. The unconditional

debt to output ratio is 28.3 percent compared to 29.3 percent in the unregulated economy
(see again table 2). The lower average level of debt also has a positive effect on collateral.
The reason is that less indebted households, by devoting a smaller fraction of their income
to debt service, can enjoy a higher level of consumption, which in equilibrium boosts the
price of nontradables, raising the collateral value of nontraded output.7
    The second way in which the planner avoids financial crises is through the cyclical com-
ponent of capital controls. Figure 4 shows that as the economy enters in a recession, the
planner increases capital controls to discourage households from financing the fall in income
by borrowing from the rest of the world. It follows that, as in the endowment-shock econ-
omy, capital control policy is not countercyclical in nature. The Ramsey planner waits until
the economy is in recession to increase capital controls, as opposed to raising capital con-
trols preemptively during booms to allow the economy to enter recessions with a lower debt
burden.
       The lack of countercyclicality of the optimal capital-control policy also holds uncondition-
ally. The unconditional correlation of τt with ytT + pt y N is -0.1 (table 2), which means that
expansions in output are accompanied by reductions in capital-control taxes and vice versa.
In the endowment-shock economy this correlation is more negative at -0.8. The reason the
negative correlation is smaller (in absolute value) in the present economy is the absence of
shocks to the nontraded endowment. To see this, it is of use to look again at equation (28).
In the economy with nontradable endowment shocks, cTt+1 and yt+1
                                                             N
                                                                 comove positively over
the cycle. As a result, Ψt+1 is relatively acyclical. This means that the cyclicality of τt
is governed by the cyclicality of µR
                                   t+1 . By contrast, in the absence of shocks to the non-
traded endowment, Ψt+1 inherits the cyclicality of cTt+1 . Since cTt+1 and µR
                                                                            t+1 are negatively
correlated, changes in Ψt+1 and µR
                                 t+1 tend to offset each other causing τt to be less cyclical.
It is therefore reasonable to conjecture that allowing for nontradable endowment shocks in
the present economy would result in a larger negative correlation between optimal capital
controls and output.
   In the preceding analysis the cyclicality of optimal capital controls is taken to be their
conditional and unconditional correlations with output. A different dimension along which
the cyclical nature of capital control policy is often discussed, especially in policy circles,
has to do with the behavior of capital controls over the leverage cycle. For example, it
is argued that an increase in the debt-to-output ratio triggered by a fall in the country
interest rate should be met with a macroprudential increase in capital controls. It turns out
   7
    It can be shown numerically that the average optimal capital-control tax rate and the frequency of crises
are sensitive to the value assumed for the relative patience factor, β(1 + r). The closer the relative patience
factor is to unity, the lower the average optimal capital-control tax rate and the frequency of crises will be.



                                                      25
that in the present model the unconditional correlation between the debt-to-output ratio,
dt+1 /(ytT + pt ytN ), and the optimal capital control tax, τt , is indeed positive at 0.7. However,
this positive correlation does not conform with the intuition given above, for in the present
model the debt-to-output ratio tends to be high not in periods in which the interest rate is
low, but in periods in which it is high. Specifically, the correlation between dt+1 /(ytT + pt ytN )
and rt is positive at 0.4. This is a further manifestation of the model’s prediction that
optimal capital controls are high when the economy is in recession, or equivalently, that
optimal capital control policy is procyclical.


6     Conclusion
This paper shows that the conventional view according to which policymakers should increase
capital controls during economic booms and loosen them during contractions is not supported
as a Ramsey optimal outcome in open economy models with pecuniary externalities due to
flow collateral constraints. It shows that in this class of models, the Ramsey planner waits
until recessions have set in before increasing capital controls, as opposed to raising capital
controls preemptively during booms to ensure that the economy enters the contractionary
phase of the business cycle with sound financial fundamentals.
    To understand the logic behind the optimality of a procyclical capital control policy in
the context of the present economy, it is important to understand that a key ingredient of
most models in this class is the assumption of high impatience on the part of households.
For example, in the present calibration, which is a typical one, the relative impatience factor,
β(1 + r), is 0.95. That is, agents’ subjective discount rate is 5 percentage points higher than
the market discount rate. This means that households have a strong incentive to front load
consumption via the accumulation of external debt. The desire to front load is so strong
that, for the purpose of understanding the inner workings of the model, one can safely
ignore the consumption smoothing motive—the backbone of the intertemporal approach to
the balance of payments. The second key ingredient is the collateral constraint. Hitting
the collateral constraint is highly costly because it forces agents to deleverage, which, in
turn, entails cutting present consumption in favor of future consumption, precisely what
agents do not like to do. The third key ingredient of the model is the pecuniary externality
created by the fact that the value of collateral depends on a price which is endogenous to
the economy, but exogenous to individual households. This pecuniary externality causes the
laissez-faire economy to be caught with a binding collateral constraint more often than it
would were agents to internalize the pecuniary externality. The Ramsey planner, therefore,
constantly negotiates a tradeoff between allowing agents to front load consumption and

                                                 26
preventing them from hitting the collateral constraint too often. The economy is at the
highest risk of hitting the constraint in bad times. This is because during recessions all of
the components of collateral, namely, tradable output, nontradable output, and the relative
price of nontradables, are depressed. As a result, it is during these circumstances that the
Ramsey planner has the highest incentive to discourage borrowing. And the instrument he
has to do so are capital control taxes.
   The intuition given above may convey the impression that the optimality of procyclical
capital control policy depends on the assumption of impatient households. But this is not
the case. Making households less impatient will make the optimal capital control policy
more acyclical but will not result in a countercyclical policy. The increased acyclicality is a
direct consequence of the fact that, all other things equal, the more patient households are,
the less frequent financial crises will be. Thus, making households more patient not only
fails to overturn the predicted procyclicality of optimal capital control policy but comes at
the cost of resulting in an economy that underpredicts the frequency of financial crises.
   What theoretical features could be added to the present model in order to reconcile its
predictions regarding the cyclicality of optimal capital controls with the conventional wis-
dom? One possibility is to incorporate nominal rigidities. In Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe
(2016b), for example, we show that open economy models with downward nominal wage
rigidity and non-optimal exchange-rate policy, such as a currency peg, can deliver the result
that Ramsey-optimal capital control policy is countercyclical. In that environment, a nega-
tive demand shock, such as an increase in the country interest-rate, causes a contraction in
the demand for goods. In turn the contraction in the aggregate demand for goods translates
into a weaker demand for labor. Market clearing in the labor market requires a fall in the real
wage. However, if nominal wages are downwardly inflexible and the nominal exchange rate is
fixed, the real wage is unable to fall, giving rise to involuntary unemployment. Under these
circumstances, the Ramsey planner has an incentive to lower capital controls as a way to fos-
ter debt-financed domestic absorption. During booms, market clearing in the labor market
calls for an increase in the real wage. With the nominal exchange rate fixed, this requires
an increase in nominal wages. But such an increase sows the seeds of larger unemployment
in the contractionary phase of the cycle, given the combination of downward nominal wage
rigidity and a fixed exchange rate. Individual agents understand this mechanism but are
too small to internalize the fact that their own increase in demand during the boom phase
exacerbates the cycle. Thus, the Ramsey planner finds it optimal to increase capital con-
trols during the boom phase as a way to restrain demand by making agents internalize the
externality. It would be of interest to characterize the cyclical properties of optimal capital
control policy in the context of an economy that incorporates both a collateral constraint and


                                              27
downward nominal rigidity to ascertain whether the resulting policy prescription conforms
with the conventional wisdom.
   Finally, the central theme of the present paper is normative. An alternative perspective
is to consider the positive aspects of the problem. Fernández, Rebucci, and Uribe (2015)
examine the behavior of capital controls in a panel of 95 countries over the period 1995-2011
and find that capital controls are remarkably stable over the business cycle. At the same
time, Zhou (2017) documents that capital controls are tightened during financial crisis. The
model economy studied in this paper is consistent with both of these empirical regularities in
one of the specifications considered, namely, when the economy is assumed to be buffeted by
tradable endowment and interest rate shocks and nontradable endowment shocks are turned
off. It follows that the model economy studied has predictions for optimal capital control
policy that are closer to the data than to conventional wisdom.

Appendix
In this appendix we present the first-order conditions of the Ramsey problem and derive
equation (28), which links the optimal capital control tax in states in which the collateral
constraint is slack to the Ramsey planner’s Lagrange multiplier on the collateral constraint.
In what follows we abstract from the possibility of multiple equilibria that may arise from
the fact that the constraints of the Ramsey planner’s problem may not describe a convex set.
Specifically, we assume that the parameter values of the model are such that the constraint
set is convex.8 The Lagrangian of the Ramsey problem is

marginal utility of income of the private household, λt , (evaluated at the Ramsey allocation)
in states in which the collateral constraint under the Ramsey policy is slack (µR
                                                                                t = 0) and
exceeds λt in states in which the collateral constraint is binding under the Ramsey policy,
µR
 t > 0. That is, we have shown that


                                            0 < λt ≤ λR
                                                      t .


     Suppose that in period t the collateral constraint is slack under the Ramsey plan, that
                                  T  1ξ
                   T       1−a    c
is, suppose κyt + κ a ytN                 ytN − dt+1 > 0. Then, by (33), µR                        R
                                                                            t = 0, and by (31), λt =
                                   t
U 0 (A(cTt , ytN ))A1(cTt , ytN ) = λt . Using (21) to replace pt in (18), we have that (18) also holds
with a strict inequality. Therefore (22) is only satisfied if µt = 0. That is, µR
                                                                                t = µt = 0 in
this case. We can then express (32) as

                                        λt = β(1 + rt )Et λR
                                                           t+1


and (20) as
                                   (1 − τt )λt = β(1 + rt )Et λt+1 .

Dividing the first expression by the second yields

                                         1      Et λR
                                                    t+1
                                              =         ≥ 1.
                                       1 − τt   Et λt+1

The inequality follows from the fact that in any state and date, 0 < λt ≤ λR      t . Finally,
                                                                    T 1/ξ−1
