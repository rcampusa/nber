                                              ABSTRACT

In this paper we propose an Open Economy Financial Accelerator model along the lines of Greenwald-Stiglitz
(1993) close in spirit but different in many respects from the one proposed by Greenwald (1998.) The
first goal of the paper is to provide a taxonomy of the effects of a devaluation in this context. The direct
(first round) effect on output, taking as given net worth and interest rate, is negative for domestic firms
(due to the input cost effect) and positive for exporting firms (due to a positive foreign debt effect).
The indirect (second round) wealth effect (on output through net worth, taking as given the interest
rate) is uncertain, depending on the relative size of the domestic and exporting firms. There is also
an indirect effect on output through the response of the domestic interest rate to a devaluation due
to the risk premium effect. Due to the uncertainty on the sign of most of these effects, it is difficult
to assess the overall impact of a devaluation. One cannot rule out, however, an economy-wide contractionary
effect of a devaluation. If the devaluation affects negatively the net worth of domestic firms, the domestic
interest rate may rise (due to the risk premium effect), exerting an additional contractionary impact
on output. If, on top of that, the monetary authorities force a further increase of the interest rate in
an effort to curb the exchange rate, the contractionary effect will be emphasized.

1       Introduction
The role of …nancial factors in the transmission of monetary shocks has been
thoroughly explored in the Financial Accelerator literature.1 There are at
least three strands of this literature. The …rst one focuses on agency costs and
the willingness to extend loans (Bernanke and Gertler, 1989, 1990; Bernanke,
Gertler and Gilchrist, 2000; Carlstrom and Fuerst,1997); the second one
emphasizes the role of bankruptcy costs and induced risk aversion on the part
of a …rm’s managers (Greenwald and Stiglitz, 1993); the third one stresses
the role of asset prices and collateralizable net worth (Kiyotaki and Moore,
1997).
    The theoretical underpinnings are di¤erent but all of these models predict
that a change in corporate net worth is a crucial determinant of investment
and production and that monetary shocks are at least in part transmitted
through the impact of changes in the interest rate on net worth. If one ex-
tends the framework to the open economy, this is only part of the …nancial
accelerator story. In this new context, in fact, also changes in the exchange
rate a¤ect net worth so that the balance sheet channel bifurcates into an inter-
est rate/net worth channel and an exchange rate/net worth channel. Open
Economy extensions of the Financial Accelerator (OEFA) framework have
been proposed by Gertler, Gilchrist and Natalucci (2003) (along the lines of
Bernanke-Gertler-Gilchrist and Carlstrom-Fuerst), Edison, Luangaram and
Miller (1998) (along the lines of Kiyotaki and Moore). As to the Greenwald-
Stiglitz approach, to the best of our knowledge there have not been open
economy extensions with the notable exception of Greenwald (1998).
    The stream of "twin crises" – i.e. the intertwined process of …nancial
disruption, capital ‡ight and exchange rate turbulence –which has a- icted
emerging countries in the late ’90s has brought about a new wave (the third
generation) of models of currency crises (Aghion, Bacchetta and Banerjee,
2000; Caballero and Krishnamurthy, 2000; Cespedes Chang and Velasco,
2000; Christiano, Gust and Roldos, 2002; Devereux and Lane, 2003) in which
    1
    In the following we will use the expressions Broad Credit view or Balance Sheet channel
as synonims of Financial Accelerator.



                                            1
…nancial factors play a leading role in the propagation of the crisis. In a sense,
therefore, also these models can be traced back to the OEFA framework.
    Most of the models listed above end up with the normative conclusion that
‡oating is preferable to a …xed exchange rate regime. For instance Gertler,
Gilchrist and Natalucci (2003) show that welfare losses following a …nancial
crisis are signi…cantly larger under …xed than under ‡oating exchange rates.
    In this paper we propose an OEFA model along the lines of Greenwald-
Stiglitz, close in spirit but di¤erent in many respects from the one proposed
by Greenwald. The …rst goal of the paper is to provide a taxonomy of the
e¤ects of a devaluation in an OEFA context. There a is a wide range of
di¤erent and correlated e¤ects so that the ultimate impact on output and
the macroeconomy is in uncertain and can well be negative.
    Changes in the interest rate and in the exchange rate are intertwined. If a
country runs a …xed exchange rate regime and a sudden collapse of con…dence
occurs, the central bank may be induced to manipulate the interest rate in
an attempt to halt short term capital out‡ows. This is quite common: Italy
in 1992, Thailand in 1997, Russia in 1998, Argentina in 2001 are just a few
episodes. The net worth of the …rms is going to su¤er because of the interest
rate hike. Most of the times, however, this sharp increase of interest rates is
ine¤ective and a devaluation occurs. The transition to ‡oating rates frees the
hand of the monetary authorities, who can lower interest rates. This move is
bene…cial for …rms’net worth while the impact of devaluation on net worth is
uncertain. When the pace of devaluation becomes "unsustainable", at least in
the eyes of the monetary authorities, they become anxious to halt devaluation
by increasing interest rates again. Once again the …rms’net worth is going to
su¤er. When devaluation is harmful, moreover, a restrictive monetary policy
is going to be counterproductive because net worth will su¤er twice.
    In this paper we study the consequences of a devaluation in a …nancially
fragile environment. In section 2 we discuss the background assumptions.
Section 3 is devoted to a discussion of the …rst round or impact e¤ect of a
devaluation on the basis of the output-net worth relationship, whose micro-
foundation is described and discussed at length in the appendix. In section
5 we derive the laws of motion that describe the evolution over time of the

                                        2
net worth. These laws allow to assess the second round or indirect e¤ect
of a devaluation through changes in net worth. Section 6 is devoted to the
determination of interest rates. Section 7 concludes.


2    The Environment
The model economy we consider is characterized by the following assump-
tions. In each period, there is a "large" number – say It – of …rms which
belong to one of two sectors. Firms indexed by i = 1; 2:::Itx sell their goods
only on foreign markets (eXporting sector or X-sector). Firms indexed by
j = Itx + 1; Itx + 2; :::It produce only for the home market (domestic sector or
H-sector). Therefore Ith = It Itx is the number of …rms producing only for
the home market.
    For simplicity we assume that technology is uniform across …rms. Firms
produce by means of a Leontief technology whose inputs are labour and an
imported intermediate good ("oil").
                                                                           1
    The production function of the generic …rm therefore is Yk = min(Nk ; Ok )
; k = i; j where Yk ; Nk ; Ok represent output, employment and oil. The pa-
rameter > 0 measures oil requirement per unit of output. Assuming that
                                                    1
labour is always abundant, we can write Yk = Ok so that labour require-
                 1
ment is Nk = Ok :
    Firms are price takers in a perfect competition setting. Production takes
time, so that …rms produce in the current period but sell only in the next
one. Due to high transaction costs, there are no forward markets.Therefore
the selling price which will be determined on the spot market tomorrow
is uncertain today, i.e. at the moment decisions are made on production,
employment, oil imports and …nancing both for the domestic producer and
for the exporter. As to the former, we assume that the individual price
(in domestic currency) of goods produced in t and sold in t+1 is Pjt+1 =
Pt+1 ujt+1 where ujt+1 is a random variable –capturing an idiosyncratic shock
to revenues – with Et (ujt+1 ) = 1. It follows that Et (Pjt+1 ) = Pt+1 where
Pt+1 is the (average) market price of goods sold on domestic markets.


                                      3
    Analogously, the price (in foreign currency) at which the exporter sells his
                               x       $
goods on foreign markets is Pit+1  = Pt+1 uxit+1 where uxit+1 is a random variable
                                             $         $
with Et uxit+1 = 1 so that Et Pit+1
                                  x
                                       = Pt+1    and Pt+1  is the (average) market
price of goods sold on foreign markets.
    Both X and H …rms succeed in selling all the output they decided to
produce: Output is supply driven. In other words, the volume of demand
does not constrain production. 2
    Firms …nance their production costs (the wage and oil bills) by means of
net worth and credit. For the sake of simplicity, as a …rst approximation we
will adopt the following
    Assumption 1: The exporting sector seeks only foreign …nance whose
cost is the real foreign interest rate Rx ; the domestic sector asks only for
domestic loans whose cost is the real domestic interest rate R:
    If the …rm is solvent, the loan obtained in t is reimbursed in t+1. If the
…rm is not able to repay the debt, it goes bankrupt. The insolvent …rm leaves
the market. In the present context, therefore, bankruptcy is the single most
important determinant of …rms’exit from the market. On the other hand,
the presence of extra-pro…ts will induce …rms’entry. We will not examine the
e¤ects of industrial dynamics, however, in order to get rid of unnecessary
complications at this stage of the analysis.
    Firms hire labour on the domestic labour market and oil on the inter-
national oil market. The real cost of labour for H …rms is the real wage
   2
     We can provide the following rationale for this apparently restrictive assumption.
Let the demand of the the i-th commodity in period t+1 be d (Pit+1 =Pt+1 ; it+1 ) where
Pit+1 =Pt+1 is the relative price of the i-th commodity and it+1 is a stochastic demand
disturbance speci…c to the market in question. Let supply be sit i.e. output produced in t
and made available to the consumer in t+1. By assumption sit is made up of the quantities
produced by a "large number" of producers so that the contribution of each …rm to total
supply is negligible. In equilibrium Pit+1 =Pt+1 = f ( it+1 ; sit ) i.e. the relative price is an
increasing function of the demand disturbance, given the predetermined supply. If demand
is su¢ ciently elastic, changes in supply do not a¤ect the relative price signi…cantly so that
the relative price is essentially an increasing function of random demand. In our setting
the random variable uit+1 can be conceptualized along these lines. A high realization of
uit+1 can be thought of as a regime of high demand which drives up the relative price of
the commodity in question. In this regime each …rm operating in the i-th market produces
a high volume of output. By construction, however, it has no di¢ culty in selling it. In a
regime of low demand, the realization of uit+1 turns out to be low and may push the …rm
out of the market if it is "too low", i.e. if it makes the net worth of the …rm negative.


                                               4
wt := Wt =Pt : Assuming, for simplicity, that the price of oil in dollars is the
same as the price of goods sold abroad Pt$ ;the real price of oil for H …rms is
"t t (where t := Pt$ =Pt );i.e. the real exchange rate. The average cost for H
…rms, therefore, is ht := wt + "t t :A higher exchange rate translates into
higher costs of imported oil for H …rms. 3
      Since X …rms hire labour on the domestic market but sell goods and seek
external …nance on foreign markets, the nominal cost of labour for X …rms
is the nominal wage in foreign currency Wt ="t :The real cost of labour for X
…rms is the real wage evaluated at foreign prices Wt ="t Pt$ = wt ="t : On the
other hand, the nominal cost of oil in foreign currency is Pt$ so that the real
cost of oil for X …rms is unity. The average production cost for X …rms, say
                           h
  x                x       t      wt
  t ; therefore is t :=       =       + . In this case, a higher exchange rate
                         "t t    "t t
translates into lower costs for X …rms.4 The short-run e¤ect of a devaluation,
therefore is favourable for X-…rms due to lower costs in foreign currency.
      The demand for (domestic) …nance on the part of H-…rms is the …nancing
gap, i.e. the di¤erence between production costs and net worth, measured
in domestic currency. Since the H-sector seeks …nance and sells goods only
at home, the appropriate de‡ator of the …nancing gap of the H-sector is the
domestic price level. The …nancing gap of the H-sector at constant domestic
prices therefore is ht Yith Ahit where Yith and Ahit are output and net worth of
the domestic …rm and ht is increasing with the exchange rate.
      On the other hand, since the X-sector seeks …nance and sells goods only
abroad, the appropriate de‡ator of the …nancing gap of the X-sector is the
foreign price level. The …nancing gap of the X-sector at foreign prices there-
   3
     In Greenwald (1998), production is carried out by means of labour alone but the
nominal wage is indexed to the price of foreign goods so that in the end average cost for
domestic producers is increasing with the exchange rate. In our context, if the nominal
wage were indexed to a weighted average of the prices of domestic and foreign goods in
domestic currency, i.e. Wt = (1        ) Pt + "t Pt$ ; the real wage would turn out to be
wt = (1        ) + "t t :The real wage, therefore, would be a linear function of the real
exchange rate. In this case the average production cost would be          = wt + "t t =
(1     ) + ( + ) "t t . Also in Greenwald’s case, therefore, a devaluation would push cost
up by making room for a wage increase.
   4
     The average production cost at foreign prices in a Greenwald (1998) economy would
be xt = "1t + + : Also in this case, the average production cost for X-…rms is decreasing
             t
in the exchange rate.


                                            5
fore is xt Yitx Axit where Yitx and Axit are output and net worth of the foreign
…rm and xt is decreasing with the exchange rate. X-…rms, in fact, are not
completely insulated from the domestic economy since they hire labour on
the domestic labour market at the current wage in domestic currency. There-
fore a devaluation makes the need of foreign currency to anticipate wages less
acute.


3       Output and net worth
As in Greenwald and Stiglitz (1993), the problem of the …rm consists in max-
imizing expected pro…ts less bankruptcy costs. The solution of the problem
yields optimal output (size) as a function of net worth. The relationship of
output and net worth emerges quite naturally also modelling the …rm as a
risk averse agent as in Greenwald (1998). In a sense, the presence of ex-
pected bankruptcy costs in the objective function of the …rm in Greenwald
and Stiglitz (1993) plays the role of risk aversion in Greenwald (1998).
    Thanks to the assumptions of linear technology and uniform density of
the idiosyncratic shock, output is a linear function of net worth. The optimal
supply of the i-th …rm in the X-sector is (see appendix A.1 for the derivation):

                          1               1
                Yitx =           +                Axit       1            i = 1; 2; :::; Itx   (1)

where Yitx is output and Axit is net worth of the X-…rm at constant (foreign)
prices. The "size" of a …rm can be measured both in terms of output (the
scale of production) and in term of net worth.
    The impact of an increase of the exchange rate on output is:

                                                                                  "            (2)

the output of X-…rms, i.e. the e¤ect of a devaluation keeping the net worth
constant, is positive. In fact, an increase of the exchange rate implies a lower
wage in foreign currency and a lower …nancing gap (foreign debt e¤ect).
   The optimal supply of output/demand for labour of the j-th …rm in the
H-sector is (see appendix A.2 for the derivation):

                 Yjth =      h

                               "   := @    t =@"t    =        t   >0

the derivative (4), which measures the …rst round e¤ect of a devaluation
on output of H-…rms, is negative. In fact, an increase of the exchange rate
implies a higher cost of oil in domestic currency (input cost e¤ect). Since
H-…rms seeks …nance only on the domestic credit market, the foreign debt
e¤ect is absent by construction. All in all, a devaluation hurts the H-sector
as a whole and is bene…cial to X-…rms.5

put is a linear function of net worth, the average supply of the exporting
sector and of the home sector turn out to be

    For simplicity, at this stage of the analysis we abstract from import competition. By
construction, in this model domestic …rms do not compete with foreign producers on the
domestic goods market. If there were some degree of import competition, a devaluation
would ease the competitive pressure on domestic …rms who could increase their production
and sales on domestic markets.

The impact e¤ect of a devaluation on aggregate output is positive if, on
average, the net worth of X-…rms is "su¢ ciently high", i.e. bigger than a
threshold A^x . Given the interest rates R and Rx , the larger h, i.e. the number
of domestic producers relative to the number of exporting …rms and the larger
the average size of the H-…rm, the more likely it is that a devaluation will
a¤ect negatively aggregate output.

    In order to keep the analysis as simple as possible, we assume that the number of
…rms is constant. This assumption implies that bankrupt …rms are replaced one-to-one
with new entrants.

4     Wealth e¤ects
In the previous section, we have discussed the (…rst round) e¤ect of a de-
valuation on (current) output keeping net worth constant. A devaluation,
however, has a second round e¤ect on (future) output which can be concep-
tualized as a wealth e¤ect because it operates through the accumulation of
net worth.
   Assuming, for the sake of simplicity, that …rms do not distribute divi-
dends, the net worth or equity base of the i-th …rm in the X-sector in t+1
can be de…ned as follows

                  Axit+1 =   x
                             it+1   = uxit+1    Rx    x
                                                      t   Yitx + Rx Axit      (10)

Given Rx ; there are three factors a¤ecting Axit+1 : (1) revenues uxit+1 Yitx ; (2)
costs xt Yitx ; i.e. the product of average costs xt times the scale of production
Yitx ;(3) internal funds (i.e. the equity base inherited from the past Axit ).Both
(2) and (3) are "augmented" by the interest rate.
      The wealth e¤ect of a devaluation operates through (1) and (2). The
impact of a devaluation on future net worth of X-…rms in fact is:

                  @Axit+1         @Y x                                x
                                                                 x @Yit
                          = uxit+1 it      Rx        x x

                 @Yitx
The term uxit+1        is the marginal revenue of a devaluation, i.e. the change
                 @"t
in revenues due to an increase of the exchange rate. It measures the impact
e¤ect of a devaluation on revenues. In the case of X-…rms it is positive. The

                               @Yitx
we know that x" < 0 and              > 0:While the marginal revenue is always
                                @"t
positive, in principle the marginal cost is uncertain because a devaluation
implies lower average costs but higher production. We will label the impact
of a devaluation on unit costs the average cost e¤ect of a devaluation. In
the case of X-…rms the average cost e¤ect is negative. The impact of a
devaluation of the scale of activity will be referred to as the scale e¤ect. In

  ( t)
          Rx     2            t
boils down to Rx x" > 0: Hence, the scale e¤ect prevails over the average
cost e¤ect and the marginal cost turns out to be positive. Therefore both
the marginal revenue and the marginal cost of a devalutation are positive for
X-…rms. The wealth e¤ect for X-…rms is positive if the marginal revenue is
greater than the marginal cost.
    Recalling (2) and (1), from the expression above one gets

   @Axit+1                        @Yitx                                uxit+1

Since x" < 0; a devaluation has a positive wealth e¤ect on the generic X-…rm,
     @Axit+1
i.e.         > 0; if the expression in brackets is positive. This occurs if uxit+1
      @"t
is "not too small", i.e.if it is greater than a threshold u^xit

                                            Rx xt     2 (Rx xt )2

                                           Yitx + 1   2 + Rx Axit

When inequality (11) is satis…ed a devaluation a¤ects positively net worth
and output in the future, i.e. the second round e¤ect is positive.
   A similar argument can be applied to H-…rms. Since the equity base of
the j-th …rm in the H-sector in t+1 is

                  Ahjt+1 =       h
                                 jt+1   = uhjt+1     R     h

the impact of a devaluation on future net worth of H-…rms is:

According to (15), a devaluation has a positive wealth e¤ect on the average
X-…rm if the expected relative price (which is equal to one by construction) is
greater than a threshold u^xt which ensures that the average marginal revenue
@Ytx
      is greater than the average marginal cost. The threshold is decreasing
 @"t
with the exchange rate and the equity base. The smaller the exchange rate
and the "size" of the average X-…rm the less likely it is that the wealth e¤ect
is positive for X-…rms.
    A similar argument can be applied to H-…rms. The average equity base
of the H-sector in t+1 is

                     Aht+1 =     h
                                 t+1   = 1        R   h
                                                      t    Yth + RAht              (16)

The impact of a devaluation on future average net worth of H-…rms is:

                     @Aht+1                   h    @Yth           h h
                            = 1         R     t              R    " Yt
                      @"t                          @"t

After rearranging, from the expression above one gets

                        @Aht+1           h        Yth + 1
                               =         "            h

According to (17), a devaluation has a positive wealth e¤ect on the average
H-…rm if the expected relative price (equal to one by construction) is smaller


                                             12

               @Yth
ginal revenue        is smaller than the absolute value of the average marginal
                @"t
cost. The threshold is increasing with the exchange rate and decreasing with
the equity base. The higher the exchange rate and the smaller the "size" of
the average H-…rm the more likely it is that the wealth e¤ect is positive for
H-…rms.
    At a point in time an economy can be identi…ed by the triple "t ; Aht ; Axt :Inequalities

rate space in terms of the sign of the wealth e¤ect on X and H …rms respec-

    We can partion the positive orthant, therefore, in four regions. The north-

wealth e¤ect is positive for X-…rms and negative for H-…rms. This is reminded
by enclosing the sign of the wealth e¤ect (for exporting and domestic …rms
respectively) in brackets associated to the letter indentifying the region. The
same criterion has been employed to characterize the eastern region (E), the
southern region (S) and the western region (W).
    Let’s assume that, in period zero, Ah0 > Ax0 ; i.e. on average H-…rms are
bigger than X-…rms. If the current exchange rate is relatively low (e.g. "0 ) a
devaluation has a negative wealth e¤ects for H-…rms (see point H in the N
region), and a negative wealth e¤ects for X-…rms too (see point X in the S

region). If the exchange rate were very low, i.e. close to the origin, points H
and X would end up in region W where the wealth e¤ect is negative for both
types of …rms. Only at very high levels of the exchange rate the wealth e¤ect
would be positive for both types of …rms (region W). In other words, in this
case the wealth e¤ect of a devaluation is negative for both …rms "most of the
times".
    Of course the opposite would be true is Ax0 > Ah0 . The second round e¤ect
of a devaluation, therefore, depends not only on the relative importance of
the X and H sectors but also on the relative average size of X and H …rms.


5    Laws of motion
In a macrodynamic framework, the e¤ects of a devaluation are not limited to
the impact and the second round e¤ects. The repercussions of a devaluation
will be felt on net worth –and therefore on production –in all the subsequent
periods. Assuming that the equilibrium is stable, with the passing of time
the e¤ect will be smaller and smaller and tend asymptotically to zero. In
order to assess the "long run" wealth e¤ect of a devaluation, we must study
the law of motion of net worth.
    As to X-…rms, substituting (1) into (10) and rearranging we get

   It is clear from (20) that a devaluation will impact positively on Axs –i.e.
@Axs =@"t > 0 –by reducing unit costs xt :
   Average output of the exporting sector in the steady state will be:

The long run e¤ects of a devaluation on output of the X-…rms consists of
two parts. The …rs term in the sum is the impact e¤ect, which is positive as
shown in section (3). The second term is the sum of the second round e¤ect
and all the subsequent e¤ects (which we will refer to as the long run wealth
   7
    Due to the linearity of (18), averaging across …rms yields a linear law of motion of the
average net worth. If the individual law of motion were non linear, also higher moments
of the distribution would show up in the law of motion of the average state variable. For
instance, if the individual law of motion were concave (convex), the variance of the state
variable would a¤ect negatively (positively) the law of motion of the mean of the state
variable.

e¤ect) which is positive too.
    Figure 2 illustrates the point. In the upper panel, the thin line represents
the phase diagram of equation (19) for a given level of the exchange rate,
say "0 . A devaluation –i.e. an increase of the exchange rate to "1 –makes
the phase diagram shift and rotate upward (bold line) because both the
intercept and the slope of the phase diagram are decreasing with the average
cost, which in turn is decreasing with the exchange rate. The steady state
equity base goes up from Ax0 to Ax1 .
    In the lower panel the thin line represent equation (5) when the exchange

rate is "0 : A devaluation makes the line shift and rotate upward (bold line)
because both the intercept and the slope are decreasing with the average cost,
which in turn is decreasing with the exchange rate. The impact e¤ect of the
devaluation on output is measured by the vertical distance between points S0
and B: The second round e¤ect is measured by the vertical distance between
the coordinates of points B and C on the y-axis. In fact, the devaluation
makes net worth go up from Ax0 to AxC . After the second round a sequence
of adjustments of net worth and production occurs along the dynamic path
of the economy towards the new long run equilibrium.

equilibrium. The steady state of the average net worth of the H-sector is:

It is clear from (23) that a devaluation will impact negatively on Ahs – i.e.
@Ahs =@"t < 0 –by increasing unit costs ht :
    Average output of the home sector in the steady state will be:

                                              1     Ahs
                               Ysh =              +             1
                                             R ht   2 ht

Hence
                 @Ysh               h
                                    "        1  Ah              1 @Ahs

The long run e¤ects of a devaluation on output of the H-…rms is negative.
Of course the adjustment of net worth and output of the average H-…rm
following a devaluation could be represented graphically adopting the same
procedure followed in …gure 2. In the case of the H-…rm both the phase
diagram and the relationshipe between output and net worth would shift
and rotate downward.
    Therefore, the economy-wide average output in the steady state is

6       Interest rates and bankruptcy risk
So far, we have dealt with interest rates as if they were exogenous. In this
section we relax this assumption. Following Greenwald (1998) we assume
that both in the country considered and in the rest of the world, the interest
rate can be modelled as the sum of a risk-free interest rate – for simplicity
uniform across countries –and a risk premium. The foreign interest rate is
Rx = Rf + x where Rf is the risk free interest rate, is a generic risk (to be
speci…ed in the following) and x is the "international beta". Symmetrically,
the domestic interest rate is R = Rf + h where h is the "domestic beta".
Assuming perfect capital mobility, the relationship between the domestic and
foreign interest rates turns out to be

                                     R = Rx +                                         (25)

with = h          x
                     with h > x :
   Given the focus of the present paper, we assume that the domestic interest
rate should compensate for the risk of bankruptcy. Hence is related to (for
simplicity, in the following it will coincide with) the probability of bankruptcy
of H-…rms evaluated in the aggregate, i.e. at the level of the macroeconomy,
say F .8
   In the appendix A.2, we de…ne the following pro…t function for the generic
H …rm:
                         h          h
                         jt+1 := ujt+1     R ht Yjth + RAhjt                 (26)

where uhjt+1 is an idiosyncratic shock distributed as a uniform r.v. with
support (0; 2). Recall that ht = wt + "t t is the average !    cost. The i-th

     Also X-…rms can go bankrupt but their default in principle a¤ects the interest rate on
foreign debt since they seek …nance only on foreign …nancial markets.

is the leverage ratio:In fact in our context (average) debt is de…ned as Dth :=
  h h
  t Yt    Aht so that ht turns out to be the proportion of total cost which is
…nanced by means of debt. Apart from a scale factor, therefore, the proba-
bility of bankruptcy can be thought of as the product of the interest rate R
times the average cost ht times the leverage ratio ht :
                          Dh                 RDth
     Notice that ht ht = ht : Hence, F =          :Apart from the scale factor,

therefore, the probability of bankruptcy can be conceived also as the ratio of
debt service (principal and interest) RDth to output.

    It is easy to conclude therefore that the leverage ratio is decreasing in
a non-linear way with the interest rate hR = h hR < 0 , the average cost
  h
     = h h < 0 and the equity base hA = h hA < 0 (see appendix A.3).10

F is clearly decreasing with net worth FA = 12 R ht hA < 0 while it is a non
monotonic function of the interest rate and the average cost.In fact from the

The sum in brackets in (31) measures the change in the product R ht =
RDth = ht Yth (i.e. the ratio of debt service to average cost) caused by a change
of the interest rate. An increase of the interest rate a¤ects R ht in two
contrasting ways: the impact e¤ect is obviously positive (because R goes up
by assumption) but the indirect e¤ect is negative because the leverage ratio
goes down hR = h hR < 0 . We can rewrite (31) as

     Since the scale of production is increasing with net worth, both output and net worth
can be a measure of the size of the average …rm. Therefore, the leverage ratio is decreasing
with size: the greater the size of the average domestic …rm, the smaller the leverage.

absolute value.
   A similar argument applies to the response of the probability of bank-
ruptcy to a change in average cost. In fact from the de…nition (28) follows

         Yth
increase of the average cost on ht ht is obviously positive (because ht goes
up by assumption) but the indirect e¤ect is negative because the leverage
ratio goes down h = h h < 0 . We can rewrite (32) as

value, i.e.        < 1; then F > 0 i.e. the impact e¤ect prevails over the
indirect e¤ect. The opposite holds true if elasticity is greater than one in
absolute value. In …gure 6 we plot F as a function of ht . It is a hump shaped
curve. The upward (downward) sloping branch of the function is character-
ized by elasticity smaller (greater) than one in absolute value. Higher values
of Aht bring about shallower hump shaped functions. For each level of the
average cost, in fact, as net worth goes up, the probability of bankruptcy
goes down.

    Since the average cost is increasing with the exchange rate, the probability
of bankruptcy turns out to be also a non monotonic function of the exchange
rate:

It is easy to see that the domestic interest rate is decreasing with net worth:

@Aht     1      1

and 2 = F (computed in a predetermined initial condition);the domestic
interest rate is increasing (decreasing) with unit costs if 2 > 0 ( 2 < 0) ;
i.e. for relatively low (high) levels of the average cost:
    An increase in t may be due, among other things, to a devaluation.The
impact of a devaluation on the domestic interest rate:

                          @R    @R     h                   2       h

captures the risk premium e¤ect of a devaluation. Of course the risk premium
e¤ect is positive, i.e. a devaluation pushes up the domestic interest rate, if
  2 > 0; it is negative otherwise.
    Taking into account the determinants of the domestic interest rate exam-
ined in the present section, the …rst and second round e¤ects of a devaluation
on H-output are more complicated than assumed in sections 3 and 4. For
instance, an increase of the exchange rate, keeping net worth constant, makes
output of the H-…rms shrink because of the increase in unit cost. The reduc-
tion in output can be even bigger if the interest rate goes up as a consequence
of the increased risk of bankruptcy. This occurs if 2 > 0. If the opposite
holds true, the devaluation makes the domestic interest go down, an e¤ect
which o¤sets, at least in part, the reduction in the scale of production due
to increased unit costs. In symbols, from (3) follows

    The derivative (36) di¤ers from the derivative (4) computed in section 3,
i.e. keeping net worth and the interest rate constant, because of the term
  R which measures the elasticity of the domestic interest rate to average cost
and can be either positive or negative. In section 3, R = 0 by construction.


7      Conclusions
In a …nancially fragile environment, i.e. an economy in which production
decisions depend on the availability and the cost of internal and external
funds, a devaluation can a¤ect output by means of a wide range of e¤ects. In
this paper we have provided a tentative taxonomy which can be summarized
as follows:

    1. direct (…rst round) e¤ect on output, taking as given net worth and
       interest rate:

            a negative input cost e¤ect on H …rms,
            a positive foreign debt e¤ect on X …rms.

    2. indirect (second round) wealth e¤ect (on output through net worth,
       taking as given the interest rate) on X and H …rms. The sign of this
       e¤ect depends on the size of the average X an H …rm.

    3. indirect e¤ect on output of H …rms through the response of the domestic
       interest rate to a devaluation due to the risk premium e¤ect.The sign
       of this e¤ect depends on the elasticity of the interest rate to the average
       cost of H-…rms.

    Due to the uncertainty surrounding the sign of most of these e¤ects, it
is di¢ cult to assess the overall e¤ect of a devaluation. One cannot rule
out, however, an economywide contractionary e¤ect of a devaluation. The


                                        26
likelihood and extent of this case is an interesting question to be answered on
empirical ground in future research. In the paper, however, we have shown
–albeit only at a speculative level –that this occurrence cannot be con…ned
to an analytical curiosum.
    If the devaluation a¤ects negatively the net worth of H-…rms, the domes-
tic interest rate, which incorporates a premium for the risk of bankruptcy,
may rise (due to the risk premium e¤ect), exerting an additional contrac-
tionary impact on output. If, on top of that, the monetary authorities force
a further increase of the interest rate in an e¤ort to curb the exchange rate,
the contractionary e¤ect will be emphasized.
    In this paper, we have dealt with the exchange rate as if it were exogenous.
In future research developments we want to endogenize the exchange rate in
general equilibrium variant of the present framework .We conjecture that
the equilibrium exchange rate may be a function not only of the domestic
and international interest rates but also of the …nancial conditions of …rms as
captured by net worth. A policy move which leads to a devaluation, therefore,
can feed back on the exchange rate through its impact on net worth.

where Pt+1   is the market price of goods sold on foreign markets in t+1.

    Thanks to the assumption on technology, we can rewrite (38) as follows:

                       x                               wt

                                                      "t t

    The expression wt + "t t represents the real average production cost in
terms of domestic goods, i.e. the nominal average production cost in domestic
currency de‡ated by the domestic price level, and will be denoted by ht :
Dividing ht by the real exchange rate one gets the real average production
cost in terms of foreign goods, say xt ; i.e. the nominal average production

which is the expression in parentheses in (39). Both the numerator (i.e.
the average cost at constant domestic prices) and the denominator (i.e. the
real exchange rate) of the expression above are increasing with the nominal
exchange rate. The higher the exchange rate, the higher will be the "oil bill"
an therefore the production cost in domestic currency (input cost e¤ect of a
devaluation). At the same time, the higher the exchange rate, the lower will
be the …nancing gap in dollars (foreign debt e¤ect) because wages are paid
in domestic currency but "…nanced" in foreign currency: given the nominal
wage in domestic currency, the higher the exchange rate, the lower will be
the dollar value of the nominal wage and the …nancing gap. The real average
production cost in terms of foreign goods, however, is decreasing with the
nominal exchange rate. For X-…rms who raise funds only on foreign …nancial
markets, the foreign debt e¤ect more than o¤set the input cost e¤ect.
    The i-th …rm goes bankrupt in period t if xit+1 < 0, i.e.

where uxit+1 is the critical threshold of the average revenue. According to (40)
if there is a negative shock and the average revenue of the …rm falls below
the threshold, the …rm goes bankrupt.
    Let’s assume that uxit+1 is distributed as a uniform r.v. with support
(0; 2) so that Et uxit+1 = 1. The probability of bankruptcy can be expressed
as follows:

                                              uxit+1   Rx              wt           Axit
            Pr   uxit+1   <   uxit+1        =        =                     +               (41)

    The probability of bankruptcy is increasing with the interest rate and the
real wage and decreasing with the real exchange rate and net worth per unit
of output.

    Finally we assume that bankruptcy is costly and the cost of bankruptcy is
an increasing qaudratic function of the scale of production, i.e. CBi = (Yitx )2 .

can be interpreted as follows: the expected marginal real revenue (equal to 1
by assumption) must be equal to the real marginal cost, which in turn is the
sum of the marginal production cost and the marginal bankruptcy cost. The
marginal production cost is equal to the real average cost in terms of foreign
goods multipled by the interest rate Rx xt :The marginal bankruptcy cost
consists of two parts. The …rst one is positive and increasing with output:
Rx xt Yitx : The second part is negative and increasing in absolute value with
                   Ax
net worth: Rx it :

where Pjt+1 is the price of the non-tradables produced by the i-th …rm, i
is the interest rate on the domestic market for loans. The meaning of the
remaining symbols is straightforward.
    Dividing (45) by Pt+1 and using the usual assumptions, we obtain the
following function of pro…t at constant (domestic) prices:

    Let’s assume that uhjt+1 is distributed as a uniform r.v. with support

be expressed as follows:

is the elasticity of the leverage ratio with respect to the interest rate.
    A similar argument applies to the response of the probability of bank-
ruptcy to a change in average cost. In fact we can write
