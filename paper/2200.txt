             Should Social Security Benefits Increase with Age?



                                  ABSTRACT



      This paper shows that the optimal relation between social security

 benefits and retiree age depends on
                                       balancing the advantage of providing an
 otherwise unavailable actuarially fair annuity against the lower rate of

 return earned in a pay-as-you-go social
                                           security system. The ability of
compulsory social security programs to provide an actuarially fair annuity

 implies that benefits should increase with age while the lower return on

social security contributions than on private saving implies that a larger

fraction of total benefits should be
                                       paid during the early years of
retirement. In an economy that contains a mixture of rational life cycle

savers and completely myopic individuals who do no saving, it is optimal for

benefits to decline during the earlier part of the retirement period and then

to begin rising. Numerical calculations based on actual macroeconomic

parameters and representative survival probabilities
                                                       suggest that the optimal
age for minimum benefits occurs before age 75.

      Although individuals can save while they are working to finance

 consumption during their retirement years, they cannot purchase actuarially

 fair annuities with which to spread their accumulated wealth over the

 uncertain retirement period. Because insurance companies cannot know as much

 about individuals' health and life expectancy as the individuals themselves,

 an adverse selection problem leads to the underprovision of annuity

 insurance.1 As a result, individuals are forced to leave involuntary bequests

 and to consume less during their retirement
                                               years than an actuarially fair
 annuity would permit.

      In contrast to the limited private
                                           annuity market, compulsory public
social security retirement systems can provide actuarially fair annuities.

This feature is a potentially important
                                           justification for mandating such

benefits even though the implicit return on social security is less than the

return on private investments.2

     It is perhaps surprising therefore that in practice the social security

program provides each retiree with a real benefit that is fixed for life. It

seems at least plausible that the social security program should instead

provide a lower level of benefits in the
                                           early retirement years (when most
individuals have savings with which to finance consumption) and a higher level

of benefits in the later years (when the uncertainty of survival and the

absence of actuarially fair private annuities make the availability of social

security benefits more important). The present paper examines this conjecture

and shows the conditions under which it is true.

      It is useful to begin the analysis by considering the simple but extreme

case in which individuals are completely myopic: they do no saving and

are therefore completely dependent on social security for their retirement

consumption. Section 1 discusses the optimal age profile for social security

benefits in such an economy. A more appropriate framework for deriving the

optimal annuity structure recognizes that some fraction of the population are

completely myopic while others save rationally for their old age. Before

considering this general case, section 2 goes to the opposite extreme from

section 1 and examines the optimal annuity structure when everyone is a

rational life-cycle saver. Looking at this case permits separating the

effects of imperfections in the private annuity market and individual myopia

in the design of the optimal social security annuity structure. Finally,

section 3 considers the general problem of a mixed economy with both myopes

and lifecyclers who face an imperfect private annuity market. Section 4

presents a numerical example and discusses the application of the analysis.

There is a brief concluding section.



 1.   The Optimal Annuity Structure with Complete Myopia

      The economy examined in this paper is an extension of the overlapping

 generations model first developed by Samuelson (1958). Instead of the

 Samuelsonian two-period framework, individuals work for two periods and then
                                             —3—


 retire for either one or two periods. All
                                                     individuals are alike and each has
 a probability p of surviving to the second retirement period. The population

 grows at rate ri per period and wages grow at rate g.
                                                                (For concreteness, I
 shall later assume that each period is 10 years long.)

       If the number of new retirees at time t is Rt, the number of older

 retirees who survived from the previous vintage of retirees is pRt_i. The

 social security program pays benefits of bit to the younger retirees at time

 t and b2t to the older retirees at time        t.

      All workers at each point in time are paid the same wage,
                                                                        w. If the
 total number of workers at time t is denoted
                                                      Lt and the social security tax
 rate is 0, the social security tax collections are Tt =
                                                                 DwL.    The
pay-as-you-go nature of the social security program implies the
                                                                         budget
constraint:


(1)        bitRt +              =
                     b2tpRt_l       OwtLt.

      To focus the present analysis on the structure of the annuity, I will

assume that the level of the social security tax, 0, is fixed. Since

individuals are myopic and do no saving, the appropriate welfare criteria in

this sector can be written as a function
                                                of consumption only.

      Each individual's utility during retirement will be written in the

separable form u(c3) +
                         v(c4)      where c3 is consumption during the first
retirement period (i.e. the third period of life) and c4 is the consumption

during the second period of retirement.        I take social welfare in each period
to be the sum of the utilities of the individuals alive in that period:
                                               —4--




(2)        w Rt • u(c3t)      +
                                   pRti        v(ct).

      Since -individuals are completely myopic arid therefore do no retirement

saving during their working years, all retirement consumption is financed by

                                                        The optimal design of the social
social security: c3 =    bit      and c4. =     b2t.
security benefits is then equivalent to maximizing


                               +           •
(3)        w Rt • u(bit)           pRt_i       v(b2t)i

subject to the government budget constraing given by equation (1). It follows

immediately that u' =   v'   at the optimal levels of benefits. Thus if the two

utility functions are identical, the optimal benefits are the same in each

period: bt =    bt.4
      Since real wages are rising at rate g per period, the common level of

benefits is also increasing at rate g per period.              The equality of benefits of

the younger and older retirees at each point in time therefore means that the

optimal level of each individual's own benefits increases at rate g between

the early retirement period arid the late retirement period.




2.     The Optimal Annuity Structure with Rational Life Cycle Savers

       Consider now an economy in which each individual is a rational life-cycle

 saver but in which no private annuity market exists. Each individual saves

 during his working years and then chooses an optimal level of consumption from

 these accumulated assets during the first period of his retirement. The

 remaining assets plus the interest on them are consumed in the second

 retirement period if the individual survives. If the individual dies at the
                                                 —5.--




  end of the first period, those assets are bequeathed.
                                                                           i shall assume that -in
  deciding his own consumption the individual
                                                               gives no weight to these bequests.
 The social welfare function will of course take them into account.

        To derive explicit results, I will now follow the log-linear utility

 specification of Feldstein (1985, 1987) and posit that individuals who will

 retire in period t maximize in     c1.2 + ln c21 + in                    c3
 +   p in c41 subject to a lifetime budget constraint


 (4)         [(l-O)w2 - C1 t_2)(1+r)3        +
                                                     [(l-)w        -


            + (bit_c3t)(1+r)   —
                                   c41   =       0


 It follows directly that the individual's
                                                             optimal spending plan is:


 (5)        c+3 = (i+r)            ((19)                 [    + (1+g)/(1+r))   +
                                                                                           2
                                                                                               +   b2,t+i)
                                                                                   (1+r)           (1+r)

where k = 1 for s = 4 and k = 0
                                for the previous periods. Note that since
wages rise at rate g per period, benefits per retiree also increase at that

rate; thus, b2t+i =
                       b2(1+g).
       Since the number of persons in each cohort rises at rate n, social

welfare at time t can be written:



                   2
(6) W. = Rt[(1+n       in c1 + u+n       in c2 + in c3 +                 -!- in        + (1-p)
                                                                                           1+n in C4t]

The last term represents the value of the bequests made by those who do not

survive to the second retirement period; the coefficient
                                                                               reflects the
relative weight given to these bequests in the social welfare function.
                                                    -6-


      It follows from equation (5) that


(7)
                   =                                +        + b1-)             +
                                                                                    b2(-)}.
Combining equations (6) and (7) implies



(8)            =
                   a1 ln{(1-O)wt[1 +                    + b1(-)           +
                                                                              b2(P)       }   + a2


where a1 =   (i+n) [(i+n)3 + (i+n)2             +    (i+n)   +   p   +   (].—pfl    and


a2 = —a1 ln(3+p) +       (i+n)'[(i+n)2      +       2(i+n)   + 3p +       3(1—p))ln[(1+r)/(1+g)].
The important feature of a1 and a2 at this point in the analysis is that they

are constants, independent of 8, bit and b2t. Thus maximizing social welfare

is equivalent to maximizing {(i-e)w[i +                              + b1()          +
                                                                                          b2()}.
Moreover, since the current analysis takes the level of the social security

tax rate (9) as given, maximizing social welfare is equivalent to maximizing

                             subject to the budget constant is still given by equation
bit +   (1+g)/(i+r)b2
(1) that


                                =
                                    OwtLt
(9)          bit +     -! b2t
Since 0 is not a choice variable, the right hand side of (9) is predetermined.

It is immediately clear that the problem of maximizing bit +

                       subject to 9 and to the constraints that bit                            0 and b2t   0
[(i+g)/(1+r)]b2
does not have an interior solution. Welfare is an increasing function of


bit      (i+g)I(1)       <   pI(i+n);    in this case the optimal social security program

would be a lump sum to new retirees with no benefits to older retirees.

Conversely, if (i+g)!(1+r) >            p/(i+n),        the optimal program would provide no
                                         —7—



 benefit to new retirees and a lump sum to those who survive to the second

 period.

      To understand this result, note that the key inequality can be restated

 as a comparison of the survival probability p and the "efficiency of social

 security," x =   (1+n)(1+g)/(1+r).   This term can be characterized as the

 efficiency of social security because it compares the implicit return on

social security [(1+n)(1+g)] to the return earned on private assets (1+r).

Previous analysis has emphasized that since social security is inefficient in

the sense that x <   1, a social security program is justified only to the
extent that the provision of benefits to those myopic individuals who would

otherwise save too little outweighs the losses to the rational life cyclers

who are forced to sacrifice a return of 1 +    r   in exchange for a return of

(1+n) (1+g).

     In the present context in which the size of the overall social security

program is fixed and in which all individuals are rational life
                                                                     cyclers, the
comparison of x and p indicates whether the gain from social security's

ability to provide a fair annuity outweighs the loss due to its lower rate of

return. If x < p. the return on social security is so low that individuals

are better off receiving a lump sum social security payment when they retire

with no second period benefit at all. Another way of stating this is to note

that x < p is equivalent to (1+g)(1+n) <
                                            p(1+r),   i.e., the return provided by

the social security annuity ((1+g)(1+n)) is less than the return from private

saving reduced by the mortality probability (p(1+r)].

    In the alternative case, the low returns on the social security annuity

is nevertheless great enough to exceed the expected return on private saving:
                                            —8--




(1+g)(1+n) >   p(1+r)   or x >   p.    In this case, optimal social security benefits

should be paid only to those who survive to the second stage of retirement.5

     These results show that the optimal time structure of retirement benefits

for rational life-cyclers depends on balancing the gains from annuity risk

protection against the loss from relying on the low yielding social security

instead of higher yielding private assets.

     The analysis of this case of rational life cyclers is useful in

understanding the more general case to which I now turn.




3.   Optimal Annuity Structure When Some Individuals are Myopic

     I now follow the analysis of Feldstein (1985) and assume that a fraction

p. of the population are complete myopes who never save anything while the

remain 1 - p. are rational life cyciers.

     At time t, the per capita consumption of the working myopes is

(1-e)w and the per capita consumption of the two cohorts of retired myopes is

bit and b2t. The number of newly retired myopes is              and of older myopes is

                          Similarly, the numbers of working myopes in the younger
MPRt1 =   p.pRI(i+n).
and older cohorts are p.(1+n)2R and p.(i+n)Rt. The component of social welfare

at time t attributable to the myopes is thus p.R{(i+n)2ln(1_O)wt

÷ (1÷n)ln((i_O)wt) +      in   bit +   (p/(1+n)] in b2}. Combining this with the
corresponding component of social welfare attributable to the rational

life-cyclers as previously derived in equation (8) yields the social welfare

value at time t:

Writing   x =   (1+g)(1+n)/(1+r)   for the efficiency of social security, equation

(14) implies that b2 > b1 if x > p and b2 < b1 if x <              p.
     Two general things should be noted about this result. First, the

question of whether older retirees get higher or lower benefits than younger

retirees depends only on the comparison of social security efficiency (x) and

the mortality probability (p) and not on the relative frequency of myopes in

the population (g4. Second, the effect of the fraction of myopes in the

population is to dampen the sensitivity of the benefit difference (b2-b1) to

the difference between x and p. Thus, while the previous section showed that

x < p implies that social security is so inefficient that rational lifecyclers

would prefer to receive all of their benefits at retirement (i.e., b2 =                             0),
when there are myopes as well as lifecyclers, some benefits must be provided

in both periods. Nevertheless, x < p implies that first period benefits are

higher than second period benefits (b1 >                     Conversely, when social
                                                  b2).
security is efficient enough so that the actuarially fair return at rate

(1+g)(1+n) exceeds p(1+r), the expected return on private saving without an

annuity, then the optimal structure of social security benefits gives higher

benefits to the older retirees.

 4.   A Numerical Example and a Simple Extension

      Although the social security efficiency (x) depends only on basic

 macroeconomic parameters (g, n and r), the survival probability relevant for

 determining the age structure of benefits depends on the age limits of the

 social security benefit groups. This section examines the relation described

 by equation (14) with the help of realistic numerical values and shows the

 implications of dividing the overall retirement period in different ways.

      Consider an economy in which individuals who reach age 65 all live for 10

years and may live for another 10 years. No one lives beyond age 85. The

survival probability p will be approximated by the actual probability of

surviving from age 70 to age 80. According to The Vital Statistics of the

United States (Bureau of the Census, 1986, p. 69), this survival probability

for a white male in 1982 was 0.53.

      The value of x depends on the rate of population growth, the rate of wage

growth and the real rate of return on private capital. The rate of population

growth over the past three decades averaged 1.4 percent a year. Since we are

using ten year period, 1 + n =        (1.014)10 = 1.15.     Similarly, real compensation

grew at an average annual rate of 2.2 percent, implying

1 + g =   (1.022)10   =   1.24.   Finally, since the real pretax rate of return on

nonfinancial corporate capital averaged 10.4 percent from 1955 through 1984

(Feldstein and Jun, 1986), 1 +       r   =   (1.104)10 = 2.69.   Taken together, these

imply that x =   0.53 for a decade period.

      This coincidental equality of the macroeconomic parameter x =           0.53 and
                                             0.53 implies that bt =
the decade survival probability p =
                                                                      b,   i.e., that the

benefits of retirees aged 65 to 75 should be the same as the benefits of

concurrent retirees aged 75 to 85. Note that since the overall benefit level
                                          —12—


rises over time at the rate of growth of wages, this equality of the benefits

of younger and older retirees means that each individual's benefit increases

as he ages. More specifically, real wages growing at 2.2 percent a year

implies that 1. + g =   (1.022)10 = 1.24 and therefore that the benefits of 75 to
85 year olds should be 24 percent higher than the benefits that those same

individuals received when they were 65 to 75 years old.

      More generally, this analysis suggests that if social security benefits

can vary with each year of age rather than by decade, the benefits of retirees

should decline at early ages while the annual value of

x =   (1.014)(1.022)/(1.104)   =   0.94 is less than the annual survival probability

and should then begin increasing with age. For example, in 1982 the annual

survival probability of white males fell to 0.94 at age 75. Thus, optimal

benefits would decline among retirees aged 65 to 75 and would then begin to

increase.

      Since this is a cross-sectional relation, each individual's benefits would

begin to increase at an earlier age. The age at which an individual's

benefits begin to increase corresponds to the point at which the 2.2 percent

annual rise in the general level of benefits outweighs the cross-sectional

decline in benefits. Thus at some point between the ages of 65 and 75 optimal

benefits stop declining and begin to increase.



5.     Conclusion

       This paper shows that the optimal relation between social security

benefits and retiree age depends on balancing the advantage of providing an

otherwise unavailable actuarially fair annuity against the lower rate of
                                          —13—


 return earned in a pay-as-you—go social security system. If the tax rate that

 finances social security benefits is fixed, the ability of compulsory social

 security programs to provide an actuarially fair annuity implies that benefits

 should increase with age while the lower return on social security

 contributions than on private saving implies that a larger fraction of total

 benefits should be paid during the early years of retirement. In an economy

 that contains a mixture of rational life cycle savers and completely myopic

 individuals who do no saving, it is optimal for benefits to decline during the

earlier part of the retirement period and then to begin rising. Numerical

calculations based on actual macroeconomic parameters and survival

probabilities suggest that the optimal age for minimum benefits occurs before

age 75.

     The present analysis has assumed a complete absence of private annuity

markets. If private annuity markets do exist but provide a return that is

less than actuarially fair, the value of the survival probability (p) in the

present analysis must be replaced by p/p* when p* > p is the survival

probability implicit in the private annuity. Thus benefit rise with age if

and only if x >   p/p*.    In the limiting case of an actuarially fair private

annuity (p* =   p),   social security benefits should decline with age as long as

x < 1.

     This analysis suggests that the ability of social security to provide an

actuarially fair annuity that cannot be provided by the market implies that

the optimal level of social security taxes is higher than the level derived in

Feldstein (1985) for an economy in which the retirement period was certain.

Similarly, the annuity aspect of compulsory social security may alter the

conditions (derived in Feldstein, 1987) in which a means tested program is
                                    -14-


preferable to a universal program. These issues will be examined in

subsequent research.

1.   On the absence of actuarially fair annuities, see Friedman and

Warshawsky, (1985a, 1985b).

2.   See Feldstein (1985) for an analysis that shows that it may be optimal to

have no social security in an economy in which the implicit return on social

security is low even though individuals save too little privately for their

own old age.

3.   I have extended that model to deal with related issues in Feldste-in

(1985, 1987).

4.   Although it is of course possible to argue that differences in the

utility function imply a different benefit structure, it is not clear in which

direction this difference points. Younger retirees may have a higher marginal

utility of consumption at each level of spending because they are healthier

and therefore able to engage in a broader range of activities. Alternatively,

the older retirees may have a higher marginal utility of consumption at each

level of spending because they have higher fixed costs for medical care and

other personal services. While recognizing both possibilities, the present

analysis proceeds on the assumption that both utility functions are the same.

5.   Since borrowing secured by future social security benefits is illegal,

the optimal level of b2 may be constrained to be not greater than the level of

final period consumption that the individual would choose conditional on that

value of b2. This type of consideration is clearly important if we recognize

a large number of retirement subperiods.
