1.      Introduction

        This short article examines the contribution of fluctuations in prices of nontradable goods

relative to tradable goos vis-a-vis fluctuations in exchange-rate-adjusted relative prices of

tradable goods for explaining the variability of the real exchange rate of the Mexican peso

against the U.S. dollar. The exercise is motivated by the results reported in Engel (2000) for the

peso-dollar real exchange rate, and it makes use of the techniques he proposed in that paper and

in his previous work on variance decompositions of real exchange rates (see Engel (1999)).

Interest in revisiting the issue follows from Engel’s finding that the fraction of the variance of

the peso-dollar real exchange rate accounted for by the variance of the Mexico-U.S. ratio of

prices of tradable goods adjusted by the nominal exchange rate is in excess of 0.9, regardless of

the time horizon over which the data are differenced in computing variability coefficients. This

result is at odds with the emphasis that theoretical and empirical studies of exchange-rate

management in emerging markets regularly put on fluctuations in the domestic price of

nontradables relative to tradables as the main determinant of the real exchange rate. Mendoza

and Uribe (2000), for example, reported large variations in Mexico’s relative price of

nontradables during the exchange-rate-based stabilization of 1988-1994, but did not compute

variance ratios to assess their contribution to account for Mexico’s real-exchange-rate

variability.

        The results of the variance analysis reported here show that Engel’s finding is consistent

with periods in which Mexico did not follow an explicit policy of exchange rate management. In

contrast, in periods in which Mexico followed a fixed exchange rate or a crawling peg, the

fraction of real-exchange-rate variability accounted for by movements of tradable-goods prices
                                                -2-

and the nominal exchange rate falls sharply and varies widely with the time horizon of the

variance ratio. Data for the periods of managed-exchange-rate regimes in Mexicoalso do not

reproduce two other key findings of Engel’s work: namely that, (a) covariances across domestic

nontradables relative prices and cross-country tradables relative prices tend to be generally

positive or negligible and (b) variance ratios corrected to take into account these covariances

generally do not change results derived using approximate variance ratios that ignore them.

Contrary to these findings, in periods in which Mexico had a managed exchange rate, the

correlation between domestic nontradables relative prices and international tradables relative

prices is sharply negative. The standard deviation of Mexico’s domestic relative prices is also

markedly higher during these periods. As a result, measures of the contribution of tradables

goods prices to real-exchange-rate variability corrected to take into account these features of the

data are significantly lower than those that do not. Movements in domestic nontradables relative

prices can account for up to 70 percent of the variance of the real exchange rate in periods in

which Mexico managed the value of its currency.

2.     Variance Decompositions of the Peso-Dollar Real Exchange Rate

       The analysis of variance conducted below follows closely Engel (2000). The data used

are non-seasonally-adjusted monthly observations of the consumer price index (CPI) from

Mexico (MX) and the United States (US) covering the period January, 1969 to February, 2000.

Mexican data were retrieved from the Bank of Mexico’s web site (http://www.banxico.org.mx),

and those for the United States from the site maintained by the Bureau of Labor Statistics

(http://stats.bls.gov). Three price indexes were retrieved for each country: the aggregate CPI (P i

for i=MX, US) and those that apply to durable goods (PD i for i=MX, US) and services (PS i for
                                                  -3-

i=MX, US). The dataset was completed with the nominal exchange rate series for the monthly-

average exchange rate of Mexican pesos per U.S. dollar (E) reported in the IMF’s International

Financial Statistics CD ROM. All price indexes were re-based to February 1988=100 to match

the date of the implementation of the exchange-rate-stabilization plan that collapsed in

December of 1994. The real exchange rate was generated using the IMF’s convention as

RER=PMX/(E*PUS). The data were transformed into logs and logged variables are expressed in

lower caps.

        Durable goods are treated as tradable goods and services are treated as nontradable

goods. This definition is roughly in line with standard treatment and is also roughly consistent

with a sectoral classification of the Mexican data based on a definition of tradable goods as those

pertaining to sectors for which the ratio of net exports to gross output exceeds 5 percent (see

Mendoza and Uribe (2000)). Following Engel (2000), a simple algebraic manipulation of the

definition of the real exchange rate is used to decompose its natural logarithm into the following

identity: rert / xt + yt. The variable xt is the exchange-rate-adjusted price ratio of tradables (i.e.,

durable goods) across Mexico and the United States: xt / pdt MX-et - pdt US.1 If the strong

assumptions needed for the law of one price to hold in this context were satisfied, xt should be a

constant and should not contribute to explain variations in rert. The variable yt includes the

terms that reflect domestic prices of nontradable goods (i.e., services) relative to those of

tradable goods: yt / bt MX (pst MX-pdt MX)- bt US(pst US-pdt US), where bt MX and bt US are the weights

of nontradable goods in each country’s CPI. Intra-country relative prices of nontradable goods



        1
       This is in fact the negative of Engel’s measure because the real exchange rate used here
conforms to the IMF’s definition.
                                                      -4-

are thus defined as: mxpnt / pst MX-pdt MX and uspnt / pst US-pdt US.

       The results of variance decompositions of the peso-dollar real exchange rate are

summarized in Table 1. The Table presents five panels that correspond to different sample

periods. Panel I is for the full sample. Panels II and V are for periods without exchange rate

management in Mexico. Panel II corresponds to the same sample period studied by Engel

(2000), which is set by a sample of data retrieved from Datastream for the period September,

1991 to August, 1999. Since this sample includes some data for the managed-exchange-rate

regime that collapsed at the end of 1994, Panel V shows results for a sample that includes only

data for the post-1994 period without exchange rate management. Panels III and IV are for

periods of exchange rate management. Panel III (January, 1969-July, 1976) corresponds to a

fixed exchange rate. Panel IV (March, 1988-November, 1994) is for the managed exchange- rate

regime implemented to anchor the stabilization plan known as El Pacto. This regime included

an initial one-year period of fixed exchange rate followed by a crawling peg within a narrow

band (the boundaries of which were revised occasionally).

       The top section of each panel in Table 1 reports the correlation matrix and the standard

deviations of rer, x, y, mxpn, and uspn computed over four time frequencies in which each

variable has been transformed using 1-month differences, 6-month differences, 12-month

differences and 24-month differences. The bottom section lists four variance ratios that measure

the contribution of fluctuations in x to explain the variance of rer computed over the same
                                                  2
frequencies. The first ratio is the basic ratio    (x)/ 2(rer) reported by Engel (2000). This ratio

ignores covariance terms in the elements that make up the real exchange rate (i.e., it is accurate
                                                                          2
only when x and y are independent random variables, in which case          (rer) = 2(x) + 2(y)). The
                                                  -5-

second and third ratios are alternatives discussed in the Appendix to Engel (1995) that consider
                                                 2
covariance terms. The second ratio is simply      (x)/[ 2(x)+ 2(y)] .2 The third ratio measures the

contribution of x to the variability of rer by assigning to x half of the covariance term in the
                                                                       2
equality that links the variance of rer with its two elements (i.e.,    (rer)= 2(x)+ 2(y)+2cov(x,y)).

Thus, the third variance ratio is [ 2(x)+cov(x,y)] /    2
                                                        (rer). This variance ratio can be written as:

                               [ 2(x)/ 2(rer)] {1 + (x,y) (y)/ (x)] }.

Hence, the basic variance ratio that disregards the covariance of x and y approximates well this

adjusted variance ratio when the correlation between the two variables, (x,y), is low and/or the

standard deviation of x is large relative to that of y. The fourth variance ratio controls only for

the covariance between x and the domestic relative price of nontradables in Mexico. In this case,

the variance ratio is:

                         [ 2(x)/ 2(rer)] {1 + (x,mxpn)[bMX (mxpn) / (x)] }.

As in the previous case, the basic variance ratio approximates accurately this adjusted variance

ratio when the correlation between x and mxpn is low and/or the standard deviation of x is large

relative to that of mxpn.

        The motivation for considering the fourth variance ratio that controls only for the

covariance between x and mxpn follows from the fact that y captures the combined changes in

domestic relative prices of nontradables in Mexico and the United States, as well as the recurrent

revisions to the weights used to compute each country’s CPI (which also take place at different




        2
        This ratio includes a covariance term because when x and y are not independent random
variables 2(x)/[ 2(x)+ 2(y)] = 2(x)/[ 2(rer)-2cov(x,y)].
                                                  -6-

intervals in each country).3 Hence, while the variance ratio adjusted for the x-y covariance yields

correct measures of how much of the variance of the real exchange rate is due to variables x and

y, it is silent about the contributions of the various elements that conform y. Computing an exact

variance ratio that decomposes these effects requires to control for the full variance-covariance

matrix of y, x, mxpn, uspn, bMX and bN . Since data to calculate this matrix are not readily

available, the fourth variance ratio listed in each panel is seen as a proxy that isolates the effect

of the covariance between mxpn and rer. The complement (i.e., 1 minus the ratio shown) is a

good measure of the contribution of Mexico’s relative price of nontradables to the variance of

the real exchange rate to the extent that: (a) movements in the CPI weights play a minor role, and

(b) the correlation between mxpn and uspn is low and/or the variance of mxpn largely exceeds

that of uspn. Computing this variance ratio still requires an estimate of an assumed constant

value of bMX, which was determined using 1994 weights from the Mexican CPI, extracted from a

methodological note provided by the Bank of Mexico (bMX is 0.6).4

       Statistical issues related to the role of covariance terms in the calculation of variance

ratios are very well-known. Engel considered them carefully in his work on industrial countries

and on the peso-dollar real exchange rate and concluded that they could be safely set aside. For

instance, Engel (1995) argued that in the case of the components of the real exchange rate of the


       3
         Since yt is calculated as the difference rert-xt, and since the aggregate CPIs include
nondurables in addition to durables and services, this residual measure of yt captures also the
effects of cross-country differences in the prices of nondurables relative to durables.
       4
        This figure reflects weights from the 1989 National Income and Expenditure Household
Survey (NIEHS), which were incorporated into the CPI in 1994. Until recently, Mexico did not
have a fixed schedule for updating CPI weights. Weights were revised in 1980 using the 1977
NIEHS, in 1994 using the 1989 NIEHS, and in 1998 using the 1994 NIEHS combined with data
from the 1995 census. Starting in 2000, weights are to be updated biannually.

United States vis-a-vis industrial countries, “comovements between x and y are insignificant in

all cases, except when we use the aggregate PPI (producer price index) as the traded goods price
                                                                                       2
index” (p. 31). In addition, Engel (2000) noted that the basic variance ratio (i.e.,   (x)/ 2(rer))

“tends to underestimate the importance of the x as long as the co-variance term (between x and

y) is positive (which it is at most short horizons), but any alternative treatment of the covariance

has very little effect on the measured relative importance of the x component” (p.9). In these

conditions, the basic variance ratio is either very accurate (if (x,y) is low) or in the worst-case

scenario it represents a lower bound for the true variance ratio (if (x,y) is positive). In either
                     2
case, a high ratio    (x)/ 2(rer) indicates correctly that real-exchange-rate fluctuations are mostly

explained by movements in tradable goods prices and in the nominal exchange rate.

       The results reported in Panel I of Table 1 show that for the full sample period (January,

1969 to February, 2000) the findings of Engel’s analysis hold. The basic variance ratio exceeds

0.94 at all frequencies and any of the three corrections for covariances across x and y or across x

and mxpn make no difference. The latter reflects the results that the correlation coefficients

 (x,y) and (x,mxpn) are very small and that the standard deviations of x are larger than those of

y and mxpn. Covariances of x with uspn are also irrelevant because the correlations between

these variables are generally negligible and the standard deviations of uspn are all small. Note in

addition that the correlations between mxpn and uspn are negligible as well.

       A very similar picture emerges from Panel II for the period of the Datastream sample

used by Engel (2000) and from Panel V for the post-1994 period. The one difference is that at

frequencies higher than 1 month there are marked negative correlations between x and uspn and

between mxpn and uspn. These correlations could in principle add to the contribution of
                                                  -8-

domestic relative price variations in explaining the variance of rer. However, they can be safely

ignored because the standard deviation of x dwarfs those of uspn and mxpn at all time horizons,

and the latter still have to be reduced by the fractions bMX and bUS respectively (presuming

constant weights).

       The picture that emerges from Panels III and IV for periods that correspond to managed

exchange-rate regimes in Mexico is very different. Two changes are critical to note:

(a)    The standard deviations of the Mexican relative price of nontradable goods and of the

       composite variable y increase significantly and become in some cases even larger than

       the standard deviations of x.

(b)    The correlations between x and y and between x and mxpn fall sharply and become

       markedly negative (approaching -0.6 in most cases).

       The basic variance ratio of x to rer, which ignores these changes, is still very high, and in

several instances it exceeds 1 (which reflects the presence of large covariance terms). However,

the two variance ratios corrected to take into account the negative correlation between x and y

and the larger standard deviation of y, and the variance ratio that controls only for the covariance

between x and mxpn, show dramatic reductions in the share of real-exchange-rate variability

attributable to x. For instance, Panel III (for the fixed exchange rate sample) shows that

according to the third variance ratio listed in the panel, the contribution of x to the variability of

the real exchange rate reaches a minimum of 0.29 at the 6-month frequency and remains low at

around 0.36 for 12- and 24-month frequencies. The fourth variance ratio, which corrects only for

the covariance between x and mxpn, is below 0.61 at frequencies higher than one month. These

effects are also present, albeit with less dramatic results, in the sample of Panel V for El Pacto’s
                                                 -9-

exchange-rate-based stabilization. In this case, the variance ratios that consider the covariance

between x and y indicate that the contribution of x to the variability of the real exchange rate is

below 0.6 at all frequencies (except with the third ratio at the 12-month frequency, in which case

it increases to 0.7). The fourth ratio shows that if the only covariance considered is that between

x and mxpn, the variance of rer attributable to x reaches a lower bound of 0.55 at the one-month

frequency. This variance ratio increases sharply at the 24-month frequency.

       It is important to note that, despite the dramatic reduction in the fraction of real exchange

variability that can be accounted for by movements in relative prices of tradable goods and the

nominal exchange rate in periods of exchange-rate management, there is still a nontrivial fraction

of real-exchange-rate variability that these movements account for (ranging from 0.29 to 0.71).

It is equally important, though, not to generalize the results that apply to periods without

exchange-rate management to those with managed exchange-rate regimes because during the

latter the relative price of nontradable goods plays a very important role in driving the real

exchange rate.

       Two other important features are worth noting in comparing periods of managed and

floating exchange rates:

(a)    The correlation between x and rer is much lower in the former compared with the latter.

       The correlation between x and rer is almost perfect at all time horizons in periods of

       floating exchange rates, while it ranges between 0.29 and 0.7 in the samples of managed

       exchange rates.

(b)    In some of the managed exchange rate scenarios, particularly the 12- and 24-month

       horizons of the sample of El Pacto, the correlation between nontradable goods relative
                                                -10-

       prices between Mexico and the United States is positive (it can be as high as 0.32). This

       reduces the share of fluctuations in rer that can be accounted for by y because the

       variance of the latter is a negative function of that correlation (i.e., if U.S. and Mexican

       relative prices of nontradable goods are more likely to increase together, differences in

       the behavior of these domestic relative prices across countries tend to offset each other

       more and hence are less important for real-exchange-rate fluctuations). This point is also

       raised by Engel (1995).

       The quantitative significance of the second observation depends on how large is the

correlation between mxpn and uspn, compared to the strong negative correlation between mxpn

and x, and on how large is the standard deviation of U.S. nontradable goods prices relative to that

of Mexican nontradables goods prices. With regard to the latter, all panels in Table 1 show that

the variability of nontradables relative prices in Mexico exceeds by a large margin that of the

United States. Indeed, this is about the only result that is robust to the changes in exchange rate

regime documented in the Table. The higher volatility of Mexico’s domestic relative price of

nontradable goods vis-a-vis the United States deserves careful scrutiny regardless of its

contribution to the variability of the peso-dollar real exchange rate.

3.     Conclusions

       The evidence reported here suggests that fluctuations in the domestic relative price of

nontradable goods can account for 50 to 70 percent of the fluctuations of the real exchange rate

in economies under exchange rate management (particularly in those using it as an stabilization

policy instrument). Two lessons are to be learned. First, the behavior of the determinants of the

real exchange rate differs sharply between countries with the features just described and the
                                                -11-

industrial countries for which variance decompositions of real exchange rates are normally

applied. The overwhelming role of movements in prices of tradable goods and nominal

exchange rates found in industrial countries, or even in developing countries with floating

exchange rates, is sharply diminished. Second, even though the variance of domestic

nontradables relative prices can account for more than a half of the variance of the real exchange

rate, there is still a non-trivial fraction accounted for by changes in tradable goods prices and

nominal exchange rates.

       These lessons lend support to the suggestion in Engel (2000) that a full explanation of the

behavior of the real exchange rate in the literature on exchange-rate management is likely to

require modifications to the dominant approach that considers only the role of changes in the

relative price of nontradable goods. On the positive side, however, the results indicating that

roughly a half of the variability of the real exchange rate can be attributed to movements in

nontradables goods prices are in line with the quantitative findings that the recent literature has

produced (see Mendoza and Uribe (2000)).

       The two lessons referred to above are captured clearly by the graph of the peso-dollar

real exchange rate and its components at the end of this text. The graph shows that overall

fluctuations in tradable goods prices and in the nominal exchange rate are a key determinant of

the movements in the real exchange rate. However, in periods like that of Mexico’s 1988-1994

exchange-rate-based stabilization, the real exchange rate was heavily influenced by a massive

change in the relative price of nontradable goods within Mexico. This observation also suggests

that the role of the relative price of nontradables may not be as critical in episodes of exchange-

rate management across industrial countries. If in these cases the relative price of nontradables
                                                 -12-

exhibits similar variability and is positively correlated across countries, fluctuations in non-

tradable goods prices will continue to explain a small fraction of the variability of the real

exchange rate. In the case of the peso-dollar real exchange rate, the variance of the relative price

of nontradables in Mexico is much higher than that in the United States. Further research

comparing the experiences of industrial and developing countries could shed light on these

conjectures, and could explore whether other real exchange rates pairing emerging markets with

industrial countries display similar sensitiveness to the exchange-rate regime as the peso-dollar

real exchange rate.

       The analysis undertaken here avoided intentionally taking a position on the best modeling

strategy to account for the fraction of real-exchange-rate variability explained by movements in

tradable goods prices and the nominal exchange rate. This is because the intent of the analysis

was to focus exclusively on statistical results and because approaches to model this phenomenon

are still subject of controversy. In particular, the evidence reported here for periods without

exchange rate management, in which a large fraction of real-exchange-rate variability is due to

changes in relative prices of tradable goods and the nominal exchange rate, does not suggest per

se that one should view fluctuations in the variable x as deviations from the law of one price or

evidence of price stickiness. It simply shows how much x (i.e., the ratio of exchange-rate-

adjusted CPI prices of durable goods across Mexico and the United States) contributes to explain

the variance of the ratio of exchange-rate-adjusted aggregate CPIs. This is distant from the ideal

scenario needed to interpret changes in x as deviations from the law of one price. The law of one

price applies to single, homogeneous goods sold in a freely-accessible market and in the absence

of frictions like transportation costs and tax and tariff distortions. Clearly, aggregate data for the
                                                 -13-

CPIs of Mexico and the United States violate these conditions. The goods included in these

indexes are different, carry different weights, and the weights change a different intervals.

Access to a “common market” has varied widely over the sample period and across goods, and

similar caveats apply to transportation costs, taxes and tariffs.

       There are detailed studies on purchasing power parity (PPP) and the law of one price that

have tried to take the above issues into account, and still find evidence of large price differentials

at highly disaggregated levels in consumer goods. Some researchers are more concerned with

the impossibility of defining pure concepts of “tradable” goods in the sense that the law of one

price requires, and are thus exploring relative price movements introducing measures of the

“degree of tradability of goods” (see Betts and Kehoe (2000)) or distribution costs (see Busrtein,

Neves, and Rebelo (2000)).

       The contribution of the relative price of nontradable goods to real-exchange-rate

variability was also documented without taking a position on the modeling strategy to follow in

order to capture it. The traditional approach in the literature on exchange-rate management in

emerging economies has been to combine isoelastic utility functions that consider tradable and

nontradable goods with sectoral neoclassical production technologies. This has generally failed

to produce large changes in the relative price of nontradables, as it results in a nearly-linear

sectoral production possibilities frontier (PPF) when the models are calibrated to the data.

Fernandez de Cordoba and Kehoe (2000) and Mendoza and Uribe (2000) encountered this

problem and opted for introducing sector-specific production technologies to increase the

curvature of the PPF. However, Mendoza (2000) studied further the composition of the Mexican

CPI and found that the change in nontradables relative prices is heavily biased to changes in the
                                                 -14-

cost of use of housing, and that the latter have been identified to be closely related to real estate

prices, domestic credit conditions, and international capital flows (see Guerra de Luna (1997)

and (1998)). This evidence suggests that one important mechanism driving the real exchange

rate may operate through asset-pricing and credit channels.

       Finally, the treatment of the data in the analysis conducted here abstracts from medium-

to low-frequency considerations, including those related to mean-reverting properties of real

exchange rates in the data and the long-run determination of real exchange rates. However,

research in this direction is also inconclusive, as the survey by Froot and Rogoff (1995) shows.

For example, Asea and Mendoza (1994) find that while the data support predictions of long-run

neoclassical models in which cross-country differences in the relative price of nontradable goods

reflect differences in productivity across sectors that produce tradables and nontradables,

measures of the long-run relative price of nontradables do poorly in explaining cross-country

differences in CPI-based measures of the real exchange rate. At medium time frequencies, it is

interesting to note that computing the variance ratios reviewed here using 72-month differences

of the data, which correspond to the six-year periodicity of recent Mexican business cycles, the

contribution of variable x to the variance of the real exchange rate is about 65 percent (both for

the full sample and for the period of the managed exchange rate that ended in 1994).

       In summary, it seems quite reasonable to agree with Paul Samuelson in that: “Unless

very sophisticated indeed, PPP is a misleadingly pretentious doctrine, promising us what is rare

in economics, detailed numerical predictions” (Samuelson (1964), p. 153).
