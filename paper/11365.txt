The International Exposure of U.S. Banks

                                            ABSTRACT

This paper documents the changing international exposures of U.S. bank balance sheets since the
mid-1980s. U.S. banks have foreign positions heavily concentrated in Europe, with more volatile
flows to other regions of the world. In recent years some cross-border claims on Latin American
countries have declined, while claims extended locally by the branches and subsidiaries of U.S.
banks have grown. The foreign exposures of larger U.S. banks tend to be less volatile than claims
of smaller banks, and locally-issued claims tend to be more stable than cross-border flows. Business
cycle variables have mixed influence on U.S. bank cross-border and local claims. The cross-border
claims of U.S. banks on European customers tend to be procyclical. By contrast, locally generated
and cross border claims on Latin American customers of U.S. banks are not robustly related to either
U.S. or country-specific business cycle variables. U.S. banks do not appear to be strong conduits for
transmitting U.S. cycles to these smaller markets, and may instead serve a positive role in stabilizing
the amplitude of foreign country cycles.

I. Introduction
        U.S. bank claims on industrialized and emerging markets can alter the extent of
financial sector depth in markets, expand opportunities for international risk sharing and
consumption smoothing in response to idiosyncratic country shocks, lead to altered
international transmission of disturbances, and alter the institutions in the source and
destination markets. Supporters see the foreign banks as key sources of otherwise scarce
capital, with broader positive spillovers on the stability and efficiency of local financial
markets. Critics of industrialized country banks participating in foreign markets
sometimes argue that these banks are unstable lenders who undermine local financial
markets. The debate on whether foreign lenders are fickle continues to rage (Galindo,
Micco and Powell 2004), and underscores the importance of fact-finding and
communications on the international lending practices of industrialized country banks.
        This paper explores patterns in U.S. bank claims on foreign partners. We contrast
the determinants and trends in U.S. claims on European and Latin American
counterparties. As in Goldberg (2002), we primarily draw on data from a time-series panel
of individual U.S. banks that report exposures to foreign markets. These reports are filed
quarterly by each U.S. bank (or bank holding company) to support the bank supervisory
process of the Federal Reserve, Federal Depository Insurance Corporation, and Office of
Comptroller of the Currency. The banks report the country-by-country distribution of their
foreign exposures,1 the form of these exposures (cross border claims and local claims, i.e.
claims extended by the affiliates of U.S. banks located in foreign markets), valuations of
derivative positions held, some maturity composition details, and broad categories of
recipients of U.S. claims by destination market.
        Four interesting findings arise in our current examination of data which spans mid
2004. First, claims extended by larger U.S. reporting banks tend to be less volatile than
claims by smaller U.S. banks. Second, while there have been some declines in cross-
border flows to Latin American counterparties, larger U.S. banks have had robust trend
growth in local claims on Latin America. Third, local claims tend to be more stable than
cross border claims. Finally, there is at best mixed evidence in support of the idea that
U.S. international claims are cyclically driven, where cyclical forces are proxied by GDP

  The use of the term “U.S. banks” in this paper generally includes U.S. owned banks, bank holding
companies and U.S. subsidiaries of foreign banks. The reported data also are combined with similar data
from other countries to form the consolidated data on international bank lending reported by the Bank for
International Settlements.

growth rates and interest rates. While U.S. bank cross-border claims on European
counterparties tend to expand with European growth performance, these sensitivities are
not robust and the explanatory power of these forces is low. We do not observe stable
transmission of U.S. or destination market cycles into either Latin American or European
partners, either in cross-border or local claims.2
         These findings build on Goldberg (2002), wherein it was observed that the U.S.
banks engaged in international lending had become more diverse since the 1980s, with
fewer banks overall, and the remaining banks increasingly polarized in terms of size and
portfolio allocations. By the late 1990s, while a substantial share of the U.S. banks
reporting foreign exposures were smaller banks, the vast majority of these exposures were
nonetheless attributable to a few large banks. Lending by the larger banks also is less
volatile than lending by the smaller banks.
         Our findings of weak and variable cyclical transmission from the United States
banks contrast with stronger results by Peek and Rosengren (1997, 2000a) on Japanese
business cycle transmission to the United States. Our results also contrast with Van
Ricjkeghem and Weder (2001), who find more transmission when banks have a presence
across multiple markets.3 U.S. banks do not appear as particularly fickle in emerging
markets, in contrast to some of the conclusions on international banks of Galindo, Micco,
and Powell (2004). Indeed, while our results support the view that foreign banks can
transmit international business cycles into host country financial markets, this result is
neither strong or robust. U.S. banks also may reduce the extent to which locally-sourced
real shocks and interest rates, i.e. local business cycles, are amplified by banking
intermediaries. Consequently, the U.S. banks engaged in this type of credit extension
abroad may reduce the highly procyclical credit cycles in some foreign markets.4
         Section II of this paper discusses the U.S. bank foreign exposure data and provides
background on the extensive changes that have occurred since 1986 in U.S. bank lending
abroad and in the form and scale of their exposures. Data on the relative importance of
U.S. bank and other foreign bank claims relative to GDP across European and Latin

  BIS (2004) provides a thoughtful overview of issues from the perspective of source and host countries of
financial sector FDI. Goldberg (2004) surveys the host country implications of financial sector foreign direct
investment, and draws parallels between the effects of FS-FDI and FDI in manufacturing and extractive
resource industries.

  Galindo, Micco, and Powell (2004) argue that foreign banks may make be fickle lenders in times of local
crises, sharply reducing credit extension to local markets. We do not find general support for this argument
in U.S. bank data.

American countries provide context for the importance of this financial activity. Section
III econometrically explores the volatility of the panel data on U.S. bank international
claims. We contrast the cyclical properties of claims on industrialized countries in Europe
versus on Latin American countries. Section IV discusses the implications of our results,
on balance emphasizing that foreign banks may contribute to aggregate stability in
emerging markets.


II. Broad patterns in U.S. Bank foreign exposures
       The Federal Financial Institutions Examinations Council (FFIEC) Country
Exposure Report (FFIEC 009) must be filed by every U.S. chartered, insured, commercial
bank in the United States, including the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and US
territories and possessions, or it’s holding company, provided that the bank (or holding
company) has, on a fully consolidated bank basis, total outstanding claims on residents of
foreign countries exceeding $30 million in aggregate. In these reports, bank claims are
itemized by country and separately encompass claims on banks, public entities, and other
recipients including individuals and businesses. In addition to direct international flows,
bank claims include the fair value of interest rate, foreign exchange, equity, commodity
and other derivative contracts. Banks provide some details on time remaining to maturity
(one year and under, 1 to 5 years, and over five years), as well as on direct claims versus
ultimate risk claims. Other quarterly reports filed by banks contain information on bank
total assets located in the United States and abroad. Some reporting conventions have
changed over time, but much of this confidential data has been consistently filed by banks
since 1986.


       Foreign claims relative to local economies. Foreign lending can constitute a
substantial fraction of claims in recipient countries. In this context, foreign claims are the
sum of cross-border claims in local claims denominated in both foreign and local
currencies. As shown in the first data column of Table 1, European countries often have
total foreign claims in excess of 100 percent of their GDP. This large fraction in part
reflects volumes of back and forth financial flows across borders, heavy use of banking
sector finance, and the role of European financial centers in intermediation of some flows.
For Latin American countries, foreign claims represent a much smaller share of GDP:
across the region, the ratio of foreign claims to country GDP is closer to 70 percent.

                                  As shown in the second data column, the U.S. accounts for a relatively small
          portion of the foreign claims on European countries, typically close to 5 percent overall.
          Intra-European flows dominate the foreign claims on European countries. By contrast,
          U.S. banks account for a large portion of overall foreign claims on Latin American
          countries. There is considerable cross-country variation in the share of the U.S. within
          these foreign claims, from Costa Rica at less than 20 percent of total foreign claims to
          Mexico, where this ratio exceeds 95 percent.


                                  Consolidation in U.S. Banks with Foreign Exposures. Industry consolidation,
          observed elsewhere across banking and financial services industries, is clearly evident in
          the changing number of banks (or bank holding companies) with exposures to foreign
          markets. Chart 1 shows the number of U.S. banks that have filed foreign exposure reports
          each quarter since 1986. Starting from highs of 185 reporting banks in the mid 1980s, the
          number of U.S. banks with foreign exposures declined to 140 by the mid 1990s and
          further declined to 75 banks by 2004.

                                             As the number of banks declined, the size distribution of remaining banks changed
        considerably over time. Chart 2 shows the share of reporting banks in five different asset
        size ranges, contrasting size distributions for 1986q1 and 2004q1.5 In the 1980s banks
        were broadly distributed across small, medium, and large asset ranges. By 2004 the
        distribution was more bimodal. Currently more than 30 percent of banks have assets well
        under $1 billion, while more than 60 percent of banks have total assets in excess of $10
        billion.

                                             As the total number of banks declined, so did the number of U.S. banks with
        exposures across different foreign regions. Among Europe, Canada, Asia and the Middle
        East, Africa, and Latin America, Latin America has the most U.S. banks reporting
        exposure (66 banks in mid 2004), with similar numbers participating in European and
        Canadian markets. Asia and the Middle East (AME) have 56 banks, while about 30 U.S.
        banks have some claims on Africa and Other Countries.

                                   As a share of all banks reporting these foreign exposures, a similarly large
               proportion of banks – over 90 percent – maintained positions in Latin America, Canada,
               Europe, and Asia/Middle East (AME) in the 1980s through the early part of the 1990s. As
               shown in Chart 3, the 1990s was a decade of increasing differentiation across U.S. banks
               in terms of their regional exposures. While participation of U.S. banks in Canadian and in
               Latin American markets remained high, participation rates in the Asia/Middle East and
               Europe declined. By 2004, some of this differentiation was reduced: participation in
               European markets recovered to over 80 percent of reporting banks, and the share of banks
               participating in Latin American countries declined from highs observed prior to the
               Argentine crisis. During this period, the proportion of reporting banks with Asia/Middle
               East exposure stayed at near 70 percent.

                                   Very few banks have foreign exposures only in one region. The number of banks
               exclusively focused on Latin America was 3 or 4 through the 1980s, rising to 8
               sporadically in the early 1990s, and declining again to few specialty operations.
               Typically, between 1 and 3 banks specialize in other regions, generally in claims on either

       Magnitudes of U.S. Bank Foreign Claims. The trend toward consolidation in the
banking sector has not lead to a decline in the total foreign exposures across U.S. banks.
The increasing values over past decades of total foreign exposure of U.S. banks (in 2003
dollars) are depicted in Chart 4 for cross-border claims and Chart 5 for local claims. After
sharp declines over the late 1980s, U.S. bank foreign exposures had persistent expansion
from 1993 through 2004. This growth occurred in both in total cross-border claims and in
total local claims, even when evaluated relative to the growth in total assets of U.S. banks
reporting foreign exposures.
       These observations are drawn from data aggregated across all U.S. banks reporting
foreign exposures. Next, we instead utilize the source data, at the level of individual
reporting banks, and construct bank-specific measures of foreign exposure-to-asset
position. We then average this foreign exposure ratio across all individual reporting banks.
The resulting averages, shown in Chart 6, are unweighted by bank size and therefore place
greater (relative) weight on the exposures of smaller banks. Trend increases in average
foreign exposure ratios occurred through late 1998, driven strongly by growth in US
average ratios of bank claims on Latin America. These average claims on Latin American
counterparties fluctuated substantially through 2000 before sharply declining between mid
2001 through 2004 when our data end. These ratios shown in Chart 6 contrast sharply with
patterns in total flows from all U.S. banks reporting foreign exposures. The difference
demonstrates that smaller U.S. banks with foreign exposures both had higher than average
exposures to Latin America and reduced these exposures (relative to their asset bases) more
dramatically than their larger bank counterparts.

                                                 Our examination of U.S. bank exposure data leads to more nuanced conclusions
             that some other studies of international capital flows which argue that the 1999 to 2000

                                                                                     9
       credit crunch was common throughout Latin America. Braun and Hausmann (2002), for
       example, using data through 2001, find that bank credit in many Latin American countries
       collapsed in the aftermath of the Asian and especially the Russian crises. The strong rates
       of real credit growth, sometimes described as credit booms, that characterized the early
       and mid-1990s generally decreased since 1998 and stayed at lower levels through 2001.
       We find that this type of credit crunch in claims on Latin American countries was more a
       feature of the cross-border flows than of the local claims of U.S.-owned banks. Moreover,
       this credit crunch seems to better describe banks other than the largest U.S. banks with
       foreign exposures to countries in the region. This interesting set of observations may be
       relevant for discussions of overall banking sector stability. Crystal, Dages, and Goldberg
       (2002) had argued that the mix of foreign versus domestically owned banks within Latin
       America was important for the growth rates and stability of credit flows: credit growth and
       credit stability were enhanced when strong foreign partners were participating in local
       markets. Here we confirm this finding, and extend it with the observation that the size, as
       well as the form of foreign bank claims on a market, also may matter for sustained
       intermediation by the banking sector.

                                                 The Composition of U.S. Bank Foreign Clients. The exposure data shows the
relative importance of banks, public sector borrowers, and all other borrowers in U.S.
bank cross-border claims on each country. Charts 7 and 8 show these broad details for
cross-border claims on Europe and Latin America, respectively. In U.S. bank cross-border
claims on Europe, the share of public sector borrowers was in the area of 10 percent since
the 1980s, rising as high as 14 percent in the early 1990s and again in 1998, but recently
falling to below 7 percent. Other private sector borrowers became increasing active in total
cross border claims on Europeans over the past two decades, ultimately rising to be
comparable in size to bank borrowers.
                                                 U.S. bank cross-border claims on Latin American counterparties also were
characterized by a declining relative importance of bank-to-bank lending. Even more
dramatic were the reductions in the share of cross-border claims accounted for by the
public sector, moving from 40 percent in the late 1980s to under 10 percent in 2004. The
share accounted for by non-bank private borrowers has continued to rise over past
decades, reaching almost 60 percent in 2003 and 2004. By 1999 private non-bank activity
displaced bank-to-bank lending as the primary client in U.S. bank cross-border claims on
Latin America customers.

III. U.S. Bank Foreign Exposures and Business Cycle Transmission
                                                     International banks entering into foreign markets can potentially change the
transmission of international shocks to local markets (Peek and Rosengren 1997, 2000a)
and spur contagion across markets (vanRijckeghem and Weder 2001). These banks can
also have different risk management systems and sources of funds, raising the prospect
that they may change the typically procyclical response of the host country banking
system to local shocks. In this section we provide evidence relevant for the debate on
shock transmission by exploring the sensitivity of U.S. bank foreign exposures to local
country and U.S. business cycle variables. In order to have a benchmark for comparison,
we contrast the patterns in U.S. bank claims on European countries with the patterns in
U.S. bank claims on Latin American countries. Delving further into this issue, we ask
whether larger banks – here taken to be the five largest money center banks -- are more
stable in credit extension and differ from smaller banks in the sensitivity of this credit to
business cycle variables.6 Some of the analysis uses aggregated claims across banks, while

6
  The top five money center banks are Bank of America Corp., Bank One Corp., Taunus Corp., J.P. Morgan
Chase Bank, Citigroup. Taunus is the US holding company subsidiary of Deutsche Bank. These banks are,
in part, formed by smaller banks that consolidated. Thus, for each of these five large money center banks we
create a synthetic construct going back in time that includes the exposures of smaller banks that eventually
merged together into the current five money center banks. This approach may impart a survivorship bias to
                                                                                           12
other parts of our analysis exploit the rich time-series panel nature of the bank exposure
data7.


III.1 Exposures to European and Latin American countries
         Europe accounts for 40 percent of total U.S. bank foreign exposures (Table 2),
with U.S. bank cross-border claims three times as large as U.S. bank local claims (i.e.
claims extended by their branches and subsidiaries abroad). The United Kingdom,
Germany, France and the Netherlands account for most of the U.S. bank claims on
Europe. Latin American countries account for less than 8 percent of the total foreign
exposures of U.S. banks. In contrast to the pattern vis-à-vis Europe, where cross-border
claims dominate, U.S. bank exposures to Latin American countries now occur more
through local claims, by a ratio of nearly two to one. Looking across countries, the largest
U.S. banks with foreign exposures typically dominate local claims more than they
dominate cross border claims. In some Latin American countries, most notably Costa
Rica, Ecuador, Jamaica, and Uruguay, smaller U.S. banks account for more of the cross
border claims than do the larger U.S. banks (Appendix Table 1).
         To gain perspective on the fluctuations in different types of U.S. bank foreign
exposures, we construct volatility measures by country and across types of claims (cross
border, local). “Volatility” is the standard deviation of these claims on each country
(summed across banks), normalized by the associated mean U.S. bank claims on that
country. As shown in Table 3, the volatility of cross border claims in recent data (2000Q1
through 2004Q2),8         is similar for Europe and Latin American regions. Iceland and
Argentina had similar and particularly high coefficients of variation in the cross-border
claims. While the average variation in local claims appears higher for countries in Latin
America compared with Europe, this observation masks the high volatility of claims on
some individual European countries with relatively small volumes of such claims. Finally,
abstracting from Mexico, where local claims volatility is driven by recent purchases of


the empirical results that follow. Note that Taunus is not domestically owned. An alternative group of large
banks could be geared toward large domestic lenders, and be broader. Such a grouping could include:
Citigroup Inc, Bank of America Corporation, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Wells Fargo & Company,
Wachovia Corporation, Bank One Corporation, US Bancorp, National City Corporation, Suntrust Banks,
Inc.

  This time frame both captures the dynamics surrounding the Argentine crisis, and has the technical
advantage of minimizing the adjustments to account for bank mergers needed as the analysis goes further
back in time.
                                                    13
 Mexican banks, and Argentina, which was in crisis during part of this period, local claims
 issued by U.S. banks have tended to be more stable than cross border claims in most Latin
 American countries.

          The next pair of tables compares patterns in the foreign claims of larger versus
smaller U.S. banks reporting foreign exposures. For these calculations, we sum across the
claims of larger U.S. reporting banks (5 money center) vis-a-vis individual countries and
compare these sums with similar constructs using data summed across all other banks
reporting foreign exposures. We compute the relative coefficients of variation across large
versus smaller banks for a specific type of claim, and for a specific country or region. In
the results reported in each cell of Table 4 a value greater than one can be interpreted as
showing that claims extended by larger U.S. banks were relatively more volatile than
claims extended by smaller U.S. banks. Analogously, a cell value less than one implies


                                                      15
relatively less volatility in the foreign exposures of the larger U.S. banks vis-à-vis a
particular country.

# Mexican local claims appear more volatile due to acquisition events during this interval.



          The preponderance of cells with values less than one in the left-most panel of
Table 4 suggests that, on average, the cross border and local claims on European countries
by larger U.S. banks are less volatile than the claims extended by smaller U.S. banks.
There is clearly country specific variation, with larger U.S. banks having higher volatility
of claims than smaller U.S. banks in their transactions with financial centers such as
Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Differences across larger and smaller U.S. banks
are most pronounced in local claims both in European countries and Latin American

countries (right panel): the claims by larger banks tend to be substantially less volatile
than the claims by smaller banks. Evidence on cross-border claims to Latin American
countries is mixed. For Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Jamaica, cross border claims from
larger banks clearly were more stable, contrasting with patterns for Colombia, Ecuador,
Mexico and Uruguay.


III.2 Foreign Exposures of U.S. Banks and Business Cycles

As another window into the volatility of U.S. bank foreign exposures, we conduct
regression analysis starting from a model of a bank’s exposure to any country as
dependent on local business cycle variables (real local interest rates9, itc , and real GDP

growth rates, GGDPt c ) and U.S. business cycle variables (U.S. real interest rates, itus , and

U.S. real GDP growth, GGDPt us ). The (log) exposure of bank i to country c at time t,

Exp tic , is expressed as:


Exptic = a0i + a1i t + a r + a 2r t + b ⋅ itc + c ⋅ itus + d ⋅ GGDPt c + e ⋅ GGDPt us               (1)


plus a random error term. In this specification the terms a0i + a1i t allow for bank-specific

variation in mean and trend-growth in their foreign exposures. The terms a r + a2r t
introduce region-specific variation and allow for the possibility that, regardless of the role
of other observable fundamentals, some regions are more popular destinations for U.S.
bank foreign exposures.
         To reduce estimation problems arising from unit root properties of GDP growth,
real interest rates, and U.S. bank external exposures, we first-difference equation (1). The
bank and region constant terms drop out, leaving equation (2) specified in log-differences
with bank-specific and region-specific fixed effects to capture trends in claims on specific
countries (and with a random error term assumed).


∆Exptic = a1i + a2r + b ⋅ ∆itc + c ⋅ ∆itus + d ⋅ ∆GGDPt c + e ⋅ ∆GGDPt us                           (2)

  The data used, in general, are country lending rates (IFS 60p), “the lending rate to meet the short and
medium term financing needs of the private sector, differentiated by credit worthiness of borrowers and
objectives of financing”. If this rate is unavailable for a country, we use deposit rates (IFS 60L) or Treasury
bill rates (IFS 60C). See the data appendix.
                                                       17
       This basic testing specification states that the percentage change in a U.S. bank’s
claims on any country has: a bank specific component common across all regions; a
region-specific component shared by banks; components correlated with changes in
foreign and U.S. real interest rates; and components correlated with changes in foreign and
U.S. GDP growth rates. Regression specifications are run over quarterly data for the
period 1986Q1 to 2004Q2 using percent changes in the bank exposures against changes in
interest rates and against percent changes in real GDP growth rates.
       As detailed in Table 5, we performed many variations on this basic specification.
Many regression results were starkly different for the full data period compared with a
sample break at 2001:Q2. To capture the flavor of these changes, we present the earlier
and latter results for contrast, fully aware of the limitations of using a small number of
quarters in the latter period. Some regressions use data on claims aggregated across U.S.
banks. Other regressions take greater advantage of the rich data of individual bank
exposures, alternatively applying fixed effects estimators or random effects estimators to
time-series panels. Hausman tests favor the random coefficients model over fixed-effects
estimators. Other specifications compare the growth in U.S. bank foreign exposures across
“crisis” versus “normal” periods.10 We have run the regression specification with and
without regional trend terms, with different intervals specified, and with cross-border
claims aggregated across all reporting banks, disaggregated to larger versus smaller
reporting banks, and as robustness checks, containing adjustments for the ultimate
counterparty on transactions instead of just direct counterparties and excluding either U.S.
GDP or U.S. interest rates from the regressions. Only a subset of our findings is reported
in the tables of this section. Distinctions in the results generated across specifications are
discussed if these are statistically or economically important.

Regression Results
        The panels of Table 6 present regression results using aggregates across all U.S.
banks in their foreign exposures to individual countries. The top panel presents findings
for cross-border claims. The lower panel presents findings for the local claims of U.S.
banks. There are 18 European countries and 11 Latin American countries represented in
each data quarter. The top panel shows that macroeconomic variables are significant
drivers of U.S. bank cross-border claims on European countries. More specifically, these
claims exhibit procyclicality vis-a-vis US GDP growth and negative correlations with
destination market interest rates (as indicated by boldface type). However, these cyclical
forces have low explanatory power for the overall regression analysis, and are particularly
weak as determinants of the pattern of cross-border flows from U.S. banks to their Latin
American counterparties.

                                                     20
these macroeconomic forces. Additionally, the estimated relationships are not robust over
time. Local claims of U.S. banks were procyclical with U.S. GDP in the data extending
through 2000 or 2001 (as in Goldberg 2002), but these procyclical patterns are not
sustained in 2001 through 2004.
        In other regression specifications we explore whether these cyclical forces play
different roles in the foreign exposures of larger U.S. banks versus smaller U.S. banks.
Recall that claims from larger U.S. reporting banks tend to be less volatile than claims
from smaller U.S. banks, and local claims tend to be more stable than cross border flows.
Tables 7 and 8 explore this theme for cross-border claims and local claims, respectively,
using ordinary least squares regressions. As in the prior sections, the aggregate called
“larger banks” is the sum of foreign exposures across five money center banks. The
aggregate called “smaller banks” consists of the sum across all other banks of claims on
each country at each date.11 In these regressions the “i” superscript from equation 2
covers two aggregates, larger and smaller banks, while the regional superscript
distinguishes between the regional location of the 29 countries in the regression each
quarter and spanning European and Latin American countries.
        The relationships between business cycle variables and U.S. bank foreign
exposures appear unstable over time and differentiated by region. U.S. bank claims on
Europe exhibit positive growth in the cross border and local claim components, with this
growth alternatively attributable to trend or to U.S. GDP cyclical transmission. Cyclical
transmission to European countries, to the extent to which it is present, is more robustly a
feature of larger bank lending. Other cyclical variables do not enter these regressions with
consistent signs or significance ranges. Larger U.S. banks had robust trend growth in local
claims on Latin American countries across the different sub-periods of our sample,
including in the period following the Argentine crisis. These trends likely reflect strategic
expansions by the U.S. banks that entered local markets by setting up branches and
subsidiaries. Quarterly cyclical fundamental variables explain very little of the patterns of
foreign exposure expansions in recent years. While cross-border claims have a greater
tendency toward comovement with the U.S. cycle, this pattern is not robust across larger

11
   Appendix Tables 2 and 3 explore similar concepts, but individually introduce individual bank claims on
individual countries in the regressions, instead of claims aggregated by type of bank. While we report
specifications using random effects estimators, we also have performed fixed effect regressions, with fixed
effects defined over individual banks, yielding similar results. The random effects estimators provide a
better description of the trend differences across banks in their claims on different regions.

                                                   21
and smaller U.S. banks and we do not observe stable rates of transmission of U.S. or
destination market cycles in cross-border or local claims.

         As further robustness checks, we consider whether simultaneously including U.S.
real GDP and U.S. real interest rates in specifications biases each individual term toward
insignificance. Such misspecification might arise, for example, because U.S. real interest
rates are endogenous to the business cycle, following a policy reaction function, or

fluctuations. Alternative regression specifications using either but not both of the country
fundamentals (not shown) do not qualitatively change our conclusions. Likewise, our
qualitative findings are robust to the choice of different break point dates post 2000q1, and
robust across regression specifications using individual bank data instead of data
aggregated across groups of banks.


IV. Concluding Remarks


This   paper has explored recent patterns in the international exposures of U.S. banks.
Despite continued consolidation in the financial services industry, reflected in the sharply
reduced total number of U.S. banks with foreign exposures, the total foreign exposure of
these banks has continued to grow. U.S. bank claims represent a large fraction of foreign
claims on Latin American countries, as well as being large relative to local GDP. This role
is stronger than in individual European countries, where other European banks tend to
dominate foreign claims. Public sector recipients of these claims account for less than 10
percent of the total cross-border claims on European countries, consistent with how bank
lending has been allocated in Europe in recent decades. While a similar ratio now applies
for Latin American countries, this represents a sharp departure from allocations in the
early 1990s, when the public debt share exceeded 30 percent of U.S. bank claims on the
region.
          The largest U.S. banks increasingly dominate the total volumes of foreign
transactions of U.S. banks, with the composition of transactions evolving differently for
larger banks than smaller banks involved in foreign exposures. Cross-border claims have
soared with respect to European counterparts, but more recently have been flat or
declining in the Latin American region. Instead of representing declines in the related
foreign exposures of larger U.S. banks, these cross-border claims have been replaced by
claims from U.S. bank branches and subsidiaries located in Latin American markets. Such
local claims soared after 1997 and later stabilized at high levels, even in the aftermath of
the Argentine crisis. Post-crisis declines in U.S. bank positions in Latin America were
more heavily concentrated among the smaller U.S. banks with foreign exposures. Smaller
banks’ positions have been concentrated in cross-border claims, with these claims



                                            24
exhibiting slower and more volatile overall credit growth than claims emanating from the
largest banks.
       The final empirical section of the paper uses data on individual U.S. bank foreign
exposures to investigate the claim that such banks may be highly cyclical lenders, and
transmit foreign shocks to local markets. We find evidence of procyclical cross-border
flows from U.S. banks to European markets. However, U.S. bank claims on Latin
American countries tend to have weak and unstable relationships with both U.S. business
cycle variables and local business variables. We do not present a structural model of
portfolio theory as a determinant of the behavior of U.S. banks in selecting markets for
extending claims and for determining quantities of these claims. However, our regression
results do not bode well for such an application, especially if the application will rely on
U.S. and counterpart country GDP growth rates and interest rates.
       Overall, we find that cyclical variables explain very little of the movements
observed in cross-border claims, or the growth in local claims. The evidence certainly
does not support strong U.S. business cycle transmission. Indeed, the lack of importance
of local business cycle variables as determinants of U.S. bank foreign exposures may have
direct policy relevance. These claims of foreign banks may dampen the strong pro-
cyclicality of overall credit issuance by local financial systems, ultimately reducing the
amplitude of local cycles. This hypothesis is worth future investigation. U.S. banks, and in
particular the larger U.S. banks that have been heavily involved in local claims, may play
a role in stabilizing the business cycles of the foreign host markets.

Banking exposure data

U.S. FFIEC 009 and 009a reports are filed quarterly by all U.S. banks with significant
exposures.

Background: The report was initiated in 1977 as the FR 2036 report and was used to
collect data on the distribution, by country, of claims on foreigners held by U.S. banks and
bank holding companies. The FDIC and OCC collected similar information from
institutions under their supervision. In March 1984, the FR 2036 became a Federal
Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) report and was renumbered FFIEC
009. It was revised in March 1986 to provide more detail on guaranteed claims. In 1995,
the report was revised to add a schedule for the fair value of derivative contracts and
several items were combined.
Respondent Panel: The panel consists of U.S. commercial banks and bank holding
companies holding $30 million or more in claims on residents of foreign countries.
Respondents file the FFIEC 009a if exposures to a country exceed 1 percent of total assets
or 20 percent of capital of the reporting institution. FFIEC 009a respondents also furnish a
list of countries in which exposures were between 3/4 of 1 percent and 1 percent of total
assets or between 15 and 20 percent of capital. Participation is required.

                          Larger banks reversed their path of trend cross-border credit growth to Latin
comments                  America, while cross-border flows from smaller banks had more pronounced
                          trends. Slowdowns in the United States reinforced this pattern with respect to
                          Latin America, but cross-border claims accelerated instead with respect to
                          European countries. Number of Observations = 6844, Number of Groups = 62
