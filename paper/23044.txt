Care Act

                                           ABSTRACT

This study provides a national analysis of how the 2014 Affordable Care Act (ACA) Medicaid
expansions have affected aggregate prescription drug utilization. Given the prominent role of
prescription medications in the management of chronic conditions, as well as the high prevalence
of unmet health care needs in the population newly eligible for Medicaid, the use of prescription
drugs represents an important measure of the ACA’s policy impact. Prescription drug utilization
also provides insights into whether insurance expansions have increased access to physicians,
since obtaining these medications requires interaction with a health care provider. We use
2013-2015 data from a large, nationally representative, all-payer pharmacy transactions database
to examine effects on overall prescription medication utilization as well as effects within specific
drug classes. Using a differences-in-differences (DD) regression framework, we find that within
the first 15 months of expansion, Medicaid-paid prescription utilization increased by 19 percent in
expansion states relative to states that did not expand; this works out to approximately seven
additional prescriptions per year per newly enrolled beneficiary. The greatest increases in
Medicaid prescriptions occurred among diabetes medications, which increased by 24 percent.
Other classes of medication that experienced relatively large increases include contraceptives (22
percent) and cardiovascular drugs (21 percent), while several classes more consistent with acute
conditions such as allergies and infections experienced significantly smaller increases. As a
placebo test, we examine Medicare-paid prescriptions and find no evidence of a post-ACA effect.
Both expansion and non-expansion states followed statistically similar trends in Medicaid
prescription utilization in the pre-policy era, offering support for our DD approach. We did not
observe reductions in uninsured or privately insured prescriptions, suggesting that increased
utilization under Medicaid did not substitute for other forms of payment. Within expansion states,
increases in prescription drug utilization were larger in geographical areas with higher uninsured
rates prior to the ACA. Finally, we find some suggestive evidence that increases in prescription
drug utilization were greater in areas with larger Hispanic and black populations.

      1. Introduction

     The passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2010 and the subsequent implementation
of Medicaid expansions have resulted in the largest coverage gain among non-elderly adults since
the program’s inception in 1965. While the 2012 Supreme Court ruling made Medicaid expansion
under the ACA a voluntary decision for states, 31 states plus the District of Columbia have adopted
the expansions. With nearly 15 million new enrollees obtaining Medicaid coverage between 2013
and 2016, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Medicaid now covers
more than 72 million Americans. This represents a 26.5 percent increase in the number of
individuals covered by Medicaid relative to 2013 enrollment levels. Not only has this large growth
in the Medicaid program led to intense public policy debate, but it also provides researchers with
an opportunity to understand the responsiveness of health care use to insurance expansions.

       Prescription drugs are one of the most widely used forms of medical care in the U.S., with
nearly one out of every two Americans consuming at least one prescription drug in a month
(National Center for Health Statistics, 2016). At the same time, health insurance coverage appears
to be an important determinant of access to such treatments, partly because the patient must first
obtain access to a physician. Non-elderly adults without coverage are four times more likely than
their insured counterparts to report foregoing needed prescription drugs due to cost (National
Center for Health Statistics, 2016). In recent years, the high prices of life-saving hepatitis C and
HIV medications have fueled debate about the role of public policy in providing access to costly
but effective pharmacological treatments for vulnerable populations. Moreover, care management
through prescription drugs may potentially reduce the use of more resource-intensive medical care
such as emergency department visits or other non-drug spending (Goldman, Joyce, & Zheng, 2007;
Lavetti & Simon, 2016; Roebuck, Dougherty, Kaestner, & Miller, 2015; Stuart, Doshi, & Terza,
2009). In part reflecting previous research findings, the ACA classifies prescription drugs as one
of the ten categories of “essential health benefits” that all commercial private insurance plans must
provide.

       Expanding insurance coverage was one of the major policy objectives of the ACA. Recent
estimates suggest that uninsurance rates have declined substantially since early 2014
(Courtemanche, Marton, Ukert, Yelowitz, & Zapata, 2016; Frean, Gruber, & Sommers, 2016;



                                                 2
Kaestner, Garrett, Gangopadhyaya, & Fleming, 2015; Sommers, Gunja, Finegold, & Musco,
2015), along with improvements in self-reported access to primary care and prescription
medications (Sommers, Blendon, Orav, & Epstein, 2016; Sommers et al., 2015). Although changes
in insurance coverage resulting from the ACA Medicaid expansions have already received
substantial attention from researchers and policy makers, far less is known about its impact on the
use of specific types of medical services.

       In all 50 states, Medicaid covers most major categories of medical intervention, including
pharmacological therapy. Coverage expansions for low-income adults are expected to increase the
use of pharmacological treatment through improvements in access and affordability. A large
literature using experimental and quasi-experimental research designs establishes that demand for
prescription drugs is responsive to cost sharing (Chandra, Gruber, & McKnight, 2010; Newhouse,
1993). Utilization of prescription medications can also provide early evidence of ACA Medicaid
expansion effects on access to providers, because prescriptions can only be obtained through
consultation with a medical practitioner with prescriptive authority. Thus, studying the effect of
insurance on health care utilization is important for understanding how Medicaid expansions affect
access and health outcomes.

       This paper studies the impact of the ACA’s 2014 Medicaid expansions on prescription drug
use by comparing outcomes in states that expanded Medicaid eligibility to those in non-expansion
states, both before and after the policy change. This difference-in-difference approach is similar to
that used in recent studies that assess the impact of ACA Medicaid expansions on uncompensated
hospital-care costs (Dranove, Garthwaite, & Ody, 2016; Nikpay, Buchmueller, & Levy, 2015;
Nikpay, Buchmueller, & Levy, 2016) and on coverage, access to care, and labor market outcomes
(Gooptu, Moriya, Simon, & Sommers, 2016; Kaestner et al., 2015). We assess overall Medicaid
prescription utilization rates and utilization within specific drug classes, as well as how changes in
utilization varied across different geographic regions based on prior insurance rates and racial
composition. In addition to evaluating the impact on use of prescription drugs within the Medicaid
program, we also conduct a comprehensive analysis of whether Medicaid expansion simply
substituted away from utilization under uninsured or private payment sources. This helps in
gauging whether these utilizations are likely to amount to new uses; the issue of Medicaid ‘crowd




                                                  3
out’ of private insurance has been a substantial concern in prior literature (Congressional Budget
Office, 2007).

       We find that prescription drug utilization in Medicaid increased by 19 percent in Medicaid
expansion states in the first 15 months following the 2014 ACA expansion, relative to states that
did not adopt Medicaid expansion. Moreover, we isolate heterogeneity in utilization by drug class,
with a general pattern of larger increases for chronic conditions and smaller increases for acute
conditions. The largest increase of 24% occurred among drugs used for treating diabetes, as well
as an estimated 22% increase for contraception and 21% for cardiovascular disease, with
significantly smaller increases for respiratory/allergy medications and antibiotics.
       We observe no significant effect of Medicaid expansion on Medicare, privately insured
prescription utilization or on uninsured prescriptions paid by cash or assistance programs; the
magnitudes of these statistically insignificant coefficients are also small; they are 1.6 -7.5 percent
as large as the policy effect for Medicaid prescription utilization.       This suggests a lack of
substantial crowd out of private prescription drug utilization following Medicaid expansion.
       Within expansion states, we find that increases in prescription drug utilization were larger
in geographical areas with higher baseline uninsured rates in 2013, where the ACA likely produced
the largest coverage changes.      Finally, we document suggestive evidence that increases in
Medicaid prescriptions were greater in areas with a higher share of minority (Hispanic and black)
populations, indicating that Medicaid expansion under the ACA may have reduced ethnic/racial
disparities in access to medications. Our findings are robust to various alternative specifications,
comparison of pre-policy trends, and placebo testing, suggesting the results can be causally
attributed to the Medicaid expansions.


      2. Background

       Medicaid is a means-tested health insurance program for low-income populations; it is
jointly administered by the federal and state governments. Since the creation of the Medicaid
program in 1965, states have had broad discretion over a range of eligibility rules, program
benefits, and provider reimbursement, subject to compliance with federal minimum standards. As
a result, there has long been considerable variation in Medicaid eligibility standards and program
generosity across states. Even though prescription drug coverage was a state option, all states


                                                  4
covered pharmacological treatments prior to the ACA; after the ACA’s Medicaid expansion, new
enrollees must be offered so-called “benchmark” benefits, including prescription drug coverage.
The ACA provides additional federal financing to states for extending Medicaid coverage to non-
elderly adults earning less than 138 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL), in hope of
standardizing Medicaid coverage across states. The expansion decision was later delegated to
states, and as of January 1, 2017 31 states plus Washington DC have implemented the ACA
Medicaid expansion, while the remaining 19 states have not.

       Provisions of the ACA have reduced uninsurance substantially, with the largest gains in
insurance coverage occurring subsequent to the 2014 Medicaid expansions and the creation of
health insurance Marketplaces with income-based premium tax credits. Multiple experimental and
quasi-experimental studies have demonstrated that health insurance increases the use of medical
care, including prescription drug use. The vast quasi-experimental evidence from Medicare Part D
implementation suggests that health insurance drug coverage reduced out-of-pocket (OOP)
spending and led to higher prescription drug use among the elderly (Kaestner & Khan, 2012;
Ketcham & Simon, 2008; Lichtenberg & Sun, 2007) and improved their health status (Afendulis,
He, Zaslavsky, & Chernew, 2011; Ayyagari & Shane, 2015; Kaestner, Long, & Alexander, 2014).
There is also evidence that prescription medications for chronic conditions such as high cholesterol
and diabetes can reduce the use of more expensive forms of health care. Using inpatient discharge
data from Florida, Borrescio-Higa (2015) finds that lower prescription medication costs as a result
of Walmart’s $4 Prescription Drug Program in 2006 led to higher utilization of anti-hypertensive
drugs and resulted in fewer hospitalizations among those between the ages of 45 and 64.

       Yet, this previous literature on the elderly and the near-elderly does not provide direct
evidence from which to draw inferences about the non-elderly adult population gaining Medicaid
coverage under the ACA. One concern is that provider acceptance of Medicaid is lower than that
of Medicare (Decker, 2012) and access to physicians is needed for obtaining prescriptions. A few
prior studies estimate the impact of Medicaid on prescribed medications. The Oregon Health
Insurance Experiment finds that in the first year, Medicaid coverage increased the likelihood of
using prescription medications by 8.8 percentage points among previously uninsured, low-income
adults (Damiano, Bentler, Momany, Park, & Robinson, 2013). Using a difference-in-difference




                                                 5
study design, Sommers et al. (2016) estimate a 10-percent reduction in low-income adults
reporting skipping prescribed medication in Kentucky and Arkansas following Medicaid
expansions under the ACA, relative to non-expansion Texas. In addition, two recent studies have
explored the prescription drug utilization implications of the ACA Medicaid expansions in
particular. (Mulcahy, Eibner, & Finegold, 2016) use prescription transaction data to longitudinally
follow a sample of non-elderly adults who reported any prescription drug use during January 2012.
They find that adults who gained Medicaid in 2014 increased their prescription drug use by 79
percent. However, their sample was limited to those already using prescription drugs, nearly two-
thirds of whom reported chronic health conditions such as diabetes, asthma, and breast cancer.
This indicates that their study focused on a population with much higher prevalence of chronic
disease than the overall population of adults potentially gaining coverage through the ACA
Medicaid expansions (Decker, Kenney, & Long, 2014). More importantly, their sampling design
does not allow them to consider the effects on those who did not use prescription medications prior
to the expansions. The second study, by Wen and colleagues (2016), examines aggregate Medicaid
medication use as reported in the CMS State Drug Utilization Database (SDUD) through 2014.
They find a significant increase in the number of prescriptions per enrollee following expansion,
but no significant change in total spending. Notably, their study does not examine heterogeneity
in effects by drug class, across payer types other than Medicaid, or by sub-state geographical units.

       Our paper builds on prior literature in several important ways. We use a rich national
dataset of pharmaceutical claims that allows us to produce a comprehensive estimate of the impact
of the ACA Medicaid expansions on aggregate prescription drug utilization through early 2015.
More importantly, we are also able to describe the heterogeneous policy impacts of the Medicaid
expansion across drug classes and geographic areas that vary by baseline coverage rates and
population demographics.

       We examine the effect of these state Medicaid coverage changes on prescription drug
utilization using a quasi-experimental study design. We exploit variation in adoption of the ACA
Medicaid reform across states to compare Medicaid prescriptions drug use in treated states relative
to comparison states, both before and after the policy changes. We also explore heterogeneity in
response across geographical areas that differ by uninsured rates prior to the policy change. This




                                                 6
approach has been used previously in other settings to evaluate, for instance, the effect of Medicare
on health care spending (Finkelstein, 2007), the effect of health care reform in Massachusetts on
hospitalization (Miller, 2012), and the effect of the ACA on insurance coverage (Courtemanche et
al., 2016). In the sections that follow, we discuss our data sources, empirical methods, and results.
The estimates from this study, using recently available data, are applicable to the ongoing health
policy debates surrounding the effects of the ACA; they are especially relevant, moreover, for
understanding the implications of the Medicaid coverage expansions for health care use on the part
of low-income Americans.



       3. Data

        Our main source of data on Medicaid prescription drug utilization is a large, nationally
representative database of prescriptions dispensed from January 2013 through March 2015 at both
retail and mail-order pharmacies. This proprietary database captures over 80 percent of all
transactions in the US; the database also contains weights that are designed to provide estimates
of 100 percent of US retail and mail order pharmacy transactions. The database records the date
the prescription was filled, the payer, geographical identifiers, and Uniform System of
Classification (USC) product codes. We obtained prescription counts aggregated by unit of
geography (all states and DC, as well as data from the 917 Core Based Statistical Area (CBSAs) in
the US),1 time (quarterly, from Q1 2013 through Q1 2015), drug class (total, as well as by 9
classes), and payer type.

        A key advantage of these data is that they allow us to produce timely estimates of the
ongoing Medicaid policy reforms on prescription drug utilization and at the sub-state level. Other
rich data sources such as the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) Household Component
are only available after a considerable time lag. Meanwhile, CMS totals of state-by-year Medicaid
prescription counts in the SDUD lack information on other sources of payment, thus preventing


1 We use Core Based Statistical Area (CBSA) as our market definition because this is the smallest geographic unit
available to us. CBSAs are geographic aggregations produced by the US Office of Management and Budget (OMB);
they consist of groupings of geographic areas with at least 10,000 population and are associated with an urban core.
These areas are clusters of adjacent counties with social and economic integration. Approximately 94 percent of the
total US population lives within CBSAs.



                                                         7
any direct comparison to other payment sources for placebo or crowd-out hypothesis testing; these
totals also lack sub-state data for investigating heterogeneity by smaller area characteristics. The
administrative database we use also circumvents the small sample problems, as well as the recall
and reporting issues associated with household surveys such as the MEPS. Our data include both
fee-for-service Medicaid and Medicaid managed-care claims.

        An important disadvantage of our dataset is that it does not contain the patient-level
information on demographic and socioeconomic characteristics that would allow us to estimate
specifications separately by age, gender, or other important subgroupings of individuals. To
control for changes in the economic climate that may independently affect state Medicaid rolls,
we merge the prescription claims data with state and CBSA-level unemployment rates from the
Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS). 2 We control for
possible changes in population by dividing total counts of prescriptions by Census Bureau state
and county annual non-elderly adult population estimates.3 We also incorporate information on
uninsurance rates and racial/ethnic composition of the local markets using estimates produced by
the Census Bureau.4 The resulting dataset is a balanced panel of 51 states (including Washington,
DC) observed for a total of 9 quarters (459 =51*9 total cells), and a balanced panel of 781 CBSAs
that do not cross state lines (we drop 143 that do) for a total of 7,029 (=781*9) cells.



       4. Methods

        Our main empirical strategy uses a difference-in-difference method to compare
prescription drug utilization in all expansion states to non-expansion states (first difference) before
and after the expansions (second difference). In a specification check, following Wherry and Miller



2 To obtain the unemployment rate in a CBSA, we take the average of the unemployment rates for all the counties
within a CBSA. County-level unemployment rates come from BLS LAUS, and the listings of counties within CBSAs
come from the Mable Geographic Correspondence Engine (http://mcdc.missouri.edu/websas/geocorr12.html).
3 We obtain these annual county resident population estimates by year from
https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/2015/demo/popest/counties-total.html
4 We obtain county-level 2013 uninsured rates for non-elderly adults at or below 138 percent FPL from the Census

Bureau’s Small Area Health Insurance Estimates (SAHIE) program. We obtain 2013 county-level racial/ethnic
composition data from the Area Health Resource Files (AHRF).




                                                       8
(2016), we drop from our expansion group the five states (DC, DE, MA, NY, and VT) that had the
largest expansions of Medicaid to nonelderly adults prior to 2014.

         Our main outcome of interest is medication utilization under Medicaid, defined as the total
number of Medicaid prescription drugs dispensed (new and refills, all therapeutic classes) where
Medicaid (including both FFS and managed care) is recorded as the payer. We also examine total
prescriptions dispensed for other payer categories. Our data are aggregated to state and CBSA
levels, by quarter. We generate per-100 population utilization rates by dividing the total number
of prescriptions by Census Bureau estimates of the non-elderly adult population measured in 100s.
The identifying variation in our main analysis comes from cross-state differences in expansion
decisions. Our baseline model for the effect of the ACA Medicaid expansions is specified as:

𝑌𝑠𝑡 = 𝛼 + 𝛽𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑥𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑡 + 𝜕𝑈𝐸𝑠𝑡 + 𝜏𝑡 + 𝜗𝑠 + 𝜀𝑠𝑡                                (1)

         The dependent variable is the natural logarithm (ln) of prescriptions per 100 non-elderly
adult population in the state, with 𝑠 indexing state and 𝑡 indexing each quarter in the data,
respectively. The DD coefficient, β, measures the change in Medicaid scripts in expansion states
net of the change in non-expansion states. While most states implemented the Medicaid eligibility
changes beginning January 2014, Indiana, Michigan, New Hampshire, and Pennsylvania expanded
later in 2014 or 2015. To account for this staggered timeline, the DD interaction term,
𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑥𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑡 , turns on during the quarter of expansion relevant for that particular state. The
model includes state fixed effects to account for time-invariant state-specific differences in
prescription drug use and time dummies for each quarter and year in the data to capture national
time trends. We use state quarterly unemployment rates (UE) to control for changes in economic
conditions that may independently influence drug utilization patterns. 5 The model is estimated
using ordinary least squares, and throughout we report standard errors clustered at the state level
to account for correlated error terms across states over time (Bertrand, Duflo, & Mullainathan,
2004).




5 We also estimate our models without including the unemployment rate as a covariate and find they do not materially
alter our results.



                                                         9
        Identification in the difference-in-differences model is based on the assumption of parallel
trends – that absent the 2014 Medicaid expansion, trends in outcomes would not have differed
significantly across the expansion and non-expansion states. While this assumption is not directly
testable, we compare trends in Medicaid prescriptions across the treatment and comparison states
prior to the policy change; this comparison offers support for our identifying approach. Because
we have a limited number of quarters of data prior to the policy change, we also examine Medicare
prescription counts as a placebo test; if we were to find similar effects in Medicare as in Medicaid,
we would have cause to suspect that our assumptions are not valid.



       5. Results

        In Figure 1, we plot unadjusted time trends for total per-capita (we normalize by the number
of non-elderly adults in the state) prescriptions paid at the state level by Medicaid, Medicare,
private insurance plans, or through cash and assistance programs available to the uninsured during
the study period; we plot these trends separately for the expansion and non-expansion states. The
red and black lines represent ACA Medicaid-expansion states and non-expansion states,
respectively.6 The first vertical line in blue denotes the beginning of the ACA’s first open
enrollment period in the fourth quarter of 2013; the second denotes the implementation of the ACA
Medicaid expansions in the first quarter of 2014.




6 Four states (i.e., IN, MI, NH and PA) are omitted from the graphs because they expanded after January 2014. They
are, however, included in the regressions that allow for more flexibility in specifying the Medicaid expansion date.
The graphs do not change in any meaningful manner when these states are included in the expansion category.

       Figure 1 reveals that prior to the expansions in early 2014, Medicaid prescriptions followed
similar trends across the two groups of states. There is a slight upward trend in Medicaid
prescriptions coinciding with the start of the ACA open enrollment period in 2013Q4, but this
trend is visible in both expansion and non-expansion states. This is consistent with increases in
Medicaid coverage during the open enrollment period found in prior research (Carman, Eibner, &
Paddock, 2015; Sommers et al., 2015; Sommers et al., 2014). There is a clear divergence in trends
after the first quarter of 2014, when the expansion states experience a very noticeable increase in
Medicaid within 6 months of the policy change, relative to the non-expansion states. The
remaining panels in Figure 1 display trends in prescriptions that were paid by Medicare, private
insurance, and were uninsured (cash and assistance programs). These panels demonstrate that
trends in aggregate prescriptions did not differ appreciably across the two groups of states for the
non-Medicaid payment categories.

and unadjusted sample means of the dependent variable. The dependent variable is the natural
logarithm of Medicaid prescriptions per 100 population. The pattern in the first panel of figure 1
is reflected in the DD estimate for Medicaid prescriptions in column (1) of Table 1. The estimate
demonstrates that Medicaid expansions in 2014 led to sizable and statistically significant increases
in Medicaid prescription drug use. The coefficient represents a 19-percent increase in Medicaid
prescription utilization relative to non-expansion states for all drug classes.         Column (2)
demonstrates that the estimate increases to 23 percent when we drop the five states that provided
publicly subsidized coverage to adults at or below 100 percent of the FPL prior to 2014 (the District
of Columbia, Delaware, Massachusetts, New York, and Vermont).

        We next study whether specific drug classes were differentially affected by the expansion.
Prescription medications that treat acute medical conditions may respond differently to coverage
expansion than drugs used for chronic illnesses. One possible reason is that unlike medications for
chronic illnesses (e.g. anti-hyperlipidemic agents), acute medications that treat conditions
requiring immediate treatment are likely less price sensitive, and therefore may not respond



                                                      13
sharply to changes in coverage. Another reason for differences across drug classes is that the newly
eligible population’s health care needs may differ from those of the nation as a whole – in
particular, chronic conditions may be more common among low-income individuals qualifying for
Medicaid than among those with private insurance.

       Table 2 describes the impact on utilization of a range of medication classes. Our results
indicate that there were statistically significant increases in utilization across all drug classes,
but relatively larger effects for certain classes, particularly those relevant to common chronic
medical conditions. Medications used for treating diabetes accounted for the largest growth among
all the classes, with an increase of 24 percent; this effect was statistically different from the mean
effect on all the remaining classes combined. The use of cardiovascular medications (those for
high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and heart disease) increased by 21 percent, while the use of
contraceptives increased by 22 percent. Meanwhile, the use of respiratory/allergy medications,
antibiotics, and gastrointestinal medications, which are more commonly taken for shorter -term
acute conditions than the other drug classes, increased less than overall drug spending, with growth
rates ranging from 16 to 17 percent.

       The larger increases in use of medications for chronic conditions such as diabetes detected
in our data are consistent with recent research that finds that diagnoses of chronic health conditions
have increased among low-income adults in states that have expanded Medicaid eligibility under
the ACA (Kaufman et al. 2015, Wherry and Miller 2016). Overall, this pattern of results suggests
that Medicaid expansion was particularly effective at increasing prescription drug utilization for
common and potentially costly chronic medical conditions, and that there may have been a
meaningful effect on access to contraceptive treatments, even though Medicaid family planning
waivers had existed prior to the ACA expansions.

         Our lack of finding a strong effect for HIV and Hepatitis C medications is likely due to two
factors. First, the existence of federally funded programs such as the Ryan White HIV/AIDS



                                                      15
Program (RWP) and the AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) already facilitated the use of
these medications for many patients prior to the expansion of Medicaid in 2014. Second, growth
in use of Hepatitis C medications may have been attenuated by limited access in several state
Medicaid programs (such as Indiana and Washington) due to cost concerns (New York Times,
2015; Pear, 2015).



      5.1. Robustness Checks

         To investigate the basis of support for the quasi-experimental study design, we examine
whether there were differential pre-trends in Medicaid prescription drug utilization across states
based on treatment status. We do this by using data from 2013Q1-2013Q4 and the following
empirical specification:

𝑌𝑠𝑡 = 𝛼 + 𝛾𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑡 + 𝛿𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 𝑥𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑡 + 𝛽𝑈𝑛𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑜𝑦𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 + 𝜏𝑡 + 𝜗𝑠 + 𝜀𝑠𝑡
(2)

In the above equation, 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑑 stands for a quarterly linear time trend, 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 indicates the
states that expanded after the last time period in this regression (2013 Q4), and the interaction term
𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑥𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑑 identifies differential trends between expansion and non-expansion states
during the pre-expansion period. Also included in the regression are the trend main term, the
unemployment rate, and state and month-by-year fixed effects.
         In addition, to evaluate the parallel trends assumption, we use an event study approach by
interacting the expansion dummy with each year-quarter in the data from 2013-2015. For the
parallel trends assumption to be valid, we would expect the interaction terms in 2013 to be
statistically indistinguishable from 0. The point estimates in column 1 of Table 3 are indeed quite
small in magnitude (and not statistically significant) relative to the DD estimate in Table 2,
indicating that no significant differential trends appear in the pre-expansion period that would
otherwise threaten our identification strategy. Column 2 displays the event study estimates; there
is no evidence of differential trends across the states that expanded and those that did not, prior to
the policy change. Starting with 2014 Q2, the estimates are positive, statistically significant, and
higher in magnitude every consecutive quarter, which implies that the impact of coverage has



                                                 16
amplified over time, consistent with other recent evidence on the ACA’s Medicaid expansion
(Sommers, Blendon, & Orav, 2016). This pattern in the data also mirrors the staggered timeline of
state expansion decisions. In every successive quarter after the first six months of the policy
change, the effect on aggregate Medicaid prescriptions exceeds the mean effect of 19 percent
shown in Table 2. These changes over the 15-month period following the onset of the Medicaid
expansions may also reflect longer-term effects on access and utilization. The evolution of the
ACA’s impact on Medicaid prescriptions during this 15-month period likely reflects higher use of
medications due to pent-up demand for health care; it also suggests longer-term effects on
coverage, access, and utilization that occur through diffusion of information about the policy
changes.


       We test the sensitivity of our results to the addition of group-specific linear time trends.
These results are presented in column (3) of Table 3. This specification addresses the possibility
that expansion and non-expansion states may follow different, unobserved time trends correlated
with Medicaid expansion decisions. We detect no difference in the estimates in column (3)
compared to the baseline model, emphasizing that underlying group-specific trends are not
responsible for the observed effect on Medicaid prescriptions.

        One mechanism through which Medicaid prescriptions may increase following expansions
is private insurance crowd-out. To explore this mechanism, we investigate the impact of the
expansions on prescriptions from private insurance, cash and other assistance programs available


                                                     18
to the uninsured. This analysis allows us to consider whether Medicaid prescriptions increased
simply through a substitution of payment source from private or uninsured to Medicaid, or due to
a net increase in utilization. Table 4 below contains these results. The statistically insignificant
point estimate of -0.01 in column (1) corresponds to a 1-percent decrease in prescriptions from
cash and assistance programs; this magnitude is nearly one-twentieth of the statistically significant
effect on Medicaid prescriptions. Similarly, in the case of private insurance, the statistically
insignificant estimated coefficient in column (2) implies a reduction of 1 percent, which is almost
one twentieth smaller in magnitude than the Medicaid effect. The point estimates for privately
insured and uninsured prescriptions are negative but statistically indistinguishable from zero. The
magnitudes of these coefficients suggest at most an effect 1.5-5 percent as large as the Medicaid
effect, indicating little to no crowd-out of prescription drug use from other sources to Medicaid.

       As a falsification test, we next consider changes in Medicare prescription utilization. We
hypothesize that the Medicaid eligibility changes for the non-elderly adult population under the
ACA are unlikely to affect prescription drug use in the Medicare program. Consistent with our
hypothesis, the result from this analysis, which we report in column (3) of Table 4, suggests that
there was no effect on Medicare prescriptions. In Appendix Table 2, we present event study
estimates for aggregate prescriptions paid by non-Medicaid sources; taken together, these results
provide support for the validity of the difference-in-difference specification. The dependent
variable is the natural logarithm of uninsured, privately insured or Medicare prescriptions per 100
population. These results confirm our findings that prescriptions from non-Medicaid payment
sources did not respond significantly to the ACA Medicaid expansions, and taken together, these
results provide support for the validity of the main difference-in-difference specification.

    5.2. Heterogeneous Effects at the Market Level

        The analysis with aggregated state data presented so far indicates that Medicaid
prescription drug utilization increased significantly in response to the ACA Medicaid expansions.
We next expand on this reduced form analysis to examine whether these results are isolated in
geographical areas with higher treatment intensity. Here we consider the response of prescriptions
paid by Medicaid to reductions in uninsurance that occurred after 2014. Using data aggregated to
the CBSA level, we explore whether the effects of Medicaid expansion on prescription drugs is
larger in CBSAs with higher pre-reform uninsurance levels (where we expect larger gains in
coverage), relative both to CBSAs with lower baseline (2013) uninsurance in expansion states and



                                                   20
to CBSAs with higher baseline uninsurance rates in non-expansion states. Courtemanche et al.
(2016), who examined the effects of the ACA Medicaid expansions on insurance status, conducted
a similar analysis using CBSAs as geographic units. The estimating equation is specified below:



𝑌𝑐𝑠𝑡 = 𝛼1 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑡 𝑥𝑃𝑐𝑡 𝑈𝑛𝑖𝑛𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑑 2013𝑐 𝑥𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 + 𝛼2 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑡 𝑥 𝑃𝑐𝑡 𝑈𝑛𝑖𝑛𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑑 2013𝑐 +

𝐶𝐵𝑆𝐴 𝐹𝐸 + 𝜀𝑠𝑡                                                                                     (3)



        The main coefficient of interest in the above equation is 𝛼1 , which represents the
differential change in Medicaid prescription use in CBSAs with high 2013 uninsurance rates
compared to those with low rates in expansion states, with non-expansion states as the DD control
group. We expect that there would be a greater increase in Medicaid prescription drugs in CBSAs
where the baseline fraction of uninsured population was larger, more so than in baseline-highly-
uninsured CBSAs in non-expansion states (i.e., 𝛼1 >0). The coefficient of interest in this regression
appears in panel A of Table 5, along with summary statistics of 2013 uninsurance rates. The
estimate for 𝛼1 in column (1) is consistent with our expectations and indicates that in the CBSA
where the uninsurance rate at baseline was one percentage point higher, the Medicaid expansion
increased Medicaid prescription utilization by 1 percent, relative to similar CBSAs in non-
expansion states. In other words, CBSAs with 2013 uninsurance rates that were one standard
deviation (9.33) below the median uninsurance rate experienced a 9.3-percent increase (1 percent
* 9.33) in aggregate Medicaid prescriptions post-ACA.7

        The ACA Medicaid expansions are also expected to reduce absolute differences in
insurance coverage related to race and ethnicity. Using the American Community Survey,
Buchmueller and colleagues (2016) document that in 2014, the largest declines in uninsurance



7
  One concern in examining this specification is whether the remaining CBSAs in the sample differ in ways that
introduce bias in our estimates. We re-estimate our baseline difference-in-difference model (equation 1) using this
sample, comparing CBSAs in expansion states to a group of comparison CBSAs in non-expansion states. The results
from this analysis are displayed in Appendix Table 5. While these estimates are smaller in magnitude, they are
similar in direction and precision, confirming our findings from the main specification.



                                                        21
occurred among Hispanics (7.1 percentage points) and blacks (5.1 percentage points), relative to
whites (3 percentage points). We exploit geographic variation in racial composition to examine
whether the impact on Medicaid prescriptions was comparatively larger in areas with greater
Hispanic and black populations. The estimating equation is:



       𝑌𝑐𝑠𝑡 = 𝛼1 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑡 𝑥𝑃𝑐𝑡 𝑀𝑖𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑦 2013𝑐 𝑥𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 +
𝛼2 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑡 𝑥 𝑃𝑐𝑡 𝑀𝑖𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑦 2013𝑐 + 𝛼3 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑡 𝑥𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 +
𝛼4 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑜 𝑛𝑠 𝑥 𝑃𝑐𝑡 𝑀𝑖𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑦 2013𝑐 + 𝜏𝑡 + 𝜗𝑠 + 𝛼5 𝑋𝑐𝑠𝑡 + 𝐶𝐵𝑆𝐴 𝐹𝐸 + 𝜀𝑠𝑡                (4)



        We report this result in panel B of Table 5. The coefficient on the interaction term
𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑡 𝑥𝑃𝑐𝑡 𝑀𝑖𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑦 2013𝑐 𝑥𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 of 0.003 indicates that the effect of the Medicaid
expansion on Medicaid prescription drug utilization was statistically significantly higher in areas
of expansion states with a greater share of Hispanic and black populations. More specifically,
Medicaid prescription volume increased by 0.3 percent more in expansion states compared to
states that did not expand, for every one-percentage-point increase in the minority population share
of a CBSA. A CBSA that is one standard deviation higher in percent minority thus experienced a
5.7 percent larger increase in Medicaid prescription utilization. This suggests that the Medicaid
expansions reduced racial disparities in access to medications.

       Appendix Tables 3 & 4 present results from a specification where we replace the post-2014
indicator with a dummy for each quarter to investigate pre-policy trends for these two
heterogeneity analyses through an event study. Appendix Table 3 shows small and statistically
insignificant coefficients for the time periods before Medicaid expansion, which is reassuring. The
results also indicate that the post expansion effects appear strongest in the 3 rd quarter of 2014,
although statistically significant and positive effects also appear later in column 2. The results of
Appendix Table 4 are less convincing; although most coefficients are statistically insignificant in
this table, they are all negative before the expansion and positive after the expansion.

         Taking the results from Tables 5 and Appendix Tables 3 and 4 together suggest that the
growth in utilization of Medicaid prescription medications was more pronounced in geographical
areas where the “bite” of the Medicaid expansions was larger because baseline uninsurance was
higher, and in areas where minority populations were more concentrated. While the results from
the event study method in Appendix Table 4 are broadly consistent with the results from the DDD
approach in Table 5 for the baseline uninsurance study, the corresponding story is not as strong
for the percent minority study.



        6. Discussion

         Using a national administrative dataset of prescription drug utilization, we find that in the
15 months following the ACA Medicaid expansions, non-elderly adult Medicaid prescriptions per
100 population increased by 19 percent. We consider next what these results suggest is the increase
in use of prescription medications among the newly enrolled population. Multiplying the quarterly
average of 59.15 Medicaid prescriptions per 100 non-elderly adult population in our data (from
taking the inverse natural log of 4.08 in Table 1) by the total pre-ACA non-elderly adult population
in the expansion states (114 million, based on the 2013 American Community Survey) translates
the 19 percent increase to 12.8 million additional prescriptions (0.19 *59.15* 114 million/100).
This is an estimate of the ACA Medicaid expansion induced increase in prescriptions per quarter,
assuming no population growth.8 In order to back out how many new prescriptions this represents
per newly eligible beneficiary, we divide this 12.8 million by an estimate of the number of
individuals who gained Medicaid coverage through ACA, which comes from a DD research design
that compares expansion to non-expansion states. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
(CMS) official enrollment reports through the end of March 2015 indicate that the net enrollment
in Medicaid/CHIP in expansion states was 10.5 million more compared to 2013 (CMS 2015),
while the similar figure for non-expansion states was 1.8 million, yielding an unadjusted
difference-in-differences estimate of 8.7 million newly-enrolled individuals by the end of our study



8
  This estimate is expected to be smaller than the total realized increase in prescriptions under Medicaid from 2013
to 2014, as this estimate does not capture the “welcome mat” effect and changes in prescription use among other
Medicaid populations that may be co-occurring.



                                                         24
period, though this number may include as many as 1 million children (Frean, Gruber, and
Sommers 2016). Subtracting out children yields 7.7 million newly-enrolled adults. Therefore, the
“treatment on the treated” estimate of the effect of Medicaid expansion on prescription drug use
equates to 1.7 (12.8 million /7.7 million) prescriptions per enrollee per quarter or 6.6 prescriptions
per enrollee per year. As a comparison, Mulcahy et al. (2016) find that previously uninsured adult
medication users who gained Medicaid had 13.3 more prescription fills in 2014 compared to 2013.
This was higher (17.8 more prescriptions) for those with chronic conditions, and lower (10.9
additional fills) among the healthier Medicaid enrollees in their sample (aged 20-61). Our results
imply a smaller effect as expected, but a similar order of magnitude as their healthier-population
estimate.

       Our sub-group analysis by drug-class suggests that the increase in utilization was higher
for medications used in treating chronic conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease,
and for psychotherapeutic medications. Given that lack of appropriate management of chronic
diseases through medications is one of the plausible mechanisms for coverage affecting long-term
health (Tamblyn et al., 2001), and that survey-based analyses of the Medicaid expansion have
shown increased rates of care for chronic conditions (Sommers, Blendon, Orav, et al., 2016), these
findings are encouraging in terms of potential health outcomes.

       One of the limitations of this study is that our data does not observe individuals
longitudinally, so it cannot capture the effect of the expansions on those who were previously
uninsured. However, in additional analysis using pre-expansion uninsurance rates at the sub-state
level, we examine the effect of change in insurance coverage on utilization. The lack of individual-
level data also precludes us from estimating directly the per-person changes in utilization, though
our back-of-the-envelope calculations indicate that our estimates correspond to about one more
prescription fill every two months per newly enrolled Medicaid beneficiary.

       Using recently available prescription drug data at the national level, this study provides an
important set of results in the context of the ACA. Our findings suggest a significant and positive
impact of the ACA Medicaid expansions on the use of prescription drugs in expansion states,
which is consistent with the impact of insurance coverage expansions on improving access to care.
This study contributes to the growing literature on the impact of the health reform under the ACA.



                                                 25
Our findings provide important new evidence on the role of Medicaid in the health care safety net,
and the first order impact of the ACA Medicaid expansions for improvements in access to and
utilization of medical care in states that expanded Medicaid. Future research should consider
whether this policy-induced boost in prescription drug utilization is reflected in subsequent health
impacts and downstream effects on use of other types of medical care.

Notes: This table shows the state classification for Medicaid eligibility used in this paper. These are
mutually exclusive lists of states. We first examine states in the first two columns together, as expansion
states. Later specifications separate expansion states into those with and without substantial pre-2014
Medicaid expansions. Source: Reproduced from Table A1 of Simon, Soni and Cawley (forthcoming).



                                                    30
1 The Medicaid expansion became effective in January 2014 for all expansion states as of this writing,
except for the following: Alaska (September 2015), Indiana (February 2015), Louisiana (July 2016),
Michigan (April 2014), Montana (January 2016), New Hampshire (August 2014), and Pennsylvania
(January 2015). Since this table records only expansion status as of January 2014, some of the states that
later expanded Medicaid appear in the control group column. However, our regressions categorize those
states that expanded after January 2014 but before March 2015 as expansion states only in the quarters after
the expansion was implemented. The remaining notes to this Table explain the categorization of expansion
states into columns 1 or 2.
2 Since 2000, Arizona offered Medicaid-equivalent benefits to childless adults with income below 100
percent FPL through a Section 1115 waiver program. However, the state closed the program to new
enrollees in July 2011 (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2016) and consequently experienced a significa nt
expansion for childless adults in 2014.
3 Arkansas operated a limited-benefit premium-assistance program for childless adults who worked for
small, uninsured employers (ARHealthNetworks waiver) (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2016) prior to the
ACA.
4 Although California expanded Medicaid for childless adults to some degree as part of the state’s 1115
“Bridge to Reform” waiver, this was not available in all counties and was not full Medi-Cal benefits
(http://kff.org/health-reform/fact-sheet/the-california-health-care-landscape/).
5 Colorado had only very limited eligibility before 2014. Adults with income up to 10 percent FPL were
eligible for Medicaid as of May 2012, and enrollment was capped to 10,000 adults (Kaiser Family
Foundation, 2016).
6 Under the IowaCare program, childless adults with income below 200 percent FPL were eligible for
public health insurance since 2005. However, IowaCare provided limited services in a limited network, and
so low-income adults in Iowa effectively underwent substantial expansion in coverage in 2014 (Damiano
et al., 2013).
7 California, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Minnesota, New Jersey, and Washington elected to enact
the ACA Medicaid expansion in 2010 to 2011. However, New Jersey’s early expansion only extended to
23 percent FPL while the other five states extended at least until 50 percent FPL (Sommers, Buchmueller,
Decker, Carey, & Kronick, 2013). Also, Washington’s early expansion was limited to prior state plan
enrollees (Sommers et al., 2013). Hence we treat New Jersey and Washington as full 2014 expansion states.
8 In 2008, Oregon enacted a small Medicaid expansion for low-income adults through lottery drawings
from a waitlist. However, less than one-third of the 90,000 people on the waitlist were selected to apply for
Medicaid in 2008 (Baicker et al., 2013) and so the 2014 expansion represented a significant increase in
eligibility for low-income adults.
9 In Hawaii, childless adults with incomes up to 100 percent FPL were eligible for the state’s QUEST
Medicaid managed care waiver program (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2016).
10 Although Wisconsin was not an ACA expansion state, the state received federal approval to offer
Medicaid to childless adults below 100 percent FPL through the BadgerCare program as of 2009 (Gates &
Rudowitz, 2014).
11 In Delaware, childless adults with incomes up to 100 percent FPL were eligible for Medicaid benefits
through the Diamond State Health Plan waiver (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2016).
12 Massachusetts implemented reforms to expand insurance coverage to low-income adults in 2006 (Kaiser
Family Foundation, 2016).
13 In New York, childless adults up to 78 percent FPL were eligible for the Medicaid (Home Relief) waiver
program and childless adults up to 100 percent FPL were eligible for the Family Health Plus waiver program
(Heberlein, Brooks, Guyer, Artiga, & Stephens, 2011).
14 In Vermont, childless adults up to 150 percent FPL were eligible for Medicaid-equivalent coverage
through the Vermont Health Access Plan waiver program (Heberlein et al., 2011).
