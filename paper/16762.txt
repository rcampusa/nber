                                             ABSTRACT

We examine the value of terroir, which refers to the special characteristics of a place that impart unique
qualities to the wine produced. We do this by conducting a hedonic analysis of vineyard sales in the
Willamette Valley of Oregon to ascertain whether site attributes, such as slope, aspect, elevation, and
soil types, or designated appellations are more important determinants of price. We find that prices
are strongly determined by sub-AVA appellation designations, but not by specific site attributes. These
results indicate that the concept of terroir matters economically, although the reality of terroir – as
proxied for by locational attributes – is not significant.

               The Value of Terroir: Hedonic Estimation of Vineyard Sale Prices

                       Robin Cross, Andrew J. Plantinga, and Robert N. Stavins*


        Wine producers and enthusiasts use the term “terroir,” from the French terre (meaning
land), to refer to the special characteristics of a place that impart unique qualities to the wine
produced. The Appellation d’Origine Contrôlée (AOC) system in France, and similar systems
adopted in other major wine-producing countries, are based upon the geographic location of
grape production, and are therefore predicated on this notion of terroir. Under a parallel U.S.
system, production regions are designated as American Viticultural Areas (AVAs), with finer
geographical designations known as sub-AVAs. Such designations allow wineries to identify the
geographical origin of the grapes used in producing their wines, and -- equally important – seek
to prevent producers outside the AVA from making false claims about the nature and origin of
their wines.

        What is the value of terroir in the American context? Does the “reality of terroir” – the
location-specific geology and geography (including climate) – predominate in determining the
quality of wine? Does the “concept of terroir” – the location within an officially named
appellation – impart additional value to grapes and wine? More to the point, does location
within such an appellation impart additional value to vineyards?

        The central question we address is whether measureable site attributes – such as slope,
aspect, elevation, and soil type – or appellation designations are more important determinants of
vineyard prices.1 We do this by conducting a hedonic price analysis to investigate sales of
vineyards in Oregon’s Willamette Valley, one of the most important wine-producing regions in
the United States.2

        How should site attributes and sub-AVA designations influence vineyard prices? If site
attributes significantly affect wine quality and if consumers are able to discriminate such quality,
then vineyard prices would depend on site attributes alone,3 and AVA designations would be

  The notion of terroir sometimes extends beyond natural endowments to encompass the history and culture of a
place, but we use a narrower and more common definition of terroir focused on physical attributes of the location
(Gergaud and Ginsburgh 2010).
2
 The Willamette Valley is designated as an AVA. Within the valley, there are six sub-AVAs: Chehalem
Mountains, Yamhill-Carlton District, Ribbon Ridge, Dundee Hills, McMinnville, and Eola-Amity Hills.
3
 Wine quality is affected not only by site attributes, but also by the quality of growing stock, as well as vineyard
management, and the skills and resources of the winemaker.


                                                         3
redundant. Alternatively, consumers might not be able to discriminate among wines perfectly
and might use AVA designations as signals of average quality of wines from respective areas,
and/or might derive utility directly from drinking wines which they know to be of particular
pedigree. In this intermediate case, site attributes and AVA designations would influence
vineyard prices, with the variables for site attributes measuring how producers value intra-AVA
differences in vineyard characteristics. Presumably, producers attach premiums to site attributes
that enhance wine quality, provided that consumers can perceive and are willing to pay for such
quality differences.

       What if, at the extreme, variation in vineyard prices is explained completely by AVA
designations (that is, site attributes are irrelevant)? This would indicate that terroir matters
economically – as a concept, though not as a fundamental reality. Producers might recognize the
value of the AVA designation because they know that consumers will pay more for the
experience of drinking wine from designated areas.4 But the fact that site attributes are
unimportant suggests that consumers cannot discern quality differences. Any appreciation they
might express for an area’s terroir would essentially be founded on reputation, not reality.

        In the next part of the paper, we discuss some related research from the wine economics
literature. Then, in section 2, we describe the data we employ, as well as our estimation strategy.
In section 3, we present our results plus some robustness checks. Section 4 concludes.

                                           1. Previous Literature

        Our analysis is related to and builds upon previous work by others. In one recent study,
Gergaud and Ginsburgh (2008) find that site attributes of vineyards in the Haut-Médoc
appellation in Bordeaux have no effect on wine prices or ratings, after controlling for producer
differences in wine-making technology. Our study builds on this work by examining – in
addition to site characteristics – the value assigned to appellation designations. Further, we are
able to measure site characteristics more precisely than Gergaud and Ginsburgh by using GIS-
based information to develop highly detailed physiographic profiles of each parcel.

        In another recent study, Ashenfelter and Storchmann (2010) investigate the effects of
climate on vineyards in the Mosel Valley. As in our study, the authors have fine-scale data on
vineyard characteristics. They find that site characteristics – including slope, orientation, soil
types, soil depth, and altitude – as well as solar radiation are significant determinants of vineyard
quality. We do not include climate variables in our analysis, because of trivial variation in
rainfall, humidity, and wind across the relevant portion of the Willamette Valley, but our site
attribute variables proxy for the amount of solar radiation received by vineyards.

        An important similarity and difference with our study concerns respective dependent
variables. Gergaud and Ginsburgh (2008) and Ashenfelter and Storchmann (2010) employ
measures that are based on wine prices or ratings. Our dependent variable, vineyard sale prices,
is preferable in the context of our investigation into the value of terroir, because it avoids

4
  Alternatively, buyers might be less informed than sellers about how vineyard attributes affect wine quality, and,
therefore, use the AVA designation as a signal of quality. Or producers may bid up the value of vineyards located in
designated appellations because there is prestige associated with owning vineyards in such areas.

                                                         4
potentially confounding influences on our results of non-vineyards inputs into wine production
(such as labor and wine-making techniques). Provided that these inputs are variable and
reproducible, profit-maximization implies that the optimal levels of these inputs are implicit
functions of fixed and non-reproducible vineyard attributes and input and output prices that are
constant across the vineyards in our sample. As such, we can estimate the implicit prices of
vineyard attributes using a simple hedonic equation for vineyard sales.

        As we suggest above, if consumers have limited information about specific vineyards or
are unable to judge differences in quality among wines, then they might use appellation
designations as signals of quality of wines from respective areas. In fact, the results of many
blind taste tests indicate that wine consumers have very limited ability to distinguish intrinsic
qualities of wine (sweetness, acidity, tannins, etc.), and instead judge quality by relying on
extrinsic signals, such as price, origin, and wine-maker reputation.

        For example, Veale and Quester (2008) found that tasters’ perceptions of quality were
strongly correlated with price and country of origin, but not with intrinsic qualities related to
taste. Similarly, Goldstein et al. (2008) found that when price information is withheld, non-
expert tasters show no preference for more expensive wines and even show a slight preference
for less expensive wines.5

                                    2. Data and Estimation Strategy

2.1 Dependent Variable for Hedonic Estimation: Vineyard Value

       In order to investigate the relationship between vineyard sales prices, site attributes, and
appellation designation, we employ a new data set on vineyard sales provided by Northwest
Farm Credit Services, a lending institution specializing in agriculture. The database includes the
universe of 104 sales between 1995 and 2007 of properties in the Willamette Valley that
included vineyards and vinelands.6 In addition to total sale price, size, and location of property,
sales records include an appraiser’s estimate of the value of non-vineyard assets, such as
dwellings and other buildings, winery equipment, and non-vineyard land. We subtract the
estimated values of these non-vineyard assets from the total sale price to obtain the value of
vineyards in each sale.

       A remaining complication is that vineyards differ in terms of grape varietals planted,
whether rootstocks are resistant to phylloxera, and type of trellis system in place. This
heterogeneity accounts for some portion of the difference in sale prices. Because terroir relates

5
  Tasters with some wine training demonstrated a non-negative relationship between price and enjoyment.
However, Hodgson (2009a, 2009b) has found that even wine judges have difficulty consistently evaluating wines.
Using data on over 4,000 wines entered in 13 competitions, Hodgson (2009a) found that the probability of winning a
Gold medal in one competition was statistically independent of winning a Gold medal in another competition.
Further, Hodgson (2009b) found that judges at the 2009 California State Fair commercial wine competition were
inconsistent in their evaluations.
6
  Vinelands are areas that can be developed for vineyards. We use the term “vineyards” to refer collectively to
vineyards and vinelands.


                                                        5
exclusively to non-transferable attributes of vineyards, such as soils, elevation, slope, and
climate, we also subtract from the vineyard value the appraiser’s estimate of the value of all
vineyard enhancements. This leaves us with the estimated price of bare land for vineyards.
After converting these values to 2007 dollars using the Consumer Price Index, and dividing by
the area of vineyards, we obtain the real per-acre vineyard value for each property, denoted
vinevalue. The log of this variable is the dependent variable in our hedonic model.

2.1 Vineyard Attributes

       The sales records from Northwest Farm Credit Services provide information about
average characteristics of vineyards included in each sale. We develop more precise measures,
using GIS-based information on slope, aspect, elevation, and soils. The location of each parcel is
determined from tax lot boundaries and matched to GIS maps of physiographic variables.7

        Parcels are divided into 10-meter pixels and each pixel is classified according to 14 slope,
16 aspect, 86 elevation, and 8 soil group categories. For example, slope categories are 2-4
degrees, 4-6 degrees, and so forth. Elevation categories are 150-159 feet, 160-169 feet, and so
on. Because the number of categories exceeds the number of observed sales, we combine them
following conventional wisdom about which vineyard attributes are most favorable or
unfavorable.8 We then compute the percentages of each parcel in each of these aggregated
categories, and use these as independent variables in our hedonic regressions. The definitions of
all variables are found in Table 1.

        As discussed above, the elevation, slope, and aspect variables determine the amount of
solar radiation received at each site and, thus, are proxies for one important component of
climate. We did not include additional controls for rainfall, humidity, and wind because these
factors exhibit little variation within the Willamette Valley.

        We conducted sensitivity analyses on the site attribute variables. Because there are other
reasonable ways to specify the categories discussed above, we explored alternative definitions,
and found that our results were not sensitive to these changes. Another issue with the site
attribute variables is that they are defined for the entire property, not only the vineyard portion of
the parcel. Unfortunately, we cannot refine these measures, because we do not know exactly

7
  The tax lot information was obtained from county tax assessors’ offices. Contour information was derived from
USGS National Elevation Dataset data at 10 and 30 meter scales (http://seamless.usgs.gov/ned1.php). Soil
information came from the USDA/NRCS Soil Data Mart (http://soildatamart.nrcs.usda.gov/).
8
  We define three elevation variables: best (250-450 feet), possible (200-250 feet, 450-650 feet), and too low or too
high (<200 feet, >650 feet), denoted bestelev, posselev, and lowhighelev, respectively. Vineyards that are too high
or too low face greater risk of frost and low temperatures that inhibit ripening. South-facing slopes are regarded as
preferable. We define the aspect variables as south (south), southeast or southwest (southew), east or west
(eastwest), and north (north). Jory-Nekiah and Willakenzie-Hazelair are considered the best soils for producing
pinot noir, and so we define bestsoil as the share of the parcel with either of these soils. The two other soil variables
are goodsoil (Amity-Dayton, Bellpine, Laurelwood, or Yamhill soils) and poorsoil (Willamette-Woodburn and other
soils). Finally, vineyards that are too flat (<2 degrees) tend to be poorly drained and those that are too steep (>12
degrees) are difficult to harvest. We define bestslope as the percentage of the parcel with slopes between 2 and 12
degrees and flatsteep as the residual.

where vineyards are located within parcels. Instead, we conduct two robustness tests, discussed
below, to explore whether our results are affected by this measurement error. For this purpose,
we construct a variable, denoted percentvine, measuring the percentage of the parcel in
vineyards.

        In addition to the site attribute variables, we construct a variable for the area of the
vineyards (vineacres) and indicator variables for the location of a parcel within a sub-AVA (eola
for Eola-Amity Hills, mcminnville for McMinnville, yamhill for Yamhill-Carlton, dundee for
Dundee Hills, chehalem for Chehalem Hills, and nosub if the parcel is outside these sub-AVAs).9
Parcels outside of sub-AVAs are demarcated as being in the Willamette Valley AVA. It is
important to acknowledge that, although the Willamette Valley AVA was established in 1984,
the sub-AVA designations were not officially adopted until 2005 and 2006. Prior to this time,
the areas that would later be designated as sub-AVAs were well recognized by wine producers,
and it was common practice to label the origin of wines using the same geographical terms.10
We construct a variable, saledate, equal to 1 if the sale occurred after the respective sub-AVA
designation became official and 0 otherwise, and use it to test for changes in the effects of the
sub-AVA designation.

        Finally, for use in robustness tests, we computed the straight-line distance from each
parcel to the nearest sub-AVA. This variable, denoted distancesub, equals 0 if the parcel is
within a sub-AVA.

        Summary statistics for all variables are presented in Table 2. The average unlogged price
for vineyards (vinevalue) is about $10,000 per acre, with prices ranging from $2,500 to $42,000
per acre. Given that our sample includes only parcels with vineyards, we must have within-
sample variation in site attributes if we hope to measure effects of terroir. The statistics in Table
2 reveal that 31.3, 47.0, 34.5, and 87.3 percent of the land within our sample of parcels,
respectively, faces directly south, and has the best elevation, soils, and slopes. At the other
extreme, 16.8, 15.8, 35.0, and 12.7 percent of the land, respectively, is in the least desirable
categories for aspect, elevation, soils, and slope. With the possible exception of the slope
variable, these statistics suggest that our sample reflects a significant range of physiographic
conditions.

                                       3. Results and Robustness Tests

        For our basic model, we regress the log of vinevalue on vineacres, the square of
vineacres (sqvineacres), site attributes, sub-AVA designations, and a constant term. The omitted
variables are lowhighelev, north, poorsoil, flatsteep, and nosub. Because these are the least
desirable categories, we expect the coefficients on the included site attribute and sub-AVA
variables to be positive.

       The results, in Table 3, reveal that most of the estimated coefficients on the site attribute
variables are positive, but none are significantly different from zero. The smallest p-value is

9
    We have no observations of sales within the Ribbon Ridge sub-AVA.
10
     For example, in 2004, Archery Summit labeled their Red Hills Estate wine “Dundee Hills Pinot Noir.”

                                                          7
0.311, and none of the estimates are even marginally significant.11 In contrast, four of the five
estimated coefficients for sub-AVA are significantly different from zero at better than the 1%
level. Parcels within the Eola-Amity Hills, Yamhill-Carlton, Dundee Hills, and Chehalem Hills
sub-AVA sell for significantly more than parcels without a sub-AVA designation. In 2007
dollars, the premiums associated with location within these sub-AVAs were, respectively,
$2,933, $3,721, $7,163, and $3,306 per acre.

        Pairwise F-tests indicate that the coefficient on dundee is different from those on eola,
yamhill, and chehalem, but that the coefficients on eola, yamhill, and chehalem are statistically
indistinguishable from one another. The coefficients on parcel size indicate that the per-acre
price falls as the parcel size increases, but at a diminishing rate. Finally, the adjusted R2 is 0.422,
reasonably high for cross-section data.

        As mentioned above, the sub-AVA designations did not become official until 2005 and
2006. For the Eola-Amity Hills, Yamhill-Carlton, and Dundee Hills sub-AVAs, our sample
includes sales that occurred before and after the official designation. To test for a corresponding
shift in the sub-AVA premium in these cases, we interact eola, yamhill, and dundee with
saledate and add these variables to the basic model. We find that the coefficient estimates are
positive and significant in all cases, indicating a rise in the premiums following the official
adoption of the sub-AVAs.12

        Why are the impacts of site attributes on sales price insignificant? As mentioned above,
the site attribute variables are measured over the entire parcel, not just the vineyard portion,
which may decrease the precision of these variables and explain why the estimated coefficients
are not significantly different from zero. To explore this possibility, we restrict the sample to
parcels that are at least 50 percent vineyards (percentvine ≥ 0.50). For the entire sample, an
average of 68 percent of the parcel area is vineyards, with a minimum of 16 and a maximum of
100 percent (Table 2). With a 50 percent cut-off, we still have 83 observations with which to
estimate the model. The results (not reported, but available upon request) show little change
from the basic model. None of the coefficient estimates for site attributes are significantly
different from zero, and the estimates for sub-AVAs have similar magnitude and significance
level. Qualitatively, the findings remain the same for cut-off values of 68% and 75%. We also
re-estimate the basic model with percentvine entered as an independent variable in the basic
model. The associated coefficient is not significantly different from zero.

        Another possible explanation for the insignificance of the site attribute variables is that
their effects could be masked by the sub-AVA designations. The sub-AVA designations are
supposed to be based on the area’s terroir. In this case, the sub-AVA variables would measure
the average effect of the site attributes of parcels within the sub-AVA, and dropping the sub-
AVA variables would increase the explanatory power of the site attributes. We find this result in

11
     The results do not change appreciably if we use robust standard error estimates.
12
  The Eola-Amity Hills premium increases from $590 to $5,621 per acre, the Yamhill-Carlton premium increases
from $2,186 to $7,064 per acre, and the Dundee Hills premium increases from $4,440 to $15,474 per acre. The full
set of results is available from the corresponding author upon request.


                                                            8
the case of the bestsoil variable, which has a positive and significant (5% level) coefficient when
we omit the sub-AVA variables (Table 4).

        Further investigation reveals that the bestsoil variable is highly correlated with the
indicator variable for the Dundee Hills sub-AVA (dundee) but not with the other sub-AVA
variables.13 Thus, the model in Table 4 does not identify whether higher vineyard prices are the
result of soils or location within the Dundee Hills sub-AVA. We split the sample into two
groups – parcels inside and outside the Dundee Hills sub-AVA – and estimate separate models
with only the site attribute variables. In both cases, the coefficient on the bestsoil variable is
insignificant, suggesting that it is the Dundee Hills location, and not better soils, that raises
vineyard prices.14

        A further check is to see if there is variation in the site attributes within sub-AVAs. If
not, then the effects of the site attributes will be captured by the sub-AVA variables. Table 5
reports the standard deviation of the site attributes for the whole sample and for parcels within
each sub-AVA. The statistics indicate similar variation in site attributes within and across sub-
AVAs.

        Finally, if the terroir of a sub-AVA has important influences on wine quality, then parcels
that are outside, but close to, sub-AVAs should be valued more than parcels that are farther
away. We re-estimate the basic model with the variable distancesub included. This
corresponding p-value is 0.45.15

        Our results indicate that the significant premiums associated with sub-AVA designations
are unrelated to observable site attributes. An alternative explanation is that bottle prices for
wines from sub-AVAs command higher prices (for reputational reasons), which bids up the
prices of sub-AVA vineyards. To examine this possibility, we summarized data on 2006 Pinot
Noir bottle prices for the Willamette Valley AVA and for each sub-AVA. From the Wine
Spectator database, we obtained 243 observations, and from the Wine Advocate (Robert Parker)
database 310 observations. In Table 6, we report the vineyard premiums (in 2007 dollars), based
on the results from Table 3, plus the average bottle prices (in 2007 dollars) from our two wine
data sources. The rankings of vineyard premiums are broadly consistent with bottle rankings.
McMinnville and Willamette Valley are at the bottom in all rankings and Dundee Hills is at or
second from the top. Of course, the bottle prices are also affected by the skills and reputations of



13
     The simple correlation coefficient for bestsoil and dundee is 0.69.
14
   There are 24 parcels inside the Dundee Hills sub-AVA and 80 parcels outside. With these sub-samples, the p-
values for the bestsoil variable are, respectively, 0.81 and 0.90. Although the mean of bestsoil is higher for parcels
inside the Dundee Hills sub-AVA (0.87 compared to 0.19), there is considerable variation in the bestsoil variable
within the sub-samples. In both cases, bestsoil has a standard deviation of about 0.30 and minimum and maximum
values of 0 and 1, respectively.
15
   A similar result is obtained when we drop two observations for parcels that are outside but closest to the
McMinnville sub-AVA. There is no premium associated with being inside this sub-AVA. Full results are available
from the corresponding author upon request.

wine-makers, and so these results are, at most, suggestive of correlation between vineyard and
bottle prices.16

                                                4. Conclusions

        We have estimated a hedonic model of vineyard prices in Oregon to examine whether
they vary systematically with designated appellation, after controlling for site attributes. Despite
using precise measures of site attributes, we do not find evidence of a significant effect of these
variables on vineyard prices, and a series of robustness tests does not alter this finding. But, we
do find that vineyard prices are strongly determined by whether or not parcels are inside specific
sub-AVAs. The delineation of sub-AVAs is intended to capture the unique characteristics of a
geographical area as they relate to grape production.17 That is, sub-AVAs are supposed to reflect
the area’s terroir. Our finding that the physical characteristics of vineyards are not priced
implicitly in the land market raises questions about whether sub-AVA designations have a
meaningful connection – in reality – with terroir.

        Nevertheless, our results make clear that the concept of terroir matters economically.
Buyers and sellers of vineyard parcels in the Willamette Valley of Oregon attach a significant
premium to the sub-AVA designations, ranging from about $3,000 per acre for Eola-Amity Hills,
Chehalem Mountains, and Yamhill-Carlton, to over $7,000 per acre for Dundee Hills. One
possibility is that buyers are less informed than sellers about how the attributes of a vineyard will
affect wine quality and, therefore, rely on sub-AVA designations as quality signals. Either way,
consumers are evidently willing to pay more for the experience of drinking wines from these
areas. While they may not discriminate among wines in terms of their intrinsic qualities,
consumers are responding to extrinsic qualities of wines, such as price and area of origin.




16
  Because there is considerable variation in bottle prices within sub-AVAs, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that
average bottle prices are the same across sub-AVAs.
17
   The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, which designates AVAs in the United States, defines a
viticultural area as, “a delimited, grape-growing region distinguishable by geographical features.”
