The extensive literature on knowledge management spans several fields, but there are remarkably
few studies that address the basic question as to whether knowledge management practices improve
organizational performance. I examine that question using a national probability sample of establishments,
clear measures of IT-driven knowledge management practices, and an experimental design that offers
a unique approach for addressing concerns about endogeneity and omitted variables. The results indicate
that the use of company intranets, data warehousing practices, performance support systems, and employee

                    The Performance Effects of IT-Enabled Knowledge Management Practices


                                                                         Abstract


            The extensive literature on knowledge management spans several fields, but there are remarkably

few studies that address the basic question as to whether knowledge management practices improve

organizational performance. I examine that question using a national probability sample of

establishments, clear measures of IT-driven knowledge management practices, and an experimental

design that offers a unique approach for addressing concerns about endogeneity and omitted variables.

The results indicate that the use of company intranets, data warehousing practices, performance support

systems, and employee competency databases have significant and meaningful effects on a range of

relevant business outcomes.


Introduction:


            The concept of knowledge management (KM) goes back to the earliest studies in economics,

more recently spanning other disciplines as well (see, e.g., Polyani 1958, Argote 1999, Dierkes, et al.

2001). What counts as “knowledge” has been the subject of a long conceptual debate (see, e.g., Ackoff

1989 and Guo and Sheffield 2008 for reviews), and while there is no consensus on a simple definition, the

idea that knowledge is information that has meaning seems central to most definitions. In the context of

business and organizations, knowledge refers to information that helps the organization meet its goals.

The practices that govern how such knowledge is produced, captured, and then used are therefore the

essence of knowledge management and will serve as the definition here.


            The explosion of interest in knowledge management spawned best-selling books, practitioner-

oriented journals, and extensive research activities. 1 The interest stemmed in large measure from the

claim that knowledge management can explain organizational success, an assertion that makes it central

to the interests of organization, strategy, and economic researchers (Nelson 1991). Despite this interest,


            1 See, e.g., Senge (1990) and new practitioner journals like the Journal of Knowledge Management Practice. As of 2010, there were over 3000 journal
articles about knowledge management as measured by those featuring the term “knowledge management” in the abstract of the article.
there has been remarkably little evidence as to whether knowledge management practices actually have

any effect on organizational outcomes. Arguably the most serious efforts to assess the effects of

knowledge management practices have been in the MIS field in part because information technology

offers concrete examples of knowledge management and in part because MIS already had a strong

tradition of examining the effects of technology.


        In the arguments below, I identify information technology applications associated with

knowledge management practices and observe their relationships with various measures of organizational

outcomes. This analysis represents an advance over the few prior attempts to assess the effects of

knowledge management in several ways. First, these IT-based applications of KM are objective and

readily applicable across organizations. Second, the data are nationally representative, improving the

generalizability of the findings. Third, the design of the analysis makes it possible to address estimation

problems present in previous attempts. The study also contributes to the much more extensive MIS

literature on the effects of information technology by adding to the growing literature on the effects of

specific IT practices. The ability to examine specific practices with nationally-representative data with

multiple measures of performance and a longitudinal design for addressing estimation challenges is

reasonably unique even in the extensive MIS literature.


Knowledge Management Research:


        Interest in knowledge management in an organizational and business context goes back at least to

Scientific Management and its effort to codifying the tacit knowledge that craft workers possessed and

teaching parts of it to less skilled, cheaper workers. Contemporary research on knowledge management is

sometimes dated from Nelson and Winter (1982) and their focus on how organizations create knowledge,

how they learn. Much of the research on knowledge management since then has been in the field of

management, initially with a focus on how tacit knowledge is developed and then used. Knowledge in

this context was typically seen as embedded in each organizational context, operating at the level of the

individual worker, and was transferred through social relationships (e.g.,Argote, Beckman, and Epple

1990). Examples include how technicians and craft workers learn to get the most out of new equipment
and how they pass such knowledge informally onto colleagues. A branch of this literature examined the

structure and practices of organizations as they affect the ability to learn (e.g., Cohen and Levinthal 1990;

Sorensen 2003), although it is probably fair to say that most of the research examined social and group

mechanisms rather than organizational factors. Reviews of the management-based KM literature make

clear that the focus of interest has been on describing how knowledge is created, retained, and transferred

(see, e.g., Argote, McEvily, and Reagans 2003). Assessing the impact of KM was of secondary

importance, and the few such studies look at the individual job level for outcomes (e.g., Darr, Argote, and

Epple 1995).


        Prusac (2001) suggests that the recent focus on firm-level knowledge management was driven by

improvements in information technology, which are more of a firm-level issue. It is not surprising, then,

that a related set of research on KM developed in the MIS field (see Alavi and Leidner 2001 for an

overview). These studies sees specific IT tools as embodying knowledge management, as opposed to the

focus on social relationships in the management field. Another point of contrast with the management

literature is that researchers in the MIS tradition have been more concerned about the payoffs from

practices. 2


        Very little is known about the effects of knowledge management practices on performance,

however. As Tanriverdi (2005) notes, there are few studies in either the MIS or management fields that

actually demonstrate a relationship between knowledge management, even broadly defined, and

performance. His study shows a link between IT readiness, knowledge management capabilities, and

then financial performance in a cross-section of healthcare providers. Lee and Choi (2003) find a

relationship between IT support, knowledge management practices, the performance of tasks and, in turn,

overall organizational performance in a cross-section of Korean firms. Economics and operations

research has a growing interest in KM and its outcomes as well. Here the measures of KM used often

2 These are not the only fields with an interest in knowledge management. Edwards, Hall, and Shaw
(2009), for example, review studies about knowledge management in operations research, although it is
fair to conclude that the OR research is much more limited than in management or MIS and focuses
mainly around the application of Problem Structuring Methods to knowledge-related issues.
range far and wide. Chen, Lu, and Yang (2009), for example, use data envelop techniques to argue that

the presence of a “think tank” leads to better performance among electricity generators; Yang (2010)

asserts that CEO perceptions of the KM orientation of their firm relate to the competitive position of their

firm in a cross-sectional sample of hi-tech Chinese companies; Loof and Heshmati (2002) use research

and development expenditures to proxy KM and relate it to innovation outcomes in a cross-section of

firms. And in a study that may be the most similar to the one here in terms of data, Kremp and Mairesse

(2004) use a representative cross-sectional sample of French manufacturers to examine the relationship

between a knowledge management orientation and measures of innovation and productivity in an

exploratory study. Some of their measures of KM are quite broad (e.g., having a knowledge management

culture), others extend beyond KM (e.g., incentives to retain employees), and none overlap with the IT

applications here. But they find significant effects on firm performance.


        The challenge of investigating the relationship between knowledge management practices and

organizational outcomes begins with establishing what knowledge management means and

operationalizing it for analysis. As one can see from the KM studies cited above, the variables used to

measure KM vary widely across studies. But they are often quite indirect measures, and many have

construct validity challenges in that they may well be capturing effects from other phenomenon (e.g.,

employee retention saves turnover costs as well as knowledge). A recent review lamented that it was

possible to read a book-length account of KM and not have a sense of how the term was defined (Prentice

2009). In fact, though, there is some consensus as to how KM should be defined. Argote (1999) and

Argote, McEvily, and Reagans (2003) survey the voluminous research on knowledge management,

particularly from an organization and management perspective, and concluded that there are three basic

aspects to knowledge management: The creation of knowledge, its retention, and its transfer. Alavi and

Leidner (2001) do a similar review, emphasizing the MIS perspective and the separate body of research in

that field, coming up with a reasonably similar taxonomy: knowledge creation, sharing (including

retrieval and storage), transfer, and a fourth category of application. The first three items are virtually

identical in both reviews. It seems clear that any attempt to operationalize the general concept of

knowledge management should address these three aspects. (“Application” in Alavi and Leidner‟s (2001)
taxonomy, is a broader concept that is dependent on the context where it is applied and therefore may be

hard to measure across situations.) If knowledge in an organizational context is information that helps the

organization achieve its goals, then we can define knowledge management practices as those that help

create knowledge, retain it in the organization, and transfer it to where it is useful.


        The other challenges of examining the effects of KM practices on organizational outcomes are

similar to those in any observational study. They include having appropriate measures of outcomes.

Measures used in prior studies are limited and include indirect measures such as participant satisfaction

with KM and perceived measures of success. While all these are useful, they are not necessarily the most

important measures of performance, especially in for-profit business operations. Arguably the most

common limitation to prior studies is that they all use cross-sectional research designs that limit the

ability to address questions of endogeneity (i.e., are the already best performers using more KM practices)

and omitted variables (i.e., are factors associated with the use of KM actually driving better performance).


        Assessing Performance Effects: There has been an explosion of research in the past decade

exploring how various management practices affect organizational productivity and performance. Such

studies have been especially prominent in this journal (e.g., Corbett, Montes-Aancho, and Kirsch 2005;

Frei and Kalakota 1999; MacDuffie 1997). Systems of work organization may have been the most

prominent topic (e.g., Handel and Levine 2002) although the list now includes topics like organizational

structures (e.g., Bloom and Van Reenan 2007).


        The literature on the payoffs from information technology (IT) is also extensive and closely

related to this analysis because the measures used to estimate KM practices are IT-related. That literature

is too extensive to review here (see Tanriverdi 2005 for a recent survey), but a brief summary begins with

noting that that there was an initial back-and-forth between studies that did not find a payoff to IT

spending, especially in economy-wide studies, and those that found positive effects, especially at the

firm-level (e.g., Bharadwaji et al. 1999). Since then studies have advanced considerably in terms of data

and methods. For example, Brynjolfsson and Hitt (2003) use longitudinal data and note that the return on

IT investments depends on the lag structure of investments. Recognition that expenditures per se can be a
noisy measure (e.g., accounting systems differ, and expenditures and use may not be perfectly correlated)

has led more recent studies to focus on the effects of specific IT systems: Mukhopadhvav and Kekre

(2002), for example, use a field study to examine the consequences of introducing IT-driven B2B

procurement systems; Bartel, Ichniowksi, and Shaw (2007) find that the introduction of computer

controlled machines improves productivity in the value industry. Aral, Brynjolfsson, and Wu (2010)

examine the introduction of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems and attempt to pin down the

causality of effects by observing that productivity rises when ERP system begin to be used but not when

they are purchased. Not all these studies find strong relationships: Heim and Peng (2010), for example,

find that the effect of statistical process control management practices overshadow those of related IT

investments, Ping (2010) finds no advantage to cutting edge IT investments, and perhaps most important

for our purposes, Devaraj and Kohli (2003) argue that the lack of relationship between IT expenditure

and performance outcomes they observe is because of the missing mediating effect of KM applications.


        Studies of the effects of IT applications are much further advanced than the nascent research on

the effects of KM. But they have also become more fragmented in that findings about the effect of a

particular IT application may say little about the effects of a different IT application will be. That is not

surprising given that these applications – ERP, SPC, B2B, etc. – each enable different management

practices . Further, in order to get information on specific IT applications, virtually all the studies have by

necessity used narrow sampling frames that limit their generalizability.

        While we may not learn much about the possible effects of KM applications from the IT studies,

the methodological issues are similar. The general framework underlying all these studies is that the

practices alter the production function in ways that allow capital and labor to be used more efficiently.

The goal of changing the production function seems central to the basic idea of knowledge management.3

Although it seems to be a straight-forward question conceptually, attempts to estimate the effects of

3 It is also possible that knowledge management practices might be directed at idiosyncratic outcomes
that cannot neatly be linked to production function-type outcomes (e.g., creating breakthrough or
“blockbuster” products that change the basic production function), although those goals seem less
common.
knowledge management practices, or indeed any practice, on organizational performance raise some of

the classic problems in observational studies. The challenges begin with the fact that the practices being

considered are choice variables where organizations must make a conscious decision to introduce the

practices being examined. Such a decision is not a random event, and one problem this raises is

endogeneity: Better performing firms may be the ones most able to afford and therefore choose to

innovate or perhaps those that are performing poorly may be the most motivated to innovate. In either

case, estimates of the effect of introducing knowledge management practices and performance will be

biased if the decision to introduce them is influenced by prior performance.


        A second problem comes from the fact that many of the factors that could cause establishments to

introduce such practices may themselves have an independent effect on performance, the problem of

omitted variables or sample heterogeneity. It could be, for example, that organizations that innovate in

many aspects of management are also more likely to introduce knowledge management systems. There

could be a statistical association between the introduction of knowledge management practices and

organizational performance because firms that introduce those practices are doing many things that also

influence performance.


        Both problems appear in analyses based on cross-sectional data. A standard approach for

addressing both the problem of endogeneity and of sample heterogeneity, therefore, is to use panel data.

The basic approach with panel data is to examine the use of a practice like knowledge management

techniques and organizational performance at time t and then again at t+1, comparing changes in practices

with the change in performance. Fixed effects models based on this approach draw comparisons within

organizations over time and are perhaps most effective in addressing omitted variable problems, to the

extent that unobserved variables within the organizations do not change within the period being examined

and that there is variation in practices and performance across the two periods. These models can also

help in dealing with endogeneity issues across establishments. But they do not necessarily eliminate them.


        Fixed effects models look at the changes in practices and see how those changes affect

subsequent performance. Consider, for example, the fact that organizations that adopt practices
also make decisions as to when to do so, e.g., early in the evolution of the practices, where they

are still novel, or later when they are well-established. Organizations that adopt them earlier, in

period t, may be systematically different from those that adopt them in t+1. Late adopters have

less time to put the practices to use; they may also be less innovative than early adopters or

perhaps the practices are simply less important for them. For example, Ping, (2010) focuses on

early adopters of IT innovations and finds that they appear to get no advantage from their

investments as compared to those who do not adopt them.


        Where practices are already well-established, the fixed effects models of panel data will focus

disproportionately on late adopters; when practices are relatively new, as they might more likely be for

the knowledge management practices considered here (see below), such an approach will

disproportionately focus on early adopters. (Capturing not only whether organizations introduced

practices but when they did so would help, but doing so often has to rely on the retrospective memory of

respondents, which is less than precise.) Further, virtually all fixed effect models are driven by changes

in practices, and they treat the introduction of practices and their abandonment as equivalent decisions.

While it is possible to examine these two pathways separately, doing so should be based on some

understanding of how they differ.


        A related and more fundamental problem with panel data is that it exacerbates measurement error

in both the dependent and independent variables, where the latter is especially important because it can

lead to biased estimates. Panel data relies on differences in responses between periods, each one of which

is measured with error. The difference between two responses, each measured with error, therefore

compounds the error, making it greater than what we otherwise would observe in the cross section. The

problem is worse when the panel is relatively short: The true rate at which practices actually change is

likely to be less across a small period of time, and assuming that measurement error happens when

responses are given, the ratio of erroneously reported change to actual change will be higher in a shorter

period. In the context here, the biggest issue is with the independent variables that measure knowledge
management practices. Reports of changes in those practices will compound the measurement error, and

such error in independent variables creates biased estimates (see, e.g., Freeman 1984 for a discussion).

The problem should be less severe the farther apart the observations are in time because the rate of

misclassification should remain the same while the number of true changers should be greater where more

time is passed.4 If panel data estimates of the effects of practices are smaller (in absolute value) than

cross-section estimates, we cannot tell without additional information whether this result is due to a

reduction of the bias from heterogeneity or an exacerbation of the bias from measurement error.


            In the arguments that follow, we rely on a unique set of information that allows us to examine the

effect of IT-related knowledge management practices on organizational performance with a research

design that represents a considerable improvement over most prior studies. First, we can examine those

knowledge management practices with reasonably objective measures that are comparable across

organizations, industries, and contexts. Because the data are based on a national probability sample, we

can draw conclusions that have reasonably clear external validity. Second, the longitudinal nature of the

data allows us to use the basic fixed effect design to address omitted variable issues. Third and most

important, the structure of the data allows us to control for performance before the knowledge

management practices were introduced, addressing some of the more intractable endogeneity problems

described above that are otherwise difficult or impossible to address. Although the focus is on KM, the

study can also contribute to the larger literature on IT applications by using a representative sampling

frame and a novel approach to addressing endogeneity and omitted variable issues.


Data and Methods:


            The information for this study comes from the National Employers Survey (NES III) conducted

in 2000/2001, which was in part designed to examine knowledge management issues. The National

Employer Surveys have been administered by the Bureau of the Census as telephone surveys using

Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) where the interviewer entered responses directly into


            4 The extent to which this is the case, and whether it negates the advantages of addressing heterogeneity, depends on the extent of measurement error, its
correlation over time, and the magnitude of the heterogeneity bias.
a database. The survey was delivered to a nationally representative sample of private establishments with

20 or more employees. It is drawn from the Standard Statistical Establishment List (SSEL), a listing of

establishments taken from Internal Revenue Service records and based on the mandatory tax reporting by

employers. As such, it is the definitive list of employers, which is superior in its representativeness to

other commonly used employer sampling frames.


        Establishments represent a coherent location where operations take place whereas the firm or

company is based on a legal definition that may encompass many separate locations. Using

establishments as the unit of analysis provides a more accurate measure of actual practices because

practices vary across operations and locations within firms, especially larger firms. Performance measures

at the establishment level are also more likely to reflect factors unique and limited to the establishment.

A potential downside is that some financial measures of performance, especially overall profitability, are

typically only collected at the firm level. The benefits of better knowledge management practice are

likely to include synergies across establishments that show up at the firm level but not at the

establishment level. Our results therefore will miss such benefits.


        The survey over-sampled establishments in the manufacturing sector and establishments with

more than 100 employees. Public-sector employers, non-profit institutions, and corporate headquarters

were excluded from the sample, as were establishments with fewer than 20 employees. Establishments

with fewer than 20 employees are numerous but account for only approximately 25 percent of all

workers. The choice of restricting the survey to larger establishments was made not only because smaller

establishments come and go quickly but also because the management and workplace practices of very

small establishments are often so informal and variable, changing day-to-day in response to otherwise

routine developments such as absenteeism, as to make it difficult to respond in a meaningful way to

questions about practices and policies.


        In administering the NES, the target respondent was the plant manager in the manufacturing

sector and the local business site manager in the non-manufacturing sector. The goal of this survey,

however, was to measure what was actually done in the facility, not the policies that might exist in
employee handbooks. For some topics, such as knowledge management practices, there may be a big

difference between actual and stated policies. The best person to ask about actual operating practices is

the person in charge of the establishment. The questionnaire was designed to allow for multiple

respondents so that, for example, information could be obtained from establishments that kept financial

data in a separate office, typically at corporate headquarters for multi-establishment enterprises.


        The usual reason given by employers for non-participation in the survey was that they did not

participate in voluntary surveys or were too busy to do so. Analysis of the characteristics of respondents

and non-respondents from the sampling frame indicates that there was no significant pattern of

differences at the two-digit industry level in the likelihood of participating in the survey (Lynch and Black

1998). The only differentiating characteristic of establishments less likely to participate was that

manufacturing establishments with more than 1000 employees, constituting 0.1 percent of the sample,

were less likely to do so. Larger establishments have more resources and may be more likely both to

afford the costs of implementing KM practices and to see benefits from them. To the extent that we lose

larger establishments, we may be losing observations that would improve our results. On the other hand,

because the sampling frame bypasses the very smallest establishments, we may also lose observations that

are less likely to use and to see benefits from KM practices.


        The survey was conducted in 1994, repeated in 1997 and then again in 2001 when questions

about knowledge management were included. The sampling frame for the 2001 was drawn from the

establishments that responded to the 1997survey. It includes 2,825 establishments with more than 20

employees with a response rate of 85 percent. 1225 of the 2001 establishments were surveyed in the 1994

as well. A downside of surveying only those establishments that are still operating in 2001 is that the data

miss establishments that failed between 1994 and 2001. The question that we cannot answer given the

design of the sample is whether the use of knowledge management practices was associated with the risk

that an establishment would fail. If so, the results could be biased because the sample would lose poor

performing establishments (i.e., those that failed), biasing measures of effects upward if those making

greater use of knowledge management practices failed or downward if those making less use of the
practices failed.5 The 1994 and 1997 data have been used in a number of studies (there were no KM

questions on those surveys), but the 2001 data have never been used before. The most relevant of the

prior NES studies are Lynch and Black (2001), which shows that having more employees using

computers raised organizational productivity.


             The structure of the data combined with the history of developments in knowledge management

makes it possible for us to address some of the above statistical problems using a unique approach that

improves on the standard fixed effects technique based on panel data. Specifically, we are able to form a

panel in which the first wave was conducted before the specific knowledge management practices being

considered existed, at least in the form that they are operationalized here. We also know the performance

level of the establishment before the practices were introduced. This gives us an initial measure of

performance that is exogenous and unrelated to the introduction of knowledge management practices.

We can use this measure to generate a fixed effect/first difference estimate by comparing it with

performance in a latter period when knowledge management practices were measured. (Cappelli and

Neumark 2001 use this approach as well.) This approach has the general advantage of fixed effects

estimates in addressing omitted variable problems. Further, having an initial estimate of performance that

is independent of the use of knowledge management practices avoids the problem of exacerbating

measurement error associated with panel data: If the practices did not exist in the first period, there

should be no exacerbation of measurement error because there can be no error in the first measure.


             The most important advantage of this approach, however, is in addressing the endogeneity

problem. Arguably the biggest concern for estimation is if establishments that already are performing

well are more likely to introduce these knowledge management practices. (If the reverse was true, poor

performing establishments being more likely to introduce them, this would lead to a downward bias in the

estimate, making it more difficult to find a significant, positive relationship between practices and

performance and producing a more conservative test.) If the initial measure of performance can be

structured so as to be free from any association with the incidence of knowledge management practices, it

5 Because the 2001 survey interviewed only a subset of the respondents from 1997, it is quite difficult without access to Census‟ internal interview reports to learn
anything about the respondents who failed and how they differed from the survivors.
provides a very effective means – superior to standard fixed effects models - to control for the possibility

that good performing establishments disproportionately introduced these practices.6


         The above arguments rely on the assumption that the practices being examined did not exist

before the beginning of the panel, when the first measure of performance was gathered, and there are

many caveats to such a claim. First, it is impossible to prove with certainty that practices did not exist in

any given operation, in part because attempts to measure practices almost never are made until such

practices are reasonably well-known. Second and more important, even if the specific practice under

consideration did not exist, some related practice with a similar mission may have been in operation.

Consider, for example, the practice of having a company intranet. Such practices could not exist before

the IT systems behind them existed, but it was possible for organizations to use other technologies to

facilitate the information sharing that is the goal of intranets: an information billboard where questions are

posted, e.g., or even a company library could serve that purpose.


         If related practices existed before the specific knowledge management practice being measured

here, then some part of any possible performance enhancing effect was also operating in the earlier

period. Our estimate of the effect of introducing the knowledge practices would therefore be biased

downward as it would be net of the prior performance effects. The explanation is similar if the actual

practice being measured was somehow in place before the beginning of the panel. In other words, the

analyses here do not rest on the claim that the knowledge management practices did not exist before 1993.

It is only the claim that this empirical approach reduces biases in the estimate that relies on that assertion.

This situation represents somewhat good news for analyzing whether knowledge management practices




6 Another possibility, more difficult to address, is that the decision to introduce these practices is based on future
performance: Establishments that anticipate changes in performance might be more or less likely to introduce them
now. For example, an establishment might believe that business will boom in the future and therefore will require
better knowledge management practices to keep up. It is not completely obvious how such a situation affects an
analysis of the relationship between these practices and current performance. If the estimate of future performance
is truly independent from current performance, then it should have no effect on the former estimate.
improve performance as the downward bias in estimating positive effects makes for a more conservative

test.


            To determine whether the relevant knowledge management practices existed before the first

survey, we conducted an extensive review of the practitioner literature using two different databases that

each captures thousands of publications. Specifically, we looked to see when the practice in question was

first mentioned. As noted above, it is possible that the practice existed even before there was a name for

it, but such a situation is unlikely to be common. Business and practitioner publications are interested in

reporting on new developments, and if they have yet to identify any organization using a practice, it is not

likely that the practice is widespread. If the practice has yet to be described or discussed, let alone having

examples of organizations using it, then it is even less likely that it is present in our

establishments. (See Appendix for details.)7


            The above approach is not the only technique for addressing endogeneity problems, of

course. Statistical techniques for addressing endogeneity include using instrumental variables as

a substitute for the potentially endogenous independent variable, in this case the KM practices.

Good instruments are variables that would be correlated with the use of knowledge management

practices but uncorrelated with the error term in the original equation. It is difficult to find

instruments that meet that test, however, and there are no obvious candidates in these data. A

different approach is to use “switching” models where the change from one regime or set of

practices to another is endogenous with respect to the outcome variables. Such models require

knowing in this case when practices were introduced, information that is not available here. The

Heckman selectivity model is a special case of a switching model for situations where only one



            7 We should be clear, however, that even controlling for performance before knowledge management practices could have existed does not completely
eliminate the concern about endogeneity. It is possible, for example, for an establishment to have its performance spike up because of some change in its market after
1993 that leads to higher performance in 2001. That higher performance might make it more likely for them to introduce knowledge management practices before
2001. As an empirical matter, performance as measured in the 1994 survey is strongly related with performance in 2000 (see below), suggesting that there may not be
many establishments where the above scenario could hold. The unique variation in performance across establishments in 2001 will be less when controlling for 1993
performance, therefore, which makes it more difficult to find a statistically significant relationship between performance and any independent variable.
regime can be observed as in cross-sectional data.8 Experimental designs like the one used here that

help rule out endogeneity are preferable to statistical adjustments to data with endogenous attributes.

While the above design rests on assumptions about the use of KM practices in 1994, the alternative

statistical adjustments also rely on assumptions that are more difficult to test (e.g., normal distribution of

the variables in the underlying population).


        Knowledge Management Variables: The NES 2000/01 asked establishments about their use of

knowledge management practices that span the three categories of the knowledge management terrain

identified above in prior research: Creating knowledge, retaining it in the organization, and transferring it

within the organization. These survey questions follow the MIS tradition in that they ask about specific IT

tools and practices that drive knowledge management actions. The advantages of using IT systems to

measure of knowledge management practices include the fact that having or not having such systems is a

more objective measure than, say, whether individual employees share information, and they are also

reasonably consistent to interpret across organizational contexts. The answers are therefore more likely to

be valid.


            The questions we use in the analysis are as follows: 9


Does your establishment…

        maintain a formal system, such as a database, for identifying which employees are good at which
        tasks? Yes/No
        maintain an intranet, a computer-based network within your organization? Yes/No

        use data warehousing, systematically collecting data related to operations for analysis later?
        Yes/No

        use electronic performance support systems, a computer application that guides users in
        performing tasks as they do them? Yes/No

Each question included a help screen that provided respondents with further explanation of the concept

and examples of the practices in question.

        8 For a discussion of switching models as a solution to endogeneity problems, see Dutoit 2007.
        9 These questions were generated with the help of Linda Argote at Carnegie Mellon University.
        The “data warehousing” item falls under the heading of creating and capturing knowledge, which

is arguably the most basic and best-known aspect of knowledge management (see, e.g., Argote 1999).

Data warehousing are systems for extracting data and storing it in for later use in analyses that support

management decisions (Watson and Hurley 1997). These systems might be thought of as the first step in

sophisticated analyses to understand an organization‟s business environment through data it produces.

While the best-known applications of such analyses may be in marketing, they touch every aspect of

business. The “database on employee competencies” variable is an example of a knowledge retention

practice. Identifying and then recording which employees are good at what allows the employer to assign

individuals to tasks in ways that improve performance (Reagans, Argote, and Brooks, 2005).

“Performance support systems” are software controlled by employees that helps them perform tasks by

providing access to information, tools, or advice that aid in addressing problems (Lee and Liu, 2006). A

simple example might be a pop-up menu that provides formulas or calculators to aid in answering

financial questions. (The infamous Microsoft “clippy” icon may be the best-known example.) Research

on the effects of these systems on performance outcomes, almost always at the task and individual level,

has been limited to case studies (e.g., Chang, 2007). Intranets use internet technology, typically

protected via firewalls, as a tool for communication within a specific group or community (Skok and

Kalmanovitch 2005). The knowledge sharing that is facilitated by intranets cuts across all aspects of

performance. Here as well, prior research on the effects of intranets on performance focuses almost

entirely on individual outcomes and case studies (e.g., Lee and Kim 2009). In our context, intranets

operate within the establishment, possibly beyond to the broader firm in multi-establishment operations.

Both performance support systems and intranets fall under the “transferring knowledge” aspect of

knowledge management.


        It is worth noting the construct validity issues of using specific IT practices like these to measure

KM. For example, it is certainly possible to have knowledge sharing without an intranet. The estimation

here, therefore, captures the marginal effect of having an intranet beyond the effects of other information

sharing arrangements that might be in place without IT support. If we consider the estimates here as
measuring overall KM practices, they may be conservative measures. Because these measures clearly do

not exhaust the possible set of knowledge management practices, the failure to find relationships between

them and performance outcomes would not dismiss the general claim that knowledge management

practices improves performance. Evidence of such relationships, though, would support the more general

hypothesis that these practices affect organizational outcomes.


        It is also possible that the IT practices used here may facilitate performance improvements

through channels other than KM. That concern is most likely with the “intranet” measure. Martini et al.

2009 note in their review of case studies that intranets in business are used almost entirely for transferring

information. But they can also facilitate distributed software and computing services that can reduce

costs, and some of the effects on performance we observe could be attributable to that channel.


        As noted above, we assert that these IT-enabled manifestations of knowledge management

practices effectively did not exist for most establishments when the first measure of performance was

taken in the 1994 survey. The information we have is only when the practices were first discussed, and

the assertion is that they would not become common in establishments until well after then. Their first

appearance in the business and academic literature was as follows: For company intranet, the first

mention of any company using an internal intranet is in 1995; the first mention of any database (electronic

or otherwise) capturing employee competencies is in 1994; the first mention of “electronic performance

support” in companies was in mid-1992 as a tool to support a specific training program; although data

storage certainly existed earlier, the concept of “data warehousing” as something that could be used to aid

management decisions (as opposed to simply retrieve data) is first mentioned in a conceptual sense a

technical journal in 1992. The particular citations where these practices appeared are available on

request. For the purposes of estimation, our claim is simply that the use of these practices by the

establishments in our dataset before 1993 is likely to be rare and therefore inconsequential to our effort to

limit the bias in our estimation.10




       10 If the practices existed in any establishment before 1993 and had a positive effect on
performance – the relationship we are testing – then the fixed effect estimates would be biased downward.
        Dependent Variables: We have three measures of establishment performance. The first and most

important is annual revenue or sales per employee (“Salesln” in log form). While measures of physical

productivity have some advantages as being more proximate to any changes in production functions, this

measure has the important advantage of being comparable across industries and contexts. Sales per

employee has been used in many other contexts to measure establishment performance. In addition, we

have two other measures, unique to the manufacturing context, that tell us a great deal about operating

efficiency. These are scrap costs per employee (“Scrapcosts”) – the value of failed assemblies or other

material that cannot be repaired or restored – and cycle time (“cycletime”) – the period of time required to

complete one cycle of the manufacturing process. Both of these variables are expressed as negative

values in the data. Lower scrap rates, other things equal, mean less waste, an important measure of

production efficiency. Equivalent operations with lower cycle times are more efficient in that they

produce more in the same amount of time (for more about the relevance of these two measures to the

production process, see Hopp and Spearman 2001). When combined with controls for industry type,

these variables measure aspects of relative operating performance that may be different from sales per

employee.


        Control Variables: Important control variables are first the industry in which the establishment

operates (three-digit SIC code) as that has a largely determinant effect on the production process. The

book value of capital stock (“Bookvalue”) is a standard control variable in studies based on production

functions as more capital, other things equal, should make establishments more effective. This measure

captures investments of all kinds, including expenditures on IT. And size of the establishments as

measured by the number of employees. Size affects scale economies, among other things, and is captured

in the dependent variable in the sale equation, included as a control in the scrap cost and cycle time

regressions.




The concern would be more with the endogeneity issues noted above, the possibility that more effective
establishments were more likely to adopt them.
        We add one more very important control variable in an attempt to address further the omitted

variable issue - that something like a general innovative capability or good overall management could be

driving both overall higher performance as measured in 2001 and the introduction of knowledge

management practices. Performance in 1994 should capture any effect of innovation on performance that

is constant between the two periods, so the concern is really whether there is any change in overall

operating effectiveness or innovativeness after 1994 and before 2001 that could confound how we

interpret the relationship between the knowledge management variables and establishment performance.


        The measure we use to address that concern is whether or not the establishment received ISO

9000 certification. This certification has been seen as measuring the effectiveness of internal

management systems, especially in the area of quality and productivity. Corbett, Montes-Aancho, and

Kirsch (2005) find that certification is associated with superior financial performance at the firm level.

They use a matched-pair control group for their analysis. We can replicate their analysis with our data

and a more traditional regression model. Specifically, we can see whether there is a relationship between

ISO 9000 certification and establishment performance and then also whether that relationship holds up

when controlling for performance in the earlier period. (Because ISO 9000 certification was introduced

before 1994, we cannot make the same claim as for our knowledge management variables, viz., that our

1994 performance measure is independent of the decision to secure certification.) For the purposes of this

paper, however, the more important idea is that ISO 9000 certification is a good measure for how

sophisticated a firm is in its management practices. Including that certification provides a good control

for the omitted variable of the overall sophistication of an establishment‟s management. And because the

certification took a few years to become popular, it might be especially important as a means of capturing

any change in overall management effectiveness after 1994.


Analyses and Results:


        The analyses that follow and straight-forward and rely largely on the experimental design of the

data to address the statistical challenges associated with inferring causation. Table 1 presents variables,

means, standard deviations, and a correlation matrix of the variables used in the analyses. Because there
are no prior assessments of the extent to which these IT practices were used in the economy, it is difficult

to know what to expect. But the rank order of the extent of use of the practices seems sensible: Given that

intranets are often seen as one of the first IT applications in a system, the fact that intranet use is roughly

twice as great (80 percent use them) as the other practices is reasonable. The least common practice is the

employee database, with a third of establishments using them. That also seems reasonable given that such

practices require not only an IT system but also detailed assessments of employee performance by task,

which is a management challenge that not many employers undertake. What is perhaps more surprising

is that the KM practices are not strongly correlated with each other. The strongest relationship (.27) is

between intranet and performance support systems, and others are close to zero. Among other things, the

lack of correlation suggests that the other three KM practices do not necessarily rely on intranets.

Conceptually because the practices occur separately suggests the appropriateness of estimating each KM

practice independently.


        The first analyses are presented in Table 2 where we examine the relationship between

establishment sales per employee in the cross-section. Each of the IT-knowledge management practices

exhibits a statistically significant relationship with the sales variable except for the employee competency

database, and all the signs are in the expected, positive direction. When we add 1993 sales as a control

variable, the significance pattern is unchanged. As one might expect, sales in 1993 is significantly and

strongly associated with sales in 2000/2001, and the magnitude of the IT-knowledge management effects

diminishes, suggesting that part of the effect one observes in cross-sectional analysis is more accurately

attributable to factors that were quite likely in existence before the knowledge management practices were

introduced. An important conclusion from this finding is that cross-sectional estimates of performance

effects are biased upward, suggested the need for alternative approaches in these and in prior analyses

conducted elsewhere. But the size of the relationships is still reasonably large. When controlling for

previous performance, having a system of performance support is associated with roughly seven percent

greater sales; a data warehousing system with 10 percent greater sales; and an intranet with 14 percent

greater sales. These are certainly meaningful effects for a business operation.
        We repeat the same general approach in Table 3 with a new dependent variable, the value of

scrap costs per employee. This is a standard measure of operating efficiency in manufacturing operations.

Because it is only relevant for manufacturing, we restrict the sample to those establishments. The sample

size is smaller as a result, making it more difficult to estimate effects with precision, yet all four of the

knowledge management variables show significant relationships with the dependent variable, and the

effect sizes are substantially bigger that with the sales per employee measure. Again, because scrap costs

are expressed in negative form, greater use of these practices is associated with lower scrap costs. We

have no prior measure of scrap costs, but we can add the 1994 sales per employee measure as a general

control for the variation in performance across establishments. When we do so, the coefficients on the

knowledge management variables remain significant, and their magnitudes change only slightly. To

illustrate the magnitude of these effects, the use of an intranet is associated with 57 percent lower scrap

costs, and the use of electronic performance support systems are associated with even bigger reductions,

64 percent.


        In Table 4 we conduct the same analyses for cycle time. The number of observations here falls

even further because of missing values, and perhaps for that reason the coefficients are not estimated as

precisely. The relationships with all the KM variables are in the expected direction, although when we

add the 1993 sales per employee control variable, only the electronic performance support and data

warehousing are significant. For those variables, the effects appear sizeable: Data warehousing, for

example, is associated with 52 percent less cycle time. The scrap cost and the cycle time equations

explain far less of the overall variance than does the sales per employee measure, which suggests

measurement or omitted variables may be more important in the former models. We might expect KM

practices to have bigger effects on scrap costs and cycle time than on sales per employee because the

former are measures of operating efficiency, the focus of most KM, while sales per employee and revenue

more generally is driven in part by market prices and by marketing and sales practices that are less the

focus of KM. Nevertheless, it is useful to see that KM has significant and meaningful effects both on the

cost and the revenue side of these operations.
             We add the ISO 9000 variable in Table 5 to control for general operating effectiveness and

innovation, replicating the earlier study by Corbett, Montes-Aancho, and Kirsch (2005). As with their

study, we find that IS0 9000 certification is associated with superior financial performance in the form of

establishment sales. But the significance of the effect disappears when we add 1993 sales, and the

magnitude of the coefficient shrinks sharply. When including the ISO 9000 measure as an additional

control, the knowledge management variables are still significant. When 1993 sales are added as another

control variable, the KM variables retain the same general pattern of significance as before with

coefficient sizes basically unchanged. These results give us confidence that that the relationship between

performance and knowledge management is not driven by the omitted variable of overall innovation

effectiveness or operating excellence. We also examine the above relationships with other specifications

(available on request). When we include all the KM variables in the same equation, not surprisingly, the

significance of each individual relationship although the overall variance explained remains similar,

reflecting collinearity among those variables in the context of these models. When we combine the KM

variables to form principal components, the significance and effect sizes are at least as large as with the

individual analyses. But there is no justification for interpreting the KM variables simultaneously given

the fact that they do not have to occur together, as illustrated by the earlier finding that their presence in

the establishments is not closely correlated.11


Conclusions and Managerial Implications:


             The widespread and growing interest across fields in the topic of knowledge management rests

heavily on the idea that organizational performance can be improved through explicit attempts to manage

the creation, retention, and transfer of knowledge about performance issues. While the literature on

knowledge management is now vast and spans the MIS and management fields, there are remarkably few

studies that address this basic empirical question as to whether knowledge management practices


             11 It is not unusual for the presence of variables across observations to be relatively uncorrelated in a sample and to be collinear in the context of a
particular regression model because the two exercises capture something different. For example, the bivariate correlations here represent relationships between only
two variables while collinearity is driven by the common variation among any and all of the KM variables (i.e., including three-way and four-way correlations).
Further, the common variation that causes collinearity in the regression model is only with respect to the relationship with the dependent variables and to the
component of variation that is independent of the variation associated with the control variables.
contribute to improved effectiveness and efficiency. The above study represents a considerable advance

over prior research in this area and adds to the more general research on the effects of IT practices.


        The results across the different measures of organizational performance suggest that these

knowledge management practices have significant and meaningful effects on organizational performance.

Data warehousing has the biggest effect on cycle time, electronic performance support systems have their

largest effect on scrap rates, and the use of an intranet use has the biggest effect on sales. The results for

maintaining a data base of employee competencies were much more mixed, showing a significant

relationship only for scrap rates. Comparing the different practices, data warehousing and intranets are

the most general purpose knowledge management practices in that they can be used in several KM tasks

and contexts. Maintaining a database on employee competencies is arguably the most specific and

narrow of the practices. It is used to make better matches between employees and jobs, but presumably

those matches only happen when employees move to new positions. In an industry like consulting, those

assignments are project or engagement-based and happen frequently, these arrangements may pay off, as

Ofek and Sarfary (2001) speculate. But in most organizations, they are relatively rare events that happen

only when employees are promoted or otherwise move to different jobs. The scope for improving

organizational effectiveness therefore may be less and may explain why this practice had the weakest

effects on organizational performance.


        Overall, the effects are quite large, especially in the case of cycle time where the use of these

practices is associated with a 50 percent or more reduction in cycle time. They only apply to

manufacturing operations, and cycle time is only one aspect of production efficiency, which is in turn

only one aspect of performance for businesses. Nevertheless, cycle time matters a great deal for

organizations, and these effects are very meaningful in magnitude. That leads directly to implications for

management application. Whether or not to pursue formal KM practices has been the topic of recent

research at the conceptual level (e.g., Lee and Steen 2010). The empirical results here seem to suggest

that IT-driven KM practices can have big effects on performance. Before leaving that conclusion,

however, we should acknowledge several limitations. For example, we cannot be sure whether the higher
performance on sales, scrap rates, and cycle time are offset by more intensive use of other resources

besides those we control for here. Specifically, we do not know what it costs to put these KM practices in

place. We have controls for capital, but there may be other costs – training employees, for example – that

we cannot measure. Variables measuring profitability would be preferable in this regard, but using such

measures would require collecting data at the level of analysis where profit is calculated, typically the

firm. And that would create the problem noted earlier, that it is hard to establish clearly what practices

are in use in firms, which often have multiple locations and operations.    And we cannot be sure that the

intranet effects in particular only relate to KM outcomes as intranets can facilitate functions other than

information management and communication.


        Having prior measures of performance and a good measure of innovative practices other than

knowledge management as controls certainly helps make the case for the results. Omitted variables are

always a concern, however, especially in models where the total amount of variance explained is

relatively small as with the scrap and cycle time models. What we are measuring here is the IT

application of knowledge management practices, but it is important to recognize that these applications

stand as proxies for management approaches that can be quite systematic. Electronic performance

support systems, for example, change the way tasks are performed, standardizing them across the

organization. Data warehousing can be an essential component of quality control practices and root cause

analysis. Intranets are the most general purpose of the applications and facilitate an array of information

transfer and communication efforts within organizations. The effects we observe, therefore, are likely

associated with approaches to managing operations that are systematic and arguably fundamentally

different from those that came before. The relationships we see are likely capturing new ways of

managing associated with KM practices, not simply the effects of these IT systems per se. And in that

context, the large effect sizes we observe seem reasonable.


        Knowledge management continues to be an important topic for managers as they seek to deal

with the loss of knowledge from greater employee attrition, with the extension of operations to global

markets that stretches the limits of coordination around standard practices, and more generally the basic
strategy concern of finding sources of competitive advantage inside their operations. The notion that

knowledge management can be driven or at least assisted by IT systems seems to be advanced by these

developments as compared to the alternative view of seeing it reside in social relationships given that

globalization and increasing employee mobility tears at the heart of the relationship model. These results

give us substantially greater confidence that IT-related knowledge management practices of the kind

described here have a meaningful effect on important aspects of organizational performance.

Appendix: The History of Knowledge Management Practices


Search method: We searched two separate publication databases for evidence of these practices looking

for the terms anywhere in article text. The ABInform database used goes back to 1970, and the EBSCO

(Business Source Premier) database goes back to 1964.


"Employee competency data base" Searching for “competency”, “competency data”, “competency

database” and “competency data base” (+ the program also automatically gives “competence”). The

first mention of employee competencies comes from 1987 (Higgins, 1987), an article on an interactive

video test that scores managerial competence. “Competency data” does not get mentioned until

December 1992 (Murphy, 1992), in an article that tells about an HR software. There were only two

other relevant articles until January 1995, one from 1993 (on assessing competencies and gathering

competency data, Ulrich, 1993) and another from 1994 (on computer software that helps track nurses’

competencies).


“Does your establishment maintain an intranet?” The first mention of “intranet” is July 1995, in a

technology-centered article that says that this technology is coming. There are a few articles from

August – October 1995 that tell about companies that start to use the intranet.


“Does your establishment use data warehousing?” ABI automatically searches for “data storage” when

searching for “data warehouse”. The first ever mention of data storage is 1989, and there are various

other mentions of this term in 1991. The term “data storage” gets to be widely used in 1991. The first

mention of “data warehouse” is from 1992 (although this is in a highly technical context: What can

various software do?). The first mention outside a technical IT journal mention is also from 1992.


“Does your establishment use electronic performance support systems?” First mention in October

1991 as electronic performance support system; first mention March 1991 as performance support

system; First mention in January 1991 as “human resource information system.” These are conceptual

articles with practitioner-oriented articles appearing much later.
