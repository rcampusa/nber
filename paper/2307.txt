                U.S. Firms in Latin American Service Industries




                                    ABSTRACT




       The participation of U.S. service industry firms in Latin American
 markets for services consists
                                mainly of the activities of U.S.-owned affi—
  hates operating in Latin America and very little of direct exports of ser-
 vices from the U.S. The important
                                     policy issues thus involve barriers to the
 establishment and operation of affiliates in host countries rather than
 trade barriers. Since direct investment
                                          rather than trade is at issue, the
 comparative advantages that are important are those of U.S. multinational
 firms rather than those of the U.S. as a country.

     The characteristics we observe in U.S. multinationals in these
industries, particularly their low R & D intensity, are not those usually
associated with the comparative advantages of U.S. multinationals. However,
their skill intensity -is relatively
                                     high. A more detailed breakdown of the
sector does show at least some industries,
                                            particularly in finance, in which
skill levels are very high, and these are the most likely candidates for
major gains for U.S. multinationals.
                                      Nevertheless, u.s. shares in the Latin
American service sector are very small overall and not likely to reach the
levels in manufacturing or petroleum in the foreseeable future.

  1. Introduction

      What is referred to as trade in
                                        services has recently been given a pro-
  minent place on the international
                                      policy agenda. To a large extent this is
 a result of the current efforts of the
                                           U.S. government to reduce barriers
 to such trade. Many developing
                                  countries have opposed such liberalization,
 arguing that it would benefit mainly the
                                             developed countries. The reason
 for this, they claim, is that the
                                      international comparative advantage of
 the developed countries has shifted from goods to services (see
                                                                 Bhagwati,
 1986, for a discussion).

     Given the characteristics of most
                                          service industries, discussed below,
 and particularly the fact that much of their output is nontradable,
                                                                     we

 suggest here that what is at issue is not so much
                                                      the liberalization of
 trade in services as liberalization of
                                          entry into developing_country ser—
vice industry markets by multinational firms from developed countries,
                                                                              if
that is the case, the comparative
                                     advantage that -is relevant is that of
multinational firms from developed
                                      countries rather than that of the deve-
loped countries themselves.

   In this paper we examine the characteristics of U.S. multinational

firms in service industries. We ask whether these characteristics are

likely to imply strong competitiveness and comparative advantage for these

multinationals relative to developing host countries, using Latin America,

including the Caribbean, as a point of reference. We also estimate the

importance of U.S. foreign direct investment in the Latin American service

sector by relating output and employment of U.S. owned affiliates to total

host country output and employment -in a few individual service industries in

various Latin American countries. The study is based on data for 1982, since

these are the most comprehensive and detailed service industry data available

for U.S. firms.

2. The Tradability of Services

    The whole issue of trade -in services has been muddled by the failure to

distinguish among several versions of what constitutes this trade: 1) ser-

vice transactions that cross national borders (e.g. architectural work by

an architect in New York for a builder in Saudi Arabia); 2) service tran-

sactions that do not cross borders, but involve buyers and sellers who are

residents of different countries (tourism) and are therefore defined as

service items in the balance of payments; and 3) service indust activi-

ties in a country by firms owned by Foreigners.

    Of these three types of activity, the first is very minor, outside of

the transactions that take place within multinational Firms. Those within

multinational firms mostly involve goods industries rather than service

industries and, in any case, are ancillary to the sale of goods. The

second type, consisting mainly of tourism and transportation, is a major
                                     -3—

 item in the balance of payments, but is not the focus of demands for

  liberalization. it is the third group that is most important, at least to

 the United States. It involves a set of industries in which the U.S. con-

 siders itself to have some comparative advantage, and it accounts for

 almost all the service industry sales to foreigners by U.S. firms. It is

 therefore likely to be the center of any set of negotiations.

     To understand the U.S. interest in negotiations on service trade, we

 thus have to examine the service-industry activities of U.S. firms

 operating overseas. The total sales of U.S.-owned overseas affiliates in

 trade and service industries, broadly defined, amounted to over $450

 billion in 1982 as compared with $359 billion in manufacturing, less than

 $200 billion in petroleum and coal production, and $23 billion in other

goods-producing industries. That figure undoubtedly exaggerates the amount

of U.S. firms' activity in foreign service industries for several reasons.

One is that it includes wholesale and retail trade, the sales of which con-

sist to a large extent of commodities with relatively little service value

added. Excluding these industries, although they do involve a substantial

amount of service output, still leaves over $180 billion in service

industry sales. This is far larger than direct U.S. service export tran-

sactions ($28 billion for travel and transportation and about $9 billion

for other nonfactor services aside from royalties and fees). Thus, outside

the travel and transportation area, the sale of services by U.S. firms to

buyers outside the U.S. is performed almost entirely by U.S. controlled

firms operating in foreign countries, that is, by direct investment rather

than by international trade (for more details on this point, see Kravis,

1985, and Lee and Naya, 1986).

3. Characteristics of U.S. Multinationals in Service Industries

    Services have become much more important in U.S. direct investment over

the last 30 years or so, and account for approximately a third of total

U.S. direct investment today (Lipsey, 1987).1 The finance part of the ser-

vice sector, in particular, grew very rapidly, as did wholesale trade to a

lesser extent. Other service industries involved only a small part of

investment.

    Service industries are often thought of as being labor-intensive and as

employing relatively unskilled and poorly educated workers. These

industries are also expected to invest little in research and development

and to participate hardly at all in international trade. They are someti-

mes, in fact, referred to as the nontradables sector of an economy.   If the

service industries were, in fact, characterized by low physical capital,

human capital, and R & D intensity, it would be surprising to find that

these industries would be the ones in which firms from advanced countries

would have any comparative advantage. Developing countries would have

little to fear, and also little to gain, from giving them free access to

their markets.


3.1 Service Industry Parent Companies

    The characteristics of parent companies are of interest, because they

describe the attributes of the firms that are carrying out the investment

in service industries in other countries. Presumably, these parent charac-

teristics reflect at least some of the firm-specific advantages that the



   1The definition of the service sector varies among authors who write
about it (see Stigler, 1956, Fuchs, 1968, and Kuznets, 1966). A very broad
definition of the service sector would be that it encompasses all the
industries not covered in the goods-producing sectors. That could include
                                    —5-


 affiliates bring with them. Ideally, we would describe the characteristics

 of parents of service-industry affiliates, but the data we have refer

 instead to service industry parents of affiliates in all industries. These

 parents own mainly service industry affiliates, but do not include, for

 example, those parents that are in manufacturing or mining, but own affi-

 liates in service industries.

    The information available for parents is much more limited than that

for affiliates. We can, however, say something about factor intensities,

average size, foreign trade, and technological inputs and income.

    With respect to physical capital intensity,2 the comparison between

parents in service industries and parents in manufacturing or extractive

industries is very sensitive to the definition of service industries. The

reason is that the physical capital intensities in services vary over a

tremendous range, far larger than that in manufacturing, and the inclusion

or exclusion of an industry can easily reverse the results of a comparison.



construction, government, transportation, communication, and public utili-
ties, as well as trade, finance, and personal and business services. We
will concentrate our attention on narrower versions of the service sector.
We exclude government entirely, since it is not a field for direct invest-
ment, and we exclude public utilities and transportation, because these are
not usually counted in the service sector, and because they are government-
owned in many countries. We are inclined to exclude wholesale trade, or at
least segregate it, in studying investment, because U.S.-owned wholesale
trade affiliates are mainly sales affiliates of U.S. manufacturing com-
panies, and their sales are largely commodities. We exclude holding com-
panies, where possible, because they are basically a conduit for U.S.
investment rather than a part of host-country service industries. They
might hold portfolio investments or, if they control foreign companies,
those would appear under their appropriate industry categories. Finance
operations in the Netherlands Antilles are excluded because they are also
largely conduits, in this case for their parents' borrowing.

   2The measure of physical capital intensity we use here is the value of
net property, plant, and equipment divided by the number of employees.
(For a fuller discussion, see Kravis and Lipsey, 1986). A drawback of the
number employed as the labor input measure is that it ignores differences
                                      -6-


    Parent firms in trade and services including transportation, com-

munication, and public   utilities   (T.C. and P) are more physical capital

intensive than those in manufacturing or all industries combined (see Table

1). However, once the T.C. and P. group is removed, the remaining service

industry parents seem to be relatively labor intensive on average, even if

the capital-intensive real estate industry is included.

    Our measure of human capital intensity has far less variance than that

of physical capital intensity. As can be seen in Table 2, parents in trade




among industries in the quality of the labor force. We chose to treat these
differences in quality as representing differences in human capital or skill
intensity, rather than differences in labor input.

 and services are below average in human capital intensity and below those in

 manufacturing, but again, they straddle the other groups. Parents in some

 of the service industries, such as the ones related to petroleum, nonbank-ing

 finance, advertising, and management consulting are above manufacturing

 parents and all parents -in human capital intensity.

    Service industry companies are often pictured as being relatively

small—scale operations. In fact, as measured by assets, service industry

parents are, on the average, large in comparison with manufacturing parents

or with parent companies -in general (see Table 3). The high average asset

size of service industry parents reflects mainly the inclusion of banking

parents (average assets over $7.5 billion), other finance (almost $3
                                   -8—

billion), retail trade, and petroleum wholesale trade, all larger on the

average than manufacturing parents. However, parents in non-petroleum who-

lesale trade and in other services were smaller than those in manufac-

turing, on average.

3.2 Characteristics of U.S. Affiliates in. Latin American Service Industries

    A distinctive characteristic of U.S. investment in services in deve-

loping Western Hemisphere countries is that the number of U.S. parents is

small, except in a few financial centers. In those few, however, the

number of parent firms is very large. For example, of 151 U.S. parents

that had any banking affiliates abroad in 1982, almost all (135) had one or

more in developing Western Hemisphere countries (mainly in the Bahamas or
                                        —g-

  in British Caribbean islands), but
                                       only 71 had banking affiliates in Europe.
  Of 710 U.S. parents that had any affiliates in finance other than banking,

  including insurance and real estate, almost 500 had affiliates in Latin

 America or other Western Hemisphere
                                        developing countries. Principally these
 were located in Bermuda and the Netherlands Antilles, but also in Panama,

 the Bahamas, and the British Caribbean islands. Outside of these cases the

 numbers of parent companies in most countries were very small.

      The measures of the size of service industry
                                                        operations available
  directly from the data are assets, sales,
                                                 employee compensation, employment
  and the amount of direct investment.
                                           Assets are usually presumed to reflect
  capital input in the affiliate's host
                                           country, but they may not. The assets
  may not be located -in the affiliate's host
                                                 country. They may not be inputs
  into production in the affiliate's
                                        host country. They may, in fact, even be in
 the U.S. in some cases.

     Sales in many cases, particularly -in wholesale trade, include large

 amounts of goods imported by the foreign affiliate, and therefore

 exaggerate the amount of production that takes
                                                     place in the affiliate's
 country. Employment and employee compensation both reflect labor input, and

 employee compensation has the advantage of
                                                 combining crude labor input with
 a measure of the average quality of labor.
                                                  It is omitted from the table
 only because the shares are very similar -in these aggregates to employment

 shares. Direct investment reflects
                                        the parents' investment in the foreign
operations, but not the output of foreign labor
                                                     or of capital financed by
borrowing in the market or from other non-U.S. sources.

    From these data we find that service
                                            industries including finance and
retail trade, but excluding
                             banking in the Caribbean, accounted for 40 per
cent of the total assets employed -in
                                      Latin American affiliates. These were
mainly in banking and a large part of the assets was not provided by U.S.

investors. This group of industries
                                        accounted for only 30 per cent of U.S.
investment, however, and less than 15 per cent of labor input and sales. If

we include bank services -in the
                                   Caribbean, the shares measured -in assets and
sales are significantly higher.

                                                    and U.S. investment, and
accounted for less than 6 per cent of assets, sales

less than 10 per cent of employment.

    Within the service sector, banking was a large part (see Table 6).
                                                    banking was almost half of

places, two relatively low-wage and low-skill industries, were relatively

unimportant measured by assets, under 6 per cent, but accounted for about

half of service industry employment in Latin America.

  3.2.2.   Factor intensities

      The capital intensity of parents does
                                               not necessarily carry over to
  their foreign affiliates if the firm can split its activities into dif-

 ferent types and carry them on at different
                                                locations. In fact, the physi—
 cal capital intensities of parents do not carry over to affiliates
                                                                    very
 precisely, although the 5 industries in which
                                                  parents' physical capital
 intensities were highest were also the ones in which affiliate capital

 intensities were highest (Appendix Tables 8 and 9). The correlation was much

 stronger for skill or human capital intensities.
                                                      Over the whole range of
 industries, higher skill intensity in parents was associated with high skill

 intensity in affiliates. There are two ways in which this could come about.

One is that skill intensity is
                                 an industry or firm characteristic that is pre-
sent wherever the firm operates. The other
                                                is that high skill intensity firms
concentrate their operations in high wage countries. Within Latin America,

the former explanation seems to be the
                                         predominant one. There, the skill
intensive U.S. industries by and large have affiliates with high compensation

per worker. However, the latter factor does operate to some extent. That is,

within the service sector, the industries
                                             with lower skill levels, such as
hotels and lodging, real estate, and miscellaneous business services, are

somewhat more heavily represented among affiliates in Latin America than
                                                                         among
all U.S. affiliates around the world. Furthermore, some of the high—skill

industries, such as management consulting,
                                             finance other than banking, and

advertising, are relatively little represented in Latin American affiliates of

U.S. firms (see Appendix Table 9).

   As might be expected, affiliates in the trade and service sector were
                                   — 14 -




not particularly physical-capital intensive (see Table 7). However, ser-
vice industries, broadly defined, were heavier users of physical capital

than manufacturing industries. A disaggregatiofl, as in the case of service

industry parents, identifies the source of the high capital intensity: the

transportation, communication, and public utility industries, with over

$100,000 in physical assets per worker and, not far behind, petroleum who-

lesalers. Aside from those, the trade and service sector was a little less

capital-intensive than manufacturing, but the margin was not large for most

service industries. Low physical capital intensity has not been a par-

ticular feature of service industry affiliates.

     The stereotype of service industries mentioned earlier is similarly not

 supported by data on average compensation in affiliates, our measure of

  human capital intensity. Table 8 shows that
                                              average compensation (average
  human capital per employee) was a little higher in trade and services than

  in all industries and manufacturing.   The same was true for most individual
 service industries. The only really low-wage industry in the group was

 retail trade, and several of the industries
                                                   paid quite high wages.

    Within Latin America, the skill intensity of service industries was

again above the average for all industries and that for manufacturing. And

here too, the only outstandingly low—skill
                                                 industry was retail trade. By
and large, the lower—skill industries in Latin America were the same ones

as in affiliates as a whole (see Appendix Table
                                                     9).

3.2.3.   R & 0 and export intensities

   A characteristic of firms that is sometimes referred to as a factor

intensity, or as something close to it, is the R&D intensity, measured in

various ways. A typical one, on which we have data for majority-owned

affiliates, is the ratio of R&D expenditures to sales. Service industries

are not usually considered leaders in this respect and the data for affi—

hates support this impression.

    U.S. affiliates in all industries invest relatively little in R&D, as

compared to parents, and affiliates in services, by any definition, invest

less than those in manufacturing. Affiliates in Latin America, in every

service industry shown, and in petroleum and manufacturing also, spend much

less on R&D than those in other countries relative to their sales, typi-

cally about a third as much or even less (see Table 9). Thus, the picture

of service industries as being little involved with R&D is confirmed, espe-

cially for affiliates, and even more for affiliates in Latin America.

    On a less detailed industry classification we can also examine the

export propensities of service industry affiliates.     Overall, as Table 10
shows, the trade and service sector does not appear to be less oriented to

exporting than the manufacturing or petroleum sectors. As with respect to

other characeerstjcs, the service sector is extremely heterogeneous.

Affiliates in wholesale trade are more export oriented than those in manu-

facturing, even though they are mainly distributors of manufactured pro-

ducts. And finance affiliates in the Caribbean countries are almost

entirely involved -in the sale of services outside their host countries. In

these cases, not only the sale, but also much of the production of services

appears to take place outside the host countries, to the extent that one can
                                   — 18 -




even attribute production to a location in some of these industries. That is

suggested by the small amount of employment relative to the sales or assets of

affiliates located in these countries. Affiliates in other service

industries, including finance affiliates outside the Caribbean, other ser-

vices, and retail trade, do export relatively little, although the proportion

is not insignificant——20 per cent for affiliates in services other than

finance.

    Latin American affiliates in petroleum are much more export-oriented

than others, and those in wholesale trade a little more than average. The

distinctive feature of affiliates in Latin America is the very low export

orientation of manufacturing affiliates. Those in nonfinancial service

industries are also relatively uninvolved in exporting.

    In sum, we find little support in the data on U.S. multinationals for
                                        - 19   —




  the usual picture of the service sector
                                          as being composed of low-Skill,
  labor-intensive industries serving
                                       only host-country markets. The service
  sector is extremely heterogeneous, but the general impression from our

  investigation is that multinationals
                                         producing services are not, on the
  average, very different from other multinationals
                                                      in physical capital inten-
  sity and their export orientation, but they are somewhat more skill-

  intensive than others. Affiliates in finance and wholesale trade are

 heavily involved in exporting, while those in other services and retail

 trade are not. The picture of service
                                           industries as being little involved
 in R & 0 is, however, confirmed,
                                    especially for affiliates, and even more so
 for affiliates in Latin America.
                                      Otherwise, U.S. service industry affi-
 liates in Latin America (excluding
                                      Caribbean banking) were found to be
 rather similar in their characteristics to those in other areas.

 4. U.S. Affiliates' Share of Latin American Service Sectors

     Despite the recent concern in many Third World countries about foreign

direct investment in service
                               sectors, very little is known about the extent
to which foreign firms participate in the production of services in these

developing countries. The available data do not permit any detailed exami-

nation of this issue for Latin America
                                          as a whole, but the meager published

data, relatively aggregated and far from perfect, give a rough idea of the

share of value added in Latin American
                                         service sectors that is accounted for
by U.S. affiliates (see Table 13). These shares are somewhat underestimated

since the "value added" for U.S. affiliates that can be calculated from the

published u.s. direct investment surveys does not include interest payments

and depreciation, although these were collected. However, the inclusion of

these missing items could not change the overall picture.

    These calculations suggest that U.S. affiliates accounted for over 93

per cent of the production of financial services in Latin America in 1982.

However, that figure is dominated by U.S. banking activities in the Caribbean.

Aside from these, the percentage share is only 25 per cent. Their share of

wholesale and retail trade was a bit over one per cent, while that in

transportation and communication, which we do not generally include in ser-

vices, was only a third of a per cent. Thus, U.S. multinationals' share of

service production in Latin America seems to be very low, and much lower than

their share of manufacturing production.

    The impression that U.S. affiliates play a relatively unimportant role

in Latin American financial services carries over to figures for individual

countries. As Table 14 shows, their share of both value added and

employment was less than 2.7 per cent in all the reporting countries for

which data are available.

    However, one should not forget that the Latin American service sector

is highly heterogeneous, and our data on the size of aggregate service produc-

tion include not only a wide variety of services, but presumably also a high

degree of informal sector activities. Therefore, despite their lOW share of

aggregated services, U.S. affiliates may play an important role in some

"modern't parts of these service industries. Furthermore, the role of foreign

firms in Latin American banking and finance may be much more important than is

indicated by production or employment because the U.S. branches may function

as a bridge between the international capital markets and the host countries.

5. Concluding Remarks

   The participation of U.S. service industry firms in Latin American

markets for services consists mainly of the activities of U.S.-owned affi-
                                   — 22   —




hates   operating in Latin America and very little of direct exports of ser-

vices from the U.S. The important poicy issues thus involve barriers to

the establishment and operation of affiliates in host countries rather than

trade barriers. Since direct investment rather than trade is at issue, the

comparative advantages that are important are those of U.S. multinational

firms rather than those of the U.S. as a country.

    The characteristics we observe for U.S. service-industry multinationals

as a group are not those usually associated with multinational firms! com-

parative advantages. In particular, those firms are much less R & D-

intensive than those in goods production. The characteristic that does

suggest the possibility of multinationals! comparative advantage is the

somewhat higher skill level in service-industry multinationals than in goods

industry firms. Of course, a more detailed breakdown of the service

industry sector would reveal some much more skill-intensive subgroups, and

in some of these there may be large multinational company advantages.

    Some rough calculations of the U.S. participation in Latin American

service production also suggested that the role of multinationals may have

been exaggerated in the public debate. U.S. affiliates accounted for only

an extremely small proportion (less than 3 per cent) of the production of

financial services in Latin America, and their share in wholesale and

retail trade was only a bit over one per cent. But again, a more detailed

breakdown of the data would probably show that multinationals play an

important role in certain service industries.

    As far as we can see, the importance of liberalization of "trade in

services" to both developed and developing countries has probably been
                                   — 23 -




exaggerated.   (For a similar view, see McCulloch, 1987.) For one thing, the

term "trade in services" is a misnomer; there is very little such trade.

Almost all the issues involve market access through direct investment.

While these issues may be important to a few industries, particularly finan-

cial services, it seems unlikely that any great gains to the balance of

payments of the U.S. or great gains or losses for developing countries are

at stake.
