                       Has the Rate of Investment Fallen?



                                    ABSTRACT



     Although the ratio of gross fixed nonresidential investment to GNP

has decreased very little since the late 1960's, the corresponding net

investment ratio declined by nearly 40 percent between the second half

of the l960's and the second half of the 1970's. Four—fifths of this

decline was due to the increased ratio of depreciation to GNP and only

one—fifth to the decreased ratio of gross investment to GNP. The increased

ratio of depreciation to GNP was in turn due in equal amounts to the higher

ratio of capital to GNP and to the higher rate of depreciation. Nearly

half of the higher depreciation rate was due to the increased rate of

depreciation of equipment and nearly half to the increased share of equip-

ment in the capital stock.

                There has   been   widespread concern in recent years about the decline in

 the rate of investment. Experts like Denison (1979) and Baily (1980) have

 pointed to the slow growth of the capital stock as one of the reasons for the

 slowdown in productivity growth. But, at the same time, the official Department

 of   Commerce figures released in 1980 and 1981 indicate that the ratio of       fixed

nonresidential       investment    to gross national product has shown virtually no trend

 since the late 1960's and was actually higher in 1979 (0.110) than it had been           in
1969    (o.ioy).    More generally, the ratio of fixed nonresidential investment to

GNP was virtually the same in the last half of the 1910's (0.103) as it had been

in the last half of the 1960's (0.106).

                The apparent conflict between these two views of investment is easily

reconciled: the ratio of gross investment to GNP has been relatively stable

while net investment has declined significantly. The fall in net nonresidential

investment has been particularly sharp. The relevant figures are compared in

the    first four columns of Table 1.1 Colunn        1 shows the stability of the ratio

of    gross private investment to GNP. This ratio declined by only seven percent
from its average of 0.159 in the second half of the 1960's to 0.i18 in the
second    half of the 1970's.        The same picture of stability emerges if housing and

 inventories are ignored and attention is limited to gross fixed nonresidential

 investment. Column 2 shows that the ratio of gross fixed nonresidential invest-

 ment to GNP averaged 0.106 in the peak years of the second half of the 1960's

 and then fell by less than three—percent of its value to 0.103 in the second

 half of the 1970's.

           The decline in net investment was much sharper. The ratio of total

 net private investment to GNP (column 3) declined by more than 30 percent (from

0.077 in the late 1960's to 0.052 in the late 1970's) while the ratio of net

fixed nonresidential investment to GNP (column 1) fell nearly 40 percent (from

0.0I2 to less than 0.026). The absolute declines in net investment were larger

than the corresponding absolute declines in gross investment: 0.025 for net

private investment versus 0.011 for gross private investment and 0.016 versis

0.003 for fixed nonresidential investment. Since net investment is generally

less than one—half of gross—investment, the proportional declines are relatively

larger.

          The decline in net investment affected both structures and equipment.

The figures in column 5 show that net investment in nonresidential structures

fell from 2.0 percent of GNP in the second half of the 1960's to only 0.8 per-

cent of GNP in the second half of the 1970's. Jiring the same period, net

investment in nonresidential equipment fell from 2.2 percent of GNP to 1.8 per-

cent of GNP.

          The sharp fall in net fixed nonresidential investment implied an even

sharper fall in the rate of growth of the net stock of nonresidential fixed

capital. Column 7 shows that this growth rate averaged 5.7 percent in the

second half of the 1960's but only 3.2 percent in the second half of the 1970's.

Although the final years of the decade showed a slight improvement, the rate was
still down substantially from the values for earlier decades.
            Although the comparison of gross and      net   investment rates eliminates
the   apparent inconsistency between the two views of investment behavior, it

raises the new puzzle of why net investment declined so sharply while gross

investment declined so rrnich less. Two factors account for this difference.

First, since net investment is only a fraction of gross investment, any propor-

tional fall in gross investment appears as a substantially greater proportional

fall in net investment. Second, since the difference between gross investment

and net investment is depreciation, the rapid fall in the net investment ratio

reflects a corresponding rise in the ratio of depreciation to GNP.


1. Decomposing the Net Investment Decline

            The decline in net investment can be decomposed more precisely into

the fall in gross investment and the rise in depreciation. Let IN/X be the

ratio of net investment to GNP and let iG/X and D/X be the corresponding ratios

for gross investment and depreciation. The gross and net investment ratios for

fixed nonresidential capital are shown in colums 2 and L            of   Table 1; the

corresponding     depreciation ratio is shown in column 1 of Table 2. The

In the last half of the 1960's, 1G/X averaged o.io6, iN/X averaged 0.02, and

therefore D/X averaged o.o61. The 1G/X ratio declined over the next decade to

0.103 in the last half of the 1910's, a fall of 2.8 percent. The Dlx ratio rose

during this interval by 20 percent to 0.077. Substituting these values into the

first term of equation (2) implies that the decline in gross investment contri-

buted —0.028 (0.106/0.0I2)        —0.011; i.e. ,   if the depreciation—to—GNP ratio had
remained constant, the decline in gross investment would have caused net invest-

ment to fall by 7.1 percent. Similarly, substituting the depreciation values

into the second term of equation (2) implies that the increase in depreciation

contributed —0.20 (0.06/.02) = —0.305 to the decline in net investment.

Together these two terms imply a net investment fall of —0.376, slightly less

than the observed fall of —0.381; the difference reflects the first—order

approximation nature of equation (2) as well as rounding errors in the original

terms. The values of —0.071 and —0.305 imply that the fall in gross investment

accounts for about 19 percent of the fall in net investment while the rise in

the depreciation—to—GNP ratio accounts for about 81 percent of the fall.

Adjusting the two components proportionately so that they sum to the actual

change of —0.381 implies values of —0.072 and —0.309.

              The rise in the depreciation—GNP ratio can itself be usefully decom-

posed into the change in the depreciation rate (i.e., the ratio of depreciation

to the   net capital stock, D/K) and the change in the capital—GNP ratio (K/x).
Table 2   provides annual data disaggregated into equipment and structures on the

depreciation    rate (colums   2 through   4) and on the net capital stock as a percent

of GNP (columns 5 through 7). The       identity

 implies the first order approximation in rates of change

 (14)    d(D/X)         d(D/K)    d(K/X)
                    =            + K/X
          D/X            D/K

 In the second half of the 1960's, the depreciation rate for all fixed nonresi-

 dential capital averaged 8.7 percent. This rose to 9.5 percent by the second

 half of the 1970's. This implies d(D/K)/(D/K)0.O92.          Over the same period,

 the ratio of capital to GNP rose from 0.1314 to O.805.- This 9.7 percent rise in

 the capital—GNP ratio thus contributed d(K/X)/(K/X)=O.097 to the rise in the

 depreciation—GNI ratio. Thken together, the two terms account for a rise of

 18.9 percent in the depreciation—GNP ratio.2 Since the rise in the

depreciation—GNP ratio contributed —0.309 to the decline in the ratio of net

investment to GNP, the rise in the depreciation rate (D/K) contributed

 (O.092/o.189)(—O.309) = —0.150 to the decline in the net investment ratio while

the rise in the capital—GNP ratio contributed (0.091/0.189) (—0.309)        —0.159 to

the net investment decline. Thus the rise in the depreciation rate and the rise

in the capital—GNP       ratio contributed about equally to the higher ratio of depre-
ciation to   GNP.

          The rise in the depreciation rate can itself be traced to the changing

mix of equipment and structures as well as to the faster depreciation rate for

equipment. Since equipment depreciates more rapidly than structures, a shift in

the composition of the capital stock from structures to equipment increases the

overall rate of depreciation. The relative importance of the changing composition



1-The ratio of net capital to GNP peaked at 0.838 in 1975 and then began to
decline. The rise in K/X reflects the investment boom of the middle and late
1960's and the relatively low level of depreciation in those years.

2This falls short of the 20 percent rise in D/X because of rounding errors and
the first—order nature of equation 14.

and changing depreciation rates can be               calculated from the identity:

                            (1-e)
          —
where De/E and D5/S are the depreciation rates of equipment and structures, and

e   is the fraction of the net capital stock that is equipment. Column 8 of               Table

2   shows annual values of e. Equation 5              implies   that the proportional rise in
D/K can be calculated as:
                                                                    De         D5

Substituting      the levels of the second half of the           1960's and the changes between
them    and the levels of the second half of the 1970's implies

(fl        d(D/K) = 0.429 (0.009) + 0.571 (o.ooi) + 0.079                (0.0)48)

                   = O.04)4 +     0.007 + 0.0)4)4.

Thus,    the change in the rate of equipment depreciation raised the overall

depreciation rate by O.O4)4 and thus accounts for nearly half of its rise. By

contrast, the depreciation rate for structures was largely unchanged while the

increase    in the relative importance of equipment in the capital stock also
raised the total depreciation rate by 0.0)4)4. The linear decomposition is of
course   only approximate; the three terms sum to 0.095 while the actual propor-

tional increase in the depreciation rate was 0.092.

            Since the increase in the depreciation rate caused net investment to

decline by 15.0 percent, the rise in the rate of equipment depreciation contri-

buted (0.0)4)4/0.095) (0.150) =         0.0695 of the 0.150. The small rise in the rate of
depreciation of structures added an additional 0.011 while the changing com-

position of the capital stock added 0.0695.

            Table   3 brings together all of the pieces of the overall decomposition
of the decline in net investment into its several components. These figures
indicate that the increased rate of depreciation and the higher capital—GNP
ratio   each accounted for about ItO percent.


2. Caveats and Implications

            The depreciation rates for equipment and structures are calculated by

the Department of Commerce on the basis of very detailed data on the distribu-

tion of gross investment in each year among different types of equipment and

structures. For each type of asset, the Commerce Department uses straight line

depreciation at a rate implied by 85 percent of the Bulletin F life for that

type of asset. Unlike the procedure used for calculating depreciation for tax

purposes, these depreciation calculations are adjusted for increases in the

general price level for investment goods.

            Although this procedure is supposed to measure economic depreciation,

it may well be too conservative. First, the straight line depreciation schedule

probably understates the rate of fall of the value (or remaining productive

capacity) of capital assets. Even if the output of an investment good declines

linearly, the resulting value of the asset would    decline more rapidly.1 Second,
the use of 85   percent of Bulletin F lives probably overstates the useful lives
for   many types of equipment and may understate overall depreciation. Finally,



        i-In particular, a linear decline in output implies a sum—of—the—
years—output decline in the value of the asset.

and perhaps most important for the second half of the 1910's, the jump in energy
costs and other petroleum—related prices undoubtedly made many pieces of equip-
ment economically obsolete sooner than they otherwise would have been. The con-
ventional depreciation rates therefore probably understate the amount of depre-
ciation in the late 1910's. Increasing the assumed rate of depreciation to
reflect these three biases in the current procedure would of course reduce the
implied    rate of net investment and, because of the energy price change, would

increase   the relative decline in net investment   between the late 1960' s and   the

late 1970's. The increased rate of equipment depreciation would in turn account

for a larger fraction of the greater relative decline in net investment.

            The implication for future capital accumulation of the contrast be-

tween   the sharp decline in net investment and   the much milder decline in gross

investment depends on the character of the firms' investment decision process.

If firms make investment plans directly in terms of gross investment (e.g.,

because gross investment is governed by the available cash flow), the sub stan—

tial slowdown in net   investment will partly   reverse itself over time as the

ratio   of the capital stock to GNP falls and thereby reduces the ratio of depre-

ciation to GNP. But even in this case, net investment will nevertheless con-

tinue to be low relative to GNP if firms continue to devote a high share of

gross investment to equipment.

             However, the assumption that firms decide directly on the level of

gross investment is less likely than the view that the rate of gross investment

is a consequence of decisions made in terms of the desired capital stock and of

the attractiveness of particular new investment opportunities. According to

this view, a decline in the desired growth of the capital stock reduces net
                                    —12—


investment directly; the change in gross investment then follows from this

change in net investment in a way that depends on the existing capital stock and

the depreciation rate. If this "net investment" interpretation is correct, the

fall in the net investment rate is not just an unfortunate coincidence but the

result of explicit decisions by firms to reduce the growth rate of the capital

stock. Ej-idence presented elsewhere (Feldstein, 1980) suggests that the

reduced real return on investment and the high real cost of capital have in fact

reduced the incentive to invest and caused the recent decline in net investment.
