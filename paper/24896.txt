Measuring Bilateral Exports of Value Added: A Unified Framework

NBER Working Paper No. 24896
August 2018
JEL No. F1

                                      ABSTRACT

We provide a unified framework for measuring bilateral exports of value added. We
outline a general methodology that encompasses the measures introduced by Johnson
and Noguera (2012) (value added consumed abroad) and Los et al. (2016) (value added
in exports), to which we refer as VAX-C and VAX-D, respectively. In addition we
suggest a novel third measure, VAX-P, which indicates the value added used abroad in
the final stage of production. We show that they can all be derived with the method of
hypothetical extraction in a general input-output model. This is helpful in comparing and
contrasting their characteristics. As a corollary, we show that for VAX-C and VAX-P
the sum of bilateral measures is equal to the corresponding aggregate measure, but that
this is generally not true for VAX-D. We illustrate all measures with empirical examples
computed on the basis of the World Input-Output Database. These indicators can found
at www.wiod.org.

1. Introduction


Which countries are most important in demanding value added of a country? This is a pressing
question for policy-makers seeking for example to (re)negotiate trade agreements or assessing
the domestic consequences of foreign demand shocks. If trade in intermediate products would
be absent, the answer to this question would be simple and could be derived from bilateral gross
export statistics. However, with international fragmentation of production processes, trade
flows need to be measured in value added terms as countries will be exporting and importing
intermediates (Hummels et al., 2001). 1 The main aim of this paper to offer an integrated
discussion on measures of value added in bilateral trade flows. We provide a unified framework
based on an application of the hypothetical extraction method in global input-output tables,
along the lines of Los et al. (2016). We believe that this is helpful in cleaning up terminology,
standardizing concepts and more generally providing clear guidelines which measure to use for
what type of questions.


In particular, we show that the bilateral trade measures introduced by Johnson and Noguera
(2012) (value added consumed abroad) and Los et al. (2016) (value added in exports) are special
cases of a general class of VAX measures. We will therefore refer to these as VAX-C and VAX-
D, respectively. In addition we suggest a novel third measure, VAX-P, which indicates the
value added used abroad in the final stage of production. This is another relevant measure as it
is at this final stage where demand shocks are transmitted to production and associated
intermediates trade flows, as in Bems et al. (2011, 2013). As for VAX-C, there can be flows of
VAX-P between pairs of countries that do not directly trade with each other.


We show that all VAX measures can be derived with the method of hypothetical extraction in
a general input-output model. In addition, the framework will also help to elucidate the
relationship between aggregate and bilateral measures. 2 This is important as currently there are
two alternative definitions of bilateral VAX-D: one suggested by Los et al. (2016) and another


1
  Trade in value added measurement has quickly expanded and broadened into a wider set of so-called
global value chain (GVC) measures. See Johnson (2017) for a general overview. By now, these statistics
are part of the toolkit for trade policy analysis. For example, they are published on a regular basis by the
OECD/WTO Trade in value added (TiVA) initiative and in the WITS (World Integrated Trade Solution)
database.
2
  We use the term “aggregate exports” to refer to the total exports of a country, irrespective of the partner
country. This is to be distinguished from “bilateral exports” that are for a specific destination.

                                                     2
by Wang et al. (2018). We will argue that the first is more suitable for trade analysis as it does
not impose that the sum of VAX-D to all destinations is equal to VAX-D in aggregate exports.
We show that the difference is small empirically (at current levels of international
fragmentation of production processes), but outline the fundamental conceptual difference
which potentially can cause major confusion for users.


The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We will lay out concepts and terminology
through some simple examples in section 2. This is to develop intuition. The actual
computational formulas are given in section 3. Empirical examples for a few large countries
based on data from the World Input-Output Database are discussed in section 4. 3 Section 5
defends our choice for a bilateral VAX-D measure. Section 6 concludes.




2. Concepts and terminology


In this section we will lay out our concepts and terminology, and illustrate these with an
example of a simple sequential production chain (a “snake”). The general insights do not
depend on the example however and as shown algebraically in section 3 they are generally
applicable in any constellation of the production network. 4


Figure 1 depicts a simple production process in which there are four stages of production, each
taking place in a different country. We opt for the most simple constellation through which we
can still illustrate our concepts. Country Z produces an intermediate input (from scratch), used
by country R to produce intermediates, which are subsequently used by country S to produce
an intermediate for country T. Country T is what we call the country-of-completion. This is the
country where the final stage of production takes place. Country U is importing the final good
from Country T and consumes it. 5 In each stage of production 1 unit of value is added to the
product, such that the price paid for the final product is 4.

  A full annual time series (2000-2014) of bilateral measures for 43 countries has been made available
to the research community, via www.wiod.org/gvc#nber.

  It can consist of snakes, spiders or any combination of these (see Baldwin and Venables, 2013, for a
discussion of the differences).
5
  Throughout the paper we will refer to consumption, for ease of exposition. In the empirical analysis,
we consider final use, which does not only include household and government consumption, but also
private and public gross fixed capital formation and changes in inventories.

                                                  3
In Figure 2 we show the input-output table that corresponds to this production chain. The
intermediate use block has the very simple structure of a sequential production chain. 6 Note
that gross output of each product (in the bottom row) is equal to its total use (indicated in the
last column) as required to have a closed system such that use is equal to supply for all
products. 7 In the next section, we will use this IO-table to discuss the complications arising
from “loops”.

With this set-up we next introduce the family of bilateral export measures. These are shown in
Table 1. We only report on those country pairs for which there is a non-zero export flow for at
least one of the measures (so we do not report e.g. on bilateral exports from U to any other

intermediate use matrix by a single non-main diagonal of positive transaction values and zeros

country). We also do not report on Z, as this is not needed for making our main points. The
numbers should be clear from the example, and can be checked using the information in Table
1 with the formulas to be presented in section 3. The first row indicates the traditional gross
flows. The next rows show three different variants of value added exports (VAX): for direct
use (VAX-D), for final stage production (VAX-P) and for consumption (VAX-C).

Note: based on Figure 1


Various alternative indices of bilateral VAX-D have been suggested, e.g. by Hummels et al.
(2001), Los et al. (2016) and Wang et al. (2018). We prefer to use the one suggested by Los et
al. (2016) as will be explained in Section 5. VAX-D is equal to gross exports when all activities
needed to produce the exported good are performed within the exporting country. The share of
VAX-D in gross exports is declining in the amount of intermediates imported by the country in
any domestic stage of production. For R, the share of VAX-D in gross exports is 0.5. Note that
VAX-D includes value added in the export of intermediates (as in exports from S to T) as well
as of final goods (as in exports from T to U).


Johnson and Noguera (2012) introduced the concept of VAX-C at both the aggregate and
bilateral level. Johnson (2014) provides an overview of stylised facts. It is defined as the value
added that is generated in a country but consumed abroad. 8 We refer to it as VAX-C. Unlike
VAX-C, VAX-D includes all value added that crosses the border, irrespective of where it is
ultimately consumed. Considered for the aggregate set of other countries, it is therefore always
at least as large as VAX-C, and strictly larger if some VAX-D is consumed domestically (as


8
 Johnson and Noguera (2012, 2017) refer to it as “value added absorbed abroad”. In the context of
VAX-P and VAX-C, “absorbed by” is ambiguous (as it could be absorbed in the final product, or by the
consumer) and we therefore use the term “consumed abroad” instead.

                                                    5
shown in Koopman et al., 2014). This is not true when considering bilateral flows, however. It
is here that the conceptual difference between VAX-D and VAX-C is most visible. There can
be a bilateral flow of VAX-C between a pair of countries without a direct flow of exports, as in
the case of R to U, or S to U, as indicated in Table 1.


This characteristic of VAX-C has major implications for its use in trade analysis. VAX-C is a
popular measure and used for example by Aichele et al. (2014), Johnson and Noguera (2017),
Kaplan et al. (2018) and Brakman et al. (2018) in studies of the effects of trade agreements.
They relate bilateral VAX-C flows to trade agreements between the two countries involved,
using a gravity equation framework. Using trade flows in value added terms rather than gross
exports is needed indeed. Yet, such analyses should ideally be based on VAX-D rather than
VAX-C flows. 9 This can be explained by referring to the stylized production chain in Figure 1.
A reduction of trade barriers between R and S is commonly supposed to have positive effects
on the bilateral value added exports between these two countries, which is captured by VAX-
D. The effects of a trade agreement between R and U are less obvious, however. Such an
agreement will not reduce trade barriers at borders that are crossed by R's exported value added,
which are the borders between R and S, between S and T and between T and U. The first order
effect of a trade agreement between R and U on the value added exported from R to U is
therefore expected to be nil. Trade barriers at other borders are likely to be much more relevant
and should be modeled as well in the gravity setup, even when one is only interested in the
effects of trade agreements on VAX-C. 10


We introduce a third measure of VAX, namely VAX for final stage production (VAX-P). It is
the domestic value added in exports that is used abroad in the production of a final good. This
is another relevant measure as it is at this final stage where consumption and investment demand
shocks for specific products are transmitted to production and associated intermediates trade
flows, as in Bems et al. (2011, 2013), who studied the causes of the global trade collapse in
2008-2009. There might also be idiosyncratic shocks to the final-stage country, which will
percolate to its trading partners further up the chain. Blanchard et al. (2017), for example,



9
  This might not be surprising, given the fact that VAX-C was the only value added based trade measure
defined at the bilateral level for quite a while. More recently, Dhingra et al. (2018) and Laget et al.
(2018) studied trade policies using VAX-D measures. Unfortunately, they use the measure proposed by
Wang et al. (2018), about which we argue that it has an undesirable property (see section 5).
10
   This point is also made in Noguera (2012).

                                                  6
 analyze the relationships between tariffs on final products sold by specific countries and the
 origins of value added contained in these.


 As a final comment, it should be noted that in principle an unlimited number of related measures
 could be introduced, only bounded by the number of stages in the chain. We view VAX-P as
 the most relevant however (in addition to VAX-D and VAX-C), as it clearly delineates between
 trade in intermediate and in final products. After this stage there is only trade in final goods,
 and before this stage there is only trade in intermediates in the chain. As for VAX-C, there can
 be flows of VAX-P between a pair of countries without a flow of direct exports, as from R to
 T.




 3. A unified framework for bilateral value added export measures


 3a. Preliminaries and notation
 In this section, we show how the three indicators of bilateral exports of domestic value added
 can be computed if a global input-output table is available. The general structure of such a table
 is given by Figure 3.

 In what follows, we will assume that the countries in a global input-output table can be grouped
 into three groups: (i) the country (or group of countries) for which we want to compute VAX-
 indicators, indicated by r; (ii) the country (or group of countries) that acts as the destination of
 the VAX, indicated by s; and (iii) the other countries in the world, indicated by t. In matrix

notation, the input-output structure of Figure 3 can in this context be represented by a limited
number of matrices and vectors: 11

There are M countries, each with N industries. Z is the NMxNM matrix of which the elements
indicate the transaction values of sales among industries in the accounting period, usually a
year. The rows refer to the supplying industries, the columns to using industries. Both
transactions within a country (in the diagonal submatrices) and cross-border transactions (in the
off-diagonal submatrices) are included in this matrix. It should be noted that the submatrices
generally do not have the same dimensions. In order to avoid aggregation biases (Morimoto,
1970), all industry and country detail should be retained in the computations. If r is a single
country, Zrr has N rows and columns. If s is a group of Ms countries, Zss has NMs rows and
columns.


Y is the rectangular matrix of which the elements give the transaction values of sales by
industries to final users. Like in Z, both domestic and international transactions are contained
in this matrix. Since we treat all final use categories (household consumption, gross fixed capital
formation, etc.) in the same way, Y contains M columns (one column for each country). Since
all industries in all countries can sell to final users, the number of rows is NM. The dimensions
of the submatrices vary, depending on the numbers of countries included in r, s and t.


Value added in each of the industries in each country is contained in the NM-vector w, and
gross output levels in the NM-vector x. The well-known input-output identities apply. The sum
of intermediate sales and sales to final users (both summed over countries of destination) equals
gross output, x = Zi +Yi, in which i denotes a summation vector (of appropriate length)
containing ones; the sum of purchases of intermediate inputs and payments for production
factors (value added) also add up to these values, 𝐱𝐱 = 𝐢𝐢′ 𝐙𝐙 + 𝐰𝐰.

The production requirements per unit of output are given by the NMxNM matrix A (for
intermediate inputs) and the NM-vector v (for factor payments):


                 𝐀𝐀𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟    𝐀𝐀𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟    𝐀𝐀𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟                      𝐯𝐯𝑟𝑟

Country r’s GDP can now be obtained by linking value added generation to the final demand
levels in Y by means of Leontief’s demand-driven input-output model:


𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝑟𝑟 = 𝐯𝐯�𝑟𝑟′ (𝐈𝐈 − 𝐀𝐀)−1 𝐘𝐘𝐘𝐘                                                             (2)


in which 𝐯𝐯�𝑟𝑟 denotes the NM-vector that is identical to v as defined in (1) with respect to the part
vr, but in which all other elements are set equal to zero. 12 The matrix (𝐈𝐈 − 𝐀𝐀)−1 is known as the
“Leontief inverse”. It explicitly takes into account that the industry that is producing the final
product often does not only use its own production factors, but also intermediate inputs from
first-tier suppliers. These can be located in the same country, but also elsewhere. First-tier
suppliers generate value added themselves, but might also use intermediate inputs for their
activities. The same goes for second-tier suppliers producing these, and so on. 13


In their comment on Koopman et al. (2014), Los et al. (2016) showed that using a particular
type of the “Hypothetical Extraction Method” (HEM) as pioneered by Paelinck et al. (1965)
and Strassert (1968) can be used to derive VAX-D. 14 The main part of Los et al. (2016) dealt
with the aggregate case, in which domestic value added in the exports of country r to all other
countries is considered at once. They also proposed a bilateral extension, to which we will turn
now.


3b. The hypothetical extraction method (HEM)
HEM-applications usually “extract” industries or countries from input-output structures by
setting corresponding parts of matrices that are involved in the computations to zero. Equation
(2) is then recomputed for the modified matrices: the result is called the hypothetical GDP level.


12
   If the vector v would be used instead, we would obtain world GDP rather than GDP of r.
13
   See, e.g., the appendix of Los et al. (2015) for a more extensive exposition.
14
   See Miller and Lahr (2001) for a comprehensive overview of HEM-based input-output analyses, and
Dietzenbacher et al. (1993) for an application involving multiple countries.

                                                                    9
The difference between the actual and the hypothetical GDP levels is a measure of the
importance of the extracted industry. In computing VAX-D, we do not extract entire industries
(or countries) from the system, but just some transactions. If we are interested in VAX-D
between r and s, we set all elements of Ars and Yrs to zero, assuming that s does not use any
imports of intermediate and final products from r. One might think of this as a situation in which
s sets import tariffs on goods from r that are prohibitively high. We indicate the modified
matrices with a *:


         𝐀𝐀𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟     𝟎𝟎      𝐀𝐀𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟               𝐘𝐘𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟    𝟎𝟎      𝐘𝐘𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟
𝐀𝐀∗𝑠𝑠
  𝑟𝑟  ≡ � 𝐀𝐀𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠   𝐀𝐀𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠   𝐀𝐀𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 �; 𝐘𝐘𝑟𝑟∗𝑠𝑠 ≡ �𝐘𝐘𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠   𝐘𝐘𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠   𝐘𝐘𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 �                     (3)
          𝐀𝐀𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡   𝐀𝐀𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡   𝐀𝐀𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡               𝐘𝐘𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡   𝐘𝐘𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡   𝐘𝐘𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡


Next, we compute the GDP level in r for the situation in which these matrices would have
represented the global production structure and final demand levels:


𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝑟𝑟∗𝑠𝑠 = 𝐯𝐯�𝑟𝑟′ (𝐈𝐈 − 𝐀𝐀∗𝑠𝑠 −1 ∗𝑠𝑠
                             𝑟𝑟 ) 𝐘𝐘𝑟𝑟 𝐢𝐢                                                       (4)


The value added of r contained in direct exports to s is now given by the difference between r’s
actual GDP level and its hypothetical GDP level:


𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 = 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝑟𝑟 − 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝑟𝑟∗𝑠𝑠                                                           (5)


We would like to emphasize that 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝑟𝑟∗𝑠𝑠 should not be seen as the GDP level that would result
if exports to s would be prohibitive. In a general setting with more flexible production and
demand functions, substitution effects will occur. As a consequence, the global production
structure and final demand levels will change and the global production structure after the tariff
shock will not be represented by 𝐀𝐀∗𝑠𝑠       ∗𝑠𝑠
                                   𝑟𝑟 and 𝐘𝐘𝑟𝑟 . 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 should therefore be regarded as an upper

limit to the loss in 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝑟𝑟 and is most meaningful if compared to other scenarios of extracted
transactions. Put otherwise, it is a measure of the relative importance of country s for exports
of value added by r. 15




15
 See, for example, Chen et al. (2018), who measure regional GDP-shares “at risk” to Brexit using this
HEM-approach, but argue that substitution effects will most probably lead to smaller actual GDP losses.

                                                                       10
We now show how VAX-P can be computed in a similar framework by setting elements of one
or more matrices in (2) to zero (see below for a simpler computational formula). VAX-P is the
amount of value added used abroad for final production. If we hypothetically extract all final
demand for output produced by industries in country s, we have


             𝐘𝐘𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓   𝐘𝐘𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓      𝐘𝐘𝒓𝒓𝒓𝒓
𝐘𝐘𝑟𝑟#𝑠𝑠   ≡ � 𝟎𝟎       𝟎𝟎          𝟎𝟎 �                                                 (6)
             𝐘𝐘𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕   𝐘𝐘𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕      𝐘𝐘𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕


and hypothetical GDP in r is given by


𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝑟𝑟#𝑠𝑠 = 𝐯𝐯�𝑟𝑟′ (𝐈𝐈 − 𝐀𝐀)−1 𝐘𝐘𝑟𝑟#𝑠𝑠 𝐢𝐢                                             (7)


For VAX-P, we now have the expression


𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 = 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝑟𝑟 − 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝑟𝑟#𝑠𝑠                                                   (8)


Johnson and Noguera’s (2012) VAX-C indicator can also easily be considered within this
HEM-approach (see below for a simpler computational formula for VAX-C). If we
hypothetically extract all demand by final users in country s, we have


             𝐘𝐘𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟   𝟎𝟎       𝐘𝐘𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟
𝐘𝐘𝑟𝑟&𝑠𝑠   ≡ �𝐘𝐘𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠   𝟎𝟎       𝐘𝐘𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 �                                                 (9)
             𝐘𝐘𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡   𝟎𝟎       𝐘𝐘𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡


The hypothetical GDP-level associated with this extraction reads


𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝑟𝑟&𝑠𝑠 = 𝐯𝐯�𝑟𝑟′ (𝐈𝐈 − 𝐀𝐀)−1 𝐘𝐘𝑟𝑟&𝑠𝑠 𝐢𝐢                                             (10)


and we obtain the following expression for VAX-C:


𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 = 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝑟𝑟 − 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝑟𝑟&𝑠𝑠                                                   (11)


This completes the discussion of the unified framework in which the three measures of bilateral
exports of value added can be presented. The aggregate indicator of VAX-D can be computed


                                              11
by means of slightly modified versions of (3), (4) and (5). 𝐀𝐀∗𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠     ∗𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠
                                                              𝑟𝑟 and 𝐘𝐘𝑟𝑟     are obtained by
simultaneously setting Ars, Art, Yrs and Yrt equal to zero, after which they are substituted for
𝐀𝐀∗𝑠𝑠       ∗𝑠𝑠                          ∗𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠
  𝑟𝑟 and 𝐘𝐘𝑟𝑟 in (4). The result (𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝑟𝑟 ) is then subtracted from actual GDP, as in (5). The

aggregate counterpart of VAX-P is computed by not only setting the row associated with final
demand for output from country s but also the row for output from country t equal to zero in
(6). Finally, setting both columns for consumption in s and in t in (9) to zero, (10) and (11) yield
the aggregate VAX-C.


3c. Simplified expressions for calculation of VAX
So far, we derived VAX measures using the HEM approach. We did this to stress the
relationships between the three VAX indicators. Yet, VAX-P and VAX-C can also be computed
in a simpler way given the fact that it only involves the tracing of parts of the final demand
matrix. Following the exposition by Los et al. (2015), VAX-P from r to s can be expressed as
a simple multiplication with demand for products finalized in s (by any country in the world,
including r):


𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑋𝑋𝑋𝑋𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 = 𝐯𝐯�𝑟𝑟′ (𝐈𝐈 − 𝐀𝐀)−1 [𝐘𝐘𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠           𝐘𝐘𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠   𝐘𝐘𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 ]𝐢𝐢                      (12)


Likewise, Johnson and Noguera’s (2012) bilateral VAX-C from r to s is usually written as:


                                            𝐘𝐘𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟
𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑋𝑋𝑋𝑋𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 =   𝐯𝐯�𝑟𝑟′ (𝐈𝐈   − 𝐀𝐀)   −1
                                           �𝐘𝐘𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 �,                                        (13)
                                            𝐘𝐘𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡


involving only the demand of s for products finalized in any country, including country r itself.




4. Empirical Illustrations


In this section we provide some empirical illustrations of the measures we introduced using the
2016 release of the World Input-Output Database (Timmer et al., 2015). We study the VAX of
some major countries in the world (China, Japan, Germany, United Kingdom and United States)




                                                                          12
as well as some global suppliers of raw materials (Australia and Brazil). 16 We show that
bilateral measures can vary widely across the various measures and provide some intuitive
interpretation. All results are for the year 2014 and values are expressed in million US$. For
background, we first provide a comparison of aggregate measures of GX, VAX-D, VAX-P and
VAX-C in Table 2. Tables A1 to A7 provide for each country the bilateral GX and VAX flows
to each of the 42 partner countries (and the rest-of-the-world region), the share of each partner
in total flows as well as the ranking based on these shares. We highlight some interesting results.

Note: Authors’ calculations based on WIOD, 2016 release.


VAX-D compared to GX
Column 1 in Table 2 confirms the finding of Koopman et al. (2014) that aggregate VAX-D is
smaller than gross exports (GX). Ratios vary from 70 per cent for Germany to 87 per cent for
the US, reflecting the difference in the import content of their exports as stressed by Hummels
et al. (2001). As argued by Koopman et al. (2012), these ratios are likely to be overestimations
if firm heterogeneity is such that more export-intensive firms have lower VAX-D ratios. They
showed that this was the case for China, using data that distinguishes between processing
exports and other firms. 17
       Appendix Tables A1 through A7 provide information on the bilateral VAX-D values.
In general, the rankings of export destinations are similar for the gross exports and the VAX-D
measures. This is not surprising given the nature of the available data. Information on input
requirements generally does not vary across export partners. As a consequence, the
representation of production technologies of exporting industries is not destination-specific,

16
   The measures for all 43 countries included in the 2016 release of WIOD have been made available at
the WIOD website (www.wiod.org/gvc#nber).
17
   The OECD Trade in Value Added database makes this distinction for China and Mexico.

                                                 13
and the WIOD data are no exception. Hence, the VAX-D to GX ratio for a given product is the
same across all partners. The variation in results across bilateral partners thus comes from
variation in the product mixes of exports bundles towards the various destinations. For example,
Canada and Mexico become less important as export partners for the US in terms of VAX-D
compared to gross exports. This is because the US exports to these countries is skewed towards
products with a low VAX-D ratio. On the other hand, China becomes more important for Brazil
as an export destination in terms of VAX-D, because Brazilian exports to China mainly consist
of raw materials which have a very high VAX-D ratio.


VAX-C compared to VAX-D
VAX-D includes all value added that crosses the border, irrespective of where it is ultimately
consumed. From an aggregate perspective, it is therefore always at least as large as VAX-C as
VAX-C only considers value added that is also ultimately consumed abroad (Johnson and
Noguera, 2012). Koopman et al. (2014) showed that the empirical differences are small, and
we confirm this in the second column of Table 2. This is not true when considering bilateral
flows, however, and it is here that the conceptual and empirical differences are clearly visible.
First of all, bilateral VAX-C can be higher than GX, and we find many examples of this, in
particular in exports towards major consumer markets such as China, Japan and United States.
Countries export directly towards these destinations, but also indirectly through other countries
(as also found by Johnson and Noguera, 2012).
       Second, for individual countries, the importance of various destinations do change
compared to VAX-D. For example, South Korea and Taiwan are less important for Japan as
consumers of its value added than as direct export markets, while the US is more important as
a consumer than as a direct export destination. Similarly, Canada and Mexico are less important
for the US, and continental Europe is less important for Germany as consumers than as direct
export destination. These findings confirm the well-documented existence of regional
production networks (see, e.g. Los et al., 2015).


VAX-P compared to VAX-D
The last column of Table 2 provides a comparison of aggregate VAX-P with VAX-D. It reveals
interesting variation across countries. VAX-P must be lower than VAX-D by definition as it
only captures exports of value added that are used in final production abroad. Hence VAX-P
will not include exports of final goods and the ratio of VAX-P to VAX-D will thus be mainly
influenced by the share of intermediate products (including natural resources) in a country’s

                                               14
exports. Not surprisingly, the ratio varies from 47 per cent for China, which exports relatively
little intermediates, to as much as 84 per cent for Australia, which mainly exports primary
intermediates.
       The bilateral measures shown in the Appendix tables reveal additional patterns. The
share of VAX-P going to China is typically (much) higher than the share of VAX-D or VAX-
C going to this country, confirming its important role as a final assembler using intermediates
produced elsewhere. For example, 15.3 per cent of direct VAX from Japan goes to China, yet
19.6 per cent of VAX-P. Similarly, 5.7 percent of US VAX-D goes to China, while 8.1 per cent
of VAX-P. Interestingly, Chinese VAX-P goes more to less advanced countries (such as India,
Indonesia and Mexico) and South Korea (relative to VAX-D or VAX-C shares). Yet the US
and Japan are still the largest receivers of Chinese VAX-P.




5. Which bilateral VAX-D measure to use?


The aggregate concept of value added exports for direct use (VAX-D) has been introduced by
Hummels et al. (2001) and Koopman et al. (2012), and there is unanimous agreement on how
to measure it. 18 This is not true for the bilateral VAX-D measure. Various alternative indices
have been suggested including those by Hummels et al. (2001), Los et al. (2016) and Wang et
al. (2018). We prefer to use the one suggested by Los et al. (2016) because it is the only one
which allows for a situation in which the sum of the bilateral measures across all destinations
is not equal to the aggregate measure. This is so in cases in which an exporting country is
involved in a specific type of “feedback loop” (Miller, 1966). This situation arises if a country
is importing its own value added (embodied in intermediate inputs) from one country to produce
its exports to another country. 19


An example is easily created by replacing country T in Figure 1 by country R, see Figure 4. In
this case, R is importing its own value added that was generated in an earlier stage when
producing its exports to S. The corresponding input-output table is shown in Figure 5.


18
   In fact, Hummels et al. (2001) suggested the complement to VAX-D: the import content of exports,
and referred to it as VS ("vertical specialization"). Koopman et al. (2012) showed that VAX-D is equal
to gross exports minus VS (see also Los et al., 2016).
19
   Value added exported to the final stage, or the final consumer, can obviously never be exported by
the exporting country again. Hence bilateral VAX always sums to aggregate VAX in the case of VAX-
P and VAX-C.

                                                 15
Mathematically, an input-output table has a loop if none of all possible permutation of the
intermediate use matrix yields a triangular matrix, defined as a matrix with exclusively zeros
below the main diagonal. Such permutations must involve simultaneous changes in the order
of the columns and corresponding rows, otherwise the equality of row (use) and column sum
(supply) is violated. 20 In the example of Figure 4, it is clear that there is a loop, as S delivers
intermediates to R and vice versa, hence there is always a positive value below the diagonal
block, irrespective of how the countries are ordered in the table.


In Table 3 we report on the bilateral VAX measures, as well as the aggregate (in the columns
headed by “All”). Again, we only report on pairs of countries for which there is a non-zero flow
for at least one of the VAX measures. The measures for S are not surprising and basically
repeating those for T in the snake example presented in section 2 (see Table 1). R is the country
of interest. It carries out two stages of production, and exports directly to two countries: S and
U. Its gross exports are 6, while it generates only 2 units of value added in the chain. This is
clear from VAX-C: both units are ultimately consumed in U and the sum of the bilateral
measures is equal to the aggregate one. This is also true for VAX-P, which in this case is not so
insightful as R is the country of completion so VAX-P is zero by definition, for all bilateral
pairs as well as in the aggregate sense.

   Chenery and Watanabe (1951) discuss triangularization of input-output matrices in order to make
matrix manipulations computationally less cumbersome (which at that time was of course an important
topic). Simpson and Tsukui (1956) discuss the economic meaning of (block)triangular input-output
tables.

Note: based on Figure 4


The interesting case arises for VAX-D. R exports 1 unit of value added to S, and R exports 2
units of its value added to U: the value added in the second stage of the chain and in the fourth
stage. Yet, the aggregate VAX-D is also 2. This is obvious as R adds only 2 units of value added
to the chain. We now have a case where the sum of the bilateral measures is higher (3) than the
aggregate one (2). The reason is that R exports the value added it generates in the second stage
of the chain twice: first directly to S, and again embodied in exports to U. We therefore refer to
the difference between the sum of the bilateral VAX-Ds and the aggregate VAX-D as the double
count of domestic value added in summing bilateral measures.


In a recently revised paper, Wang et al. (2018, WWZ from hereon) provide an alternative
measure of bilateral VAX-D, which rules out this type of double counts by design. The authors
wish to develop an accounting system in which the overall value added (GDP) of a country is
assigned to (bilateral) export flows in a mutually exclusive way. From that perspective, it is
only natural to impose an aggregation restriction upfront. But there is a cost involved regarding
the measurement of trade relationships. In the WWZ accounting framework, the value added in

                                                      17
exports from R to U would be only 1 unit, not 2. In that way the bilateral measures sum to the
aggregate. This might be justified when accounting for GDP, but it is counter-intuitive from a
trade perspective. If U would no longer demand the final good from R, value added in R will
decline by 2 units, as both stages of production are no longer needed. The hypothetical
extraction method introduced in the previous section provides a mathematical underpinning for
this intuition.
        One could argue (as in WWZ) that by tracing the exports and contributions of different
industries in a country this double counting would be eliminated. Assume that the first task
carried out by R is done in industry R1 (which exports to S), and the second task by industry
(which exports to U). When considering the exports to U one could say that the exports from
R2 contain 1 unit of value added by R2. Yet, it remains true that the aggregate exports from R
contain 2 units of R's value added. Having more detailed input-output tables will thus not
resolve this as long as one wishes to study aggregate exports of a country, rather than of separate
industries in a country.


To be clear, we do not claim that the WWZ decomposition is mathematically “wrong”. As long
as the accounting restrictions are obeyed, an accounting framework is correct. But we do claim
that the decomposition is essentially arbitrary as one can come up with many alternatives that
are equally valid. Without an economic model, it is impossible to defend any choice among
these. This point is also made by Nagengast and Stehrer (2016) and they propose to identify the
trade flow in which value added is actually recorded for the first time in international trade
statistics to allocate value added. Actually, there is a deep and fundamental problem in trying
to allocate value added to gross trade flows. Note that the elements in an IO table are
summations of transactions within a particular time frame, typically a year. It does not record
the sequence of the transactions. This is important to emphasize, because it implies that it is
generally impossible to retrieve the underlying production chain, except in very simple cases
such as a snake (as stressed by Nomaler and Verspagen, 2014). If loops are present, many
different networks can underlie the same IO-table. Hence, it is impossible to allocate value
added to gross flows and any "solution" is essentially arbitrary.


Fortunately in empirical terms, the double counts have (so far) been minor. Table 4 provides
information on the double count in VAX-D. It is defined as the sum of the bilateral VAX-D to
all export partners minus the aggregate VAX-D, expressed as a percentage of the latter. It
follows that this term is not large, and typically less than 1 per cent. The maximum (1.8 per

                                                18
cent) is found for the case of Germany, signifying that this country has sizeable back-and-forth
trade that is bigger than for other countries. The lowest double counts are found for Australia
and Brazil, countries that specialize in exporting natural resources. The value added generated
in mining for exports is generally not returning to these countries in the form of intermediate
inputs.

6. Concluding remarks


In this paper we provided an integrated discussion of three useful measures of value added
exports at the bilateral level: VAX-D as introduced by Los et al. (2016), VAX-C as introduced
by Johnson and Noguera (2012) and VAX-P, a novel measure that indicates the value added
used abroad in the final stage of production. We showed that the measures have different
interpretations, while they belong to the same class of indicators. All can be derived with the
method of hypothetical extraction in a general input-output model. In addition we show that the
sum of bilateral measures for VAX-D might differ from the corresponding aggregate measure
(as opposed to VAX-P and VAX-C). This happens if the country of interest is involved in
feedback loops within production networks, i.e. if the production of exports of a country
requires imported intermediates to which the country contributed value added in upstream
stages of production. This is an inherent feature of intricate production networks. We illustrate
all measures with some numerical examples using the World Input-Output Database and show
that they do not only differ conceptually, but also empirically.



                                               19
        Many extensions are possible, in particular using economic indicators other than value
added, such as labor income or hours worked (see e.g. Chen et al., 2018). Progress will depend
on the further availability of new and improved data sources. The popularity of VAX measures
in the policy arena is not (yet) properly matched by the quality of the available data, as many
gaps and inconsistencies in primary data collection remain. Harmonizing national and
international data collection efforts and institutionalizing their production in regular statistical
programs is a major challenge, see e.g. Landefeld (2015). Ongoing efforts in the international
statistical community towards this goal are therefore very welcome and deserve full support.
