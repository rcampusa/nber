                                          ABSTRACT

We analyze minute-by-minute, individual level data on viewership for Italian TV news
broadcasts (from AUDITELTM), matched with detailed data on content (from Osservatorio di
Pavia). We are interested in the behavior of viewers, and in particular in their decision to switch
away from a news program as a function of the type of story they are currently watching.
Somewhat surprisingly, we find that "soft" news systematically induces viewers to switch away,
even more than "hard" news. On the other hand, sensational stories about crime, accidents and
disasters are associated with less switching. We also find significant differences in this switching
behavior according to gender, age, and the specific TV channel being watched. For example,
young people are relatively more likely to switch away from hard news than soft news, compared
to older people.

            We analyze minute-by-minute, individual level data on viewership for Italian TV news
        broadcasts (from AUDITELTM ), matched with detailed data on content (from Osserva-

        decision to switch away from a news program as a function of the type of story they
        are currently watching. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that "soft" news systematically
        induces viewers to switch away, even more than "hard" news. On the other hand, sensa-
        tional stories about crime, accidents and disasters are associated with less switching. We
        also find significant differences in this switching behavior according to gender, age, and
        the specific TV channel being watched. For example, young people are relatively more
        likely to switch away from hard news than soft news, compared to older people.

1       Introduction
Political scientists and communication scholars have documented a trend in news production
and consumption away from "hard" news--e.g., stories about public policies, the economy,
the general functioning of government, and foreign affairs--towards "soft" news about sports,
fashion, food, travel, celebrity gossip, and the like (Zaller 1999, Patterson 2000).1 This has led
scholars to different conclusions about the consequences of soft news for democratic politics.
Some worry the proliferation of soft news harms civil discourse, public opinion and voter knowl-
edge (Zaller 1999, Patterson 2000, Prior 2003). Others suggest that soft news is beneficial--for
example, by capturing the interest of citizens who otherwise would be inattentive to news, and
thus helping political knowledge "trickle down" to a larger set of citizens (Baum 2002 and 2010,
Baum and Jamison 2006, Prat and Str¨
                                   omberg 2005).
    1
     See Reinemann et al. [2012] for a discussion of how communication scholars have operationalized the
distinction between hard and soft news.


                                                    2
       Empirical studies seeking to document patterns of viewership, or seeking to estimate the
impact of soft news consumption on political knowledge and behavior, are typically based either
on aggregate measures or on survey data. Due to the presence of strong social norms towards
"civic-mindedness," self-reported behavior might not be an accurate indicator of actual news
viewership. Social-desirability bias might lead respondents to systematically overstate their
consumption of hard news and understate how much they watch soft news. Moreover the
amount of over and underreporting could be correlated with both observed and unobserved
characteristics of respondents.2
       In this paper we study the actual behavior of individual news consumers, rather than self-
reports. More precisely, we use the minute-by-minute individual level ratings data for all
major Italian television news broadcasts during the two-year period, January 1, 2009 through
December 31, 2010. These ratings are provided by the AUDITELTM consortium, which uses
meter-based data from Nielsen. In addition to the obvious advantages stemming from the use
of "revealed preferences,"data at the individual level allow us to investigate the details of TV
viewership, with no need to infer individual behavior from aggregate data.
       We match the TV ratings data with equally highly granular data on the issues covered
by Italian national evening news broadcasts, minute by minute. This data is provided by the
Osservatorio di Pavia.3 Merging the two databases tells us which news story each individual in
the sample is watching--or not watching--for each minute of the major evening news programs.
       First, we use this data to describe the overall patterns of news viewership in the Italian TV
audience. Our descriptive analysis reveals heterogeneity in viewing habits and a relatively clear
typology. A substantial share of Italian adults never or rarely watch TV news. A second type
watches the news regularly, and these people often watch the entire program. A third type
watches news more irregularly and often watches only part of the broadcast. Second, the best
predictor of TV news watching is total TV watching. This means that demographic variables
   2
     For example Prior (2009) estimates that US respondents in the National Annenberg Election Study over-
reported their total news consumption threefold, on average. He also finds that the degree of over-reporting
varies significantly across demographic groups.
   3
     The Osservatorio di Pavia (www.osservatorio.it/en) is an independent institute of research that is spe-
cialized on media analysis, with a specific focus on monitoring media freedom and pluralism.



                                                     3
that predict overall TV consumption, such as age, gender and education, also tend to predict
TV news consumption. As a consequence older and less educated people, and women, watch
more TV news than average.
   We then conduct regression analyses to study the minute-by-minute switching behavior of
all TV news viewers. In these regressions the dependent variable indicates whether or not a
given viewer changed channels (or turned off the television) during each minute in which he or
she was watching the news. The key independent variables indicate the type of news story that
was being aired during or just prior to the switch, distinguishing between hard news, soft news
and sensational news stories.
   Our focus is on the difference in the propensity to switch away during a hard news story
than during a soft news story. When we do not include channel-specific fixed effects, i.e., when
looking at the overall variation in switching behavior between and within TV news stories, we
find that the propensity to switch away during a soft news story is systematically higher than
during a hard news story, but for the first 5-minute block. Moreover, this difference in the
propensity to switch away increases steadily as the news program proceeds. We find an even
stronger difference in the propensity to switch away during a soft news story than during a
sensational story.
   When including channel-specific fixed effects, i.e., when exploiting only within-program
variation, the differences in switching behavior when watching hard versus soft news are smaller
than those estimated without channel fixed effects, but they are still significant and sizable in
the last 10-15 minutes of each show. We also find significant differences in the propensity to
switch away during hard versus soft news according to the gender, the age and the specific TV
news show the viewer watches.
   Overall, these findings are inconsistent with the simple hypothesis that TV consumers always
seek entertainment rather than politically relevant information.
   The paper is organized as follows: in the next section we provide some background informa-
tion on the Italian television system and introduce the ratings data and the TV content data.
We also provide basic descriptive statistics and discuss some of the advantages of using data


                                               4
based on actual behavior rather than self-reported information from surveys. In section 3 we
present our descriptive analysis of viewership by type of news, while in section 4 we discuss our
regression results on individual switching behavior. Section 5 concludes by summarizing our
findings and proposing possible next steps.


2         Background and Data
2.1        A Brief Introduction to Italian TV News

In Italy there are seven national channels. Three channels are part of the national broadcasting
corporation (RAI), which is state-owned. A tacit agreement between the main political forces
is that RAI 1 is typically controlled by the government, RAI 2 by the right and RAI 3 by the
left. Three channels--Rete 4, Canale 5 and Italia 1--are part of the Mediaset network and are
controlled by Silvio Berlusconi, who was the leader of the right-wing coalition for two decades
and three times prime minister.4 During the period studied in this paper, 2009-2010, Silvio
Berlusconi was Italy's prime minister and therefore, in addition to the Mediaset Channels, he
also had substantial influence over the RAI 1 and RAI 2 channels. Prime time (20.30-22.30)
audience shares for RAI and Mediaset in 2010 were 44% and 37%, respectively. The main RAI
channel (RAI 1) had a share of about 22.5%, while the main Mediaset channel (Canale 5) had
18.5%. Shares for other times of the day are only slightly different. The last national channel,
La 7, had a small audience share, only about 3%, and is not part of our sample.5 In addition
to these channels, which are available everywhere, there are many local channels and, after the
introduction of the digital signal from 2008 to 2013, many "specialized" digital channels. These
other channels, however, accounted for a small share of the audience in 2009-2010.
        Each of the seven national channels broadcasts several TV news shows during the day. As
in other countries, the most highly watched news shows are in the evening, between 6.30pm and
    4
     In 2009-2010 Silvio Berlusconi owned by far the largest share of the company, and owned more than 50%
until 2005. No other single shareholders owned more than 4%. Berlusconi's son Pier Silvio was vice-president
of Mediaset, and his daughter Marina sat on the administration board.
   5
     From 2001 to 2013, La 7 was owned by Telecom Italia, the former state-owned telecom monopoly. It was
sold to its current owner Cairo Editore in March 2013. La 7's audience share increased considerably in the last
months of 2010.


                                                      5
9.00pm.6 The political leaning of each RAI news show tends to reflect the general orientation of
its respective channel. During 2009-2010, the evening news broadcast of the main state-owned
channel RAI 1, TG1, was controlled by the ruling right-wing coalition led by Silvio Berlusconi.
The news broadcast of RAI 2, TG2, was also controlled by the ruling right-wing coalition, while
RAI 3's news program, TG3, was controlled by the left-wing coalition.7
       There is also some interesting variation inside the group of Berlusconi-owned news broad-
casts. Mediaset 5 is by far the most viewed Mediaset channel. The main news broadcast aired
on Mediaset 5, TG5, was (and still is) more politically moderate in coverage than the TG4
broadcast of Rete 4. It was also more moderate than Studio Aperto, the main news program
aired on Italia 1, which appeals to a younger audience.
       In what follows we will refer to the RAI channels as, respectively, RAI 1, RAI 2 and RAI 3.
We will refer to the Mediaset channels Rete 4, Canale 5 and Italia 1 as Mediaset 4, Mediaset 5
and Mediaset 6, respectively. As shown in Table 2 below, the most popular TV news shows
are RAI 1 and Mediaset 5. Despite its relatively early time-slot, the third most popular show
is RAI 3. Because of its political leaning and focus, the conventional wisdom is that it has an
especially loyal audience.

2.2       The AUDITEL Data

We use individual level, minute-by-minute ratings data for Italian TV, provided by AUDITEL.
We focus on the 24 months from January 2009 to December 2010 and restrict our analysis to
evening TV news broadcasts.
       During this period, AUDITEL collected data from a panel of about 10,000 Set Top Box de-
   6
     In 2010 the evening national news programs began at 6.30pm on Italia 1 (lasting about 25-30 minutes, on
average), at 7.00pm on both RAI 3 and Rete 4 (lasting about 30 minutes on both), at 8.00pm on both RAI 1
and Canale 5 (lasting about 30-35 minutes on both channels), at 8.30pm on RAI 2 (where it lasted until about
9.00pm). These times are the same today, with only a slight change for Channel 4.
   7
     The board of directors of RAI is composed of 9 members. Seven members are chosen by a Parliamentary
committee and therefore reflect the composition of parliament--typically four members are appointed by the
majority and three by opposition parties. The remaining two members, including the director, are nominated
by the Minister of the Economy. The board of directors is therefore clearly composed of personnel which is close
to the main political parties and skewed in favor of the parties in government. Formally, the board of directors
then appoints the directors of the channels and of the news shows. Not surprisingly such appointments are
subject to intense political pressure. Leaving one channel to the opposition is an informal convention.


                                                       6
vices connected to the televisions of about 5,000 families that includes about 15,000 individuals.
Each Set Top Box records second by second if a television is switched on and to what channel it
is tuned, collecting information automatically, continuously, and passively. Each participating
family has a special remote control with buttons for each family member to press when they are
watching TV. The data are collected each night and are processed by 10 AM, when the audience
data are released to televisions and advertisers. The controls included technical verification of
each Set Top Box and analysis of abnormal behavior of TV sets and family members. The
participating families receive no monetary compensation, but they receive an in-kind gift. The
turnover in the panel is about 8-10% per year. New participants are selected from a sample of
100,000 individuals who are interviewed each year to assess the technological equipment and
devices of Italian families, the technologies employed to receive television signals, and the use
of services such as pay TV. The sample is stratified by age, gender, education, and regions.
       One important advantage of the AUDITEL data is that it tracks actual behavior. Much
previous work relies on self-reported data from surveys, which can be highly inaccurate. For
example Prior [2009] shows that U.S. citizens display a strong, systematic tendency to overstate
the frequency with which they watch TV news broadcasts. He does this by comparing the
self-reported frequency of viewership with partially aggregated viewership data from Nielsen
ratings.8 It is likely that the propensity to overstate news consumption is due at least in part
to social-desirability bias.
       It appears that Italians also substantially overstate how much TV news they watch when
they are surveyed. Consider, for example, the widely used Italian National Election Study
(ITANES).9 ITANES asks respondents how many days per week they watch television news,
from zero to seven. We compare these responses with the AUDITEL data in Figure 1.10
   8
     Comparing National Annenberg Election Survey data for 2009 and Nielsen ratings, Prior shows that on
average U.S. citizens overstate TV news viewership by a factor of three. This multiple is as high as eight for
specific subgroups, such as young people aged from 18 to 34.
   9
     ITANES is the Italian National Election Study, see http://www.itanes.org/en/questionnaires/
  10
     Since the AUDITEL data cover 2009 and 2010, we use the closest available ITANES study, which was
conducted in 2008.

       Clearly, there are large differences between actual viewership from AUDITEL and self-
reports from ITANES. While 80 percent of ITANES respondents say they watch the news
every day, according to the AUDITEL data only slightly more than 20% of viewers watch TV
news six or seven days per week. And the percentage actually watching news every day is less
than 3%.11 , 12
  11
     The AUDITEL numbers are calculated as follows. For each individual i and each day t we compute the
total number of minutes the individual watched any TV news show (this includes daytime and late-night news
programs as well as the evening news). If individual i watched at least five minutes of TV news on day t, then
we count that individual as having "watched the news" on day t, and we set wit = 1. Otherwise, we set wit = 0.
We think that a five-minute minimum is a generous lower bound for defining what people mean when they say
they "watch" a program. We then average wit over all days that individual i is in the AUDITEL sample and
multiply by seven to obtain the average number of days of TV news watching per week.
  12
     When answering the question about TV news viewership, ITANES respondents might have in mind all days
during the year, or they might focus on those days when they actually watched some TV. For example, they
might not watch TV while on holiday, and might also disregard those days when answering the question. So,
as a robustness check, we computed the AUDITEL analogue by limiting attention to those days when each
individual watched at least some TV. Computed this way, about 36% of individuals watch at least 5 minutes

    It is also interesting to check the differences between self-reported data and ratings data
along other dimensions. For example, ITANES asks each respondent what is their favourite
TV news program. Assuming each respondent watches only that program, we can construct a
survey-based estimate of the distribution of viewership shares across TV news programs. Figure
2 compares these ITANES-based estimates against the actual, AUDITEL-based audience shares.
Differently from Figure 1, this figure shows virtually no difference between self-reported and
actual news choices across the six main channels.13
    On the other hand, if we consider the total time spent watching television, self-reports in
of TV news 6 days a week, and about 6% watch every day. So, the difference with ITANES data is slightly less
pronounced than what is shown in Figure 1, but still large.
  13
     RAI 1 has the most-watched TV news program both according to AUDITEL viewership and ITANES
self-reported preferences, closely followed by Mediaset 5. RAI 3 is third, followed by RAI 2, Mediaset 6 and
Mediaset 4. If anything, respondents slightly overstate their preference for RAI 1 and understate their preference
for Mediaset 5. These gaps might partially reflect individuals watching a second news show in addition to their
favorite.



                                                        9
surveys are systematically lower than actual viewing behavior. According to AUDITEL data,
viewers watched on average 204 minutes of television per day in 2009, and 207 in 2010. In most
of the available surveys, Italian respondents report that they watch an average of 2.5 and 3.5
hours of television per day. For example, in the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT)
survey of 2010 on time-use, respondents report watching television 181 minutes per day, on
average. The AUDITEL average for that year is 14.4% higher than the self-reports. As in the
case of news consumption, these differences are likely due in part to social-desirability bias.

   The AUDITEL data also show that the total time spent watching television is correlated
with variables such as education, age, and gender. Table 1 reports a few summary statistics--
here we focus on columns 1-3. Individuals with more education spend less time watching

television while older people and women watch more (column 1). These patterns are similar
when we focus instead on time spent watching television news (column 2). Individuals with less
education watch more TV news on average than individuals with more education, and women
watch slightly more TV news than men. In general, the people who watch more television
overall also tend to watch more TV news. The time spent watching news as a share of the total
time spent watching television (column 3) is broadly constant across subgroups, except for age.
Elderly individuals not only watch more television than younger individuals, but they watch
more minutes of TV news as a share of the total time spent watching.
   Using the AUDITEL data we can also compute--for every evening TV news program each
day--the percentage of the show watched by each individual. The distribution of these per-
centages is shown in Figure 3. The histogram is U-shaped, and highest for the right-most bin,
i.e., for those cases where an individual watches over 90% of the program. We report the same
graph separately for each individual channel in Figure A.1, in Appendix A.2. There is some

                                              11
variation across channels, in particular the spikes at the right-hand side of the distribution are
higher for the programs that have more total viewers, i.e., RAI 1, Mediaset 5 and RAI 3.

       Finally, the AUDITEL data also allow us to classify--for each TV news program--the
minutes spent that each individual spends "joining," "staying" on, or "leaving" the program.
We can also detect "surfing," i.e., when an individual leaves a program in minute t and rejoins
in minute t + 1. Summary statistics of these behaviors are displayed in Table 2. By far the most
common behavior is "staying," which accounts for about 92% of all minutes. Thus, evidently
there is a large amount of inertia in viewing. About 5% of total minutes involve "joining" and
only 2.5% involve "leaving." Note that we define "leaving" as leaving before the show ends. So,
although every viewer that watches a show must "join" it at some point, viewers who watch
until the very end are not classified as "leaving" it. The percentage of "staying" minutes is
somewhat larger for the TV news programs with the highest ratings, i.e., RAI 1, Mediaset 5
and RAI 3. Conversely, the percentages of "leaving" minutes is smaller for these programs.14
  14
    The AUDITEL data also allows us to track the dynamics of the audience for each TV news program. Figures
A.2 and A.3 in Appendix A.2 show the raw number of individuals watching each broadcast--a minute-by-minute
stock variable--together with the minute-by-minute flow of individuals leaving or joining that broadcast. For
RAI 1 and Mediaset 5 the stock of viewers increases at a decreasing rate for the first 30 minutes and then
decreases rapidly. For RAI 3 the stock of viewers increases continually throughout the show. The patterns for
the other news programs are more mixed. Importantly, there are no spikes in "joining" behavior at any time
during any of the shows (except at the start), suggesting that there is little or no anticipatory behavior. For
example, it is not the case that a large number of individuals joins a show when the sports or weather segments
typically begin.

2.3       The Osservatorio Data

Recall that we want to study the real-time behavior of TV news viewers as a function of the
type of content that is being shown. Are they more likely to switch away during a hard news
story than a soft news story? To do this, we match AUDITEL data with a database of content
provided by the Osservatorio di Pavia.
      For each of the main evening news programs, the Osservatorio database contains the starting
minute and ending minute of each news story in the program, a short summary of the story,
and a classification of the main issue or issues covered in that story. The summaries and issue
codes allow us to classify each story as "hard," "soft," or "sensational," or unclassified and left
to a residual category. Broadly speaking, hard news stories are those covering international
affairs, domestic politics, public policy issues, the economy, business, and so on. Soft news
stories are those about sports, entertainment, celebrities, fashion, food, and so on. Sensational
news stories are those about natural disasters, large accidents (e.g., deadly accidents in the
workplace, not simple traffic accidents), and crime (e.g., grizzly murders, not crime as a policy
issue). Appendix A.1 gives the details of the procedure we use to classify each news story.
      During the two-year period under study, there were a total of 46,469 hard news stories,
29,126 soft news stories, and 32,063 sensational news stories. Some stories are in more than
one category. For example, a story about a deadly workplace accident that also discusses lax
government enforcement of safety regulations would be classified as both hard and sensational.
A story about a prominent Italian politician declaring that he would not root for the national
team during the World Cup would be classified as both hard and soft. During 2009-2010, 2,413
stories were classified as both hard and soft news, 5,814 stories were classified as both hard and
sensational news, and 1,643 stories were classified as both sensational and soft news.15
      Figure 4 shows the average relative share of hard, soft and sensational news appearing during
each minute of each news show. The pattern is clear: news programs start predominantly with
hard news, and then progressively shift towards softer news. There is a peak in the share of
soft news around the 30th minute of a show, which is at or near the end of most programs. On
 15
      Only 26 stories were classified as hard and sensational and soft news.

the other hand, sensational stories are distributed relatively uniformly over time. They are a
bit more common than soft stories during the first half of the typical program, and then slowly
decline during the second half.16
       These patterns imply that it is important to know the exact time at which a viewer joins
and leaves a show. Consider for example an individual who watches 15 minutes of a typical
30 minute news broadcast. If that person joins during the first 5 minutes, then he or she will
be exposed to substantially more hard news than a person who joins in minute 15. Therefore
in the analysis below we are careful to investigate the heterogeneity of viewing behavior across
different time segments of each show.
  16
    Appendix Figure A.4 show how the patterns vary channel by channel. Overall, the shows tend to follow
the same broad pattern, although with some differences, especially for RAI 3 and Mediaset 6.




                                                  14
3        Viewership By Type of News
Here we present some basic facts about the relative amounts of hard, soft, and sensational
news consumed, i.e., the "diet" of TV news viewers.17 Table 1 above shows the news diet
as a function of individual socioeconomic characteristics. Column 4 reports the total number
of evening news minutes watched by different subgroups, while columns 5-7 report the share
of minutes spent watching hard, soft, and sensational news, respectively. Interestingly, there
are almost no significant differences in the fraction of minutes spent watching hard, soft, and
sensational news across subgroups, except for age. Hard news accounts for about 35-37% of
total news watched, and soft news accounts for about 25%, irrespective of education, social
class, income or gender. The one exception is that hard news consumption increases with age
and soft news consumption decreases with age. Older individuals not only watch more news,
but a larger share of the news they watch is hard news.
       One reason these patterns are interesting is that they shed light on the role television
news plays, or does not play, in helping to produce an informed citizenry. A stylized fact in
the political science literature is that more educated and richer citizens are on average more
informed about political matters than less educated and poorer ones. Also, men appear to be
more informed about politics than women. There is less agreement about why this knowledge
gap exists (Converse and Dupeux 1962, Tichenor et al. 1970, Delli Carpini and Keeter 1996). As
noted in section 2.2, individuals with less education watch more minutes of television news than
individuals with more education, women watch more than men, and the differences between
low- and high-income individuals is negligible (column 3). Moreover, given the "proportionality"
result discussed immediately above, there is no noticeable difference in the share of hard and
soft news respondents watch as a function of education, income, social class or gender. As a
  17
    It is tempting to compare TV news programs to dinners. As the host, you must serve vegetables--the hard
news--to make a healthy meal, but you need a good dessert--the soft news--to keep some people at the table,
and possibly to attract more diners in the first place. This could explain the increasing percentage of soft news
(desserts) and decreasing percentage of hard news ("the vegetables") during each TV news broadcasts, as well
as variation between different channels--e.g., lots of dessert on Mediaset 6 for young viewers. Following this
metaphor, sensational news is analogous to not-so-healthy but delicious courses that can be served anytime
during the dinner.



                                                       15
result, individuals with less education are also exposed to more minutes of hard TV news than
those with more education, on average. Similarly, on average women are exposed to more hard
TV news than men, and the differences between high-income and low-income individuals are
small.
   This suggests that television news consumption cannot account for the knowledge gap be-
tween richer and poorer individuals, more- and less-educated citizens, and men and women.
Instead, researchers should look elsewhere, such as other news sources--newspapers, maga-
zines, books, the internet--differences in attention to and interest in politics, or differences in
the ability to process information or recall facts.
   On the other hand, the percentage of time spent watching TV news over the total time
spent watching TV overall is an increasing function of age as it goes from 9% to 14% (bottom
panel of Table 1). This finding is consistent with the idea that the elderly not only spend more
time at home than young and middle-aged people, but they might also be significantly more
interested in knowing "what happens in the world" thanks to TV news.
   Although Table 1 reveals little systematic variation in the average shares of hard vs soft
news consumption across key socioeconomic dimensions, with the exception of age, there is
substantial variation across individuals. Figure 5 shows one type of variation: individuals who
watch only a few minutes of the news programs that they watch tend to watch more soft news
than in individuals who watch most of the show when they watch.
   The x-axis in the figure shows the percentage of a TV news broadcast's total minutes each
viewer watches, on average--for the shows they watch--binned by deciles (similar to Figure
3). The y-axis plots the "relative diet" consumed by the individuals in each decile. For hard
news, for example, the values on the y-axis are calculated as follows. For each channel, we
compute the total number of hard news minutes each individual watches on that channel over
the entire sample period, divided by the total number of hard news minutes broadcast on that
channel during the sample period. We then average these ratios across all 6 channels for each
individual, and then average again over all individuals in the same decile along the x-axis. The
values for soft and sensational news are calculated in the same way. Of course, for individuals


                                                16
who entirely or almost entirely watch the news show, the hard, soft, and sensational news
consumptions bundle must correspond to the bundle aired by that TV news broadcast-- i.e.,
they must all be approximately 1. Figure 5 shows that individuals who tend to watch only
short segments of news programs, e.g., only 20% or 30% of the entire show, tend to watch
disproportionate amounts of soft news, and relatively less hard (and sensational) news.18 , 19

  18
     Returning to "TV news as dinner" metaphor, this figure hints at an observable difference between consumers
that properly eat their meat and vegetables--the hard news--and those who do not: the latter typically have
shorter dinners than the former.
  19
     Another implication is the following. While the initial quote by "the Teacher" from Pink Floyd's Another
Brick in the Wall (Part 2) is about coercion ("If you don't eat yer meat, you can't have any pudding"), the
data shown in Figure 5 refer instead to free individual choices. So, while the soft-news pudding might induce
some marginal viewers to consume some hard-news meat (and vegetables), but not all of the available meat, as
many viewers appear to choose short dinners with plenty of pudding.




                                                            17
4     Switching Behavior By Type of News
In this section we study the switching behavior of news viewers. More specifically, we want to
estimate the degree to which viewers appear to avoid hard news, switching to another channel
(or turning off their TV) more when exposed to such stories; and whether they appear to be
more attracted to, and therefore keep watching, soft news stories. We also explore the degree
to which viewers appear to be attracted by sensational stories.
    Note that the first choice viewers make is which channel to watch, and the data indicate
that those who watch news do not choose to maximize the amount of soft news relative to hard
news--otherwise, they could all watch Mediaset 6, which on average shows 11.1 minutes of soft
news per show compared to just 4.8 minutes of hard news. This is true even within time-slot.
The news programs on RAI 3 and Mediaset 4 both begin at 7:00 pm. RAI 3 airs 18.0 minutes
of hard news and 3.9 minutes of soft news, on average, while for Mediaset 4 the corresponding
figures are 13.7 and 10.2 minutes. If viewers simply sought less hard news, then they could all
watch Mediaset 4. But they do not, and in fact RAI 3's news program has more than double the
audience of Mediaset 4's.20 Similarly, RAI 1 and Mediaset 5 both begin at 8:00 pm. RAI 1 airs
14.8 minutes of hard news and 8.2 minutes of soft news per show, on average, while Mediaset 5
airs 11.0 minutes of hard news and 8.4 minutes of soft news. If viewers simply sought less
hard news, then they could all watch Mediaset 5. However, they do not--in fact, RAI 1's news
program has a slightly higher audience Mediaset 5's.21
    Simple means of switching behavior are also suggestive. Averaging over all viewers, channels
and news minutes, 1.97% of the audience switches away during hard news stories, while 4.2%
switch away during soft news stories. Only 1.70% of viewers switch away during sensational
news stories.
    As shown by Figure 4 (and Figure A.4 in Appendix A.2), the balance of hard and soft

     Other factors could of course play some role in this choice, e.g., the marked difference in political leaning
between RAI 3 and Mediaset 4. Still, this revealed preference argument rules out a simple lexicographic model
of choice, according to which only the hard versus soft balance of news matters in decisions about TV news
watching.
  21
     In the choice between RAI 1 and Mediaset 5, the difference in the ideological leaning is narrower than in the
previous case of RAI 3 versus Mediaset 4.

news varies over the course of each news program. Therefore, in our empirical specifications we
treat each 5-minute block within each TV news show separately. For each 5-minute block we
therefore estimate the following model

          Switchit = j + t + 1 Hard News it + 2 Soft News it + 3 Sensational News it +              it    (1)

where i is an index for the individual viewer, j is an index for the news program (channel),
and t is an index for the minute within each block. Each observation is for a given viewer i at
minute t, watching a given news program j (since each viewer can only watch one channel at a
time, we include only the i and t subscripts in describing the observations). The independent
variables are indicators: Hard News it = 1 if the news story i is watching at time t is a hard
news story and zero otherwise; Soft News it = 1 if the news story i is watching at time t is a
soft news story and zero otherwise; Sensational News it = 1 if the news story i is watching at
time t is a sensational news story and zero otherwise. The omitted category is a collection of
miscellaneous stories which are not easily classified as hard, soft, or sensational.22 The term
j denotes a channel-specific fixed effect, while t denotes an elapsed-time fixed effect, i.e., we
allow the average propensity to switch off to vary for each minute within each separate block.
Standard errors are clustered by individual viewer in all regressions.
       Recall from Table 2 that only about 2.5% of all minutes of TV news viewing involve switch-
ing. Therefore, to avoid regression coefficients with many zeroes, we define the dependent
variable as follows: Switchit = 100 if viewer i switches away from the channel he or she is
watching sometime during minute t, and zero otherwise. This implies that we can interpret an
estimated coefficient ^1 of 1.0 as a one percentage point increase in the probability of switching

during a hard news story relative to the omitted category of unclassified stories.
       The first choice TV news viewers make is which program to watch. Hence, we first esti-
mate models that do not include the channel-specific fixed effects (j ). This provides us with
estimates of the overall propensity to switch away from hard versus soft news block-by-block,
including the decision to watch the news on one channel rather than another.
  22
    As noted above, the "standard" length of a news broadcast varies across stations. The overall median is 33
minutes, and the mean is about 34 minutes. In the regressions we drop observations that occur after the first
35 minutes of a broadcast.

        If viewers are more likely to switch off from the TV news they are watching when Hard News =
1 compared to when Soft News = 1, then 1 > 2 . If the opposite is true, then 2 > 1 . Thus, for
each block we compute the difference in the point estimates, ^2-^1 , as well the 95% confidence

interval around the estimated difference.
        The results are presented in the left panel of Figure 6. The black curve shows the point
estimate of the difference, ^2-^1 , block by block. The light gray lines show the 95% confidence

interval around each point estimate.
        For all 5-minute blocks except the first, ^2 - ^1 is positive and statistically significant.

That is, viewers are significantly more likely to switch during a Soft News story than during
a Hard News story. Moreover, this difference is steadily increasing as time goes by, reaching a
peak in block 6.23 This is inconsistent with the simple hypothesis that TV consumers always
seek entertainment rather than politically relevant information.24
        We can also compare the propensity to switch away from soft news with the propensity to
switch away from sensational news, by studying the block-by-block estimates of ^2 - ^3 . These
  23
     We do not pay much attention to the relative drop between blocks 6 and 7, since only the news shows on
RAI 1, Mediaset 4 and Mediaset 5 are long enough to regularly have block 7.
  24
     It is likely that the switching behavior of viewers depends both on what they are currently watching and
on their expectations about what can be found on other channels (as well as non-TV options).

are shown in the right-hand side panel of Figure 6. Again, the black curve shows the point
estimate of ^2 - ^3 , while the light gray lines show the 95% confidence intervals. In this case,

for all 5-minute blocks, ^2 - ^3 is positive and statistically significant. That is, viewers are

significantly more likely to switch during a Soft News story than during a Sensational News
story. Similar to the case of soft vs. hard news, the difference increases over time, and reaches
a peak in block 6.
   Comparing the two panels of Figure 6, we see that ^2 - ^3 > ^2 - ^1 for all blocks, which

implies that ^1 - ^3 > 0. That is, the propensity to switch off during Sensational News stories

is systematically lower than during Hard News stories.
   Table 3 presents the full regression results underlying Figure 6. Each column shows a
different 5-minute block, and the rows at the bottom show the p-values of the F-tests for the
null hypotheses ^2 - ^1 = 0, ^2 - ^3 = 0, and ^1 - ^3 = 0.

   In relative terms, the differences in average switching behavior across the different types of
news stories are substantively large. Consider for example the difference in switching from a
hard news story versus a soft news story in block 4. In block 4, on average 1.90 percent of
viewers switched away while watching the news--1.99 percent switched away while watching

a hard news story, while 2.56 percent did so during a soft news story. Not surprisingly, the
difference, 2.56 - 1.99 = 0.57, is almost the same as the point estimate of ^2 - ^1 for block 4,

which is 0.56. The point estimate of the difference from the regression implies that, on average,
during block 4 a viewer is about 28% more likely to switch away from a soft news story than a
hard news story. The estimated differences are even larger in blocks 5, 6, and 7.
        We now include channel-specific fixed effects (j ). This yields estimates of the within-
channel behavior, i.e., viewers' decisions to switch conditional on having chosen to watch a given
news program. The results are shown in Figure 7, and the full regression results underlying the
figure are presented in Table 4. Analogously to Figure 6, the differences between hard and soft
news are presented on the left, while those comparing sensational and soft are shown on the
right.
        With the channel fixed effects included, the differences in switching behavior when watching
hard versus soft news are generally smaller than those estimated without channel fixed effects.
In block 1, ^2 - ^1 is slightly negative and statistically significant. That is, viewers are signifi-

cantly more likely to switch during a Hard News story than during a Soft News story. In blocks
2, 3 and 4, ^2 - ^1 is approximately zero, so viewers were equally likely to switch away during

hard and soft news stories. In blocks, 5, 6, and 7, ^2-^1 is positive and statistically significant,


                                                        22
implying that viewers are significantly more likely to switch during a Soft News story than
during a Hard News story. The difference between ^2 and ^1 is large in blocks 6 and 7. The

pattern is again inconsistent with the simple hard news avoidance hypothesis.25
    We can also compare the propensity to switch away from soft news with the propensity to
switch away from sensational news, by studying the block-by-block estimates of ^2 -^3 . In this

case, for all 5-minute blocks, ^2 - ^3 is positive and statistically significant. That is, viewers

are significantly more likely to switch during a Soft News story than during a Sensational News
story, and the difference increases steadily over time.
    Comparing the two panels of Figure 7, we see again that ^2 - ^3 > ^2 - ^1 for most blocks,

so ^1 - ^3 > 0. That is, the propensity to switch off during Sensational News stories is system-

atically smaller than during Hard News stories. This suggests that television news directors
and producers would prefer to air more sensational news stories, if they could. However, news
directors do not control the supply of sensational news. Moreover, if the stories in this category
became commonplace--natural disasters or large industrial accidents every day--they would
no longer be "sensational."26 . This way, viewers never know when a sensational story might be
coming, and some viewers might keep watching just in case one will appear soon.
    In relative terms, the differences in average switching behavior across the different types of
news stories are substantively large in the last two blocks. Consider for example the difference
in switching from a hard news story versus a soft news story in block 6. In this block, on average
2.55% of viewers switched away while watching a hard news story. The estimated difference
^2 -
    ^1 from the regression, 0.49, implies that on average, during block 6 a viewer is about 19%

more likely to switch away from a soft news story than a hard news story.
    Appendix Table A.3 reports results analogous to those in Table 4 separately for each channel.
There we observe some interesting heterogeneity across channels. Mediaset 6, which is geared
toward a younger audience, stands as an outlier vis-a-vis the other channels. Its viewers are
more likely to switch away during hard news stories than during soft news stories in every block
  25
     It is likely that the switching behavior of viewers depends both on what they are currently watching and
on their expectations about what can be found on other channels (as well as non-TV options).
  26
     Thus, the best the news director can do is place them strategically during the show. Perhaps this why they
are spread relatively uniformly, as shown in Figure 4

except block 2 (where the difference is small and statistically insignificant).27
       Since we have individual level data we can also study whether different types of viewers
respond differently to hard and soft news. Figure 8 compares men and women, and Figure 9
shows the differences by age. As in the previous figures, the block-by-block differences in the
propensity to switch away from soft versus hard news are shown on the left, and the analogous
differences for soft versus sensational news are presented on the right. The full regression results
are shown in Table A.1 and Table A.2 in Appendix A.2.
       The patterns across blocks are basically the same for men and women. However, for all
blocks, the point estimate of ^2 - ^1 is larger for men than for women, meaning that men are

relatively more likely to switch away from a Soft News story than a Hard News story, compared
to women. In 4 of the 7 blocks the difference is statistically significant at the 0.05 level. When
comparing Soft News with Sensational News , there are essentially no differences between men
and women in blocks 1-4. The difference in ^2 - ^3 between men and women is positive and
  27
    Interestingly, the largest difference in switching behavior when watching a soft news story versus when
watching a hard news story (about 1.75) occurs in the last block of RAI 2. Since the RAI 2 news show is the
latest to start (at 8:30pm), viewers might simply switch away with such a high propensity as they want to
watch--say--a movie on another channel, and there is only non-relevant soft news on the TV program itself
(and it is almost 9pm).

statistically significant at the 0.05 level in blocks 5-7. Thus, during these blocks, men are
somewhat more likely to switch away from a Sensational News story than a Hard News story,
compared to women.
          The patterns across age groups are also interesting, as shown in Figure 9. We divide viewers
in three age groups: "young" (15-39), "middle-aged" (40-64) and "old" (65-99). Looking first
at the panel on the left, we see almost no differences by age in blocks 1 and 2. Beginning in
block 3, we see systematic differences in switching behavior between the old and young. Older
viewers are more likely to switch off during Soft News than during Hard News , compared to
younger viewers.


5              Concluding Remarks
Political observers in virtually all democratic countries complain about the electorate's lack of
knowledge and information. Some blame the news media environment for this situation, arguing
that there is too much soft news and not enough informative news, especially on television news
broadcasts. Standard economic models would imply that media outlets seeking to maximize
market share or profits must provide viewers with what they want. If they are providing soft
news, it is because viewers demand it.

        In this paper we have analyzed television news-watching behavior in Italy, exploiting two
rich and fine-grained data sets that allow us to study actual viewer behavior, and to know what
type of news story each viewer is watching, minute by minute, for an entire two-year period
(2009-2010). We find that on average news programs broadcast many more hard news stories
than soft news stories, and in fact the programs begin with mainly hard news. Also, those
who watch the news do not all gravitate towards shows that broadcast the most amount of soft
news. Most tellingly, we find no evidence that viewers are more likely to switch away during
hard news stories than during soft news stories; in fact, if anything the opposite is true. Thus,
the evidence is inconsistent with the simple hypothesis that there is a general tendency by all
viewers to seek entertainment even while watching the news.
        We have presented a variety of descriptive patterns and also individual-level regression
analyses. The regressions focus on the difference in the propensity to switch away during a
hard news story than during a soft news story. When not including channel-specific fixed
effects, i.e., when looking at the overall variation in switching behavior between and within
TV news stories, we find--perhaps surprisingly--that the propensity to switch away during a
soft news story is systematically higher than during a hard news story, except during the first
5-minute block. Moreover, this difference in the propensity to switch away increases steadily as


                                                                  26
the news program proceeds. We find an even stronger difference to switch away during a soft
news story than during a sensational story.
   When we include channel-specific fixed effects in the regressions, and exploit only the vari-
ation within programs, the differences in switching behavior when watching hard versus soft
news are generally smaller than those estimated without channel fixed effects, and generally sta-
tistically insignificant for the first half of the news program. However, they are still significant
and sizable in the last 10-15 minutes of the show.
   We also investigate some of the possible heterogeneity in the decision to switch off across
different types of viewers. We also find significant differences in the propensity to switch away
during hard versus soft news according to the gender and age of the viewer, and the specific
TV news show the viewer watches. We find that young viewers are relatively more likely to
switch away from hard news compared to older viewers, and in one of the five-minute blocks
the young are significantly more likely to switch away from hard news than soft news stories.
   In future work we will exploit the AUDITEL and Osservatorio data to study other aspects
of news viewing behavior. The individual-level AUDITEL data allows us to study the viewers'
decisions to switch away as a function of their viewing habits, i.e., on the basis of their revealed
preferences minute by minute. For example, we can check whether habitual versus casual
viewers of TV news programs are significantly different in their propensity to switch away
during hard versus soft versus sensational news. We could also study how the quasi-random
case of viewers happening to watch a very salient event on a TV news broadcast or during a
"breaking news" program could affect systematically their viewing behavior in the short or in
the medium/long run.
   Finally, we plan to study the decision to switch on a given news broadcast. From an
informational viewpoint, the "joining" behavior is trickier than the "leaving" behavior, since
viewers do not know with certainty what they will find on the channel to which they switch to,
while they know for sure what they decide not to watch anymore when leaving the channel.

A.1        Classification of News Stories as Hard, Soft and Sensational

To classify TV news stories as hard, soft or sensational we proceed in steps. We first exploit the
two broadest classifications by topic that the Osservatorio di Pavia performs on its dataset, and
code as Hard News the stories that belong to the following topics: "cooperation and develop-
ment" (cooperazione e sviluppo), "rights" (diritti), "business/entrepreneurship" (imprendito-
ria), "labor" (lavoro), "economic policies and policymaking" (politiche economiche), " "domes-
tic politics" (politica interna), "statistics" (statistiche), "welfare and social policy" (welfare),
"the economy" (economia), "foreign policy" (politica estera), "politics and government" (polit-
ica e governo), "immigration" (migrazioni), "organized crime" (criminalit`
                                                                         a organizzata), "war
and terrorism" (guerra e terrorismo).28 Moreover, if the summary of the news story mentions
(i) an Italian political party or (ii) politics-related terms or (iii) law-related terms, then we
code that story as Hard News . The Italian political parties under consideration are: Alleanza
Nazionale, Forza Italia, Lega Nord, Partito Democratico, Popolo delle Libert`
                                                                            a. The politics-
related terms are: "government" (governo), "minister" (ministro), "ministry (ministero), and
"mayor" (sindaco). The law-related terms are "law" (legge) and "reform" (riforma).
       We code a story as Soft News if--according to the two broadest topic classifications em-
ployed by the Osservatorio di Pavia --that story is about one of the following topics: "sports"
(sport), "lifestyles and habits" (costume), "culture and cultural events" (cultura), "curiosities"
(curiosit`
         a), "celebrities" (VIP), "weather report" (meteo), "other news" (altre notizie). We
additionally code a story as Soft News if the words "sales/discounts" (saldi), "weather" (me-
teo) or "TV license" (canone RAI) appear in that story's summary. Finally, when the topic
of the story is transport and infrastructure (trasporti e infrastrutture) or "nature and environ-
ment" (ambiente e natura) and the word "traffic" (traffico) appears in the story's description
we classify that story as Soft News --these are typically stories about traffic jams.
       Sensational News include stories about crime, serious accidents, and natural disasters. Thus,
  28
    For reference, the two broadest classification fields in the Osservatorio dataset are called desc midi prim
and desc midi sec.

we code a story as "sensational" if--according to the two broadest classifications provided by
the Osservatorio --that story is about "crime" (criminalit`
                                                          a), "attacks on women and minors"
(violenze su donne e minori), "accidents" (incidenti) and "disasters" (disastri). Note that stories
about organized crime are coded as Hard News rather than Sensational News , because these
have important implications for assessing government performance.
