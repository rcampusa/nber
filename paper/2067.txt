                A Specification Test for Speculative Bubbles




                                 ABSTRACT




    The set of parameters needed to calculate the expected present discounted
value of a stream of dividends can be estimated in two ways. One may test for
speculative bubbles, or fads, by testing whether the two estimates are the
same. When the test is applied to some annual U.S. stock market data, the
data usually reject the null hypothesis of no bubbles.
    The test is of general interest since it may be applied to a wide class of
linear rational expectations models.

      The seeming tendency for self-fulfilling rumors about potential stock price

  fluctuations to result in actual stock price movements has long been noted by

  economists. In a famous passage, Keynes, for example, described the stock market

  as a certain type of beauty contest, in which judges try to guess the winner of

 the contest: speculators devote their "intelligence
                                                       to anticipating what average
 opinion expects average opinion to be" [1964, p.156]. In recent rational

 expectations work, this possibility has been rigorously formalized and the

 self-fulfilling rumors dubbed speculative bubbles [Blanchard and Watson, 1982;

 Shiller, 1978; Taylor, 1977; Tirole, 1982, 1985]. Recent attempts to detect such

 bubbles with formal statistical tests have, however, met with mixed success

 [Blanchard and Watson, 1982; Diba and Grossman, 1984; Flood and Garber 1980;

 Flood, Garber and Scott, 1984; Hamilton and Whiteman, 1984].

     One possible reason for the inability of the empirical tests to detect the

bubbles so often described is that the tests have been few and not very powerful.

This paper develops and applies a test for speculative bubbles that (a)allows for

a wider class of bubbles than did Flood and Garber
                                                     [1980] and Flood, Garber and
Scott [1984]; (b)is specifically designed to test against the alternative that

bubbles are present, in contrast to the volatility tests of Shiller [1981a, 1981bJ

and Leroy and Porter [1981]; and (c)may be applied even if prices and dividends

are nonstationary, again in contrast to the volatility tests and to the tests in

Flood and Garber [1980] and Flood, Garber and Scott [1984].

    The basic idea of the present paper's test is very simple, and was suggested

by the specification test of Hausman [1978]. The test compares two sets of

estimates of the parameters needed to calculate the expected present discounted

value (PDV) of a given stock's dividend
                                          stream, with expectations conditional on
current and all past dividends, In a constant discount rate model, the two sets
are obtained as follows.     One set may be obtained simply by regressing the stock

                           of lagged dividends. The other set may be obtained
price on a suitable set
                                        One of the pair is an arbitrage equation
indirectly from a pair of equations.
                               and the other is the dividend process's ARIMA
yielding the discount rate,
                                                                 rational
equation. The Hansen and Sargent [1981b] formulas, familiar from
                                        restrictions, may be applied to this pair of
expectations tests of cross equation

equations's coefficients to obtain a second set of estimates of the expected PDV


parameters.

    Under   the   null hypothesis that the stock price is set in accord with a

standard efficient markets model [Brealey and Myers, 1981, pp42-45], the
                                                                               When the
regression coefficients in all equations may be estimated consistently.
                                          PDV parameters are compared, then, they
two sets of estimates of the expected

should be the same, apart from sampling error.

    But this equality of the two sets will not hold under the alternative

                                   Blanchard and Watson [19821, that the stock price
hypothesis suggested by, e.g.,
                                                                                    model
 equals the sum of two components: the price implied by the efficient markets
                                             the equation that relates price to a
 and a speculative bubble. In this case,
                                               regressor--the bubble. As long as the
 suitable set of dividends omits a relevant
                                                       the coefficients in this
 bubble is correlated with the included regressors,
                               inconsistently. The bubble will not, however, cause
 equation will be estimated
                                             be inconsistent. So the coefficients in
 estimation of the other two equations to
                                       the implied value of the set of expected PDV
 this pair of equations, as well as
                                                                   the two
 parameters, will still be estimated consistently. Therefore, when
                                                    are compared, the two will be
 estimates of the set of expected PDV parameters

 expected to be different.
                                                                              of
     Speculative bubbles are tested for, then, by seeing whether the two sets
                                                         I check for the equality of
 estimates are the same, apart from sampling error.

 the two sets in long-term annual data
                                             on the Standard and Poor's 500 index

 (1871-1980) and the Dow Jones index (1928-1978). The
                                                                 data reject the null
 hypothesis of no bubbles. The rejection appears to result at least in part

 because the coefficients in the regression of price on dividends are biased

 upwards. As is explained in section II, this is precisely what would be expected

 if, as is sometimes argued [Shiller, 1984], bubbles
                                                               reflect an overreaction by the
 market to news about dividends. A small
                                               amount of investigation of a linearized
 time varying discount rate model suggests that such variation may also help

explain the results.

        Section II quickly reviews the standard constant discount rate efficient

markets model and the definition of a
                                           speculative bubble and then explains how the
test is performed. Section ILl presents empirical results from a constant

discount rate model and then develops and
                                               applies the specification test for a
linearized time varying discount rate model.          Section IV discusses the empirical
results. Some econometric and algebraic details are in an appendix available from

the author.

         According to   a   standard efficient markets model, a stock price          is
  determined by the arbitrage relationship (1) [Brealey and              Myers,   1981,
  pp42—35):



  (1)
              Pt —
                     bE(pt+i+dti)r.

  where p is the real stock price in        period    t, b the constant    ex-ante   real
                                                   —4--



discount rate, 0 < b =         l/(l+r)   < 1,   r the constant expected return, E denotes

mathematical expectations, assumed to be equivalent to linear projections, d÷i

the real dividend paid to the owner of the stock period t+l, and

information common to traders in period t.                is   assumed to contain, at a

minimum, current and past dividends, and, in general, other variables that are

useful in forecasting dividends. Time variation in the ex ante discount rate

b is briefly considered in section hID.


      Equation (1) may be solved recursively forward to get



(2)
           Pt     Eb'Edt+iIIt +        bEPt+ntIt.

If the transversalltY condition

holds, then t a        p,   where



(4)        p' a
                  tb'EdtiIIt.

      Now, the p defined in (1k) is the .ztque forward solution to (1) as long as

the transversa]ity condition (3) holds. But if this condition fails, there is

a family of solutions to (1) (Blanchard and Watson [1982], Shiller [1978),

Taylor [1977]). Any p that satisfies


                   *                            —1

      is also a solution to (1).
                                            c is by definition a speculative bubble, an
  otherwise      extraneous event that affects        stock prices because everyofl expects

      It to do 30. An example of            a stochastic process for c, similar            to    one
  described      in Blanchard and Watson [1982], is


  (6)                                                     with
                C—
                 t          f(Ct_i_)/(wtb)                       probability ,
                             lc/[(1w)b]                   with probability lWt


                              O<lrcl,    >O.

        According    to (6), strictly positive bubbles grow and pop. In this example,

 the probability that a bubble grows is
                                                           that it collapses is 1—ir.
 The bubble may be intimately connected
                                                   with fundamentals, with         Tr dependent
 on news about fundamentals. A simple example is                  Tr   =   1/2 for all t, with
 the bubble popping if and only if the innovation in dividends is negative.

 If r      is constant (if        = IT for all t), each bubble has an
                                                                      expected duration
of (l—IT). ( is not an identifiable parameter.) Combination of several

bubbles are possible, each with a different
                                                           Trt and C; the growth and collapse
of the bubbles may be either tightly
                                                or loosely related. See Blanchard and
Watson [1982] for further examples and discussion.

       Our aim is to test
                                 Pt      p* versus Pt =      + c,      for some nontrivial
                                                                                                 c
(possibly one not following the stochastic process (6)). Consider first this

wildly implausible case: (a) There is no doubt that Pt and dt are such that equations

(1) and (2) hold. (b)dt is a zero mean             white   noise process. Then Edt.jIIt                0

      • 0 for   all t it equation (3) holds: given that the stochatjc difference

equation (1) is solved in the forward directIon (2), the terminal condItion (3)

Insures that () is           the taique Solution to equation (1), for all           t.    In this

expectations, constant       discount rate specification,         and     (b)no   statistical

inference is necessary, then (c)the null hypothesis that there are                     no bubbles

should   be rejected it Pt . 0 for some t.
      Th basis of the empirical work in this paper is the simple logical
proposition       illustrated in the   previous paragraph:    it a univartate stochastic
difference equation is solved in the forward            direction,        a single terminal

condition ties down a unique solution. Let us now allow for (a) uncertainty

about b and the parameters of the dividend process; (b) the possibility that

dividends are an endogenous variable, e.g., because they are smoothed by manage-

ment; Cc) uncertainty about whether the rational expectations, constant dis-

count rate specification (1) really characterizes the data.

(a) Suppose that the actual value of b is not known.                    In addition, suppose

that it is known that dividends follow a zero mean, AR(l) process,

The logical proposition described above is applied in this enviror!fleflt by

                                 and S1. Equation (1) may      be   estimated by rewriting

        To apply the specification test, we compare two
                                                        estimates of 6, the

                                                                                    H0: ói —

 exceeds an appropriate critical           value.
(b) Allowing for endogeneity of dividends [Marsh

no substantial complications. Let Mt be the set consisting of a constant

and current and lagged dividends,              Mt =   {i,   dji 0}. Since H           is a

subset of I equation (4) in conjunction with                      Pt = Pt implies [Hansen

    To apply the specification test, it is necessary to turn (9) into a

regression equation. This can be done conveniently it there is a closed form

expression for tb'Edt+jIHt. Now, Edt+iIHt is by definition the forecast of
dividends   given the      past history of dividends. It dt is stationary, perhaps

                           Edt+j iHt may be calculated as the usual ARIMA forecast of
after difterencing,

dt+j.       And if dt is stationary, possibly after differencing,
                                             —8—




there is a closed form expression for Eb'Edt+jIHt        in   the form of a distributed

lag on current and past dt [Hansen and Sargent, 1981b].            As in the simple

example (7) and (8), the coefficients of the distributed lag are         functions   of b

and the parameters of dt's univariate ARIMA process. Exact formulas are given

in section lilA.

     When dividends    are   endogenous, and are characterized by an ARIMA process of

known order (but unknown parameters), the test         can proceed essentially as just
described in case (a) above: estimate (1)' by instrLlnental variables; estimate

dt's univariate ARIMA equation; estimate a distributed lag of Pt on dt; compare

the estimates of the parameters of the distributed lag with those of (1)' and

      ARIMA equation.         (Actually, if differencing is required to induce

staionarity in dt, it is more convenient to estimate a distributed lag of a

difference of Pt on a difference of dt.            See section lilA.) So the basic

difference from case (a) is that it is acknowledged that dt's ARIMA equation is

is simply a convenient way to forecast dividends, and not a statement about the

exogeneity of dividends.

     It still remains to determine the order of the ARIMA process for dt. To

make the results of as general interest as possible, the empirical work does

not assne any particular structural model for dividends. The order of the

ARIMA process for dt is data rather than theoretically determined, in the

spirit of the usual Box—Jenkins [1970] analysis. Consistent with such an

approach, a variety of ARIMA specifications are tried, tO           make sure that   the

results   are not sensitive to the exact specification chosen.

     It   is to   be noted   that this discussion assumes that arithmetic differencing

is   sufficient to induce stationarity in dt. This is because          such   a condition
makes it possible to obtain a closed form 3olutiOn to Eb'Edt+jIHt. While the
usual Box—Jenkins [1970) diagnostics suggest that arithmetic differences
                                            —9—




 suffice to induce stationarity in the data used in this paper               (see   section
  IIIB), much research in finance usi.gnes that log differences are
                                                                                required
  [Kleidon, 1985). Since it is also possible to obtain a closed form expression

 for EbiEdtjjHt when dt follows a lognormal random walk [Kleidon, 1985), the

 empirical work (in section IIIC) briefly considers this specification as well.

 (c)Suppose that the specification test described in case (b) indicate! that the

 difference between the two sets of estimates of the parameters needed to

 calculate EbiEdt+jlHt is I.mlikely to result solely from sampling error.

 Clearly, this can happen tar many reasons, in addition to the presence of bubbles.

     The possibility that a discrepancy between the two sets of parameter

 estimates results from certain factors other than bubbles is handled in two

 ways. In section hID, a model with time varying discount rates is linearized

 as in Shiller [1981a).    It is shown that in such a model one can apply a somewhat

more complicated version of the test just described.

    The second way that shortcomin, of the present value model are considered

is by applying diagnostic tests to the estimates of (1)'. The diagnostic tests

are chosen in light of two alternatives
                                              that have figured prominently in
related work, that expectations are not
                                            rational [Ackley, 1983; Shiller, 1984J
and that discount rates are time
                                      varying [Leroy, 198k). The particular tests
used are described in section III.
                                         The greater th. extent to which these
diagnostics suggest that   equation   (1) is consistent with the data,         the more
plausible it is to discount expectatjona.j irrationality and discount rate
variation as significant sources of a discrepancy between the two sets of
parameter estimates.

explanation of any difference between the two sets of estimates is
This explanation is more compelling the less likely is the difference to result
from sampling error, and the      greater the extent to which the diagnostic tests
fail   to reject (1)' and   the specification of the univariate dividend process.
   Four final conents are of interest      before the empirical work is presented.

The first comment concerns how reasonable it is to use the past history of
                                          dividends. It clearly is not reasonable

best protection against such a problem is to use a long sample period, which is

what I did. The second is that certain forms of the peso problem in fact are

this can detect in—sample switches of the dividend process.

 that bubbles result at least in part from                  an overreaction to news about
 fundamentals (Shiller, 1981]. If bubbles are present, then, one would expect
 the point estimate of 6i to be biased upwards. More generally,
                                                                                           when

 Eb'EdttlHt       involves more than one lag of dt, one might expect bubbles to cause
the st        of coefficients in the        distributed   lag projection of Pt onto dt to be
biased upwards)-

      The third comment is that this test has a substantial
                                                            advantage over the

tests undertaken in Flood and Garber [1980] and Flood, Garber and Scott [19841,

and that proposed in Sargent and Wallace [1984]. This is that the specifica-

tion test does not require parametric specification of the bubble process.

      bubble that is correlated with dividends can be detected: the

bubble described in (6); a bubble as in (6) whose probability of continuing to

float Irt depends stochasticafly on events such as, say, money supply news,

or GNP growth, or political events; and combinations of any and all such bubbles.

   The fourth comment is that the specification test can be used to test for

                                                  rational expectations models. The idea
bubbles in other infinite horizon linear

is to compare two sets of estimates. One set is obtained from the dynamic pro-
                                                the model (i.e., from the model's analogue
gramming, or equilibrium, solution to

to equation (12a) or (l2b) below).         The second set is obtained by applying the relevant

                                                 estimates obtained from two types of
Hansen and Sargent [l981b] formulas to

equations. The first is the model's Euler equations, or first—order conditions

(i.e., the model's analogue to equation (1)). The second is A.RIMA equations

for the model's forcing variables (i.e., the model's analogue to equation (lla)

or (lib) below). The null hypothesis of no bubbles should be rejected only if (a)

diagnostic tests on the Euler and ARINA equations suggest that these equations
                                                difference between the two sets of esti—
are acceptably specified, and (b) any

mates is unlikely to result from sampling error.

     Section A diacribes data and estimation technique.                  Section B presents


 etnpirial    results. Section C extends the specification test to allow for a

 dividend    process that     follows a loormal random walk. Section D extends                it to
 test   a model that allows discount       rates to vary over time.
 A.Data   and Estimation Technique

        The data used were those used by Shiller [1981a) in his study of stock

  price volatility, and were graciously supplied by him. There were two data
                                                           and dividend data. One had the
  sets, both containing annual aggregate price

  Standard   and   Poor 500   for   1871—1980           price in   January   divided by producer


  price   index (1979 • 100), dt.i —      s of dividends from that           same   January   to   the

    following          December, deflated by the average of that year's producer price

    index). The other data set was a inodif led Dow Jones index, 1928-1978 p,
                                                                                                           dt1
    as   above).        See Shiller [1981a] for a discussion of the data.

          Let me describe in turn: (i)identification of the order of dt's ARIMA

    process; (ii)estimatlon of (1)', the d process and the distributed lag of
                                                                                                           Pt

    the equations estimated.

    (i)For each data set, estimation was done with dt in levels and with dt

    arltPnetic first differences. In each case, only pure autoregressions were

estimated, for              computational    simplicity:



(ha)               dt+i •   i&   •idt+ ...    + •qdt_q+i   +


(lib)              dt+i .        + •idt      ...
                                                     •qd_q+

For      each      data set and for       both     dt and dt, two different values of the lag
length q were used. One was arbitrarily selected as q a                           ii.    The Other was
selected by the information                  criterion    of Hannan and Quinn [1979),               This
criterion           chooses the value or q that minimizes a certain function of the
estimated          parameters, and    asymptotically       chooses     the correct      q if   the process
truly      has     a finite order autoregressive representation.,2
                                                                                  Thus, for each data
set, up to          four speclfication were estimated: difterenced and undifferenced, q
-        and   q   —
                     lag length selected by the Hannan and Quinn [1979] criterion. In
one      case (Dow Jones, ditterenced) the Hannan               and   Quinn   (1979]    criterion   chose q
- . So for the Dow Jones, only tIree specifications were estimated.

The z variable is            dated t rather                  than t1 to emphasize that it is orthogonal

       The trivariate system                    estimated for undifferenced specifications therefore

was (1)', (ha) and (12a).                              For differenced specifications, the system

estimated was (1)', (hib) and (12b). The discount rate b was estimated from

equation (1)' by two step, two stage least squares [Hansen, 1982]. The first

step was      standard       two     stage least squares. The                              second   step obtained the

variables      on the right hand side of the dividend equation (ha) or (hib).

        Equations (ha), (hib), (12a), and (12b) were estimated by OLS, with the

covariance matrix of the                    parameters          adjusted as               described in (iii). Under      the

 [1986a].           This         allows   for arbitrary heteroskedasticity conditional on the

describes in detail the calculation of V.

 (iv)The relationship between the parameters in (12a) and (12b) on the one hand,

and b and the parameters of (ha) and (lib) on the other, may be derived in a

straightforward fashion from the formulas in Hansen and Sargent [1981b).

The derivative of R(O) was calculated analytically. Under the null hypothesis,

(v)The final iten discussed before results are presented is diagnostic tests on

the estimated equations.4          As explained in the previous section of the paper,

a   significant value of the test statistic (1k) is more compelling as evidence

of bubbles the less the extent to which diagnostic tests on (1)', (ha) and

(llb) indicate that other source of misspeciflcation are present. Possible

sources that have been        suggested include failure to allow for expectational
Irrationality [Ackley, 1983] and for time variation in discount rates [Leroy,

1984].

       Four diagnostic checks were therefore performed on equations (1)', (ha)

and (lib). The first checked for aerial correlation in the residuals to the

equations, using a pair of tests.            Under rational expectations, the

expectational error u1 ahould be serially uncorrelated. It the ARIMA process

for dt is properly specified, so, too, should                   since      is the

Innovation in the process. The first of the pair of serial correlation tests

checked for first order serial correlation in u1 and                    using   the

tachniques described in Pagan and Hall [1983, ppi7O, 191]. The second serial

correlation test, performed only for                calculated the Box-Pierce Q

    statistic for the residuals.          This statistic tests for first and higher order

    serial correlation [Granger and Newbold, 1977, P. 93].

        The second of the four diagnostic checks, performed
                                                                    only on equation (1)',
 was Hansen's [1982] test of instrument—residual
                                                             orthogonality. Under the null
 hypothesis that equation (1) is            correctly    specified, the test statistic Is
 asymptotically distributed as a chi squared random             variable   with q degrees of
freedom. This test has the power to detect failures of equation (1) such as

expectationa.l     irrationality and time      variation in discount rates that is
correlated    with dividends.
    The third of the four diagnostic checks tested for the stability of the
regression coefficients in (1)', (ha) and (hib). This was done by testing for
a    midsample shift of the       coefficients    in these equations.       The relevant
statistic    is asymptotically distributed as a chi squared random             variable,   with
one degree of freedom for         (1)'.    q.1 degrees of freedom for (ha) and         (hib).
This test clearly has the power to detect shifts in the             discount   rate, as well
as   in the dividend process.
      The fourth and       final diagnostic     check performed is implicit in the
estimation procedure described above. Several specifications of the dividend
process were used-—differeliced and undifferenced, with a variety of lag
lengths. Since the results did not prove very sensitive to the specification
or the dividend process, it appears unlikely that small changes in the
specification      of   the dividend process will affect the results.

B.Empiricaj. Results

      Regression   results for (1)' are       reported in Table    IA.5    The results in
Table   IA suggest that the basic arbitrage equation (1) is a sensible one.

Consider first two diagnostic tests. Coln (14) reports the                 estimates   of the
                                            —18—

first order serial correlation coefficient of the disturbance to (1)'. Since

the entries in the colunn are far from significant at the .05 level, there is

little evidence of serial correlation in this disturbance.             In addition, the

entries     in colunn    (5), which report the      Hansen [1982] test of instrxtent
residual     orthogonality, does not reject the null hypothesis of no

correlation      between the instrunents and residuals.       The successful    results in
                                                                                rational
co]unn (5) are perhaps especially noteworthy since failures of
expectations models to pass this         test are   quite coaon [Hansen and Singleton,

1982; West, 1986b].

      Most important, the discount rate b is estimated plausibly and precisely in

all   re'essions. See coltinn (3) in Table          IA. The implied annual real expected

returns are a reasonable six to seven per cent, and are quite              close to the
aritMetic means        for cx   post returns: 8.1 percent for   the   Standard and    Poor's

(S    and   P)   index (1872—1981) and 7•i4 percent       for the   Dow Jones    index

(1929—1979). Moreover, the entries in coltn (6) give little evidence that the
rate was different in the two halves of either sample. The only specification
for which the null hypothesis of equality can be rejected at the five percent
level                 Poor's. wdiffereflced. q • 2. In addition, no evidence
        iS Standard and

against the constancy of the discount rate may be found in a comparison of the
two halves' mean        cx post returns.     For the S and P    index, these were (in
percent) 8.09 (1872—1926) versus           8.12 (1927—1981); for the Dow Jones the

figures are 7.87 (1929—1954) versus 6.92 (1955—1979).

      The    specification of the arbitrage equation (1), then, appears acceptable.
Let us      rw consider the estimates for the dividend process, reported in Table

15. The      entries   in co].tnna   (8) and (9) indicate   little evidence of serial
correlation       in the disturbance to equations (ha) and Cub). Both test

statistics in all regressions are far from significant, except for              the   estimate
                                                 —19—

 of    the first order    serial    correlation coefficient P          for the   S and P Index,

 undifferenoeci, lag length q •          2.    This regression's Q statistic in coln (9)

 does, however, comfortably accept the null hypothesis of no serial correlation.

 Overall, then, no serial correlation to the               residuals     to (ha) and Cub) is
 apparent.         Also, the estimates of moeb            regression     coefficients are

statistically significant, at least when the lag length q was chosen by the
Hannan and Quinn E1979J procedtre.               Finally,    the   null hypothesis that the

parameters       of the dividend    process     are the same      in   the two halves of each

sample can be rejected at the five per cent level only for the S and P index,

undifferenced.        See coln (10). In general, then, the specification of the

dividend process seams acceptable, with the possible exception of the S and P

data set, undifferenced.

       Estimates   of the third and final equation, (12a) or (12b), are in                Table IC.
Parameter estimates are       fairly precise for         aidifferenced     specifications, less
so    for   differenced specifications.
       In contrast to the coefficients of          the other two equations, however, the
estimates  of the coefficients of equations (12a) and (12b) are probably not
sensible from the point of view of the simple efficient markets model that says
Pt -       !biEç1I.      For th. estimates        of these    coefficients       are   txiforsly
incompatible with the estimates of the coefficients of the other two equations.
The test of whether these estimates are in fact compatible--that is, the test
of    th.    null hypothesis that    bubbles     are absent--may be found in Table II.
Equation (11$) is     calculated    in ooltmn     (1).    Every   specification but      those   for
the S       and P ditferersced, rejects the null at any conventional               significance
level, One the of       the S and    P   differenced     specifications    rejects the null        at
the   5    percent level, the other at the 10 percent level,
      It    appears that the reason      for   the rejection is that the coefficients            on
                                                     -20-

dividends in the present            value    equations (12a) and (12b) are           biased upwards. In

six    of the seven speciticatiOfl3 the sum of the biases in the                           (not reported

in any table) are positive. (The only                   exception    is the S and P. differenced, q

-    2.)     Now, for undifferenced specification.5, if there is a bubble, the bias in

the estimate of the vector (m,&1,...,o) is the probability limit of the vector

of estimates of the parameters of a regression of                     the   bubble          on a constant

                                  (See equation (10).) If bubbles reflect at least in part
and d+1P• dt_q+2
a tendency of the market to overreact to dividends or to news about future
dividends [Shiller, 1984] this upward bias is precisely what would be expected.
For differenced specificatiOnS, the asymptotic bias in the estimate of the
vector (m61i...5q) is the Probability limit of estimates of the parameters in

bubbles tend to be associated with changes in lags of dividends, the 6 will
also tend to be biased upward for differenced                   specifications.6

 estimate of M    in    each data set was insignificantly different from zero.                 b1
 was set equal to the mean cx post return. A convenient way to test the null

 hypothesis    is to note that    the formula for 61 implies

 estimated. It is straightforward to construct a 99 percent confidence interval

around a2, as described in Mood et al. [19744, p382). We can then check whether

the point estimates of b'1, 6i, and
                                              are such that the right hand side of (15)
falls in this confidence interval. Note that such a procedure ignores sampling

uncertainty In the estimates of b, 6i and .                       One reason I am nonetheless

applying this procedure is that the usual asymptotic theory does not apply to

the regression that produces
                                    6.
       The empirical results are in Table III. The first line for each data set

uses the mean of t(log d) for , the second imposes                      •   0.   Only one point
estimate   of 2 is     reported for   each data set, since a2 was the same to three
decimal places whether or not            - 0 was imposed. The lower and upper bounds

estimate   of p, the first order serial correlation coefficient of the residual.

For both data sets, the estimate is insignificantly different from zero at the

10 percent level, but not at the five percent level. Column 3 has the right

hand side of equation (15), calculated fr the figures in columns 4                   to 6. The
numbers in   this column       are all   on or above the upper end of the 99          percent

confidence   interval for 2, reported in column 2.
      Apparently, the point estimates of the right hand           side    of   (15) are too big,

and/or those of       the   left hand side of (15) too snail, for the data to have been

generated by a constant discount           rate, loiormal random      walk     model, without
bubbles. This is consistent with the section IIIB results: one interpretation

is that 6, the coefficient that results when.p is projected onto                         is too

big for Pt -      p    to be correct. Another interpretation, consistent not only

with the earlier results in this paper but of those in a companion paper as

well [West, 1986c, is ttat 2, the variance of the innovation in the

univariate dividend process, is too small.

      It does not, however, seem wise to push either of these arguments too far.

One reason is the simple lognormal random walk specification may not adequately

capture the dynamics of the dt process. This figures in column (7) of Table

III   suggest   some residual serial correlation. A second reason is that the

figures in Table III do not really indicate a rejection of the model at the 99%

level, since sampling uncertainty in the estimates of b1, 61 and                     is iored.
One way to emphasize that this is a practical and not just pedantic point is to

consider the effects on         column (3)   of   different   values of   b1. Suppose     that

b1 a 1.05,      a value within two standard deviations of           the   point estimates in

Table IA.       Then all four column (3) estimates would not only fall below the

upper end of the 99 percent confidence interval in column (2), but would all be

below the point estimate of              in column (1).

      This    can be done by comparing two sets of estimates of expected present

discounted values,with expectations conditional on the set of current and past
dlvidend. Now, however, the variable
                                       being forecast is not Just dt+i but
       This will not involve an arbitrage equation; it will involve dividend
and   distributed lag equations, as before, and also a new equation, for

forecasting expected returns using current and lagged dividends. A brief

discussion follows. Algebraic details are available on request.

                The linearization parameters r, b and a were chosen as certain simple,

plausible functions of the              data.     For both ditterenced and undifferenced

specifications,           the point of linearization for         expected returns   was the mean    ex

 post    return, r •

dividends are stationary (Eidt - 0) and d0 -                    Edt.   this reduces to linearizing

around mean dividends.             For both difterenced and undifferenced specifications,

     was calculated as a          -d/r. See Table IV for the            resulting values of r, b, d
and     a.

        The dividend equation is precisely that               used in   the constant   discount   rate
case, in section IIIB.
        For    undifferenced   specifications, the          dietributed   lag equation   was obtained

by    projecting EE1yt+i.iIIt.i onto the space of current and lagged dividends
        as in equation (12a). For ditterenced specifications, a difference of
EZbiyt.i+lIIt.l       was projected         onto Ht.   as   in equation   (12b).


      The final relationship involved is a regression to forecast expected

returns. Let Rt.j             (Pt.j4dt.j)'Pt.j_i denote the cx poet return. Note that

since        Mt is a subset of I,             — rt+j             with        orthogonal   to   Ht. So
ERt+JIHt
                  Ert.jIH: a regression to forecast cx post returns                 also forecasts
expected       returns. The regressions are


(17a)          Rt+i — g      YQdt +   ... • 1ndtn
(17b)          Rt.i — g     YUdt      ...    + 'nt—n

 One can use (17a) to solve for
                                                                         As before, the dividend
 equation (ha) yields Eb1dtjIHt.                   Together these produce
                                                                                    the EZb'YtiI}.f
 Similarly, (17b)          and (lib) yield the distributed lag equation In differenced

 specifications.

      For computational simplicity, the specification test was performed conditional

         j: b and the parameters of equations (17a) and (17b). It may be shown

 that the parameters of the distributed lag equation can be estimated from the

 regressions

      The length of the distributed lag of ex post               returns on dividends      was set to

30, as in Shiller [1984, Table 1]. This was done because OLS standard errors

suggested insignificant                   for both the Dow Jones and the S          and P for a lag

length   of ten years. Because of degrees of freedom limitations resulting from
the thirty—year lag, the test in this section was applied only to the S and P.
An unconstrained lag was           used, since both            and    the sum of the        were
estimated more precisely with this lag than with Shiller's [1984] polynomial
distributed lag.

    The regression of returns on dividends is reported in Table VA. In

contrast to the results of the previous section, some predictability of returns

is suggested. Y0, the coefficient on d     or       was significantly different

from zero at the 95 percent level. So, too, was the sum of the other dis-

tributed lag coefficients. See columns (3) and (4). The significance of

the coefficients is, however, probably somewhat overstated, since, as explained

above, some experimentation was done to obtain a specification with significant

coefficients.

     Table VB has estimates of the dividend equations. These look quite

similar to those in Table lB. Table VC has estimates of the distributed lag

equations (18a) and (lSb). Note that the coefficients are woefully insig-

nificant for differenced specifications.

     Results of the test of the null hypothesis of no bubbles are reported in

Table VI. The null is strongly rejected for undifferenced specifications,

not at all for differenced specifications. The sum of the biases of the 6.

was positive for all specifications except differenced, lag length =   4.

     It is rather disturbing that allowing for time varying discount rates

yields stronger evidence against the model for undifferenced specifica-

tions, weaker evidence for differenced specifications. One possible

explanation is that the equation (17) forecasts of future expected returns

are quite noisy, and very different from the market's actual expected returns.

The fitted values from equation (17a) could then be spuriously leading to a

rejection for undifferenced specification, or conversely, those from (l7b)

could be incorrectly suggesting little evidence against the model for dif—

ferenced specifications. A priority for future research, then, is performing

similar tests with a more tightly constrained parameterization of what

determines expected returns. The evidence in this section does little to pin down
                                              —27—




 the extent to which the rejectionsin the
                                          constant discount rate model are
 due to variations in discount rates.

                             IV. Discussion and Conclusions


       This section contains some concluding comments on the previous section's results.

       The first comment to make is that
                                           any diagnostic tests of (1)' will
 clearly have arbitrarily small power against "near rational" bubbles
                                                                      that are
 arbitrarily clos, to being rational. This is, t Pt - * •
                                                        P C, and
 kct_i tar Some k that is very close to b diagnostic tests on
                                                                              equation (1)'
 may   well tail to reject equation (1)'. Sumers [19863 calculated
                                                                                 the   small
 sample    power or tests similar (though not identical)        to those   performed in
 section   iiis,and, unsurprisingly, found that such tests are ttlikely to detect
 variations in expected returns caused by near rational bubbles.
       The presence at near rationa.j
                                        bubbles certainly means that equation (1) is,
strictly speaking, invalid. This fact does riot, however,          seem to me to be of
reat     importance tar the intsrpr.tatjon or implications of the results
                                                                          of
section iii. A near rational        bubble that   tends to   generate nearly constant
expected returns will tend to       generate nearly the same time serIes Dattern of
pricàs   as will a raticna bubble. That th, tests                      iris
                                                          in section          have   little
power to distinguish betw* such a bubble and a
                                                         Strictly rational is not,
then, very    important   far the Interpr,tatj       of the evidence presented         in
section ui, at least at     the   level of generality of this paper.
    The second coement to make concerns what determines whether a constant
expected return specification is a good approximation tar the purposes of the
specification test. The section hID analysis of a linearized model with time
variation In expected returns suggests that the key          requirement is not near

constancy of returns expected by the market,         but near constancy    of   the return
                                            —28—




that   is   expected conditional   on   the past history of dividends.          In the

linearized model, £p*X                                                          In that

model, then, EptIHt       E1_1b Edt+iIHt not
                                             only when r.j — r but            also when

Er,iH -         for 1>0, I.e., when past dividends do not        help predict future
expectedreturns. Intuitively, if only past dividends           are used to forecast the

expected present discounted value of future dividends, and variations in
expected returns are independent of past dividends, it is reasonable to
forecast expected returns     to   be at their unconditional mean and to discount
future dividends at a constant rate.          This statenent holds       In   a strict
mathematical sense in a linearized model, and therefore may hold approximately
in the underlying nonlinear model.
       An implication is that most of the mild     evidence   against the constant
expected    return specification in Shiller [1981a,    1984] and all of the somewhat
stronger    evidence in Flood, Hodrick and Kaplan [1986] may      well   not be directly

relevant to the interpretation of the results of this paper.7 It is, of

course, of interest to further investigate whether, for the purposes of the

specification test, it is adequate as an approximation to consider only

variations in expected returns that are predictable from the past history of

dividends, and the extent to which such variations explain what seems to be

anomalous behavior in the data. This is an important task for future research.

       What is required is a reconciliation of what appear to be incompatible

price and dividend data. The incompatibility is manifested in an upward bias

in the estimates of the coefficients of the projection of prices onto lagged

dividends. A reconciliation that involves a parametric model for bubbles, or

fads, and which allows for variation in expected returns, is a challenging

task for future research.

      6. As             noted in West (1985], the limiting distribution of the regression of

       on dividends may            not   in general be a single vector. The statements in this

     paragraph therfore should be interpreted with caution.

             7. using the same data as In this paper,              Shiller     [1981a, 198U) and      Flood,

     Hodrick and         Kaplan [1986] obtain coefficients siificant at the five per cent
     level when the ex post return Is regrsed on certain sets of lagged prices,

     dividend-price ratios and ex post returns.                    Shiller [1984] also obtains

     significant coefficients using lagg1 earnings.
