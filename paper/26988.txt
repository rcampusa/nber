Recent evidence suggests that the short-term transition of the opioid crisis from prescription
opioids to heroin can be attributed to the reformulation of OxyContin, which substantially
reduced access to abusable prescription opioids. In this paper, we find that over a longer time
horizon, reformulation stimulated illicit drug markets to grow and evolve. We compare overdose
trajectories in areas more exposed to reformulation, defined as states with higher rates of non-
medical OxyContin use before reformulation, to less exposed areas. More exposed areas
experienced disproportionate increases in fatal overdoses involving synthetic opioids (fentanyl)
and non-opioid substances like cocaine, suggesting that these new epidemics are related to the
same factors driving the rise in heroin deaths. Instead of just short-term substitution from
prescription opioid to heroin overdoses, the transition to illicit markets spurred by reformulation
led to growth in the overall overdose rate to unprecedented levels.

    1. Introduction

    The opioid crisis is a national emergency, and policymakers are struggling to implement policies

to curb rising overdose rates that are now being driven primarily by illicit opioids. The evolution of

the opioid crisis can be observed in Figure 1A, which shows trends by category of opioid overdose

for the period 1999-2017. Prior to 2011, natural and semisynthetic prescription opioids were the

driving force behind opioid mortality. However, heroin overdose rates began to escalate near the

end of 2010. Beginning in 2013, the growth of overdoses involving synthetic opioids, primarily

illicitly-manufactured fentanyl (Pardo et al., 2019), outpaced even heroin’s rapid escalation. The shift

to illicit opioids and the growth of illicit opioid markets has pushed drug overdose rates overall to

unprecedented levels. In recent years, we have observed increases in overdoses involving non-

opioid drugs (Ruhm, 2019), often mixed with fentanyl (Jones et al., 2017; Ciccarone, 2017; Pardo et

al., 2019). The number of overdoses involving cocaine, for example, has almost tripled since 2013

(see Figure 1B); the vast majority of these (over 70% in 2017) involve some type of synthetic opioid.

        Recent work shows that states with higher rates of nonmedical OxyContin use before

reformulation experienced a disproportionate rise in heroin overdoses after reformulation (Alpert et

al., 2018). This research suggests that the reformulation led to the heroin epidemic, explaining the

vast majority – if not all – of the increase in heroin overdoses between 2010 and 2013. As access to

abusable prescription opioids decreased, the current stock of individuals misusing opioids switched

to illicit drug markets (Cicero et al, 2012; Coplan et al., 2013; Tuazon et al., 2019), increasing heroin

overdoses and infectious diseases (Beheshti, 2020; Powell et al., 2019). 1 Previous quasi-experimental

work, however, found little short-term evidence that reformulation affected overdose rates beyond

just a shift in the types of opioids involved in overdoses (Alpert et al., 2018; Evans et al., 2019).



1Other work has found some evidence of similar types of responses to supply-side interventions such as
prescription drug monitoring programs (see Mallatt, 2018 and Meinhofer, 2018).

                                                     1
        Longer terms consequences of supply-side interventions may differ from short term effects,

and the expectation was that the reformulation of OxyContin would reduce the number of new

people who misused and then became dependent on OxyContin with possible downstream

consequences on overdose deaths. However, drug overdoses have continued to rise since 2013,

suggesting that the longer-term consequences may be very different than expected. While there are

potentially negative consequences of switching from legal to illicit opioid markets even if the overall

overdose rate is unchanged (e.g., spread of hepatitis C), the welfare calculus of any supply-side

intervention becomes more negative if, over the longer term horizon, it also led to drastically higher

fatal overdose rates.

        In this paper we seek to understand the longer-term impacts of the 2010 OxyContin

reformulation and whether it may have contributed to the recent rise in fatal overdoses.

Understanding the causes of the changing drug mortality landscape is important if we want to

understand how to properly combat the ongoing public health emergency, as well as properly assess

the overall welfare implications of OxyContin reformulation. We adopt and extend the approach of

Alpert et al. (2018) to study the evolution of the opioid crisis since the reformulation of OxyContin

in August 2010. This approach studies how differential exposure to reformulation, defined in terms

of pre-reformulation levels of OxyContin misuse, predicts changes in overdose deaths and other

outcomes after reformulation. We use these relationships to infer the national-level implications of

reformulation.

        We begin by studying heroin overdoses over a longer time period than previous work,

permitting us to test whether its relationship with OxyContin reformulation weakened over time, as

we would predict if reformulation led to decreases in initiation. We then examine whether exposure

to reformulation also predicts geographic variation in the rise in synthetic opioid deaths. This

analysis helps us understand whether reformulation is responsible for deaths involving illicitly-

                                                   2
manufactured fentanyl, a primary driver of the recent escalation of the opioid crisis. Next, we

consider potential spillovers in other drug markets, specifically cocaine and psychostimulants. To

summarize the effect on overdose death rates, we consider the net effects of reformulation on total

fatal drug overdose rates.

        In addition, we also examine new substance use treatment admissions related to heroin and

other opioids to ascertain if there is evidence of a reduction in the number of newly dependent

users. A relationship between reformulation and reductions in initiation into dependence would

potentially signal future decreases in overdose death rates.

        There are few opportunities to study the ramifications of exogenous growth in illicit drug

markets (see Jacobson, 2004) and how these markets evolve and innovate over time. This paper

takes advantage of one of these opportunities and extends existing evidence to more carefully

consider the longer-term impacts of the massive shift to the black market caused by OxyContin

reformulation. By extending prior analyses just a few years, we uncover evidence that reformulation

led to the increase in total drug fatal overdoses, driving it to unprecedented levels, through the

expansion of illicit drug markets.

        The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We provide a brief background about the

reformulation of OxyContin in the next section. In section 3, we describe the data. We discuss our

empirical strategy in Section 4. We provide results in Section 5 and consider the implications of our

results in terms of illicit drug market responses to reformulation. We conclude in Section 6.

2. Background

        OxyContin was introduced in 1996 by Purdue Pharma. It is a brand-name drug for the

extended-release formulation of oxycodone, a semi-synthetic opioid, used for the management of

acute and chronic pain. The key innovation of OxyContin was its long-acting formula, which

provided 12 hours of continuous pain relief, significantly improving the quality and ease of pain

                                                   3
management compared to previous drugs. However, crushing or dissolving the pill caused the

complete dose of oxycodone to be delivered immediately, making OxyContin especially easy to

abuse. By 2010, OxyContin had more than $3 billion in sales, making it one of the highest selling

drugs in the United States (Bartholow, 2011). The drug’s wide market presence and its abuse

potential stimulated extensive diversion to non-medical use and there were concerns about

widespread abuse of OxyContin as early as 2000 (Cicero et al., 2005). Many experts have implicated

OxyContin as a key driver of the opioid epidemic (e.g., Kolodny et al., 2015) and recent work

concludes that its introduction explains a significant share of the growth in overdoses since 1996

(Alpert et al., 2019), suggesting that its removal or reformulation could also have large effects.

        In April 2010, Purdue Pharma introduced a reformulated version of OxyContin designed to

make the drug more difficult to abuse. The abuse-deterrent version uses physicochemical barriers to

make the pill hard to break, crush, or dissolve. The change increased the costs of misusing

OxyContin while maintaining the medical benefits of the drug. 2 In August 2010, Purdue Pharma

stopped distributing the original formulation of OxyContin to pharmacies.

        The removal of the original formulation represents one of the largest reductions in the

supply of abusable prescription opioids to date. Prior work has provided quasi-experimental

evidence that this reduction initiated widespread substitution to heroin, leading to a sharp rise in

heroin overdoses (Alpert et al., 2018; Evans et al., 2019). There is little existing evidence that

reformulation induced a meaningful change in the overall overdose rate. However, the opioid crisis

has evolved considerably since the end of the sample periods previously analyzed in this literature.

Our understanding of the effectiveness of supply-side interventions requires studying longer-term

outcomes, permitting time for illicit markets to expand and innovate.


2The reformulated version can still be abused orally (i.e., taking higher doses than prescribed) and some users
have counteracted the abuse-deterrent properties. Cicero and Ellis (2015) noted that the significant time
effort required should deter use of these methods.

    3. Data

3.1 Mortality

        We use the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) Multiple Cause of Death mortality

files—the census of deaths in the United States— to study annual overdose deaths from 1999 to

2017. We use restricted data to access state identifiers and categorize overdoses based on the state

of residence of the deceased. We code deaths as drug poisonings, which we refer to as “overdoses”

throughout this paper, by using ICD-10 external cause of injury codes X40-X44, X60-64, X85, or

Y10-Y14. We use drug identification codes for information about the substances found in the body

at death. T40.1 indicates poisoning by heroin. T40.2 designates natural and semisynthetic opioids

excluding heroin (e.g., oxycodone), and T40.4 refers to synthetic opioids excluding methadone (e.g.,

fentanyl). To study opioid overdoses, we aggregate T40.0-T40.4 plus T40.6, which include opium,

methadone, and unspecified narcotics in addition to the categories previously mentioned. In

addition, we will study overdoses involving cocaine (T40.5) and psychostimulants (T43.6).

        There are concerns about missing opioid-related overdoses overall or by type, such as those

coded as unspecified narcotics (T40.6) or unspecified drugs (T50.9) (Ruhm, 2018). We study T40.6

and T50.9 overdoses directly and test whether these unspecified overdoses are related to OxyContin

misuse to infer possible biases affecting our main results.

3.2 Substance Abuse Treatment Admissions

        As a complementary measure to help capture escalation to dependence, we study substance

abuse treatment admissions in the Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS) for 1999-2017. The TEDS,

which is maintained by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration

(SAMHSA), includes admissions data from all treatment facilities receiving public funding, whether

through federal block grants, Medicaid or Medicare insurance or other state funding sources. These



                                                   5
data comprise a significant portion of all admissions to substance abuse treatment facilities and

represents the best available national source on treatment admissions available.

        Each admission record reports up to three substances of abuse at the time of treatment. We

consider any admission in which heroin is listed as either the first, second or third substance as a

heroin substance abuse treatment admission. We also examine admissions including at least one

opioid, whether heroin, non-prescription methadone, or “other opiates and synthetics,” as any of

the three substances of abuse, and refer to these as “opioid treatment admissions.” Admissions

refer to ages 12+, which we scale by the population size for the same ages.

        As part of the admissions record, TEDS records the number of prior substance use

treatment episodes reported by the client at the time of intake, allowing us to study heroin and

opioid admissions for people with no prior substance use treatment episodes. While not a perfect

measure of initiation into dependence, a relative decline in these types of admissions would be

consistent with a decline in opioid misuse initiation. However, a rise in these new cases would cast

further doubts on the possible scope for reduced initiation to later impact overdose rates.

        There are concerns regarding consistent reporting of admissions data across states in the

TEDS as differences in state licensure and accreditation practices can influence which facilities are

reporting into the system over time (SAMHSA, 2014).3 Our assumption will be that any state-level

changes in reporting of opioid admissions are not correlated with pre-reformulation level of

OxyContin misuse beginning in 2011. We will consider the possible effects of misreporting when

discussing the TEDS results below.

3.3 Nonmedical OxyContin Use and OxyContin Supply



3During our time period, 42 states report admissions every year and all states report admissions for at least 15
of the 19 years. Results are similar if we select on a balanced panel. In total, we have 969 observations in the
TEDS for 1999-2017.

                                                       6
        To measure nonmedical use of OxyContin and pain relievers, we use aggregated, state-level

data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), a nationally-representative

household survey of individuals ages 12 and older. NSDUH, also maintained by SAMHSA, is the

country’s largest survey collecting information on substance use and mental health issues, including

information on self-reported “nonmedical OxyContin use” and “nonmedical pain reliever use”

within the past year. The NSDUH began asking about nonmedical OxyContin use in 2004. These

data were publicly available as two-year waves and aggregated further to 2004-2009 to reduce

measurement errors concerns.

        The NSDUH has two important advantages. First, it specifies OxyContin in the survey

question, which is the exact drug product affected by the reformulation. Second, it specifies

nonmedical use, the relevant dimension since reformulation did not affect the medical capabilities of

OxyContin. The interaction of these two properties is essential for this analysis.

        Nonmedical use or misuse captures use by individuals who were not the ones for whom the

medication was prescribed or who use it in a manner inconsistent with the physician’s prescription

instructions. Alternative data sources on OxyContin use through legal channels, such as pharmacy

claims data or reports of legal distribution, do not capture the differential effects of the

reformulation—which we would expect to affect nonmedical users more than medical users—across

states. Alpert et al. (2018) find that, in practice, nonmedical use is highly correlated with oxycodone

supply and OxyContin prescriptions. Evans et al. (2019) pursue a similar strategy as Alpert et al.

(2018) but use oxycodone supply as the measure of exposure to reformulation. This metric results

in similar conclusions given the correlations shown in Alpert et al. (2018), but we rely on the

NSDUH measure of OxyContin nonmedical use as our primary metric of exposure to reformulation

to avoid conflating medical use with non-medical use and to focus on OxyContin.




                                                    7
       The NSDUH measures are self-reported and possibly prone to some reporting error.

NSDUH uses techniques designed to elicit accurate and honest answers from respondents. These

methods – such as showing pictures of OxyContin – reduce concerns that the “OxyContin misuse”

measure reflects misuse of other types of oxycodone. NSDUH provides respondents with a highly

private and confidential method for responding to questions in an effort to increase honest

reporting. Under-reporting due to missing values is rare. To the extent that there is misreporting in

the OxyContin misuse variable, our estimates should be attenuated. Moreover, if people were

reporting nonmedical pain reliever use but not nonmedical OxyContin use, even though they

misused OxyContin specifically, then we should find that the nonmedical pain reliever misuse

variable is also associated with differential growth in overdoses. We do not.

       As a complementary though imperfect measure, we adopt an alternative measure of cross-

state variation in exposure to OxyContin reformulation -- per capita OxyContin supply, measured in

morphine equivalent doses (MEDs, defined as 60 morphine milligram equivalents). These data are

collected as part of the Drug Enforcement Administration’s (DEA’s) Automation of Reports and

Consolidated Orders System (ARCOS), which tracks the distribution of controlled substances to

each state (and sub-state geographies). Public data are available by ingredient but due to our interest

in OxyContin specifically, we filed a Freedom of Information Act request to the DEA for

OxyContin specifically. The data include the census of OxyContin supplied throughout the country.

We aggregate the years 2004 to 2009 to remain consistent with our NSDUH measures.

       We present summary statistics in Panel A of Table 1 for 2004-2009, separated into “high”

and “low” misuse states based on 2004-2009 OxyContin misuse rates. The difference in

OxyContin misuse rates between low and high misuse states is large, with high misuse states having

nearly twice the rate of low misuse states. In the pre-reformulation period, we see no difference in

rates of heroin mortality. Heroin treatment admissions are actually lower in high OxyContin misuse

                                                   8
states than low states. We do observe higher rates of deaths caused by natural/semisynthetic

opioids (prescription analgesics, including OxyContin), synthetic opioids, and cocaine in the high

misusing states. Panel B of Table 1 shows the correlations between different drug overdose rates

for 2004-2009. Before reformulation, there is a strong positive correlation between

natural/semisynthetic and synthetic opioids as well as psychostimulants.

        We show the geographic variation in OxyContin misuse in Figure A1. There is substantial

variation even among neighboring states. As one metric of this variation, we calculate the average

non-medical OxyContin use rate for each state’s neighbors. We then regress (excluding Hawaii and

Alaska, N=49) each state’s rate on this average neighbor rate. The estimate is negative and statistically

different from zero (using heteroskedastic-robust standard errors), implying considerable amounts

of variation even among neighboring states.



      4. Empirical Strategy

        We conduct our analysis at the state level due to data availability. State borders are likely not

appropriate boundaries for medical or illicit drug markets. However, this level of aggregation should

not be problematic, and the main cost is that we do not observe additional sub-state variation in

non-medical OxyContin use to exploit.

        We adopt an event study design, which estimates the relationship between initial OxyContin

misuse and overdose outcomes in each year, normalized to 0 in 2010. This approach permits us to

flexibly trace the relationship between exposure to the reformulation of OxyContin and overdose

rates. The specification is

(1)      𝑌 = 𝛼 + 𝛾 + 𝛿 × 𝑂𝑥𝑦𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑒               + 𝜃 × 𝑃𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑅𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑒            +𝜀 ,

where 𝑌 is fatal overdoses per 100,000 in state s and year t; 𝑂𝑥𝑦𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑒          represents the fixed

OxyContin misuse rate in state s in the pre-reformulation period (2004-2009).

                                                    9
𝑃𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑅𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑒           represents the pain reliever misuse rate in state s in the pre-reformulation

period (2004-2009).

        The specification includes state (𝛼 ) and time fixed effects (𝛾 ) to account for fixed

differences across states and national trends in overdoses. This model permits us to test for pre-

existing trends while studying the timing of any effect given the expectation of lagged effects in this

context. We plot the 𝛿 estimates with 95% confidence intervals, adjusted for state-level clustering.

The 𝛿 terms represent how overdose rates would have been different in year t for a state had its

pre-reformulation non-medical OxyContin use rate been 1 percentage point higher. A one

percentage point increase in non-medical OxyContin use is very large; its (weighted) standard

deviation is only 0.23. We will often report the change in the overdose rate implied by the estimates

for a one-standard deviation increase in exposure to OxyContin (i.e., how would overdose rates in a

state have evolved if it had been one standard deviation more exposed to reformulation?).

        We graphically mark 2011 as the first full year of reformulation, though partial effects in

2010 are consistent with causal impacts associated with reformulation. The timing of effects is

expected to vary by substance. All regressions are population-weighted using population data from

the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER).

        The pain reliever misuse variable (interacted with time indicators) addresses many concerns

about secular changes across states. Most policies targeting opioid misuse and most predictors

correlated with overdoses typically relate to all opioids, not OxyContin specifically. The inclusion of

these pain reliever misuse variables helps to isolate effects unique to OxyContin while accounting

for characteristics that influence overdoses more broadly. 4 In principle, this variable is not perfect




4Alpert et al. (2018) found evidence of relative reductions in heroin overdoses associated with the more general
pain reliever misuse variable, consistent with systematic adoption of policies to reduce opioid-related harms in
high misuse states.

                                                      10
because there may still be some variation within the more general measure of pain reliever use that

should be captured. However, other time-varying covariates and policy variables provide little

additional information once these pain reliever misuse variables are included in the specification.

We show this in sensitivity tests. This insensitivity is consistent with these variables adequately

soaking up many of the concerns that we may have about other confounding policies or shocks. We

also note that our results for heroin overdoses, synthetic overdoses, cocaine overdoses, and all

overdoses are generally strengthened by the inclusion of the pain reliever misuse variables, suggesting

that any residual unobserved confounders are also likely attenuating the estimates.

        The assumption of equation (1) is that, in the absence of reformulation, state overdose rate

growth would have been unrelated to pre-reformulation rates of non-medical OxyContin use

(conditional on non-medical pain reliever use). This “parallel trends” assumption cannot be tested,

though we can evaluate the appropriateness of this assumption in the pre-period which may suggest

its appropriateness in the post-period.

        Finally, it will be useful to summarize our findings. In the spirit of Alpert et al. (2018), we

estimate a trend break specification:

(2) 𝑌 = 𝛼 + 𝛾

  +𝛿 × 𝑂𝑥𝑦𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑒       × 𝑡 + 𝛿 × 𝑂𝑥𝑦𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑒       × (𝑡 ≥ 2011) + 𝛿 × 𝑂𝑥𝑦𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑒       × (𝑡 ≥ 2011) × (𝑡 − 2011)

+𝜃 × 𝑃𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑒    × 𝑡 + 𝜃 × 𝑃𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑒     × (𝑡 ≥ 2011) + 𝜃 × 𝑃𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑒   × (𝑡 ≥ 2011) × (𝑡 − 2011) + 𝜀 .




We only use 2006-2009, 2011-2017 for this estimation, and we report 𝛿 + 6𝛿 , which is the implied

relationship between pre-reformulation OxyContin misuse and the outcome in 2017 in this

parameterized model. The OxyContin misuse variable is permitted to have an overall linear trend

relationship with the outcome as well as a separate shift and linear trend break in the post-period.




                                                    11
The more general pain reliever variable is parameterized in the same manner. We exclude 2010

from this analysis since it is partially-treated.

        Our models assume that overdose rates are affected by a state’s own rate of exposure to

reformulation. In practice, there could be spillovers across states. Illicit markets may expand in

states experiencing large increases in demand for illicit opioids and these growing markets may affect

substance use and markets in other states. These spillovers will likely attenuate our estimates since

some “low misuse states” would experience larger increases than expected in overdose deaths due to

their proximity to “high misuse states.”



    5. Results

5.1 Opioid Overdoses

        We begin by estimating the relationship between pre-reformulation OxyContin misuse and

opioid-related overdoses – both overall and by opioid type. Figure 2A presents event study

estimates for heroin overdose deaths. We observe no evidence of a pre-existing trend, followed by

an increase beginning in 2011. This sharp rate of growth continues through 2016 before we see the

first decrease in 2017. The finding that the trend continues through 2016 casts doubts on the

hypothesis that reformulation of OxyContin would lead to reductions in initiation and subsequent

longer-term declines in misuse. Instead, the results suggest that reformulation continues to play a

meaningful role in explaining the rise in heroin overdoses.

        We estimate a similar, though delayed, pattern for synthetic opioids in Figure 2B. Again, the

estimates are flat prior to reformulation, suggesting the absence of confounding trends. We observe

a rise in the estimates for synthetic opioid overdoses beginning in 2013, and these effects then

escalate precipitously until the end of the sample. The 2017 estimate is 19.7, implying that a one



                                                    12
standard deviation higher rate of exposure to reformulation caused 4.5 additional synthetic opioid

overdoses per 100,000.

          This result suggests that the entry of fentanyl was not independent of demand but, instead,

strongly followed demand for illicit opioids. As the supply of abusable prescription opioids was

reduced in the medical market, users switched to illicit markets. The fact that heroin overdoses

increased immediately after reformulation indicates an expansion in the illicit market in terms of the

number of users, followed by an evolution in the substances. These results, which show a

systematic relationship between exposure to OxyContin reformulation and mortality involving

synthetic opioids, suggest that fentanyl was part of this evolution. The delay in effect was likely due

to the time it took for illicit suppliers to innovate in order to meet the rising demand for heroin, with

that innovation initially being the use of fentanyl and its analogs as cheap fillers in bags sold as

heroin (Pardo et al., 2019).

          In Panel 2C, we explore the effect of exposure to OxyContin reformulation on natural and

semi-synthetic opioids, the category that includes OxyContin. A pre-existing upward trend is

observed here but flattens around the time of reformulation, and there is little evidence of a return

to this prior trend. The pre-existing trend is expected due to our identification strategy. States with

high rates of OxyContin misuse prior to reformulation would be more likely to experience

increasing rates of misuse in the pre-period in order to be identified as “high misuse” states, and

hence these states have higher5 (and growing) rates of natural and semi-synthetic opioid mortality.

          In Panel 2D, we study the aggregated measure of opioid overdoses (T40.0-T40.4, T40.6),

thereby incorporating opioid overdoses not specified as a particular type of opioid. The results for

this outcome represent one of the key differences from prior work. We estimate large increases in

total opioid overdoses due to exposure to reformulation. Initially, reformulation may have had only


5   This was shown in Panel A of Table 1.

                                                    13
small effects on overall overdose mortality, but the increase in heroin and fentanyl overdoses

eventually dominates any reduction in overdoses involving natural and semi-synthetic opioids in

states most exposed to OxyContin reformulation. This finding is also consistent with large spillover

effects to non-opioid drugs, which are explored further below.

        One interpretation of this finding is that the OxyContin reformulation led some individuals

to move from prescription opioids to illicitly-produced opioids, expanding demand in the illicit

market. As demand expanded and given the lack of information regarding actual product quality

and contents in black markets (Galenianos et al., 2012; Miron 2003), there were spillovers

throughout the illicit drug market. Specifically, suppliers mixed fentanyl with other drugs. Given

the additional potency of illicit fentanyl, overdose rates grew even faster. Because of this market

growth, we no longer observe a simple substitution of overdoses from natural/semisynthetic opioids

to illicit opioids, but overall growth of opioid-related overdoses.

        We parameterize these results using estimates from equation (2) in Table 2, Panel A. We

estimate that states more exposed to reformulation experienced large and statistically significant

growth in overdoses by 2017 for heroin, synthetic opioids, and all opioids.



5.2 Spillovers to Non-Opioid Drug Overdoses

        We next consider whether OxyContin reformulation affected cocaine overdoses. Cocaine

overdoses might increase if individuals who were using OxyContin for nonmedical purposes

switched to cocaine post reformulation, in which case mortality should rise immediately (similar to

that observed for heroin). Alternatively, suppliers in geographic areas where fentanyl was being used

might start mixing it with cocaine too, in which case we could see a delayed increase in cocaine

mortality.



                                                   14
        In Figure 3A, we observe a pattern for cocaine overdoses similar to the one estimated for

synthetic opioids (Figure 2B). The results suggest a strong relationship between prior OxyContin

misuse and the rise in cocaine overdoses after reformulation, but the effect is delayed. The 2017

estimate is 5.5, implying that a one standard deviation increase in exposure to reformulation

increased cocaine overdoses by 1.3 per 100,000. Table 2 includes the equivalent result from the

parametric model, suggesting even larger effects.

        In Figure 3B, we study cocaine overdoses that do not also involve synthetic opioids. Here

the trend is generally flat. There is some evidence of a small differential increase in 2013; however,

the imperfect coding of synthetic opioids at this time would imply that we should observe some rise

in cocaine overdoses not involving reported opioids. The relative magnitudes of the Panel A

estimates compared to the Panel B estimates strongly suggest that the relationship with cocaine is

not due to some confounding secular trend specific to cocaine. Instead, reformulation had a delayed

effect on cocaine overdoses involving opioids, which could be due to either sellers spiking the

cocaine supply6 or users deciding to use cocaine in combination with their opioids.

        In recent years, the United States has also experienced a surge in overdoses involving

psychostimulants, such as methamphetamine and dextroamphetamine (Kariisa et al., 2019). We find

less evidence of a relationship with reformulation in the case of these substances. Results are

provided in Figure 3C. The analyses show a relative immediate decline in states with high rates of

pre-reformulation OxyContin misuse. This reduction may suggest that psychostimulants are more

likely to be used as complements with prescription opioids than with heroin. However, after

fentanyl’s entry, this trend reverses, suggesting again that the connection might be driven either by

contaminated supply or consumer preferences to use multiple substance with synthetic opioids.



6 This mixing could be intentional, or it could be accidental if suppliers unintentionally mix substances while
in preparation for distribution.

                                                       15
When we consider overdoses involving psychostimulants without any synthetic opioid present

(Figure 3D), we observe stronger evidence of a differential and persistent decline, consistent with

substitution in the absence of fentanyl. In Panel A of Table 2, we estimate a negative (but not

statistically different) relationship between pre-reformulation OxyContin misuse and growth in

overdoses involving psychostimulants.

5.3 Changes in Overdoses Versus Changes in Coding of Overdoses

        There are concerns about the appropriate coding of opioid overdose deaths and how such

coding has changed over time (Ruhm, 2018, 2019). Inappropriate coding will likely attenuate our

results, assuming that they are not systematically related to nonmedical OxyContin use since we are

“missing” some of the overdoses (overall or for specific opioid types) caused by reformulation. 7 To

test the magnitude and direction of this problem, we study overdoses involving unspecified

narcotics/drugs. We exclude overdoses also specifying another substance. The concern is that the

differential rise in synthetic opioid overdoses related to our misuse variable is a data artifact, and we

will observe a corresponding decrease in overdoses involving unspecified narcotics/drugs.

        In the appendix, we show weak evidence of a systematic increase post reformulation for

unspecified narcotics (Figure A2A). There is stronger evidence that OxyContin misuse predicts

growth in the category of unspecified drugs (Figure A2B), suggesting that our main estimates are

undercounts since some of these unspecified drug overdoses likely involve opioids. Since we do not

observe differential reductions in overdoses involving unspecified narcotics or other drugs, we are

more confident that we are observing actual changes, though muted, in overdoses and not

systematic improvements in the coding of synthetic opioids.




7 Our event study framework makes a systematic relationship with miscoding less likely since the miscoding
rate would have to systematically change in high OxyContin misuse states at the time of reformulation given
the timing of many of the results.

                                                     16
5.4 Total Effects on Overdose Death Rates

        Alpert et al. (2018) found only limited evidence that reformulation led to a short-term

increase in total (opioid and non-opioid) fatal drug overdoses (the estimated increase was not

statistically different from zero). However, as the opioid crisis has escalated and transitioned, there

is much stronger evidence that reformulation induced a sharp rise in total overdose deaths. This

relationship is shown in Figure 4, which examines the relationship between reformulation and all

fatal drug poisonings.

        The states most exposed to reformulation have experienced much sharper growth in overall

overdoses, suggesting that the reformulation of OxyContin led to growth in illicit markets and

increased the overall overdose rate. This growth is partially due to the shift of demand from the

medical market to the illicit market, but it is also due to the additional potency of new, cheap

synthetic opioids that were mixed with all sorts of illicit drugs available through illicit markets, which

lack quality controls. Our evidence suggests that spillovers of fentanyl to other illicit substances

have played an important role, but this opportunity was initiated by new users entering these

markets given reduced access to abusable prescription opioids through medical markets.

        The parameterized estimate for 2017 is included in the last column of Table 2. The event

study estimate is 20.4 while the parameterized estimate is larger. An estimate of 20.4 implies that a

one standard deviation increase in exposure to reformulation increased overdoses by 4.7 per 100,000

people in 2017. We revisit the implications of this finding in Section 5.7.



5.5     Sensitivity Analyses

        Table 2 includes results from several sensitivity analyses, which we explain in this section.

Our main estimates reflect the effects of pre-reformulation non-medical OxyContin use, holding

constant the broader effects and trends related to pain reliever misuse. While not shown, we do not

                                                   17
estimate similar increases (for heroin, synthetic opioids, cocaine, and overall overdoses) associated

with pain reliever misuse -- the effects are unique to OxyContin misuse.

        For reasons discussed above, including additional time-varying factors should not affect our

results given the inclusion of the non-medical pain reliever use variables. We test this assumption

here. In the spirit of Jaeger et al. (2020), we include a set of covariates, defined as averages for 2004-

2009, and parameterize their impact in the same manner as the misuse variables in equation (2) (i.e.,

we interact them with a linear trend while also permitting them to have a level and trend shift

beginning in 2011). Our covariates are the log of population, percent foreign born, percent white,

and percent 25-44 (see Table 1 for data sources). These variables were selected because they are

often associated with overdose trends but also because we observe notable differences based on

initial pre-reformulation OxyContin misuse rates in these variables. 8

        We include these results in Panel B of Table 2. The estimates are generally similar. The

insensitivity of the results to these additional covariates is evidence that the nonmedical pain reliever

use variable is addressing many of the potential confounding factors.

        Next, we estimate equation (2) but use an alternative (though flawed) measure of exposure

to reformulation using administrative ARCOS data on OxyContin supply in the state to construct

our pre-reformulation measure of “exposure.” We present the results in Panel C of Table 2. The

standard deviation of OxyContin supply is 0.45, about twice as large as the standard deviation for

the misuse variable, so the equivalent exercise of thinking about the effects of a one standard

deviation increase in exposure to reformulation requires doubling the implied effects (relative to

before).




8We selected only a limited set of covariates due to concerns of overfitting since each covariate is interacted
with three terms.

                                                       18
        The pattern of results is similar and the one standard deviation effects are generally, with

some exceptions, comparable to those observed before. However, there is also evidence that some

of the results are attenuated and noisier. The additional noise when using the ARCOS measure

reflects the conflation of medical use and nonmedical use of OxyContin, as ARCOS cannot

distinguish between appropriate use and diverted supply.

        In our main analysis, we aggregated 2004-2009 data to construct our measures of pre-

reformulation misuse. There may be concerns that a transitory shock to substance use in a state

immediately prior to reformulation is captured in this metric and that transitory shock itself may also

predict future (post-reformulation) changes in overdose rates. To test the possible importance of

this concern, we replicate our analyses while using only 2004-2005 to construct the non-medical use

measures. The advantage of these years is that we can measure misuse rates prior to the sample

period used for estimation of equation (2), reducing concerns about the variable itself predicting

growth or mean reversion. These results are presented in Table 2, Panel D. They too are generally

similar to the main estimates.

        Finally, our standard error and confidence interval estimates are adjusted for within-state

clustering. With only 51 units, there may be concerns about finite sample bias. As one approach to

test for this, we randomly (without replacement) and jointly assign our misuse rates to different

states and then re-estimate equation (2). We compare the absolute value of the t-statistics from the

true sample to those generated in 999 placebo samples. The final row (Panel E) of Table 2 includes

the implied p-values from this method in brackets. We still reject the null hypothesis of no effect at

conventional levels for heroin, synthetic opioid, all opioid, cocaine, and all overdoses.

5.6. Changes in Initiation Rates

        It may be surprising that the relationship between reformulation and overdose deaths has

continued to strengthen. One hypothesis was that reformulation may reduce initiation rates, leading

                                                   19
to longer-term benefits including decreases in overdose death rates. People prescribed OxyContin

could potentially be less likely to develop dependency issues when the drug is harder to abuse. We

do not see convincing evidence of a downturn in the relationship between exposure to

reformulation and overdoses, suggesting that the benefits – at least in terms of overdose deaths by

2017 -- of reduced initiation rates are small.

        As complementary evidence, we study heroin substance treatment admissions in the TEDS.

The event studies estimates are presented graphically in Figure 5. In Panel A, the outcome is all

heroin substance abuse treatment admissions per 100,000 (people ages 12+). The estimates

generally increase throughout the post-reformulation period (a joint test of the post-reformulation

estimates produces p-value=0.054), expressing a similar pattern as the heroin overdose death results.

In Panel B, we study heroin substance abuse treatment admissions without a prior treatment episode

per 100,000. These estimates also increase throughout most of the post-period (joint p-

value=0.003).

        Selecting on admissions for those without any prior treatment episodes is potentially

problematic given that having a prior treatment is endogenous to exposure to reformulation. We

find evidence that reformulation increased treatment admissions, suggesting that the population

eligible for categorization as not having any prior episodes is endogenously declining more in areas

more exposed to reformulation. This selection mechanism would bias the estimates downward, but

we find relative increases in these new substance treatment episodes, suggesting that dependence

initiation rates are not declining due to reformulation

        In Panels C and D, we repeat the above analysis but include all opioid treatment admissions,

which includes those who are in treatment for heroin, methadone, or any other prescription opioids.




                                                   20
As before, there is no evidence of a relative decline in admissions due to reformulation even among

those who had no prior treatment admissions (Panel D). 9

        These results suggest that we are not observing a decline in the incidence of dependence

which might predict future reductions in overdose rates associated with reformulation. This

conclusion is consistent with descriptive evidence from the NSDUH that shows that the share of

the household population suffering from opioid analgesic dependence, using DSM criteria, has not

been declining since reformulation (Mintz et al., 2019; Saloner and Karthikey, 2015).

        As noted in the Data section, there are concerns about data comparability in the TEDS.

Our assumption is that there are not shifts in reporting correlated with pre-reformulation

OxyContin misuse. We observe some evidence of a differential decline in the estimates between

2005 and 2006, but the general consistency of the pre-reformulation estimates suggests that there are

not systematic shifts in reporting affecting interpretation of the estimates.

5.7 Discussion

        What does the evidence in this paper tell us about reformulation’s long-term effects on illicit

drug markets? The relationship between overdose deaths and exposure to reformulation has only

grown over time. The duration of this increase through 2017 – and the fact that its growth does not

appear to be slowing – is suggestive that we are not simply observing those misusing OxyContin

prior to 2010 gradually but increasingly dying from overdoses up to 7 years later. Instead, we have

suggestive evidence of market growth and new consumers entering into illicit drug markets.

        Part of the strengthening relationship between reformulation and overdose death rates

appears to be explained by the delayed introduction of new and more deadly opioids into illicit

markets. We observe especially large overdose rate growth tied to reformulation beginning when



9We can reject that the post-reformulation estimates are jointly equal to zero in both Panel C (p=0.014) and
Panel D (p=0.002).

                                                     21
fentanyl began to permeate illicit drug markets. Similarly, we find strong evidence that synthetic

opioid death rates rose disproportionately in areas more exposed to reformulation.

        In addition, we observe spillovers into non-opioid drug markets potentially among people

with little prior medical or illicit opioid exposure. This result suggests that market expansion has

played a critical role. Finally, we find evidence of increases in heroin (and all opioid) dependence as

measured by treatment admissions, among those with no prior history of substance use treatment,

tied to reformulation. This relationship is also increasing through 2017, which is consistent with

new entrants into the market, though alternative explanations are also possible. The lack of

evidence of declines on this dimension strongly suggests that we will not observe declines in

overdose rates tied to reformulation in the near future.

        Overall, the evidence in this paper suggests that reformulation led markets to sell deadlier

substances and contaminate non-opioid drugs, expanding illicit opioid drug use. The evidence is

also consistent with an increasing flow of new consumers into these markets, though we are unable

to observe this relationship directly.

        To quantify the overall national effect of reformulation on overdose rates, we consider the

overdose trajectory for a hypothetical “country” unexposed to OxyContin reformulation. After

estimating the event study in Figure 4, we subtract off the exposure metric multiplied by the estimate

for each year. This eliminates the effect of exposure to reformulation (i.e., setting exposure to zero).

This counterfactual is an extrapolation with the usual caveats about the implicit assumptions

required for such out-of-sample extrapolations. We graph the national overdose rate compared to

this counterfactual in Figure 6. The lines intersect in 2010 since the event study estimates are

normalized to zero in this year. We do not use the event study estimates prior to reformulation to

plot a pre-reformulation “counterfactual” trend, though these points are close to the observed

overdose rates prior to 2010 (as should be clear from the estimates in Figure 4). After

                                                  22
reformulation, we see slow divergence at first. By 2013, this separation is modest, consistent with

the conclusions of Alpert et al. (2018). We estimate that reformulation increased the 2013 overdose

rate by 1.7 overdoses per 100,000 people, a 14% increase relative to the counterfactual.

        However, by 2017, our estimates imply that reformulation increased overdose rates by over

11.6 overdoses per 100,000 people, more than a 100% increase relative to our counterfactual.

Interestingly, Figure 6 suggests that the overdose rate would have gradually decreased in the absence

of reformulation (holding everything else constant 10). This counterfactual decrease may simply be

the result of extrapolating too far out of sample. However, the estimated decrease would be

consistent with policy-driven improvements and changes in prescribing patterns beginning to

reverse the course of the opioid crisis in the absence of growth in illicit opioid markets. These

policy-driven and culture-driven overdose reductions, which have been found in the literature for a

variety of implemented policies,11 could be masked by national trends driven by the transformation

of the opioid crisis.



     6. Conclusion

        Prior evidence identifies a short-term shift from prescription to illicit opioids in the years

immediately after the reformulation of OxyContin. Understanding this short-term effect helps

explain substitution patterns in overdoses between prescription and illicit opioids and provides core



10 For example, the rise in overdoses since 2010 may have induced policy adoption that independently
reduced overdoses. The above exercise assumes that these policies would have still been adopted.
11 For example, PDMPs have been widely-adopted and strengthened with evidence that these more robust

and modern PDMPs reduce misuse (Buchmueller and Carey, 2018; Kaestner and Ziedan, 2019) and overdose
rates (e.g., Pardo, 2017; Dowell et al., 2016; Patrick et al., 2016). Popovici et al. (2018) find evidence that both
pain management and doctor shopping laws reduce opioid-related overdoses. Substance use treatment access
has also been shown to decrease drug overdose rates (Swensen, 2015) while policies such as the Affordable
Care Act (ACA) Medicaid expansions have improved access to substance use disorder medications (Maclean
and Saloner, 2019) and opioid use disorder treatment availability (Meinhofer and Witman, 2018). The ACA
also improved treatment access through the dependent care provision (Saloner et al., 2018).

                                                        23
evidence about the initiating forces behind the second wave of the opioid crisis. However, by

expanding the time frame for our analysis, we identify large causal increases in overall overdoses, not

just substitution between different types of opioids.

        There are many reasons why switching people from legal to illicit markets may have harmful

consequences, even if fatal overdose rates themselves do not change (e.g., exposure to infectious

diseases). However, our analysis strongly suggests that the transition eventually increased overdose

rates to unprecedented levels as the large increase in demand within the black market associated with

reformulation generated a supply innovation (fentanyl) that impacted more than just the illicit opioid

market. As we evaluate the consequences of large supply-side opioid interventions, such as the

reformulation of OxyContin, such effects are first-order concerns.

        The potential benefits of reformulation include reductions in the propensity of beginning to

misuse opioids. However, there is little empirical evidence that such reductions are having a

meaningful impact on overdose rates. The relationship between exposure to reformulation and

overdose rates has strengthened over time. In addition, initial substance use treatment admissions

are also increasing faster in states more exposed to reformulation, suggesting that initiation rates are

still not declining in response.

        The shift to illicit opioids due to reformulation can be observed by a sudden and persistent

rise in heroin overdoses in states more exposed to reformulation. As the market evolved, we

observe a delayed but even more dramatic rise in synthetic opioid deaths in states more exposed to

reformulation. This link to reformulation suggests that the rise in illicit fentanyl was driven by

demand considerations existing years prior to the entry of fentanyl. Synthetic opioids

disproportionately affected states that had higher rates of OxyContin misuse, even conditional on

pain reliever misuse more generally.




                                                   24
        In addition, we find evidence of spillovers to non-opioid drug markets – specifically,

cocaine. We can attribute the rise in cocaine overdose rates to reformulation, suggesting possible

complementarities but more likely mixing in production given the large number of cocaine

overdoses involving fentanyl (Pardo et al., 2019). The increase in cocaine overdoses is not an

independent phenomenon but linked to the supply response to increased demand for opioids in

illicit drug markets.

        There is limited work on the ramifications of exogenous shocks to the size of illicit markets.

This study represents an important contribution showing the impact of a large exogenous shift in

demand on the black market caused by the reformulation of OxyContin. We find that the large shift

in demand for illicit opioids spurred by reformulation had large and enduring effects on illicit drug

markets more broadly.

Figure 2: Non-Medical OxyContin Misuse Event Study Estimates for Fatal Opioid
Overdoses
Notes: 95% confidence intervals adjusted for state-level clustering. Outcome is overdoses per 100,000 for the
specified category. The estimates reported in the figures are the coefficients on the pre-reformulation non-medical
OxyContin use rate interacted with year indicators. The 2010 interaction is excluded and the corresponding estimate
is normalized to 0. The specification includes state and time fixed effects. We also jointly estimate effects for pain
reliever misuse interacted with year indicators.

Figure 3: Non-Medical OxyContin Misuse Event Study Estimates for Cocaine and
Psychostimulant Fatal Overdoses
Notes: 95% confidence intervals adjusted for state-level clustering. Outcome is overdoses per 100,000 for the
specified category. The estimates reported in the figures are the coefficients on the pre-reformulation non-medical
OxyContin use rate interacted with year indicators. The 2010 interaction is excluded and the corresponding estimate
is normalized to 0. The specification includes state and time fixed effects. We also jointly estimate effects for pain
reliever misuse interacted with year indicators.

Treatment Admissions
Notes: N=949. 95% confidence intervals adjusted for state-level clustering. Outcome is substance abuse treatment
admissions per 100,000 for the specified category for ages 12+. Data are from the TEDS. The estimates reported in
the figures are the coefficients on the pre-reformulation non-medical OxyContin use rate interacted with year
indicators. The 2010 interaction is excluded and the corresponding estimate is normalized to 0. The specification
includes state and time fixed effects. We also jointly estimate effects for pain reliever misuse interacted with year
indicators. See main text for joint significance tests of post-reformulation estimates.

Figure 6: Actual and Counterfactual Overdose Rates in Absence of Reformulation
Notes: We plot the actual overdose rate over time. In addition, we estimate the event study shown in Figure 4 and
then calculate the overdose rate if OxyContin misuse were equal to zero to predict the overdose trajectory starting in
2010 in the absence of exposure to reformulation. We plot the population-weighted averages by year of the
counterfactual overdose rate. The lines intersect in 2010 since the event study estimates are normalized to zero in
this year. We could also plot the counterfactual rates prior to 2010 using the event study estimates -- they are close
to the observed rates (as should be clear from Figure 4).

Table 2: Relationship between OxyContin Misuse and 2017 Overdose Death Rates from
Parametric Model




Notes: * 10%, ** 5%, *** 1% statistical significance. N=510. Standard errors in parentheses are adjusted for
state-level clustering for Panels A-D. Outcomes are overdose deaths per 100,000. All regressions include
state and year fixed effects. Pre-reformulation OxyContin misuse rates (2004-2009) are interacted with a
linear trend and permitted to have a level and slope shift in 2011. We also control for non-medical pain
reliever use interacted in the same manner. The sample includes years 2006-2009, 2011-2017. We report the
implied estimated effect for 2017. Covariates in Panel B are defined as averages for 2004-2009 and include
log of population size, fraction white, fraction foreign-born, and fraction ages 25-44. The covariates are also
interacted in the same manner as the misuse variables are. Panel E replicates Panel A but reports p-values
from a permutation test. P-values are reported in brackets. We randomly, without replacement, assigned
misuse rate pairs (jointly) to different states and then estimated the t-statistic associated with the OxyContin
misuse rate. The t-statistic for the true sample was then compared to this distribution of 999 placebo t-
statistics.

Notes: 95% confidence intervals adjusted for state-level clustering. Outcome is overdoses per 100,000 for the
specified category. We exclude overdoses that also specify another substance. The estimates reported in the figures
are the coefficients on the pre-reformulation non-medical OxyContin use rate interacted with year indicators. The
2010 interaction is excluded and the corresponding estimate is normalized to 0. The estimated specification is
represented by equation (1). The specification includes state and time fixed effects. We also jointly estimate effects
for pain reliever misuse interacted with year indicators.
