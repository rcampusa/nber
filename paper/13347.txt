                                              ABSTRACT

Japanese atomic bomb survivors irradiated 8-25 weeks after ovulation subsequently suffered reduced
IQ [Otake and Schull, 1998]. Whether these findings generalize to low doses (less than 10 mGy) has
not been established. This paper exploits the natural experiment generated by the Chernobyl nuclear
accident in April 1986, which caused a spike in radiation levels in Sweden. In a comprehensive data
set of 562,637 Swedes born 1983-1988, we find that the cohort in utero during the Chernobyl accident
had worse school outcomes than adjacent birth cohorts, and this deterioration was largest for those
exposed approximately 8-25 weeks post conception. Moreover, we find larger damage among students
born in regions that received more fallout: students from the eight most affected municipalities were
3.6 percentage points less likely to qualify to high school as a result of the fallout. Our findings suggest
that fetal exposure to ionizing radiation damages cognitive ability at radiation levels previously considered
safe.

1     Introduction and Motivation

This paper studies the school performance of Swedish children in utero

during the Chernobyl (Ukraine) nuclear accident on April 26, 1986.

    Japanese A-bomb survivors irradiated in utero at post-ovulatory ages

8-25 weeks subsequently suffered reduced IQ: 25-30 points per Gy for

those exposed at post-ovulatory ages 8-15 weeks [Otake and Schull, 1998].

Whether these findings generalize to doses less than 10 mGy has not been

established [Hall and Giaccia, 2005, BEIR, 2006]. The existence of various

sources of very low-level ionizing radiation (e.g., radon) makes this a public

health question of general and continuing relevance.

    The ideal study of the effects of low dose radiation would assign doses

randomly, an approach that is not feasible for ethical and practical reasons,

the latter because for low doses, effects are presumably correspondingly

small and thus require a large sample size to be detected [Brenner et al.,

2003].

    The Chernobyl accident provides a nearly ideal natural experiment in

radiation exposure. Deposition occurred between April 27 and May 10 in

Sweden [Moberg, 1991], creating a pronounced spike in radiation levels.

For example, Figure 1 shows measured gamma radiation in Umeå, 400

miles north of Stockholm, which jumped more than ten-fold at the end of

April, 1986. Differences in rainfall immediately after the accident caused

substantial geographic variation in deposition [Holmberg et al., 1988]. The

northern parts of Sweden were virtually spared, while near the cities of

Gävle and Sundsvall, located on the Baltic sea about midway between

                                      3
the northern and southern most points of the country, ground deposi-

tion of Caesium-137 averaged 44 kBq/m2 (Table 1, also see Figure 2).1

This feature of the research design enables us to compare within cohorts,

and assess whether regional variation in fallout predicts the magnitude of

damage to the cohort between weeks 8 and 25 post-conception at the time

of Chernobyl, holding constant other regionally-varying determinants of

students outcomes, observed and unobserved (e.g., differences in parents’

cognitive skills by county).

       We evaluate student outcomes in a comprehensive data set on virtually

all Swedes born 1983-1988 – some 562,637 individuals – measuring perfor-

mance in the final year of compulsory schooling. These data also record

the month and place of birth, which we use to link student outcomes to

average Chernobyl deposition by region, measured aerially by the Swedish

Geological Co. in the accident’s aftermath.

       We find that the cohort of likely fetal age 8-25 weeks post conception

during the accident and born in one of the eight most affected municipali-

ties was 4% less likely to qualify to high school (or equivalently, were 40%

more likely to fail middle school). Grade point averages were 5% lower.

Moreover, students born in regions with more modest levels of Chernobyl

fallout also registered damage (of correspondingly smaller magnitudes)

relative to the least-exposed far north of Sweden. These results are ro-

bust to family fixed effects, mitigating selection concerns. Those born
   1
       Maximum doses for the Swedish population were estimated at 3-4 mSv in the first

year Holmberg et al. [1988], Edvarson [1991a]. For gamma radiation, 1 Gy corresponds

to 1 Sv.

February-May 1986, and thus outside the period brain development has

been deemed particularly radiosensitive, showed no corresponding dam-

age.

   To our knowledge, ours is the first large scale study of the effects of fetal

exposure to very low-level ionizing radiation – levels hitherto considered

safe and/or having undetectable effects – on school performance.



1.1    Literature review

A series of studies by Otake and Schull (summarized in Otake and Schull

[1998]) analyzed the effect of in utero exposure to radiation after the

Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bomb explosions in August, 1945. The

sample used in these studies contains information on 1,566 individuals

(1,242 in Hiroshima and 324 in Nagasaki) who (prenatally) were closer

than 2,000 meters from the hypocenter of the atomic bombs. Two control

groups from the same areas were matched on to the sample on the basis of

age and sex: one from distally exposed survivors (3,000-4,000 meters from

the hypocenter) and one of non-exposed survivors (> 10,000 meters). In

addition to some anthropometric measures – such as weight, height and

head size – these studies also analyzed cognitive ability (IQ) and school

records.

   The Otake and Schull studies contain several results of relevance for

our analysis. First, they established an effect on both IQ and school

records for children exposed between week 8 and 25 post-conception. For

children exposed earlier or later, no significant effect were found. Second,


                                      5
the effect was estimated to be linearly increasing in the level of exposure.

Third, no conclusive evidence on a threshold level for radiation effects was

established.


1.1.1   Chernobyl and Cognitive Outcomes

A number of previous studies have found reduced cognitive functions due

to prenatal radiation in high fallout areas of Ukraine, Belarus, and Rus-

sia, e.g., Nyahu et al. [1998], Kolominsky et al. [1999], Loganovskaja and

Loganovsky [1999]. However, these studies have focussed on populations

born near the reactor. As a consequence, they suffer from weaknesses re-

lated to the comparability of the treatment and control populations. Along

with other potential confounders, the physical dislocation (forced evacu-

ations) of the treated population limits the comparability of the treated

and control groups. Moreover, sample sizes have been relatively small.

   Nyahu et al. [1998] compared 544 children in Ukraine who lived near

the Chernobyl reactor and were in utero at the time of the accident to

Ukrainian children born in “radioactively clean zones”. Despite having

similar heights and weights at birth as the control group, prenatally ex-

posed children were more likely to be mentally retarded (IQ < 70) less

likely to have a high IQ (>110) and reported more emotional and be-

havioral problems. However, the fact that mothers of prenatally exposed

children also had lower IQ scores, as well as worse mental health, than the

control parents undermines the internal validity of the study’s conclusions.

As Kolominsky et al. [1999, p. 304] noted, “Living in contaminated areas,



                                     6
as well as forced resettlement, lead to the growth of emotional tension of

parents.”

   Other studies have found no or small effects. Litcher et al. [2000] found

no effect on school performance from Chernobyl fallout. They studied 300

Ukranian children evacuated from the 30-kilometer zone around Cher-

nobyl, comparing them with “same-sex non-evacuee child[ren] selected

from the same classrooms as each evacuee. Thus, they had the same

teachers and daily schedule, and resided in similar apartment buildings,”

Litcher et al. [2000, p. 292]. The exposed children were not significantly

different along objective measures including school performance, intelli-

gence, attention, or memory. However, the “treated sample” included

children up to age 15 months at the time of the meltdown.

   Joseph et al. [2004] studied cognitive and behavioral outcomes of 1,629

children from the former Soviet Union who had subsequently migrated to

Israel. The immigrants came from areas that ranged in fallout exposure

from ‘uncontaminated’ to ‘highly contaminated.’ They did not find evi-

dence of impaired cognitive ability. However, their sample included chil-

dren up to age 4 years at the time of the accident, meaning that only 270

children were in utero during the accident and only 98 of these were from

areas with Caesium-137 ground deposition in excess of 37 kBq m−2 . Hy-

peractivity and attention deficit disorder were higher among all children

in utero at the time (irrespective of area of origin or stage of gestation).

   Thus, weak or inconclusive results have prompted the conclusion that

Chernobyl damage, if any, reflects anxiety or stress brought on by the eco-


                                     7
nomic and social upheaval following the evacuation of the Chernobyl vicin-

ity and the fall of the Soviet Union [Joseph et al., 2004, UNDP/UNICEF,

2002, IAEA, 2006].


1.1.2       Chernobyl and Perinatal Outcomes

In contrast to the cognitive studies, perinatal impacts have been evaluated

in areas of Europe with substantially lower levels of Chernobyl fallout.

Outcomes including conceptions, spontaneous abortion, induced abortion,

stillbirth, gestation length, birth weight, and neonatal mortality have each

been studied. For each outcome, studies can be found on either side: some

find effects and others do not.

       Some of the strongest evidence points to compromised outcomes at

birth resulting from Chernobyl. Scherb et al. [1999] studied stillbirths in

18 European countries and found elevated stillbirths following Chernobyl

in the more eastern countries of Europe: Poland, Hungary, Sweden, and

Greece. Lüning et al. [1989] found increased mortality among infants

within the first 7 days of life in West Germany in May of 1986, which the

authors attributed to Chernobyl fallout in southern Germany.

       Increases in Down’s syndrome have been reported from a number of

countries, e.g., Belarus [Laziuk et al., 2002], Germany [Sperling et al.,

1994], and Sweden [Ericson and Källén, 1994], and has lately been ac-

knowledged by the WHO [2006, p. 87] as Chernobyl related. (Irrradiation

of the fetus itself cannot cause Down’s syndrome.2 Thus, cognitive per-
   2
       Ericson and Källén [1994, p. 153] “If radioactive fallout causes Down syndrome, it

must be in pregnancies where conceptions occurred after the accident – or just before


                                              8
formance of those irradiated weeks 8-25 post conception is not mediated

by Down’s syndrome.)

    A number of studies have documented adverse perinatal and child

health outcomes in Scandinavia. Ericson and Källén [1994] studied the

universe of Swedish perinatal outcomes for 1985-1989 and found a slight

decrease in conceptions in June 1986, and a statistically significant increase

in Down’s syndrome among those born in 1987 in all areas with more than

5 kBq m−2 Caesium-137 ground deposition. They also recorded three cases

of childhood leukemia.3 In addition, Auvinen et al. [2001] found elevated

levels of spontaneous abortions in Finland following Chernobyl.

2.1      Radiation Data

We use two measures of radiation exposure: aerial and in situ measure-

ments, further described below.
the accident if mosaic cases are considered (which arise by a nondisjunction in an early

mitotic division after conception).”
   3
     In addition, no effects were found on the likelihood of short gestation or birth

weight below 2,500 grams. The likelihood of birth weight below 1,500 grams was

higher in July of 1986 than July 1985, which “could well be random” Ericson and

Källén [1994]:149. No change in either low birth weight measure (below 2,500 grams

or below 1,500 grams) was found for the birth cohorts for whom we find the largest

cognitive effects, see Section 3.




                                           9
Aerial Measurement The Swedish Geological Co. (SGAB) (commis-

sioned by the Swedish Radiation Protection Authority) conducted aerial

measurements of ground deposition gamma-radiation of Caesium-134 over

the period May-October 1986 and decay corrected to May 1986.

       Caesium-134 was measured because of its stable relationship to Caesium-

137 (Cs-137/Cs-134=1.7) and its shorter half life (2 years), allowing for

the separation of radiation stemming from atmospheric nuclear weapons

tests and that from Chernobyl.

       These aerial measurements are available for 2,380 parishes (out of

2,517). A parish is a rather small geographical entity, and for most people,

everyday activities would involve crossing parish boundaries. Therefore we

also aggregate up to both the municipality and county level.4 The detailed

geographic coverage is a strength of these data.

       The aerial measurements, however, suffer from two drawbacks. First,

they lacked precision at low levels of ground radiation [Edvarson, 1991b].

Second, they only reflect deposition of Caesium isotopes. While its long

half life (30 years) makes Caesium-137 an obvious priority, our focus is on

the initial spike in radiation following the accident, for which Iodine-131

was an important contributor [Kjelle, 1991]. This motivates our interest

in the in situ measurements.
   4
       The county (län) is the first level administrative and political subdivision. There

are 21 counties. The second level is the municipality (kommun), and there are 290

municipalities.




                                             10
In Situ Measurement The Swedish Defence Research Agency (FOA)

conducted in situ measurements at 63 locations. Figure 3 replicates Ed-

varson [1991b]:table 2, which displays aerial measurements corrected by

in situ measurements since “It was found that the SGAB measurements

in the low-deposition areas (< 2 kBq/m2 Cs-134) were higher than FOA

in situ measurements by a factor of 2-3...” Edvarson [1991b, p. 49].

   Comparing Figures 3 and 4 it is clear that Iodine was an important

source of radiation in the initial aftermath of Chernobyl. Moreover, both

data sources show that the north of Sweden (Norrbotten county) had the

lowest levels of Caesium-137 ground deposition: 0.3 kBq m−2 .


2.1.1   Regional Groups

Based on the information from the aerial and the in situ measurements,

we classify Sweden into four groups as detailed in Table 1. Classification

at the measured extremes is straight-forward. The areas around Gävle

and Sundsvall were particularly hard hit, while Norrbotten county was

virtually spared. Consequently, we include in the top group Gävle and

Sundsvall and six contiguous municipalities. Together, these eight munic-

ipalities registered the highest levels of ground deposition of Caesium-137.

As for the control group, R0 (Norrbotten county) is motivated by Edvarson

[1991b, table 2], where Norrbotten shows the lowest values of Caesium-137

and Iodine-131 ground deposition.

   Norrbotten is, however, a relatively sparsely-populated county. There-

fore, we also present results from using a broader control group. Based



                                    11
on Moberg [1991, figure 2], replicated in Figure 4, we extend the control

group to also include the counties denoted by R1 (Table 1): Stockholm,

Örebro and Värmland.

   In sum, while data clearly single out our two extreme groups R0 and

R3, the division of the “middle” into R1 and R2 may be viewed as ex-

ploratory.


2.1.2   Radiation doses

While we believe the above measurements/regional grouping provide a

reasonable ordinal proxy for radiation exposure, there are several reasons

why the assignment is imperfect. First, we obviously do not know where

the expecting mother was at the time of Chernobyl, only where she was

registered at the time of giving birth. Second, we compare those in utero

at the time of Chernobyl to adjacent cohorts. Earlier cohorts were ex-

posed as infants and later cohorts were exposed to radiation stemming

from long lived radionuclides (prenatally and postnatally). Thus, any ef-

fect we detect that is unique to the cohort in utero must be due to the

spike in radiation in the days after the accident. Iodine-131, whose release

was 20-100 times that of Caesium, was an important contributor to this

initial spike [Moberg, 1991], and only proxied by the Caesium-137 esti-

mates. Third, ground depositions are more quickly washed away in urban

areas, therefore it is possible that urban areas received more fallout than

indicated by the values in the last two column of Table 1. Fourth, the ac-

tual dose a person received depends on a number of factors not captured



                                    12
here. Since these radionuclides enter the food chain, internal irradiation

may depend on the local food distribution system and dietary habits (e.g.,

consumption of milk).

       Despite these uncertainties, we are clearly evaluating effects of radia-

tion well below what has been deemed a health hazard and/or having a

measurable impact. Radiation levels in Sweden, using the UN classifica-

tion, ranged from negligible to ‘contaminated.’5 While small compared

to what the populations in Ukraine, Belarus and Russia suffered, a study

of very low-level exposure is of interest in its own right and for what

the results may imply for the risk assessment of other low-level radiation

sources, notably indoor radon radiation, and radiation in medical use.



2.2       Student Data

We focus on individuals born 1983-1988. That is, students born three

years before the accident through two years after.6

       We have register data on all persons either born in Sweden 1983-1985

or the children of a Swedish-born parent born in the period 1940-1985. As

a result, we have almost universal coverage for cohorts born 1983-1985.

For the 1986 birth cohort, we capture everybody who had at least one
   5
       Maximum Cs-137 over a square measuring 200 by 200 meters was 156.49 kBq

m−2 (< 5 Ci km−2 ).
  6
    The reason the later window is shorter is that our graduation data ends with the

class of 2004. School entry is in the fall of the calendar year the person turns seven, and

compulsory schooling ends with grade nine, normally in spring of the year the person

turns 16.



                                            13
Swedish born parent younger than 46 years (in 1986), and for 1987 and

1988 this age is 47 and 48 respectively. Since fertility is complete for nearly

all women by age 45, this means that coverage for the later cohorts is also

high.


2.2.1     Cohort groups

We focus on three cohorts as described below.


inutero Those born May 1986-February 1987 were arguably in utero at

        the time of the accident. This grouping allows for effects in very

        early pregnancy through late pregnancy. This broad categorization,

        however, obscures possible gestational-age differences in sensitivity

        to irradiation.


inutero8-25 As mentioned, the literature has identified weeks 8-25 post

        conception as particularly sensitive to radiation. This motivates

        singling out those born in the period August through December 1986

        as being of a critical age around the time of the accident. The birth

        interval was determined as follows: Assuming that the radioactive

        cloud swept Sweden April 27-May 10; and a 38 week post-conception

        gestation period, this implies that the “treated” group are those born

        between July 27 and December 13, 1986. Since we only have data

        on month of birth, we include those born August through December

        1986 in our inutero8-25 cohort.


inutero0-7 A third group of interest are those born in January and


                                      14
         February 1987. Many of this cohort were 0 to 8 weeks post con-

         ception at the time of Chernobyl. We are interested in their school

         performance since cognitive performance has not been found to be

         affected by irradiation in this period by previous studies.7 We will

         also investigate two other outcomes: cohort size and the sex ratio.

         Cohort size depends on a number of factors, notably conceptions,

         term pregnancies and perinatal outcomes. Pre-implantation is the

         stage most sensitive to the lethal effects of radiation, while irradia-

         tion during organogenesis is more likely to result in neonatal death

         [Hall and Giaccia, 2005, p. 169]. Also, the accident may have in-

         fluenced fertility decisions both with respect to conceptions and in-

         duced abortions. Our interest in the sex ratio is motivated by the

         observation that the male conceptus and fetus may be more suscep-

         tible to radiation, see Schull and Neel [1958], Peterka et al. [2004].


2.2.2       Outcome variables

Qualify HS To qualify to continue to high school, a passing grade is

         needed in all the core subjects (English, Swedish, and Math). About

         90% of students had passing grades in these subjects.


Grade points The sum of grades range from 0 to 320. These are the

         total grades summed over all subjects in the final year of compul-

         sory school. There are 16 subjects and four grade levels: fail - 0

Giaccia [2005, p. 169].

          points, pass - 10 points, pass with distinction - 15 points, and pass

          with special distinction - 20 points. The mean is approximately 200,

          and there was a slight positive trend. Grades in core subjects are

          “curved”, that is, reflect relative performance in nationally admin-

          istered tests. The vast majority of the inutero8-25 cohort belong

          to the class graduating in 2002, and this year sees no reduction in

          average grades.8



3         Results

We find damage to cognitive performance as measured by grades in the

final year of compulsory education and qualification to continue to high

school for those exposed in utero. Consistent with the bio-medical liter-

ature, we find the effects to be concentrated among those most likely to

have been exposed weeks 8-25 post conception. Moreover, the effect is

substantially larger in areas with greater Chernobyl fallout.



3.1         Figures

We begin our empirical analysis by presenting the share qualifying to high

school by birth cohort in a series of figures. Because there is substantial

seasonality in school performance by birth month, we compare those born

August-December 1986 against those born in the same months but in

adjacent years.

        The national averages were 202, 203 and 204 for the classes graduating in 2001,

2002 and 2003 respectively.

       Figure 5 compares those in the worst affected area, R3 (“Gävle and

Sundsvall”, the “treatment group”) to the rest of Sweden. The two series

track each other fairly closely until 1986, when the share qualifying from

R3 drops substantially to produce a 3 percentage point gap.9 A similar

pattern is revealed in Figure 7, where the control group is those born in

areas R0 and R1 (Norrbotten, Stockholm, Örebro and Värmland coun-

ties). Restricting the control group further to the least affected area, R0

(Norrbotten), shows a qualitatively similar picture, Figure 9. The gap

is now larger, at about 5 percentage points, and it is noteworthy that

the difference is in part driven by the control group doing better for this

particular birth year. We believe this may be related to grades in the

core subjects (and thus qualification to high school) being assigned based

on nationally standardized test (and a decrease in “raw” scores for most

students).

       Figures 6, 8, and 10 present the analogous series of figures but for those

born between February and May, i.e. cohorts for whom the biomedical

literature would not predict effects attributable to radiation. Clearly, the

poor performance of the 1986 cohort born in R3 does not extend to the

“spring” birth cohort, which reduces the likelihood that geographically-

varying effects unrelated to Chernobyl account for the pattern observed

for the cohorts exposed between weeks 8 and 25 of gestation.

       We now turn to the regression analysis.
   9
       The pre-treatment gap in qualification rates in Figure 5 is consistent with the

existence of effects on children born prior to Chernobyl and therefore exposed post-

natally. We will estimate the additional effect attributable to prenatal exposure.

3.2     Regression Analysis

We estimate three basic regression specifications for those born 1983-1988.

First, we estimate the departure in school performance for all Swedes in

utero during Chernobyl:


        yi = β0 × I(inutero*) + τyob + γmob + λcounty + δsex + ²i ,           (1)


where yi is the dependent variable of interest, I(inutero*) is an indi-

cator variable that takes the value 1 for the cohort of interest (inutero,

inutero8-25) and 0 otherwise; β0 is the parameter of interest. We include

vectors of dummies for year of birth (τyob ), month of birth (γmob ), county

of birth (λcounty ), and gender (δsex ).

   Second, we evaluate whether variation in Chernobyl fallout by area

within Sweden predicts the magnitude of the departure in outcomes for

the exposed cohort:
                          3
                          X
yi = β0 ×I(inutero∗)i +          βj ×rj ×I(inutero∗)i +τyob +γmob +λcounty +ρR3 +δsex +²i ,
                           j=1
                                                                              (2)

where yi is the dependent variable of interest, rj denotes the three areas

exposed to varying degrees by Chernobyl: R1, R2, and R3 (see Table

1). The inclusion of county-of-birth indicators clearly subsumes inclusion

of the measured level of Caesium deposition for each county (geographic

grouping) along with any other time-invariant county or area-level char-

acteristics. We also include a dummy variable for being born in one of the

eight high fallout municipalities, ρR3 . The parameter estimates of interest

are β̂j , j > 0 and we hypothesize that β̂3 ≤ β̂2 ≤ β̂1 < 0. These parame-

                                         18
ters measure the extent to which the outcomes for the inutero* children

born in the corresponding areas at the time of the accident differ from the

inutero* children born in the reference (omitted) area, controlling for all

permanent differences between areas.

   Our third empirical strategy is to apply the difference-in-differences

approach to a sample restricted to siblings (using the unique mother and

father identifiers) and compare those presumed exposed to Chernobyl ra-

diation to their siblings.

   We focus on the inutero8-25 cohort and estimate equation (2) where

we add a vector of indicator variables, one for each family (5,448 in total).

(We drop the indicator variable for gender, since we only look at same-

sex siblings. County effects are identified by families that report different

counties of birth for their children.) We restrict the sample to include only

those families with two same-sex full siblings whose fathers were married

as of 1990 (to reduce the likelihood that the parents had separated, an

event likely to have differential effects on siblings depending on age) where

one sibling belonged to the exposed cohort and the other one did not (but

was born between 1983 and 1988).

   Including these fixed effects is equivalent to differencing the outcomes

and regressors of the sibling presumed exposed to Chernobyl fallout from

his/her presumed unexposed sibling. Therefore, comparisons of the Cher-

nobyl effect are only made within (and not across) families. As before, if

school performance is affected by Chernobyl fallout, we would expect those

born between August-December 1986 to perform worse than their siblings,


                                     19
and this difference to be larger for those born in areas that received more

fallout.

   We estimate equations (1)-(2) for the following two outcomes: (1)

whether grades in core subjects (English, Swedish, Math) were sufficient

to qualify the individual to continue to high school; and (2) total grades

in the final grade of compulsory school.

   We employ Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), where standard errors are

robust to heteroscedasticity and clustered at the region level.


3.2.1      Regression Results

Table 3 presents estimates of the average departure in outcomes for

the cohort in utero during the Chernobyl accident, controlling for year,

month, and county of birth, and gender (equation (1)). Columns (1) and

(3) estimate a “naive” model where we assume that prenatal irradiation

affects cognitive development equally irrespective of fetal age. In addition,

we consider all Swedes in utero during Chernobyl, regardless of place of

birth, to be equally exposed. Finally, we consider those not in utero to

be unexposed. With these assumptions, we find that the probability of

qualifying is reduced by 0.2 percentage points for the inutero cohort

(Column (1)). For grades, we find a 1 unit reduction (Column (3)).

   In Columns (2) and (4), we make use of the finding that fetal irra-

diation 8 to 25 weeks post conception may be especially damaging to

cognitive development, and we find a larger reduction in performance for

this subgroup. For qualification, this group was 0.6 percentage points less



                                     20
likely to qualify for high school – three times the “naive” estimate. For

grades, we find a similar, albeit less dramatic, increase in effect size.10


Table 4 assesses whether the apparent damage to the exposed cohorts

in Table 3 varies with geographic variation in fallout. Columns (1)-(3)

consider the naive model of exposure – that all those born between May

1986 and February 1987 would be equally affected by a given level of

fallout (inutero). By contrast, columns (4) to (6) only consider the five

last months of birth in 1986 (inutero8-25).

       First, the R3 municipalities consistently show damage when compared

to other parts of Sweden. Column (1) compares the effect in R3 munic-

ipalities to the rest of Sweden (i.e., the excluded areas are R0, R1, and

R2). In Panel A, we see that the inutero cohort born in R3 municipalities

experienced a .018 drop in the probability of qualification (or roughly 10

times the effect for Sweden as a whole, Table 3). Column 2 now makes

comparisons relative to the two least-exposed areas: R0 and R1. We see

that the estimated damage to the inutero cohort born in the R3 munic-

ipalities increases slightly. In addition, the inutero cohort born in R2 is

estimated to have a slightly larger decrease in qualification rates but this

difference is not significantly different from zero. Column (3) repeats this

exercise by benchmarking against R0, the least affected area of Sweden.

We now find that the inutero cohort born in R3 suffered a .033 reduction
  10
       Virtually everybody born in 1986 was conceived prior to the Chernobyl accident,

and thus there was little scope for potential behavioral responses to Chernobyl with

respect to conception.



                                           21
in the probability of qualifying. Moreover, the R2 inutero cohort shows

about half the estimated R3 effect, with a slightly smaller effect for the

R1 area. Nevertheless, all three exposed areas showed significant damage

compared to R0 (Norrbotten).

   Panel B, columns (1) through (3), repeat the above exercise with grades

as the dependent variable. When comparing to the rest of Sweden, R3

natives of the inutero cohort are found to have lower grades: a drop of

2.2 grade units (column (1)). This estimate triples when we compare R3

to the R0 area (column (3)). Again, we find the estimated effect size to

correspond to the ordering of fallout.

   Columns (4) through (6) restrict attention to the inutero8-25 cohort.

The qualitative pattern is the same as above, but the estimated magni-

tudes are generally larger. Note that in column (6), we find that the

average decrease in qualification rates in R3 municipalities was .036 or 4%

relative to R0. In Panel B, the analogous estimate is 10.6 grade units or

5%.

   The magnitude of the results for grades can be interpreted as the av-

erage treatment effect for the three different fallout levels relative to the

inutero8-25 cohort born in the omitted area (Norrbotten). A change

in five grade points corresponds to the difference between pass and pass

with distinction in any of the 16 subjects counted in the final grade and

a change in 10 grade points corresponds to a one level change in two sub-

jects, or the difference between pass (10 points) and fail (0 points). To

give a sense for the importance of such changes in grades, Table 2 shows


                                     22
the percentiles between 40 and 60 in the distribution of grades for those

who graduated in 2003. A change in five grade points corresponds, for

example, to a change from percentile 46 to 50 or a change from percentile

53 to 56.11

       In sum, we are finding substantial across-the-board effects for the co-

hort likely to have been of post-ovulatory age 8-25 weeks at the time of

Chernobyl, and the effect is more severe in more exposed areas.


Table 5 reports results when the aerially measured ground deposition

of Caesium-137 is entered as a linear term in equation (2). That is, we
           P
replace the 3j=1 βj × rj × I(inutero8-25) term with β1 × Caesiumk ×

I(inutero8-25), where Caesiumk denotes the population-weighted arith-

metic mean of Caesium-137 in area k, and k indexes the county, munici-

pality, or parish, respectively.

       Consistent with the Table 4 results, we find that higher local radiation

predicts larger deteriorations for the August-December birth cohort. Col-

umn (1) assigns the average Caesium-137 level in the county of birth to the

inutero8-25 cohort, finding that a 1 kBq m−2 increase in Caesium-137

ground deposition reduces the probability of qualification by .053 per-

centage points. Column (2) and Column (3) assign the municipality-

and parish-level Caesium-137 measures to the exposed cohort, and find
  11
       As a comparison, in an evaluation of the STAR project, Krueger [1999] found a

gain of 4 percentile points for first year students in “small classes” (13-17 students)

compared to “regular classes” (22-25 students) on test scores and subsequently a 1

percentile point gain for each year in a small class.



                                           23
a smaller (though still significant) effect on qualification. Changes to the

administrative division means that we lose 12% and 14% of the sample in

columns (2) and (3), respectively.

   Columns (4) through (6) repeat the above specifications with grades

as the dependent variable. While the estimated β1 is negative for each

geographic unit k, only the parish-level Caesium-137 level is significantly

different from 0. Column (6) results imply a 0.058 unit reduction in grades

for each kBq m−2 unit increase in Caesium-137 deposition.


Table 6. Including fixed effects for each family, we find that those born

in the high-Caesium-137 deposition areas and exposed prenatally had

worse outcomes than their siblings. The inutero8-25 cohort in the R3

area had a 3 percentage point decrease in probability of qualifying rela-

tive to their (older or younger) sibling when the reference group was the

rest of Sweden, Column (1). When the R3 group was compared instead

to the least exposed R0 area, the estimated effect almost doubled to 5.6

percentage points. Again, the ordering of effect sizes corresponds to the

ordering of radiation fallout.

   We repeat this exercise for grades and find an analogous pattern The

reduction in grades for the sibling inutero8-25 during Chernobyl was

16.3 points greater in R3 than the same difference in R0.

   The existence of effects within families suggests that selection across

families into childbearing is not accounting for the effects found in previous

tables. In addition, note that the sibling comparison precludes comparison

with those born in the spring of 1986 (or spring of 1987), since one sibling

                                     24
need to be born in the fall of 1986. If indeed the 1986 birth cohort benefited

from a relaxation of national standards in benchmarking students, we are

no longer able to compare to the spring cohort due to the existence of

a minimum in birth spacing, which could bias estimated damage toward

zero.


Table 7 presents results when dividing the sibling sample according to

father’s education. Panel A presents results from the sample where the fa-

ther had two years of (vocational) high school or less; and Panel B presents

results for those whose fathers had three years of high school or more. The

education cut-off was chosen so as to create roughly similar sized samples.

From this division, it appears that the effect is more pronounced in the

group whose fathers had less education.


Table 8 shifts the focus to the cohort conceived in April and May 1986,

inutero0-7. The biomedical literature suggests that this cohort was too

young to suffer cognitive damage from the spike in radiation following

Chernobyl. Effects, if any, are believed to be terminal. Therefore, we ana-

lyze whether the cohort conceived around the time of Chernobyl is smaller

than predicted by seasonality and a linear cohort trend. As expected, we

find a fall in cohort size in these two months of 3.4% (276/8083). This can

be contrasted with Ericson and Källén [1994] who did not find reduced

conceptions or increased adverse pregnancy outcomes for April and May

1986.

   Furthermore, consistent with Schull and Neel [1958], Peterka et al.


                                     25
[2004], the inutero0-7 cohort is more female. This suggests that the

fall in fertility was partially the effect of spontaneous abortions (unless

Chernobyl induced abortions were performed disproportionately by those

who carried male fetuses – a not very likely scenario). Another possi-

bility is that fertility was negatively selected these two months [Trivers

and Willard, 1973]. However, since the estimated effect is rather large, a

1.6 % (0.008/0.488) increase in the probability of a daughter, we believe

such selection cannot account for this pattern. (For instance, in the U.S.,

unmarried mothers were found to be 0.2 % more likely to bear daughters

[Almond and Edlund, 2007].)

    While these patterns are consistent with the literature, several caveats

are in order. First, the geographic variation in Chernobyl fallout within

Sweden does not correspond to either the magnitude of the reduction in

cohort size or the tendency to be female. This stands in contrast to the

results presented in the preceding tables. Second, we would clearly prefer

to estimate effects on cohort size and gender using natality data, which

we plan to obtain, see Section 4. Finally, the academic outcomes among

those born in January and February are conflicting: a higher percentage

qualified to high school (Column 1), but grades were lower (Column 2).



4     Summary, Discussion and Future Work

We have studied the school performance in the final year of compulsory

school of the Swedish cohort born August through December 1986 – and

therefore of likely fetal age 8-25 weeks post conception at the time of the

                                     26
Chernobyl accident. For this cohort, we estimate that those in the eight

municipalities that received the highest levels of fallout were 4% less likely

to qualify to high school and had 5% lower grades. Moreover, effects are

evident in intermediately affected areas – at correspondingly lower levels.

   The fact that fallout varied distinctly in both time and space has al-

lowed us to make difference-in-difference comparisons, which yielded sup-

portive results. We also estimated effects using same-sex full siblings, one

of whom was born in the fall of 1986. This sibling comparison was then

compared across areas with differing levels of fallout. Had parental char-

acteristics of those born in the fall of 1986 deteriorated relative to those

born in adjacent years, and this “negative selection” into child bearing

was more pronounced in counties that received more fallout, we might

erroneously attribute lower performance to radiation exposure (in the ab-

sence of family fixed effects). This situation could arise if better educated

or wealthier families temporarily moved from high fallout areas to low

fallout areas immediately following the accident. As we find a similar pat-

tern with family fixed effects, we conclude that such parental differences

cannot explain out results.

   Assuming that the highest dose to the Swedish population was 4 mSv

[Edvarson, 1991b], extrapolation of the results of Otake and Schull [1998]

of a reduction of 30 IQ points per Gy (assuming a 1:1 conversion to Sv),

implies a hardly detectable effect (4×30/1000=0.12 points maximum).

However, while our found effect sizes are greater than reasonably pre-

dicted by a no-threshold linear model, the Otake and Schull studies did


                                     27
not conclude against the possibility of stronger results at very low doses,

and agnosticism regarding the effects of such low level ionizing radiation

characterizes the consensus view [ICRP, 2005, BEIR, 2006].

   The magnitude of our findings are, however, consistent with Oftedal’s

study of school performance and fallout from weapons tests [Oftedal, 1989,

1991]. He found that among Norwegian children born in 1965, those most

likely irradiated at post-ovulatory age 8-15 weeks (from U.S. atmospheric

nuclear tests) performed worse in grades 7 and 9 in tests of Norwegian,

English and Mathematics. The effect size corresponded to about one year’s

development in 15-year olds. Whereas the dose was not known, Oftedal

conjectured that it could be no more than a couple of multiples of normal

background radiation, but likely much lower.

   Other than the possibility of a stronger dose-response relationship at

very low doses [Oftedal, 1991], it can be noted that external radiation was

more important in the A-bomb cases, whereas internal irradiation (more

noxious, e.g. Busby and Fucic [2006]) is likely to have been more important

in the case of fallout from atmospheric nuclear tests and the Chernobyl

accident.

   Several factors suggest that we may have underestimated the effect.

First, our estimated effects are for the initial spike in radiation. Radionu-

clides lingered in the environment and accumulated in bodies, suggesting

that later cohorts (used as controls) may also have been affected. We only

estimate the additional damage resulting from exposure weeks 8-25 post-

conception to radiation in the immediate Chernobyl aftermath. Second,


                                     28
the areas R0 through R4 serve as ordinal proxies for individual doses. Us-

ing aggregates instead of individual doses does not necessarily introduce

a bias. However, if there is misclassification, e.g. a mother registered in

Gävle was in fact in Stockholm around the time of the accident, this could

introduce random misclassification that would bias results towards zero.

Third, note that the sibling comparison precludes comparison with those

born in the spring of 1986 (or spring of 1987), since one sibling was nec-

essarily born in the fall of 1986. If indeed the 1986 birth cohort benefited

from a relaxation of national standards in benchmarking students, we are

no longer able to compare to the spring cohort due to the existence of

a minimum in birth spacing, which could bias estimated damage toward

zero.

   Our findings contrast sharply with previous studies where weak or

inconclusive results have prompted the conclusion that damage, if any,

reflect anxiety or stress brought on by the economic and social upheaval

following the evacuation of the Chernobyl area and the fall of the Soviet

Union. According to the UNDP/UNICEF, in their report “The Human

Consequences of the Chernobyl Nuclear Accident,” only the top six mu-

nicipalities in Sweden would be considered ‘contaminated’ albeit not at a

level associated with any objective health risk: “Radiation does not pose

serious health risks to any particular group. Economic activities may

be hindered by indirect association with Chernobyl.” UNDP/UNICEF

[2002]:table 3.4. The International Atomic Energy Agency was equally dis-

missive of the possibility of radiation related damage: “the mental health


                                    29
impact of Chernobyl is the largest public health problem unleashed by the

accident to date.” IAEA [2006]:36.

   In conclusion, we have documented that the Swedish cohort of ges-

tational age 8-25 weeks post conception at the time of Chernobyl per-

formed worse in the final year of compulsory schooling compared to ad-

jacent cohorts and the effect was more pronounced in areas that received

more radioactive fallout. Future studies will investigate whether earlier

health manifestations (perinatal outcomes, in-patient records) presaged

our found effects; as well as track this cohort as it ages and additional

outcomes are realized.

The explanatory variables are mean radiation in kBq m−2 from Caesium-
137 (estimated from aerial measurements of Caesium-134 by the Geolog-
ical Survey of Sweden, on behalf of the Swedish Radiation Protection
Authority, over the period May-October 1986 and decay corrected to May
1986).
The averages are taken over the county, municipality and parish respec-
tively. Changes to county, municipality and parish delineations mean
that we can not match all observations to their respective municipality
or parish.
The county, municipality and parish means range from 1.6 to 32.3, 0.9 to
64, and 0.4 to 85.3 kBq m−2 respectively. Our smallest unit of observa-
tion is the parish, and the county and municipality means are population
weighted. Values are missing for Gotland and therefore all observations
from Gotland are excluded, reducing the sample by 4,026 observations.
All regressions include year of birth, month of birth, county of birth, R3
and gender indicator variables, and a constant.
Standard errors are clustered at the county level. Robust t-statistics in
brackets. * significant at 10%; ** significant at 5%; *** significant at 1%.

cohort, i.e., those born in the period August-December 1986, who had one
same-sex full sibling born in 1983-1988, and these siblings. The sample is
further restricted to those whose father was married in 1990.
R3 has 316 observations, of which 160 belonged to the inutero0-25 co-
hort.
The control groups are as in Table 4. Their number of observations are
7441 [3724], 2828 [1410] and 311 [154] in regressions 1 (4), 2 (5), and 3 (6)

The sample includes all singleton children belonging to the inutero8-25
cohort, i.e., those born in the period August-December 1986, who had one
same-sex full sibling born in 1983-1988, and these siblings. The sample is
further restricted to those whose father was married in 1990.
All regressions include an indicator variable for area R3, as well as year,
month, and county indicator variables, and a constant.
Standard errors are clustered at the county level. Robust t-statistics in
brackets. * significant at 10%; ** significant at 5%; *** significant at 1%.

The inutero0-7 indicator variable is one for January and February 1987.
All regressions include a linear year trend, month of birth indicator vari-
ables, and a constant.
Regressions 1,2 and 4 include county of birth indicator variables. Regres-
sions 1 and 2 include a gender indicator variable.
Standard errors are clustered at the county level in regressions 1,2 and
4, and at calendar month of birth in regression 3. Robust t-statistics in
brackets. * significant at 10%; ** significant at 5%; *** significant at 1%.
