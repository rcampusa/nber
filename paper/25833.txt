Can Blockchain Solve the Hold-up Problem in Contracts?

NBER Working Paper No. 25833
May 2019
JEL No. D82,D86,K12

                                         ABSTRACT

Two parties sign a contract but before they fully perform they modify the contract. Should courts
enforce the modified agreement? The modification may enable efficient trade in response to
changed circumstances, or one party may have made an efficient relationship-specific investment
and then been held-up by the other. Courts have had difficulty tackling this problem because the
facts required to discriminate between the two situations are non-verifiable. A private remedy is
for the parties to write a contract that is robust to hold-up or that makes the facts relevant to
modification verifiable. But implementing such remedies requires commitment to the provisions,
i.e., they themselves are subject to non-compliance. Conventional contract technology, e.g., the
use of liquidated damages, to ensure commitment are disfavored by courts and subject to
renegotiation. Smart contracts written on blockchain ledgers may offer a solution. We explain
the basic economics of these technologies. We argue that they can used to implement liquidated
damages without court involvement and thereby obtain commitment to renegotiation design and
revelation mechanisms. We address the hurdles courts may impose to use of smart contracts and
argue that sophisticated parties’ ex ante commitment to them may lead courts to allow their use as
pre-commitment devices.

I.      INTRODUCTION

A fundamental problem in contract law is how to handle contract modifications. 2 Two parties sign a
contract to trade some good or service. Before both sides have fully performed, the parties agree to
modify the contract. Should courts enforce the modified contract?

On the one hand, the parties may have encountered a change in the environment that made the original
terms suboptimal. For example, the cost of performance for the seller may have risen. Unless the price
is modified, the seller would prefer to breach. Perhaps the buyer offered more of her surplus from the
original contract to encourage the seller to perform in the modified contract. 3 In other words, the
modified contract is the output of Coasian renegotiation that yields an efficient trade.

On the other hand, the modification may be the result of a hold-up. 4 For example, the buyer made a
relationship-specific investment, i.e., an expenditure that is more valuable to the parties to the contract
than to non-parties to the contract. 5 In response, the seller threatens to breach unless the buyer agrees
to a higher price. The buyer agrees because the loss from redeploying the investment outside the
relationship is greater than the loss from paying a higher price to the seller. 6 The harm is that hold-up
discourages parties from making efficient relationship-specific investments that improve the gains from
trade. 7

Ideally, courts want to enforce modifications in the first scenario, but not the second. The central
challenge of contract modification is distinguishing between these situations. 8

One approach – which might be called a public solution – is for courts to look for evidence of changed
circumstances or for modifications made under duress or improper threats. 9 In the former case, they
enforce the modification, in the latter case they do not. The hurdle to implementing this solution is
what economists call nonverifiability: parties do not have the ability to prove to courts changed
circumstances or hold-up only when there in fact are changed circumstances or hold-up, respectively. 10

To illustrate, consider the classic case of Alaska Packers Association v. Domenico (1901). 11 Alaska
Packers Association (APA) hired some fishermen in San Francisco to fish for salmon in Alaska and deliver
the fish to Pyramid Harbor, Alaska, where the APA operated a cannery. The original contract paid each
fisherman $50 for the season plus two cents for each salmon caught. Once the APA had sailed the
fishermen to Alaska, however, the latter refused to fish unless their pay was increased to $100 for the
season plus two cents for each salmon. 12 Is this a case of changed circumstances or of hold-up?

The district court held for the fishermen. In its view, the APA agreed to the modification; if they were
under duress they would not have done so. 13 The Ninth Circuit help for the AP. In its view, there was no
consideration for the modification; so this was likely a case of duress. 14 One hint at the problem of
verifiability is that the two courts disagreed. Another is that Professor Threedy’s research has
demonstrated that the courts did not fully understand the facts of the case. 15 Worse, some of those
facts pointed towards changed circumstances 16 and others pointed towards hold-up. 17 In short, it is

16
   First, Alaska Packers may not have been in as much duress as the Appellate Court thought, as they had leverage
against the fisherman at the time of the renegotiation. For example, they could have denied them food at Pyramid
Harbor, see Threedy, supra note 15, at 217. Alaska Packers also had insurance against renegotiation. Alaska
Packers Association were part of an association of canneries that insured each other against losses at any specific
cannery, including the one at Pyramid Harbor. Moreover, the cannery at Pyramid Harbor was a small component
Alaska Packer’s total production and that cannery had other suppliers of fish – local Native American tribes. Id., at
200, 212, 215-216. Second, some facts that suggest that the fishermen’s costs were higher than they expected.
The fishermen were trained that nets were not to be reused season to season. Alaska Packers, however, had
bought a new type of net that allowed reuse. It is possible the fishermen reasonably thought the nets were
inadequate. Id., at 205-208.
17
   The fisherman seemed to have signed a low-price contract but only realized it when they arrived at Pyramid
Harbor and met other fisherman making double their wage. Threedy, supra note 15, at 205-208. In addition,
many of fact suggesting Alaska Packers may not have been in duress or that the fishermen’s costs had risen may
not actually establish that. For example, denying fishermen food may have sparked a riot and in any case have
been hard to implement. Moreover, it is unclear whether Alaska Packers thought that the threat imposed greater
losses on the fishermen than what they stood to gain with an increase in wages. Likewise, the fact that Alaska
Packers was diversified does not mean it was fully insured and indifferent to raising wages. Indeed, if Alaska
Packers was not under duress, why did it acquiesce to a change in wages at all? As for the nets, the fact that


                                                         4
likely that courts will often make mistakes about whether a modification is efficient and should be
enforceable. These mistakes will likely make contracts either too inflexible or discourage relationship-
specific investment, such as the APA’s decision to pay to transport fishermen to Alaska.

An alternative approach – which might be called a private solution – is for the parties to write better
contracts. One example is a contract that is completely state-contingent: it anticipates and prescribes
terms of trade under all possible changed circumstances. 18 The challenge with this approach is that it
complete contracts are costly to write and courts may not be able to enforce them because, again, the
changed circumstances are not verifiable to courts. 19

Another example of a better contract is one that includes contract provisions that either encourage
relationship-specific investment even in the presence of hold-up20 or incentivizes parties not to lie about
changed circumstances. 21 Economists call the former provisions a “renegotiation design mechanism”
and the latter provisions a “revelation mechanisms.” 22 The challenge with these mechanisms is that
they require that the parties be able to commit to the rules prescribed by those mechanisms. 23 If either
party refused to comply with those rules, the mechanisms would fail.

There are conventional contractual tools that parties could employ to provide commitment. For
example, parties can include liquidated damages clauses if either party fails to follow the rules set forth
under one or the other mechanism. Unfortunately, parties often have an incentive to renegotiate
liquidated damages clauses after they are triggered, so they are never enforced. 24 Other times, courts
do not enforce liquidated damages clauses that are in excess of the economic damages, so called
penalty clauses, even though it is exactly such clauses that best encourage compliance. 25



fishermen may not have known Alaska Packers’ nets could be reused does not actually mean that their costs had
risen and in a way that made the deal unprofitable for them. If Alaska Packers was right that their nets could be
reused, the fishermen’s haul should have been unaffected by the nets. Indeed, there is no evidence that the haul
that season was lower due to the nets. Indeed, the haul that season was “exceptionally large.” Id., at 209.
Professor Threedy suggests that Alaska Packers had an incentive to limit the haul because it had limited canning
capacity. Id., at 209. But that would be more easily done by hiring fewer fishermen, saving them fixed costs of
paying each fisherman a fixed amount to take the job and the marginal cost of transporting more fishermen to
Alaska than required, than be providing sub-par nets.

Recently there have emerged two new technologies, blockchain and smart contracts, that might make it
easier for parties to commit to renegotiation design and revelation mechanisms. One contribution of
our paper is to explain the economic and legal relevance of these two technologies.

Blockchain is a computer science innovation that enables the creation of a distributed, open and
unalterable ledgers. What that means is that a transaction on a computer network with blockchain
infrastructure, also called a blockchain network, is witnessed by others on the network (decentralized),
is made public to everyone on the network (open), and cannot be changed without a tremendous
amount of computing power or cost (unalterable).

Smart contracts are computer scripts that execute transactions, including transactions that constitute
mutual promises between contracting parties, now and in the future. When created on blockchain, the
future transactions envisioned in the smart contract are automatically executed and, because of the
inalterability of the blockchain, cannot practically be stopped.

Our central claim is that, by virtue of these features, smart contracts on blockchain are able to impose
liquidated damages that cannot be renegotiated, or enjoined or reversed by courts. As such they allow
parties to more credibly and robustly commit to contracts, including renegotiation design mechanisms
that protect investments against hold-up or revelation mechanisms that help courts verify changed
circumstances.

Smart contracts on blockchain are not guaranteed to work, but we think they are a significant
improvement over the status quo contracting technologies. The biggest obstacle to blockchain solutions
is the government. It is possible courts or Congress would ban smart contracts and/or blockchain. But
we believe blockchain has enough value, especially to the financial services sector, that collateral costs
will deter the government from banning our solution. The government could ban specific uses of smart
contracts and blockchain, e.g., stopping automation of future promises or certain contract penalty
provisions. But this is unlikely as both parties to a contract want these terms ex ante. It is only ex post
that one party does not prefer them. As with liquidated damages, we think the risk of court
intervention is limited to cases of bargaining-power imbalance. Finally, our solution cannot overcome
the so-called common knowledge problem that limits the power of renegotiation mechanisms to
prevent hold-up. To be sure, neither can existing contracting techniques. However, blockchain, by
making all transactions open, may be able to reduce the severity of the common knowledge problem to
some extent.

Section II provides examples of hold-up problems from case law and explains the economics of the hold-
up problem, demonstrates how renegotiation design and revelation mechanisms work, and discusses
the information hurdles to implementing these mechanisms to tackle the contact modification problem.
Section III explores how courts have attempted to tackle the problem of contact modification and pre-
blockchain private remedies that might be reduce the hold-up problem, as well the limits of both these
tactics. Section IV summarizes the general economic innovation from and legal relevance of blockchain
and smart contracts. Section V shows how smart contracts on blockchain can help reduce hold-up or
verify changed circumstances better than existing doctrinal or contractual approaches. The section also
examines some of the limitations of smart contracts on blockchain. The conclusion makes predictions
about the implications of our argument for the size of firms and output. It also speculates about the
benefits of smart contracts and blockchain for contract law more generally.

II.        THE HOLD-UP PROBLEM, ITS IMPACT AND MECHANISM DESIGN

The hold-up problem is what makes the enforceability of contract modification a difficult question for
courts. Without hold-up, modifications would simply reflect changed circumstances and efficient
renegotiation. Courts could simply enforce all modifications. With the possibility of hold-up,
modifications may be inefficient. As a result, it is critical that courts or the parties be able to rule out or
minimize the impact of modifications that are the result of hold-up. Given the centrality of hold-up to
the challenge of contract modification, this section elaborates on its prevalence, its impact and
contractual mechanisms designed to address it.

A. Examples of hold-up

Alaska Packers is a classic – though perhaps debated 26 – example of hold-up in the law. But it is not
alone. Here are a few notable examples from case law across the years:

•      Beckwith v. Frisbie, 32 Vt. 559 (1859): Frisbie, a canal boat owner agreed to transport oats for
       Beckwith, who wanted to sell the oats at market. Frisbie refused to release the oats until Beckwith
       agreed to pay a higher price for transport. Beckwith agreed because the price of oats was declining
       and further delay would have cost him lost profits.
•      Lingenfelder v. Wainwright Brewing Co., 103 Mo. 578, 15 S.W. 844 (1891): architect hired by
       Wainwright Brewing to build a brewery took away his plans when he found out Wainwright Brewing
       had hired a competitor for another project, a refrigerating plant, until Wainwright Brewing agreed
       to pay the architect a commission on the refrigerating plant as well.
•      Rexite Casting Co. v. Midwest Mower Corp., 267 S.W.2d 327 (Mo. Ct. App. 1954): Rexite Casting,
       agreed to supply castings for Midwest Mower, a manufacturer of law mowers. Mid-way through
       performance, Rexite demanded a higher price or else it would not supply any more castings.
       Because it would be unable to find an alternate supplier for months and it had a substantial number
       of orders for mowers due, Midwest Mower acquiesced.
•      Capps v. Georgia Pacific, 253 Or. 248, 453 P.2d 935 (1969): Georgia Pacific, a real estate purchaser
       refused to pay Capp, a real estate agent, the commission they had agreed to unless Capp lowered
       his fee. Capp agreed because he was in immediate need of funds to avert a mortgage foreclosure
       on his own home.
•      Austin Instrument, Inc. v. Loral Corp., 29 N.Y.2d 124, 324 N.Y.S.2d 22, 272 N.E.2d 533 (1971): Austin
       won a contract to supply radar sets to the Navy and contracted with Loral to supply components.
       Knowing that Austin had no alternative suppliers and risked losing future Navy contracts if it failed
       to deliver radar sets on time, Loral refused to deliver components unless Austin agreed to a higher
       price, which it did.
•      Kelsey-Hayes Company v. Galtaco Redlaw Casting Corp., 749 F. Supp. 794 (E.D. Mich. 1990): Kelsey
       Hayes, which supplies brake assemblies to auto manufacturers, signed a requirements contract with
       Galtaco in which the latter would supply all the castings that the former needed. Twice Galtaco
       asked for a 30% increase in price claiming its costs had risen. Having no alternative supplier, Kelsey-
       Hayes acquiesced.

Not all cases of hold-up make it to court. One famous example from recent years involved James
Gandolfini, a central character in the HBO series, The Sopranos. In the middle of production, Gandolfini
threatened to stop filming unless HBO agreed to renegotiate his wage from $400,000 per episode to
$800,000 per episode. 27 HBO agreed because of the losses it would sustain if production stopped.

There are other out-of-court examples that are less well publicized but common enough to make
casebooks. Professor Corbin, for example, provides a scenario familiar to anyone who has engaged
contractors in real estate or other industries:

          Doubtless, also, there have been tough cases in which the promisor has been
          subjected to a hold up game, so that he made his new promise under some degree
          of economic duress. It is certainly possible that a contractor may bid low in order to
          get the contract, and then refuse to perform, after it is too late to obtain another
          contractor without loss and inconvenience, in order to induce a promise of more
          pay. The strict enforcement of the supposed general [pre-existing duty] rule would
          tend to remove this temptation from bidders, since they would know that a promise
          so induced would not be legally enforceable. 28

Judge Posner has highlighted another version that does not involve underbidding so much as exploiting
a counterparty’ obligations to third parties:

          [T]here is often an interval in the life of a contract during which one party is at the
          mercy of the other. A may have ordered a machine from B that A wants to place in
          operation on a given date [and] may have made commitments to his customers that
          it would be costly to renege on. As the date of scheduled delivery approaches, B may
          be tempted to demand that A agree to renegotiate the contract price, knowing that
          A will incur heavy expenses if B fails to deliver on time. A can always refuse to
          renegotiate, relying instead on his right to sue B for breach of contract if B fails to
          make delivery by the agreed date. But legal remedies are always costly and
          uncertain. 29

A natural question in these cases is why the party being help capitulates rather than suing. As Judge
Posner has noted, hold-up can be successful in cases where legal remedies are inadequate. 30 This could
be because litigation is costly (and there is no English rule), remedies are uncertain, perhaps because
facts relevant to proving hold-up are non-verifiable, or because the law does not provide remedies for
certain types of hold-up, e.g., cases where one party makes efficient relationship-specific investments
after a contract is signed but not specified in that contract.

In order to illustrate the costs of the hold-up problem and, later, its possible theoretical solutions, we
use a recent example that should be familiar to readers, at least those familiar with smart phones. The
buyer in our example is Apple, an original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) of the iPhone smartphone
and the seller is Corning, an important component manufacturer which produces “Gorilla Glass”. Our
contention is not that Apple and Corning’s contract actually had a hold-up problem, but that it might
have and that we can therefore use it to illustrate some of the impacts of hold-up and solutions to hold-
up. The numbers we employ in this example were chosen not because they reflect reality, but because
they help demonstrate how hold-up can deter efficient investment. 31

Suppose Apple and Corning want to enter into a relationship wherein Corning provides 1 unit of a good
(“Gorilla Glass” or “glass”) at price 𝑝𝑝 per unit. 32 The value generated by trade depends on Apple’s
valuation for the glass, 𝑣𝑣 and Corning’s cost of producing the glass 𝑐𝑐.

The timing of the relationship is as follows. First, the parties contract. Second, they make their
investments non-cooperatively and simultaneously. Third, they both learn 𝑣𝑣 and 𝑐𝑐. Finally, the contract
is executed.

At the time of contracting, the precise values of 𝑣𝑣 and 𝑐𝑐 are not known since they depend on
investments made by Apple and Corning. We propose some numbers that have no special significance,
but can help the reader see how the hold-up problem operates. Suppose that 𝑣𝑣 can be either $40 or
$32 and correspondingly c can be $16 or $10. 33 Apple’s investment affects the probability that v is high
(or low) and Corning’s investment affects the probability that c is high (or low). These investments are
privately costly to Apple and Corning, costing each $5. One can think of Apple’s investment as marketing
of the iPhone thus increasing sales volume or as Apple making other features of the iPhone more
complementary with strong glass—say by having a smaller form-factor or reduced bezel or adding a face
recognition system that eliminates the need for a thumbprint ID-enabled home button and allows the
screen to take up the entire front of the smartphone. One can think of Corning’s investment as
improving the strength of glass, especially larger pieces of glass, or lowering the cost of production.

The parties do not write fully state-contingent contracts that specify 𝑝𝑝 and the probability of trade 𝑞𝑞34
for each combination of 𝑣𝑣 and 𝑐𝑐 and they only invest after they contract because, in reality, there are
unanticipated innovations, opportunities or challenges that arise after contracting but before delivery.
Real-world examples include Samsung’s surprise introduction of a glass screen that folds around the



31
   As Shavell has noted, this is not the only cost of hold-up, though the other costs are derivative of this one.
Potential victims, to avoid the costs of hold-up, may take great efforts to avoid hold-up, including using multiple
suppliers even though one is sufficient or lining up alternative suppliers before they are required. Id., at 330.
Conversely, potential perpetrators of hold-up, may engage in inefficient activities to engineer duress, for example,
using more expensive manufacturing or service methods than required so as to credibly claim higher costs. Id.; see

   Instead of dealing quantities traded, our example will deal with the probability of trade. However, our example
does not depend on the buyer only obtaining one unit of the good in question because we can define a unit a lot of
any arbitrary number of submits, e.g., crates of 1000 individual glass plates. In this context, purchase of 500 glass
plates can be described as a one-half probability of buying 1 crate of glass plates.
33
   The numbers in this example borrow heavily from a numerical example in Malani and Holden, supra note 22, at
164-169.

   See supra note 32.

edges of their Galaxy phone. 35 Corning felt pressure to match that. Another real-world example is
Apple’s surprise filing of a facial recognition system that increases the value of a larger glass plate front
from Corning. 36 Apple would not want to announce the patent earlier for fear that competitors or even
suppliers might file their related patents earlier.

With the numbers we have chosen in our example, the socially efficient thing to do is for both parties to
make the investments, since both have a marginal value above their marginal cost ($8 compared to $5
for Apple’s investment and $6 compared to $5 for Corning’s). If the investments are made then total
surplus is $40 − $10 − $5 − $5 = $20.

The essence of the hold-up problem, however, is that Apple and Corning will underinvest in the absence
of the ability to contract on the investments (or values/costs) if they cannot prevent renegotiation. To
see this, consider Corning, and suppose they make their privately costly investment. Once Apple’s value
for the glass and Corning’s cost of producing it is realized, the parties will renegotiate the price, since
contracting was incomplete at the start of the relationship. Assuming, for simplicity, that the parties
evenly split the incremental surplus generated (as would arise as a result of the Nash bargaining
solution) then the price will be adjusted so that Corning only gets half of the $6 that it increased total
surplus by, that is $3. Anticipating this at the investment stage Corning compares the $3 benefit with the
$5 cost and will not invest. Analogously, Apple will compare a $8/2=$4 benefit with a $5 cost and
likewise will not invest. This means that, in the presence of hold up, neither party will invest, Apple’s
valuation will be low and Corning’s cost high, and total surplus will be $32-$16=$16.

As our numerical example illustrates, hold-up reduces economic surplus. It is thus natural, therefore,
that economists have spent considerable effort 37 exploring how its impact can be mitigated, in
circumstances where it cannot be avoided due to limitations of the contracting environment.



C. Using renegotiation-design mechanisms to address hold-up

The difficulties with hold-up derive from subsequent the renegotiation of prices. Economists have
designed a number of contracting solutions – called “mechanisms” – to tackle the hold-up problem. The
logic behind these mechanisms stem from the observation that if this renegotiation could be structured
differently then perhaps the social optimum could be obtained despite hold-up. Chung (1991) and
Aghion, Dewatripont and Rey (1994) are leading examples of this approach. We illustrate how
renegotiation design mechanisms work using the mechanism in Aghion, Dewatripont and Rey (1994),
henceforth “ADR”. In Appendix I, we illustrate another important renegotiation mechanism based on
options contracts and attributable to Noldeke and Schmidt (1995).

   This is reflected in a number of Nobel Prizes related to this literate. After Ronald Coase won the prize for his
transaction cost theory of firm size, Oliver Williamson won it in 2009 in large part for his work on hold-up. Jean
Tirole won in 2014 for a range of contributions, one of which was his work on renegotiation design mechanisms.
Finally, Oliver Hart just won the prize in 2016 for explaining how asset ownership and residual rights of control can
promote efficient ex ante investment and thus provide a theory of vertical and lateral integration.


                                                         10
The ADR mechanism has two components. The first component is a default trade that can always be
requested by one party, even if it is held-up. This default option is structured to give that party (say the
seller) a full return to its investment for sure. This needs to be enforceable with a specific performance
remedy or a liquidated damages remedy that strongly incentivizes specific performance if the party with
the default option requests the default trade. The second component gives all the bargaining power in
renegotiation to the other party (say the buyer), by allowing that party to make a take-it-or-leave-it
offer. The timing of the renegotiation game is as follows: (1) the parties make investment decisions, (2)
the buyer makes a take-it-or-leave-it offer, and (3) the seller can accept the offer (in which case trade
takes place on those terms) or can trigger the default trade. This two-stage mechanism achieves the
socially optimal level of investment by both parties. To see why, note that the seller, despite having no
bargaining power at the take-it-or-leave-it stage, is the residual claimant on her investment due to her
access to the default option in the second stage of the game, and thus has appropriate incentives to
invest optimally. Inducting back to the take-it-or-leave-it-stage, the buyer, because it has all the
bargaining power, has the requisite incentives to invest optimally. 38

To see how this renegotiation game plays out in the Apple-Corning example, 39 there is a single unit of
glass to be traded, so it is convenient to think of setting the default probability that a widget will be
traded. The first component of the ADR mechanism is the default trade that Corning can trigger. We set
the default probability of trade at 5/6 and the default price at $23 1/3. We will not go through a
derivation of the numbers we have chosen here, 40 but they are constructed to do two things: split the
ex-ante surplus evenly between Apple and Corning, and ensure that Corning has the appropriate
incentives to make the cost-reducing investment. The second component of the ADR mechanism is to
give Apple the right to make a take-it-or-leave-it offer.

What is the best offer for Apple to make when they get the opportunity? Since Apple is making a take-it-
or-leave-it offer they have all the bargaining power and will thus want to trade the efficient amount of
glass, which here is one unit. Apple, possessing all the bargaining power, will extract Corning’s entire
surplus. This leaves Corning indifferent between the default option and accepting Apple’s offer. Corning
will thus anticipate getting the same payoff as under the default option, whatever happens.

Now work backwards, and consider Corning’s decision whether to invest at the earlier stage. If Corning
invests they get a payoff equal to $23 1/3 − (5/6) × $10 − $5 = $10 (the price minus probability of trade
multiplied by the cost of production, minus the investment cost). If Corning does not invest they get a
payoff equal to $23 1/3 − (5/6) × $16 = $10. So, Corning is willing to invest. 41



38
    See Aghion et al. , supra note , at 263-266.
39
    This description is based heavily on Holden and Malani, supra note 22, at 162-164.
40
    A general derivation is as follows. Suppose that the valuation, 𝑣𝑣, to the buyer is either 𝑣𝑣𝐿𝐿 or 𝑣𝑣𝐻𝐻 and the seller’s
cost of production is either 𝑐𝑐𝐿𝐿 or 𝑐𝑐𝐻𝐻 . Trade takes place at price 𝑝𝑝. The buyer can invest 𝑗𝑗 at cost 𝜙𝜙(𝑗𝑗) which makes
the probability of the high valuation equal to 𝑗𝑗. Similarly, the seller can invest amount 𝑖𝑖 at cost 𝜙𝜙(𝑖𝑖) which leads to
the probability of the low-cost state being i. The buyer’s payoff is thus 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣 − 𝑝𝑝 − 𝜙𝜙(𝑗𝑗), and the sellers is 𝑝𝑝 − 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 −
𝜙𝜙(i). Let the default option be a price quantity pair (𝑝𝑝�, 𝑞𝑞�). Set the default level of trade such that 𝑞𝑞�(𝑐𝑐𝐻𝐻 − 𝑐𝑐𝐿𝐿 ) =
𝜙𝜙 ′ (𝑖𝑖 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 ), where the superscript FB denotes the first-best level of investment. The default price is set to split the
surplus according the respective bargaining weights of the two parties.
41
    It is easy to break the indifference slightly in favor of investing without altering the analysis.


                                                              11
Now consider Apple, who is the residual claimant on their investment. They obtain $8 if they make the
investment, but bear a cost of just $5. So, Apple also makes the efficient investment. Thus, total surplus
is $40 − $10 − $5 − $5 = $20. Remarkably, this is the first best—the same as if Apple and Corning could
contract on all relevant contingencies.

It is, at first glance, rather surprising that Corning finds it optimal to invest despite having none of the
bargaining power in the renegotiation. The key is their ability to reject Apple’s offer and trigger trade
under the terms of the default option. The default option becomes more appealing when the glass is
low cost, which happens precisely when Corning invests. In other words, the presence of the default
option makes Corning’s payoff sensitive to their investment.



D. Mechanisms to address non-verifiability more generally

So far, we have examined the problem of hold-up when the parties make relationship-specific
investments, like Alaska Packer’s chartering of a ship to take plaintiff fishermen to Alaska, or in our
Apple and Corning example. However, there may be important ex-post inefficiencies that arise from the
inability to write complete, state-contingent contracts even in the absence of relationship-specific
investments.

The economics literature has only recently made progress in providing formal models of such ex-post
inefficiencies, typically through the use of ingredients from social psychology such as “reference
points”. 42 We will not delve into those formal models here. However, we do highlight solutions to these
ex-post inefficiencies that do not restructure renegotiation so much as get the parties to truthfully
report non-verifiable information to the court, making that information verifiable.

Beginning with Professor Maskin (1977), 43 a large literature has explored how carefully crafted
mechanisms that require players to make announcements, and face payoffs dependent on those
announcements, may be able to cause information observable to players but not to outsiders to become
observable and thus verifiable by outsiders. This is particularly useful in the hold-up setting because
once the parties know that the true state will be revealed then, then they can ex ante contract on 𝑣𝑣 or 𝑐𝑐,
even if they cannot contract on relationship specific investments per se. 44

An illustration of Professor Maskin’s theorem in the Apple-Corning setting is as follows. To make Apple’s
value 𝑣𝑣 – which both Apple and Corning know once it is realized – verifiable to a court, each party is
asked to simultaneously announce 40 or 32. The mechanism specifies that if both parties agree in their
announcement then that is the stipulated value of 𝑣𝑣. If the parties disagree then each pays a very large
fine to a third party.

It is straightforward to see that both Apple and Corning announcing truthfully is a Nash equilibrium.
Suppose 𝑣𝑣 is actually 40. Conditional on Apple announcing “40”, the Corning’s best response is to

ECONOMICS 1 (2008).

Equilibrium and Welfare Optimality, 66 THE REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES 23 (1999).
44
   For example, they can limit how much 𝑝𝑝 rises when 𝑣𝑣 is high or 𝑝𝑝 falls when 𝑐𝑐 is low so as to ensure each party
has adequate incentives to invest in raising 𝑣𝑣 or lowering 𝑐𝑐.


                                                          12
announce “40” as they avoid the large fine. Unfortunately, both parties not announcing truthfully is also
a Nash equilibrium. Suppose again that 𝑣𝑣 is actually 40. Conditional on Apple announcing “32” the best
response of Corning is to announce “32” to avoid the fine.

Troubled by this multiplicity of equilibrium, Moore and Repullo (1988) show that by using a multi-stage
mechanism, set forth in Appendix II, it is possible to implement any social objective as the unique
(subgame-perfect) equilibrium of the game induced by that mechanism. 45



E. Information problems that hamper mechanisms

Rarely, if ever, are the renegotiation design or the revelation mechanisms described above seen in
practice. 46 This begs the question: why not? One reason may be that these mechanisms seem too
complex to implement as they require two or three stages of structured bargaining. Holden and Malani
show that these hurdles cannot be too large because, while uncommon, procedures like the ADR
mechanism can be found in, e.g., variable quantity contracts. 47 Moreover, even the multi-stage
procedures in Moore-Repullo mechanisms are less complicated than some arbitration procedures to
which contractual parties agree, let alone actual trials and the civil procedure rules that govern contracts
in the absence of arbitration provisions.

     1. Uncertainty

Another explanation for why the aforementioned mechanisms are uncommon is the substantial
information requirements of these mechanisms. One piece of information required is that the parties
need to know the cost and payoffs to each type of investment to employ these mechanisms. For
example, both parties must know the cost of the Corning’s investment ($5) and the amount that it will
reduce costs 𝑐𝑐 (from $16 to $10) in order to set the default option (trade of 5/16 a unit for $23 1/3).
Often these numbers are uncertain. In that case, the parties cannot precisely structure the mechanism,
which in turn means that the mechanism may not always deter hold-up.

If this sort of uncertainty looms large, the parties can only avoid renegotiation by foregoing
renegotiation of their original contract altogether. We will discuss how this might be achieved without
and with blockchain in Sections III and V, respectively. The downside of this approach is that parties lack
the flexibility to renegotiate where there is no hold-up but there are changed circumstances such that
both parties would benefit from a different bargain than the original contract.

     2. Information asymmetry

A different sort of problem arises if there is information asymmetry between the parties. Professors
Aghion, Fudenberg, Holden, Kunimoto and Tercieux (2012) argue, theoretically, that complex
mechanisms are not robust to small perturbations from common knowledge. 48 We will not go into the
intricate details of their logic here, but their claim hinges on the observation that the above mechanisms

                                                      13
implicitly assume not just that the state of nature is observable to the contracting parties, but that it is
also common knowledge among the contracting parties. In other words, the mechanisms assume that
Apple and Corning not only observe 𝑣𝑣 and 𝑐𝑐, but agree on what 𝑣𝑣 and 𝑐𝑐 are. 49

Aghion et al. then show that these mechanisms are not robust to an arbitrarily small perturbation away
from common knowledge, i.e., to Apple and Corning honestly disagreeing even slightly about the value
of 𝑣𝑣 or 𝑐𝑐. In this context, two-stage renegotiation-design mechanisms like ADR may yield optimal trade
and thus investment, but they may also yield equilibria with suboptimal trade and investment. In other
words, investment is not the unique equilibrium of those mechanisms. 50

Things get worse with more complicated, three-stage mechanisms such as that of Moore and Repullo. 51
With those, arbitrarily small deviations from common knowledge causes not just the emergence of non-
truth telling as an equilibrium, it causes truth-telling to no longer be an equilibrium. In other words, the
parties cannot even contract on 𝑣𝑣 and 𝑐𝑐 because they will never be truthfully revealed. 52

Experimental evidence from Aghion, Fehr, Holden and Wilkening (2017) supports this theoretical finding
with respect to revelation mechanisms in particular, but also offers some hope. They show that
revelation mechanisms underperform due to asymmetric information, but that the degree of
underperformance is proportional to degree of asymmetric information. 53 In other words, the less the
information asymmetry, the better the performance of revelation mechanisms, even though they do not
achieve perfect truthfulness and thus maximal investment incentives.



III.     POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS TO THE HOLD-UP PROBLEM

There are a number of ways that parties and courts can, in practice, address the problem of hold-up,
though each approach has its shortcomings. We will first discuss what role courts can play, in order to
review doctrinal responses to the risk of hold-up during contract modifications. Nearly all either fail to
allow efficient modifications or permit hold-up, or require knowledge of facts that may not be verifiable
to a court. We will then discuss private solutions that can be employed without smart contracts on the
blockchain and their limitations.



A. Public solutions



49
   It may seem strange that both Apple and Corning can observe 𝑣𝑣 and 𝑐𝑐 bot not see the same thing. The reason
that both may get some information on 𝑣𝑣 and 𝑐𝑐 that is unbiased, but not precise. I.e., they see 𝑣𝑣 and 𝑐𝑐 plus some
random noise. In that context, the two parties get equal quality information on 𝑣𝑣 and 𝑐𝑐, but not agree on 𝑣𝑣 or 𝑐𝑐.
50
   Aghion et al. , supra note 48, at 1870, 1875.
51
   Aghion et al. , supra note 48, at 1863.
52
   The reason for the more dismal result with three stage mechanisms is that the party that plays in the second
stage not only has no incentive to tell the truth, but has an incentive to lie, because the other party gets to play
again after her. With two stage mechanisms, player 2 does not have to worry about what player 1 will do after she
moves.

Implementation—An Empirical Investigation, J. OF EUR. ECON. ASSOC. 1, 27 (2017).

Historically, courts took a dim view of modifications. They applied the pre-existing duty rule, which
stated that doing what a party had already promised to do is insufficient consideration for a new
promise. 54 This is formally the rule that the Ninth Circuit applied to invalidate the modification in Alaska
Packer’s Association v. Domenico, 55 though as we’ll see it has nonetheless come to be interpreted as
standing for a different rule. 56

The problem with the pre-existing duty rule is that it made it difficult to implement contract
modifications were efficient responses to changed circumstances. 57 It was also easily gamed with small
amounts of consideration that largely preserved the rents earned by exploitative contracting parties. 58
As a result the rule has largely been abandoned. 59

In its stead, courts have largely followed three different rules. The first and most widespread in in
common law is the duress doctrine, under which courts may rule a modification unenforceable if they
determine it was secured under duress. Duress is typically defined as induced by an “improper threat,”
including a threat of breach, 60 especially if the threat leaves the victim with “no reasonable
alternatives.” 61 The definition of duress has expanded over time and has been criticized for being
ambiguous. 62

The second rule is good faith. The comment to Uniform Commercial Code § 2-209, which governs
modification to contracts for the sale of goods only, explains that "modifications … must meet the test
of good faith.” However, this requirement largely overlaps with the duress test, the comment explains
that “the extortion of a ‘modification’ without legitimate commercial reason is ineffective as a violation
of the duty of good faith.”

The third rule is the “changed circumstances” rule. Under this rule, courts look for unanticipated
changes in commercial conditions that would make the original contract unappealing for the parties. 63 If
found, the court would enforce a modification. In contrast with the duress doctrine, in which courts


54
   See, e.g., Rose v. Daniels, 8 R.I. 381 (1866) (holding that a modification to a loan agreement which discharged the
debt for a sum lower than the amount due was unenforceable because it was not supported by consideration).
See also 1A CORBIN, supra note 6, § 171, at 105 ("[N]either the performance of duty nor the promise to render
performance already required by duty is sufficient consideration for a return promise.").

56
   It has been argued that the justification for the pre-existing duty or no-consideration rule is really duress. See,

look for evidence (duress) that a modification is bad, with the changed circumstances rule, courts look
for evidence that a modification is good.

The Restatement (Second) of Contracts effectively endorses all three rules at once. While the
background rule is that contracts (or contract modifications) lacking consideration are unenforceable, 64
the Restatement carves an exception: modifications unsupported by consideration are still enforceable
if they are “fair and equitable in view of circumstances not anticipated by the parties when the contract
was made.” 65 However, a modification is not enforceable if it is induced by an “improper threat”, which
includes a threat to breach in violation of the duty of good faith. 66

Scholars have proposed alternative rules, though these have not gained traction in case law. For
example, Professor Shavell has advocated a rule that allows modifications, so long as the change in price
is reasonable. 67 Professors Bar Gill and Ben Shahar have proposed a rule that would allow modifications
even if induced by threats so long as those threats are credible. 68 Professor Jolls has gone so far as to
suggest that courts allow the parties to contract to disallow any future modifications to a contract. 69

The different rules enforced by courts, as well as alternative rules proposed by scholars, all suffer from a
basic problem: non-verifiability. For example, the duress doctrine depends on demonstrating improper
threat and the lack of alternatives. Likewise, Professors Bar Gill and Ben Shahar’s proposal requires
distinguishing between credible and non-credible threats. The changed circumstances rule requires
proof of unanticipated alteration in economic conditions surrounding the contract. There may be
disagreements about whether there was an improper or credible threat or an increase in costs, as
exemplified by Professor Threedy’s exegsis of the facts behind Alaska Packers Ass’n v. Domenico. 70

What makes matters more complicated is that the existence of, say, changed circumstances, is not
sufficient evidence that a modification should be enforced, from an economic perspective. What the
court should do, as Professor Shavell explains, is compare the increase in costs due to changed
circumstances with the increase in price. If the increase in price is greater than the increase in costs,
then there may be hold-up even in the presence of changed circumstances. Yet, these careful economic
calculations are not the comparative advantage of courts. 71

Guggenheim Exploration Co., 122 N.E. 378, 387 (N.Y. 1919); Davis v. Payne & Day, Inc., 348 P.2d 337, 339 (Utah
1960). A problem with this solution is that it is extreme: it rules out efficient modifications in response to changed
circumstances. This could be optimal if there were no way to distinguish such efficient modifications from
inefficient modifications due to hold-up. We are not ready to do that as the mechanisms described in Sections II.C
and II.D, if they could be implemented, would allow private parties to do better than pre-committing to no
modification ever.

   The lack of comparative advantage in making economic judgments is why, in corporate law for example, courts
apply a business judgment rule that asks whether directors have followed a careful process before taking


                                                          16
Even if ex post courts can overcome these disagreements about facts and reach a decision, ex ante there
will be uncertainty amongst the parties about what rule the courts will apply or what facts the court will
find. This uncertainty implies that a positive probability that remedies will be inadequate. 72 That in turn
creates opportunities for hold-up.

Some rules, such as the pre-existing duty rule and Professor Joll’s rule to enforce no-modifications
clauses, are easy for courts to enforce and entail little uncertainty. Yet these are also extreme solutions.
Each rules out any efficient modifications in response to changed circumstances.



B. Private solutions

Given the inherently limited ability of courts to tackle the problem of hold-up, at least without going
overboard and stopping even efficient modifications, we turn to private, contractual solutions that
parties may pursue – with less reliance on nuanced judgment by courts – to address the risk or
consequences of hold-up.

Ideally, the parties would write a contract that precisely specified what investments each party would
make in each state of the world and at what price and quantity they would trade given the result of
those investments. Economists call this a complete state-contingent contract that specifies the parties’
payoffs in all states of the world. In this context, courts would have no reason to allow renegotiation --
correctly or mistakenly – because the original contract would account for all possible changed
circumstances. That, in turn, would deter hold-up.

Yet such contracts are nearly impossible to write. Parties may not know all possible states or it may not
be cost effective to specify them all ex ante. Moreover, courts often cannot verify what state the parties
are in and thus enforce the appropriate contractual provision. 73 Indeed, this is the reason that the
starting assumption of the economic literature on the hold-up problem is that parties cannot and do not
write, or courts cannot enforce, complete contracts. 74

One alternative solution is for the two contracting parties to merge and conduct the transaction
internally within a single firm. This option is why Professor Coase and later Professor Hart predicted
that hold-up could provide incentives for the parties to move their transaction from the market,
mediated by contract between firms, to organizing the transaction within a single, integrated firm.

While Apple and Corning integrating 75 would address the glass plate supply problem, both parties also
deal with other suppliers and purchasers. Corning cannot both integrate with Apple and with, say,

important corporate decisions rather than examining the economic merits of the corporate decision itself. Frank
H. Easterbrook, Comparative Advantage and Antitrust Law, 75 CAL. L. REV. 983, 894 (1987).
72
   Because courts do not adjust damages upwards to reflect the probability that they would come to a different (or
wrong) conclusion about liability, it is necessarily the case that expected damages are inadequate. See, e.g., A.
Mitchell Polinsky and Steven Shavell, Punitive Damages: An Economic Analysis, 111 HARV. L. REV. 869, 887 (1998).
73
   See supra text accompanying note 12.
74
   See Oliver Hart & John Moore, Property Rights and the Nature of the Firm, 98 J. POL. ECON. 1119, 1126 (1990);
Aghion and Holden, supra note 158, at 182.
75
   We use the term integrating rather than merging here because the term merger may mean something to the
contract theory literature than it means in the legal literature. Scholars in the contract theory literature
sometimes worry that merger implies takeover of one firm by another, which is not a necessary condition to


                                                       17
Motorola, another smartphone OEM. As a result, integrating with Apple would mean having a less
efficient relationship with Motorola, due to hold-up. Nor would Apple want to own every single one of
its thousands of suppliers, even though their deals may also entail hold-up risks. Managing all those
relationships internally within a firm simply replaces hold-up problems with internal agency problems.

A second alternative for the parties is to rely on repeat play and reputation. If Apple and Corning
transact each year for each new iteration of Apple’s smartphone, they each have a strong incentive not
to hold the other up, lest they jeopardize future deals between them. 76 That said, if the power to hold
up is asymmetric, it would affect the aggregate division of gains from trade across all the parties’
contracts in favor of the party with more hold-up power. This in turn could reduce the incentive of the
weaker party to participate even in repeat play transactions. More importantly, many parties do not
transact repeatedly – or expect that their repeated transactions will one day end. 77 In that context
parties must rely on market reputation. 78 The challenge is that, if courts cannot verify hold-up, other
companies may might not be able to either.

A third alternative is for the parties to employ one of the renegotiation design or revelation mechanisms
discussed in Section II. For instance, they could specify default trades that favor on party and give the
other party the right to make a take-it-or-leave-it offer as the ADR mechanisms suggests, 79 or they could
specify alternating price announcements and challenges alongside payments to third parties as the
Moore-Repullo mechanism proposes. 80

The weakness of these mechanisms is that they each require a strong form of commitment, which is a
significant barrier to their usefulness. If the weaker party can refuse the take-it-or-leave-it offer and the
stronger party would still trade (which it is mutually rational to do), then the ultimatum is not credible
and it will not give the stronger party adequate return on its investment. Likewise, if the parties agree
to split the penalty payment to the third party rather than hand it over to that party (again which is
mutually rational to do), then the parties do not have an incentive to truthfully announce their
valuations prior to the penalty round. Yet it is unlikely that the parties can credibly commitment to
actions required for renegotiation design or revelation mechanisms if they cannot make such
commitments to the original contract to deter hold-up in the first place.


obtain the results of operating under the roof of one firm. The legal literature does not treat merger as the same
as acquisition, as indicated by their use of the term “mergers and acquisition” rather than simply “mergers” to
describe corporate law rules pertaining to the transformation of two firms into one. The implication for the legal
audience is that we could substitute the term merger for integration in the main text if our only audience were
legal scholars.
76
   See Klein et al. , supra note 4, at 302 (explaining the value of long term contracts).
77
   With finite period games, the parties have an incentive to hold-up in the last stage. Given they have that
incentive in the last stage, they will also have it in the penultimate stage, which now looks like the final stage. This
process repeats until the value of repeat play evaporates. Robert Gibbons, GAME THEORY FOR APPLIED
ECONOMISTS 82 (1992).
78
   In our usage, reputation differs from repeat play because it can rely on shirking – in this case by holding-up –
being revealed to other parties that contract with the shirking party, reducing the latter’s gains from trade with
other parties. This distinction between repeat play (sometimes called trust) and reputation is somewhat different
than the usual distinction between these concepts in the economics literature. The latter distinction relates repeat
play to hidden action and reputation to hidden type.

One way to obtain this commitment, ostensibly without smart contracts and blockchain, is to include
penalty clauses – liquidated damages larger than economic damages – if the parties do not comply with
the mechanisms. 81 For example, the stronger party may have to pay a penalty if it makes a second offer
after its take-it-or-leave-it offer is rejected by the weaker party but before the weaker party requests
the default trade in the ADR mechanism. 82 Indeed, penalty clauses could go further and possibly dis-
incentivize hold-up in the first place by penalizing deviations from the original contract terms, if the
parties are comfortable with foregoing any flexibility to depart from the original contract.

The problem with this approach is that courts frown upon penalty clauses, though they may be more
permissive in cases where both parties are sophisticated businesses rather than cases involving small
businesses or individual consumers. 83 If courts won’t enforce the penalty clause, it will not incent
parties to commit to their roles in the mechanisms or to their original contract terms.

Even if courts would enforce the penalty clause, it can skew the incentives of the two parties. Such
clauses act like reliance damages, which are known to risk overinvestment by the protected parties. 84
The solution to overinvestment is to pay the penalties to a third party rather than the party making an
investment. 85 Yet both contractual parties have a mutual incentive to negotiate around that third-party
payment, as they did in the revelation mechanism. 86

The only way to obtain commitment without skewing investment incentives then is to have an
automatic payment to a third party that cannot be undone by the contractual parties. For example, the
parties could set up something akin to a poison pill where the contract or mechanism creates an IOU
from the penalized party to a third party. 87 Of course, if there is a gap between the timing of the
investment and the payment for that investment, the holding-up party could still petition a court to
enjoin the poison pill-type penalty before it is triggered by failure to make payment for the investment.
The held-up party is unlikely to invest much to stop the holding up party because it does not benefit
from the payment to a third party.

To avoid both circumvention of the penalty by the parties (directly) and by courts (after being petitioned
by the parties) is to have the penalty be something that even the court cannot enjoin. An outlandish but
effective solution is to create a machine, have the party that needs to show commitment place a large
amount of cash in the machine, then have the machine rigged to burn the cash if that party fails to meet
its commitment. The machine must have a dead hand switch so that it is triggered if anyone – even the
court via injunction – tries to shut it down.

REGULATION OF CONTRACTS (2000).
82
   In some cases, the penalty clause may have to be paid to a third party, otherwise it might directly undermine the
incentives the mechanism set up for the parties. For example, if the penalty for negotiating around the third party
payment in the revelation mechanism is a penalty paid by one of the parties to another, they would simply account
for it in their negotiations over the first payment.

This machine must be all-knowing about the parties’ accounts, otherwise the parties could get around
even this machine. Specifically, they could renegotiate but transact in two parts: one that appears to
the machine to conform to the original contract and a second that undoes the original contract and
consummates the renegotiated contract. If the machine only observed the first transaction, it would
release the cash it was holding hostage even though the second transaction consummated the
renegotiated contract. Again, investment incentives would be undermined.

But this machine we have described is hard to build and actually looks very much like a smart contract
on blockchain. Moreover, the latter are simple and cheaper to implement. The smart contract is just a
computer script not an awkward physical machine; it can work with digital money, which is easier to
obtain than actual cash; and can be made all knowing with APIs to all the parties accounts. 88 Moreover,
blockchain allows irreversible transfers to anonymous accounts.



IV.      BACKGROUND ON BLOCKCHAIN AND SMART CONTRACTS

We believe blockchain technology, used together with smart contracts, can overcome some of hurdles
to credible commitment in contracts with current contracting technology. In this section, we describe
the main value added from blockchain and smart contracts and then explain how these technologies
might better enable the sort of contractual commitment required either to stop all renegotiation or to
enable the use of renegotiation design or revelation mechanisms, the two strategies for eliminating
hold-up.



A. The value of blockchain

Blockchain, a computer science innovation introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, is described as a
distributed or decentralized, open and secure ledger, meaning it that verifies transactions are intended,
feasible and executed through a decentralized system rather than through a central authority (like a
government or bank, which might be costly or untrustworthy), records transactions in a public way (so
as to build reputations and counterparty trust), and ensures transaction are not reversible (to protect
parties from certain types of theft). 89 Although Nakamoto initially intended the term transaction to
mean a monetary transfer, a transaction recorded in the blockchain can be any set of promises, i.e., a
contract, or indeed any statement. 90

      1. The core function of blockchain is witnessing statements (without relying on any one witness)

A simple analogy clarifies the core function of Blockchain. Blockchain – which refers both to the method
by which a record of statements is made and to the recorded statements themselves – is akin to a
witness. Suppose A and B agree that A will rent an apartment to B for $600 per month. We can
decompose that agreement into a statement by A that A will give B access to the apartment and by B

that B will pay A a given amount per month. To commemorate their transaction, they can each write
down these statements on paper and sign those statements. The written statements can serve as proof
to third parties that A and B made the statements written down. An alternative is to find a witness. If
that witness is a neutral third party, then she can testify credibly to outsiders that the statements that A
and B make. Either way, outsiders would be able to more confidently rely on statements from B that
she has an apartment she wants to rent out, or from A that he has $600 to spend. 91

A witness’s value – relative to paper statements – is not that they are uniquely credible, but that they
incrementally improve the credibility of statements and in some cases more cost-effectively enhance
such credibility. Certainly, a paper document plus a witness is more credible than just a paper
document. Witnesses may also have two advantages over paper documents. In some cases, the
witness may be cheaper, because paper documents may require the assistance of costly lawyers to
write. The witness also may be more credible, because a paper contract can sometimes be forged. This is
not always true: a witness may lie if they are biased in favor of or bribed by one of the parties. But the
witness may be better than paper documents in some cases.

Blockchain is simply a new technology to witness transactions. The old-fashioned approach is to have
another human, ideally unrelated (or equally related) to the two or more parties to a transaction,
observe the transaction. In some cases, it was a central, privileged party, such as the government, e.g.,
when a judge witnesses a wedding, or a bank, which might validate a check from B to A. In other cases it
was simply an authorized third party, e.g., a public notary. In yet other cases, the witnessing is
recognized ex post, as required, as when a court admits as probative evidence such as a document that
was signed by both parties. Blockchain’s approach to witnessing is different: it uses cryptographic
algorithms mediated by a computer network.

At its base, blockchain sets up a network. Two of the more popular such networks are Bitcoin and
Ethereum. 92 If A and B want to transact, they each announce their transaction to the network.
Blockchain sets up a method by which computers on the network, called “nodes,” can hear the
messages from A and B. The nodes then produce evidence that they heard that message, i.e., they
validate it. 93

Technically speaking, the evidence that validates a transaction on a blockchain network is the output
from a so-called “hash function”, a type of one-way function in mathematics. 94 A hash function is an



91
   One notable outsider is a court: if there is a dispute over the agreement and the parties go to court, the witness
can help the court resolve issues of fact.

   Id. A one-way function is a function where if you know the inputs, you can produce the outputs, but if you only
have the outputs, you cannot know for sure the inputs. Andreas M. Antonopolous, MASTERING BITCOIN:
PROGRAMMING THE OPEN BLOCKCHAIN 2ND EDITION 56 (2017). An example is 2 + 3 = 5. The inputs are 2 and 3
and the function is addition. The output is 5. If you know 2 and 3, you know the output of addition is 5. But if you
know only 5, you cannot know whether the inputs are 2 and 3 or any of the following pairs: (0,5), (5,0), (1,4), (4,1),
(3,2).

algorithm wherein, upon hearing what A and B say, the node – call her W as it serves as a witness –
transforms the message into a “hash”. (The action of transforming the message is called ‘hashing’). The
key feature of the hash is that people who observe it know that W must have witnessed A and B saying
they were going give access to an apartment and pay $600/month, respectively. How do they know
that? Because hash functions have the property that there is no way for W to produce its hash unless its
heard A and B say they were going to give access to an apartment and pay $600/month, respectively. In
other words, one of the inputs to the hash function is the announced transaction and the output is a
hash that validates that the transaction was indeed announced. 95

Once the network produces evidence of a transaction, i.e., the hash, it is added to a list of previously
witnessed transactions. The whole list is called the blockchain, so sometimes people say they “add the
hash to the blockchain”. 96 Because the blockchain is a list of transactions, it is also called a ledger. 97

    2. Blockchain is an open ledger to take advantage of the economies of scale from witnessing

Blockchain is often described as a public, distributed ledger. The distributed portion refers to the
method of witnessing, which we just described. But the open ledger portion of this refers to the fact
that the blockchain is publicly available. 98 The reason it is open is that there are economies of scale
from witnessing.

By economies of scale in witnessing, we mean that the value of witnessing two transactions is worth
more than witnessing just one transaction. To see why that is, consider our rental transaction: A gives B
rights to an apartment and B gives A $600 per month. Suppose C wants to sublease the apartment. If C
is able to observe that A gave B rights to the apartment, C is more confident that B has rights to the
apartment C wants. Of course, the fact that potential counterparties benefit from observing A and B’s
exchange just means that witnessing A and B’s exchange is valuable. To show economies we must show
that D, who wants to use the apartment C has for a weekend in an Airbnb-type transaction, benefits not
only from seeing B’s transfer to C, but also A’s transfer to B. That is certainly the case: seeing A give B
the apartment gives D confidence that B had an apartment to give to C. In other words, being able to
observe multiple transactions increases a party’s confidence that their counterparty actually has the
asset that is to be transferred to the party. There are economies because once A and B’s transaction is

           Addition is not the best one-way function for blockchain, as it is also desirable to have a situation where
only when A and B present 2 and 3 can they prove that were the ones that spoke. With addition, A and B could
come forward and say they said 1 and 4, and it too would be validated since the sum is 5. So, the one-way
functions are both a one-way and unique mapping from inputs to outputs. A better example than addition is
prime factorization, which is actually used in cryptography. If I give you a number X and ask you the fewest
number of primes that, when multiplied together, yield X, you have a problem that rises quickly in complexity as X
increases. If I tell you a series of primes, you can easy calculate its product X; but if I just give you X, it is very
difficult to calculate its prime factorization.
           A form of one-way functions used often with blockchain are trap-door functions. These are one-way
functions such that, if you have some secret information (i.e., know the “trap-door”) you can compute the inputs
form the outputs.

observed and publicly validated on the blockchain, it can be used both by C and, without additional cost,
by D. 99

A necessary condition for witnessing to have economies of scale is that the validation be made public
and that ownership be traceable across transactions. To reduce transactions costs, the public validation
should be maintained in a database where public validation of other related transactions is maintained.
So, the feature of blockchain that achieves these economies of scale is that it is publicly searchable. 100

Earlier we said that the core function of blockchain is witnessing rather than public reporting. We said
that in part because blockchain without witnessing is just an open database, like the title registry that
tracks land ownership. It is witnessing that gives entries into the database value. In the last section, we
noted blockchain is an open database.

     3. Security and the inalterability of blockchain

A feature that distinguishes a blockchain public database of transactions from other public databases of
transactions is that there are so-called consensus rules. With a traditional database, a central authority
is charged with making sure the database is not retroactively modified to reallocate ownership of items.
If the centralized authority is untrustworthy, e.g., if it is also a participant in transactions recorded on
the database or it might accept side payments from participants to modify the database, then the
database’s credibility is compromised. 101 With a blockchain database, there need not be any central
administrator of the database. Anyone can contribute an entry. But what stops anyone from also
modifying old transactions (perhaps to benefit themselves or harm competitors)? Each blockchain
network has a consensus rule that determines when a database can be updated and therefore also
retroactively modified. 102

The most common consensus rule is proof-of-work validation, in which nodes compete to be the first to
hash an announced transaction and the winner is the first to add the transaction to the blockchain. 103
This method requires a node to deploy CPU time (i.e., electricity and a CPU) to perform hash functions
and thereby validate transactions. To change a past transaction, a node has to employ enough CPU time
to modify an old transaction and revalidate all other transactions, including new transactions that are
occurring in the interim. This requires a lot more CPU time; indeed, Nakamoto showed that it requires
that no one node controls a majority of all CPU power on the blockchain network. 104

Although proof-of-work makes retroactive modification of the blockchain hard, it also makes validation
of new transactions hard. By hard we mean it consumes a lot of electricity. 105 An important alternative
method being explored is proof-of-stake. Under proof-of-stake, transactions are validated by betting
that they are correct. Nodes put up money that the transaction they state occurred actually occurred. If

99
   Of course, there is a marginal cost to D of processing the information about A and D. We ignore this as that cost
is the same regardless of how the information about A and B are generated.

others put up more money that the transaction did not occur, then the node betting on the transaction
loses the money that the transaction occurred. 106 Other alternatives include other methods of voting
for which transaction actually occurred, with the alternatives being differentiated by the weight that
each node’s vote has. 107 With alternatives to proof-of-work, the manner in which transactions are
validated should be chosen so as to balance the goal of reducing the cost of incentives to validate
truthful transactions and of increasing the cost of incentives to retroactively modify past recorded
transactions. 108

      4. Anonymity and privacy on the blockchain

Another feature that makes blockchain attractive to some 109 is that blockchain can preserve anonymity
or promote privacy. This is done in either of two ways. One is by disassociating accounts with personal
identities on the blockchain database. For example, people may just have public identification numbers,
also called public keys, and those keys are not associated with names, addresses or other identification
numbers easily connected to names or addresses. 110 It should be noted, however, that various
governments have imposed know-your-customer (KYC) rules on exchanges that facilitate transactions on
blockchains and these can make it harder to maintain anonymity on the blockchain. 111 A second way to
ensure privacy is to create and maintain a private blockchain that is only accessible to a small number of
participants or that can only be searched by a centralized intermediary, who can validate whether
counterparties have certain assets or not. 112

Both methods of limiting public knowledge of transactions, unsurprisingly, limit the economies of scale
from blockchain. As a result, blockchain networks must balance the returns to scale with the value of
privacy when choosing how they will be constructed.

So-called smart contracts, as first conceived by Nick Szabo, 113 are a quite general concept: a smart
contract is a simply series of actions written in computer script. 114 When the actions constitute
fulfillment of mutual, conditional promises, they are a contract in the traditional sense. 115 Smart
contracts can fully or partially specify a contract, meaning they can include all promises made pursuant
to a contract or they can contain part of the promises, in which case the code plus a paper agreement
constitute the whole contract. 116

Smart contracts can exist independent of a blockchain network, but they can also be announced,
witnessed and automatically executed on such a network. Indeed, the reason Vitalik Buterin created the
Ethereum network was that the Bitcoin network did not support smart contracts. Ethereum is a
blockchain network but with a scripting language that allows smart contracts. Individuals write their
smart contracts in that script and the Ethereum network validates and executes it. 117

      1. Benefits that smart contracts do not offer

What makes smart contracts special is not that they are automated. One can already automate
transactions. Take the case where A rents and apartment to B for $600/month. With a smart contract,
simply by signing the contract B would automate the process of paying A because her account on the
blockchain network would be deducted $600 per month. But B could have done that before smart
contracts. For example, she could have signed a paper rental agreement and then set up a standing
order at her bank to send A an e-check for $600 each month. 118

Of course, there are fewer steps with a smart contract, which could reduce transactions costs with
contract execution. Writing and digitally signing a smart contract script could, in theory, eliminate the
need to take extra steps to automate the process. 119

But this benefit is offset by the fact that automation via smart contract requires the smart contract to be
on a network that controls enough of A and B’s assets to be able to be completely self-executing on that
network. For example, if B writes her smart contract on the Ethereum network but does not have her

    Indeed, smart contracts can be used to create not only real-world contracts but also real world corporations.
One of the original smart contracts on the Ethereum network was the decentralized autonomous organization
(DAO). A DAO is a set of smart contracts that specify the governance, assets and liabilities of a group of people or
nodes on a network. Ian Allison, Ethereum reinvents companies with launch of The DAO, Apr. 30, 2016, available

wealth in an Ethereum network account, then she would have to transfer money to an Ethereum
account to empower Ethereum to direct it according to the contract. If all B did was to allow an
Ethereum network to check her regular bank account, the smart contract could not execute her
contract.

Nor do smart contracts obviously reduce transactions costs during contract drafting. Traditional
contracts require the parties and/or a lawyer to draft a contract. But smart contracts require the parties
and/or a hired programmer to script those contracts. Services like Legal Zoom can help with form
contracts, but form contracts can be used to economize with traditional paper contracts as well as script
contracts. 120

So, what are the benefits of smart contracts over ordinary contracts?

      2. Smart contracts reduce uncertainty about promises (counterparty risk)

A smart contract, by virtue of being a plan for the future and being automated, gives counterparties
confidence that promises will be fulfilled. Take our rental example. Even if B sets up an automatic
payment for $600/month to A with her bank, there is a risk that the payment will not be made. To see
why, suppose B only has $600 in her account on September 29 and rent is due October 1. If B decides to
have dinner out on the 29th that costs $25, her bank will not be able to transfer $600 on the 1st. She will
be $25 short. By contrast, a smart contract can be written so that her account encumbers the $600
even before the 1st due so that B cannot spend $25 on dinner on the 29th if she only has $600 in her
account that day. 121

An inexact analogy to the smart contract counterparty is a secured creditor. A secured creditor knows
that, even if the debtor cannot pay her debts even after litigation or bankruptcy, the creditor can seize
their collateral, e.g., a home that secures a mortgage. By contrast an unsecured creditor whose debtor
cannot pay even after litigation or bankruptcy may get nothing. A smart contract payee can be sure that
her counterparty will not otherwise spend or encumber the money that she expects to be paid under
the smart contract. By contrast an ordinary contract payee faces the risk that her counterparty will not
have the money to pay her, leaving her with the same recourse as the unsecured creditor. Of course,
the ordinary contract payee can try to obtain a security interest, but that just means that smart
contracts and security interests are substitutes, underlining our point that the two are roughly
analogous.

When combined with an open database of transactions, such as that maintained by a blockchain
network, smart contracts can disproportionately reduce counterparty risk in the economy. To illustrate,
let us complicate the rental example by allowing that B must earn income each month to pay rent.
Specifically, on the 1st of the month B’s account, which had $600 falls to $0, but B expects to get a bi-
weekly paycheck of $1000 (net of taxes). To address the risk that B’s bi-weekly paycheck may not arrive,
e.g., because she is demoted or she takes unpaid leave, the smart contact could include an algorithm
that predicts income and, on that basis, encumbers the account to protect rent payments. When
income is more uncertain, the encumbrance should be larger to ensure a given level of confidence, say

120

121
   Stark, supra note 116. It is easy to complicate this example to account for interest. With interest at a rate of r
per day, the smart contract would simply require B to have 600/(1 + 𝑟𝑟)2 < 600 rather than 600 in her account on
Sept 29.


                                                         26
95%, that rent payments would be made on time. Indeed, the rental contract price itself could – and
from A’s perspective should – be a function of how predictable B’s income is. This means that, if B’s
employer also signed a smart contract, her income would also become more secure and she would have
to pay A less for rent! In this manner, the more that smart contracts spread the less uncertainty
counterparty risk there is and the less insurance – in the form of higher prices – needs to be purchased
against that risk. The money freed up by lower insurance payments could be spent on investment,
which should increase growth.

      3. Smart contracts reduce uncertainty about interpretation (legal risk)

A second source of risk that smart contracts can address is interpretation risk. When two parties write a
traditional contract, there may be ambiguities in meaning. Those ambiguities are subsequently resolved
by a court or equivalent adjudicator. But from an ex ante perspective, that resolution is still risky. 122

We can illustrate with a simple example. Suppose that A and B write a paper contract on Monday that
says

           A will supply B a widget on Friday. B will pay $100 upon delivery of the widget. If A
           does not perform, A owes B $150.

Suppose further that on Tuesday a hurricane strikes, destroying A’s factory and inventory, so that he
cannot perform on the smart contract. If B sues A in state court for liquidated damages, a court could
decide in at least two ways. First, the court could say the contract has an implied force majeure clause,
perhaps because that is what the parties would have agreed to if they had considered the possibility of a
hurricane white writing their contract, and so A did not breach and owes B nothing. Second, the court
could say the four corners of the contract includes no force majeure clause, so A did breach and owes B
$150.

When writing the contract, each party formed an expectation about what a court would do, and
accounted for that expectation in the price upon which they agreed. If one of the parties was risk
averse, the price might have to reflect insurance provided to that party to insure it against the risk from
court interpretation (not just the risk of a hurricane). If the parties disagreed on what would happen,
they might not agree on a price. If, e.g., A’s expectation about the cost of supplying a widget was
greater than the B’s expectation about the probability of getting the widget times the value of the
widget to be, there would be no range for bargaining. In short, if the parties were risk averse or if the
parties disagreed about what a court would do, it would be more likely that the parties would not come
to an agreement.

A smart contract can reduce the interpretation risk. Because a computer interprets a script like a strictly
textualist court would, i.e., it looks only at the four corners of the contract, the outcome may be more
predictable than when a court’s interpretive methodology is uncertain. In fact, it is possible to do even
better than a strictly textualist court because it is possible to cheaply and quickly simulate and thus

predict how a computer would execute a smart contract script under a wide array of parameter values
for contract inputs. 123

Anyone who has written code might object that code is very finicky, but this is a negligible cost. For
example, a misplaced semi-colon might cause the smart contract to not execute at all. But one can test
the contract in a sandbox 124 and see if it executes even before it is actually executed in a live
environment.

A potentially stronger objection is that the parties might not intend what the four corners of the smart
contract says, but even this is not compelling. The parties can write a different script. Alternatively,
default rule code can be written that fills gaps in smart contracts and the parties can reference that
default rule code when scripting their contract. In other words, they can’t pick the interpretive
methodology, but they can pick their default rules.

The magnitude of the benefit from reducing interpretive risk, like the magnitude of the benefit of
reducing counterparty risk is uncertain. While the former may be smaller than the latter, it could still be
significant. The former may be what drives contractual parties to agree to assign jurisdiction or arbitrate
decisions or to move transactions within a firm. 125 Most consumer contracts have arbitration clauses
and half of all trade occurs within firms. 126 Reduced interpretive and counterparty risks are not the only
reason why the parties may use arbitration clauses or prefer intrafirm transactions, but they are
significant risks. Indeed, counterparty risk is what spawned the creation of blockchain in the first
place. 127



V.      HOW SMART CONTRACTS ON BLOCKCHAIN CAN HELP REDUCE CONTRACTUAL HOLD-UP

Our central claim is that smart contracts on blockchain networks allows parties to more credibly commit
to original contracts (in case they want to prevent any renegotiation) or to mechanisms to structure
renegotiation or make information verifiable to courts (in case they want specifically to stop hold-up).
Here we explain how practically to do that. The implementation we suggest requires some assumptions
and we will clarify those as well.

A. An example with the ADR renegotiation design mechanism

Suppose that Apple and Corning wish to write a contract that includes an ADR mechanism to structure
renegotiation after a hold-up so that the hold-up does not deter efficient relationship specific
investment. Recall that the ADR mechanism requires one party be given a default option and the other
the credibility to make a take-it-or-leave-it offer. Each requires commitment, i.e., the latter party must
have strong incentives not to a second offer and the former a strong incentive not to renegotiate the
default offer. How could the parties implement this with these new technologies?

Learning from Section III.E.1, we would first ask how much information the parties have. If it is enough
to devise a renegotiation design or revelation mechanism, then the parties would want to construct a
penalty provision that deters deviation from the mechanism and that cannot be undone by courts or the
parties through renegotiation. If the amount of information is not adequate to devise such mechanisms,
the only thing the parties can do is construct a penalty provision that discourages any deviation from the
original contract. Of course, such a penalty provision would also bar renegotiation due honestly to
changed circumstances and that does not affect ex ante incentives to invest. So the parties should not
construct a penalty that locks in the original contract unless the expected cost of hold-up is greater than
the expected cost of inflexibility.

To illustrate how a penalty clause could be constructed, suppose the parties have enough information to
write an ADR renegotiation design mechanism. Let’s see how the penalty provision would work. First,
we examine the default option. In our example, it is Corning that is to be given the option to trade a
unit with probability 5/6 at price 23 1/3. We would script a clause in the smart contract code that says
Corning can ask for the default trade and if that trade is not consummated, then Apple pays a penalty.
Likewise, the smart contract code would make Apple pay a penalty if it communicated a second offer to
Corning after Corning refused its first ostensibly take-it-or-leave-it offer.

In order not to skew the incentives of the parties when playing the ADR game, the penalty must flow to
a third party. 128 For instance, if the smart contract does not observe the default trade by a certain time
or if it observes a second offer from Apple, then the code would irreversibly transfer money from Apple
to anonymous third parties.

Blockchain makes it possible for penalties to flow to third parties. All the smart contract has to do is
specify that some large amount would be transferred from Apple’s account (its public address or key) on
the network to a randomly generated list of public addresses or keys and that the smart contract would
announce to the blockchain network the private keys associated with those public keys. The latter step
would allow any node on the network to access and transfer to their account the money at those public
addresses. It would as if the code announced that there was a pile of cash on the corner of Broadway
and Fifth Avenue in Manhattan: people would rush to take the money. 129 The entities that collect the
money distributed by the smart contract would be able to remain anonymous – as blockchain allows

    Antonopolous, supra note 94, at 17 (explaining how transferring money to a public key for which the private key
is publicly known would lead to loss of funds).

anonymous transactions. 130 If that entity were located in a country that did not have a know-your-
customer (KYC) requirement, they could also convert that money into the government currency of their
choice. There are plenty of countries happy to do that. 131

The penalized party, and perhaps even the non-penalized party, would have an incentive to go to court
to enjoin the penalty. With the default option, Apple would have an incentive to not be penalized for
defying Corning’s request. With Apple’s take-it-or-leave-it offer, Apple has an ex post incentive to avoid
the penalty for making a second offer and Corning has an incentive to receive a second Apple offer,
meaning both would want to petition a court.

The future commitment feature of smart contracts and the irreversibility of blockchain transactions can
render court injunctions ineffective. Once the parties sign the agreement, future exchanges are already
booked and cannot be undone – by either the parties or a court – without having either a majority of
the computing power or the tokens on the blockchain. 132 A court does not have that. Thus, a court can
no more require a transaction on blockchain be reversed than it can require that the stock price of a
company that committed fraud increase to compensate shareholders.

Court-ordered damages would not help undermine the smart contract commitment. For one thing,
punishing Corning because Apple has to pay a penalty does not change Apple’s incentives unless Corning
has to pay Apple to compensate for the penalty Apple must pay. But if Corning has to pay Apple, then
the penalty script in the smart contract can make the penalty contingent on subsequent damages
ordered by a court. For example, if the optimal penalty on Apple for say, making more than one offer, is
100 and the damages awarded by the court for making Apple pay a penalty is D, the script could say
Apple must pay 100 + D.

Apple may be tempted to hold Corning up but avoid penalties by renegotiating in two steps. First, they
would comply with the ADR mechanism in the original contract. Second, they would simultaneously
write a separate contract with Corning that functionally puts Apple in the same position as if it had
successfully help up Corning in the original contracts. This second contract would say that Corning will
sell to Apple one unit of Gorilla glass at a price that is equal to the price the parties would negotiate for
Gorilla glass in the abstract (say 𝑝𝑝2 ) minus an amount equal how much a successful hold-up in the
original contract would benefit Apple. This benefit is equal to the difference between the price that the
original contract specified (𝑝𝑝1 ) and the price Apple could extract if it were able successfully to hold
Corning up (𝑝𝑝𝐻𝐻 < 𝑝𝑝1 ). In short, the second contract price would be 𝑝𝑝2 − (𝑝𝑝1 − 𝑝𝑝𝐻𝐻 ).

Blockchain can be used to prevent renegotiating through subsequent contracts as well. The smart
contract could crudely specify that, if there were a second exchange between Apple and Corning, the
penalty would be triggered. Of course, that approach would have collateral damage: the parties may

reasonably want to trade a second time and this penalty trigger would prevent that. To address that,
the parties could agree that the penalty would only be triggered if the second contract had a lower price
than the first contract, though this would create problems if Corning’s costs fell over time. Alternatively,
they could even configure the smart contract to both structure renegotiation on the first trade and to
provide a framework for subsequent trades. 133 That framework includes a revelation mechanism for
subsequent trades that would allow the smart contract to compare the price and cost c of the
subsequent trades to ensure that Corning was fully reimbursed for its investment in prior to the first
trade.

A natural question is how the smart contract code would know if Corning or Apple violated the default
option or final offer or negotiated a subsequent contract that de facto renegotiated their original
contract. The smart contract can certainly monitor the blockchain – the ledger of transactions – on the
network, in which case it would know directly if another trade occurs. It is here that the open feature of
blockchain is critical. It could also monitor communications or accounts not on the blockchain network
by using application program interfaces (APIs) that gave it access to the parties’ messages or to other
accounts the parties may have. 134 When the parties sign the contract, they want the penalties so they
would have an incentive to allow the smart contract access to all their messages and accounts. 135

Of course, the fact that the parties want to share information does not mean it is easy to do so. It may
be difficult to give access to all communications between parties, e.g., in person conversations between
employees of the two parties. 136 It may also be that the parties have accounts at some banks that do
not provide APIs that can give the smart contract access and the parties cannot change those banks’
policies. We hope this is a limitation that recedes in time as more accounts become interoperable in the
sense of providing API access. We also think it may not be a large limitation as parties certainly have an
incentive to keep most of their money in accounts with banks that offer APIs as those APIs allow the
parties themselves to monitor their own accounts more easily.




133
    This is not uncommon in long term contract where the end date is not specified. See, e.g., Susana López-Bayón
& Manuel González-Díaz, Indefinite contract duration: Evidence from electronics subcontracting, 30 INT’L REV. OF

though banks may charge a few to access the API).
135
    If one of the parties did not, then the other party would not want to enter the contract with that party. As a
result, the party that considered not giving access would give access because ex ante they would benefit from the
contract, even at the cost of giving access. Especially since access to the smart contract is not the same as public
access, as the smart contract would not share the messages or account information with anyone, even
counterparties.

technical barrier to it. In any case, the account owner can provide the smart contract script this power. This is no
different than an IFTTT (acronym for if this then that) script that signals to third parties the actions of an account
owner. For IFTTT examples with Gmail as an input, see https://ifttt.com/gmail.

B. Generalizing the example

Having shown through example how ADR provisions might be implemented, we can infer how the
provisions required for a revelation mechanism or the original contract as a whole can be implemented
via smart contract. The smart contract can employ penalties to get the parties to comply with specific
steps of the revelation mechanism. To complete each mechanism, the smart contracts must require
that parties take actions in a certain sequence, e.g., the take-it-or-leave-it offer comes before the
default option can be triggered, otherwise the party that was not supposed to move faces penalties.
Since the renegotiation-design mechanism is the whole contract, the parties that want to employ that
mechanism need only specify the steps that mechanism requires. Parties that wish to employ the
revelation mechanism can only finalize their smart contract by adding to their revelation mechanism a
schedule of contingent trades that are each triggered by different combination of valuations 𝑣𝑣 and costs
𝑐𝑐 revealed through the revelation mechanism.

For those parties that do not have the relevant information to devise renegotiation design or revelation
mechanisms, blockchain still has value. Such parties have to make a choice: write a contract that never
allows renegotiation, or always allows renegotiation, whether due to hold-up or to changed
circumstances. If they think the hold-up problem is bigger than the problem of inflexibility, they can bar
renegotiation under any circumstance by imposing penalties for such renegotiation. The steps were
outlined above.



C. Robustness of smart contracts on the blockchain

Smart contracts on the blockchain have at least three limitations we have not yet discussed. One is that
government may simply ban blockchain or smart contracts that impose penalties. 137 We do not think
this is likely. Blockchain has a great deal of value outside the contractual commitment setting. Entities
that obtain that value would lobby or litigate hard against a broad ban of blockchain. 138 A narrower ban
on smart contracts with penalties is more plausible. It would be akin to a ban on penalty clauses. 139 The
main problem is that the ban is difficult to enforce. Both parties to a contract with a penalty want that
penalty ex ante, so have little incentive to report that they have written a smart contract with a penalty.
And ex post a court cannot rescue them from that penalty, if the penalty is written correctly.

Only a whistleblower, a third party, or a contractual party who was coerced into agreeing to a smart
contract penalty clause has an incentive to get courts involved. But legislators would have to authorize
bounties for whistleblowers, another type of third party standing, or criminal penalties. Those may be
political hard sells because no outsiders are hurt by the commitment described in this paper. The
biggest risk comes from coerced parties. Indeed, it is likely these individuals who were able to

undermine penalty clauses in non-smart contracts. Perhaps the difficulty of enforcing a ban on all smart
contracts with penalty causes will give courts an opportunity to limit their ban such agreements to those
where one of the parties is unsophisticated and may have been coerced into signing it.

A second limitation concern with smart contracts on blockchain is that, like computer scripts generally,
they are sensitive to honest mistakes. For example, if Apple accidentally hits send on its email that
contains a draft – but not the final draft – of its take-it-or-leave-it offer, the smart contract will not allow
it to recall the message otherwise Apple could circumvent the smart contract by calling its first offer a
message it wants to recall. To address the costs of such mistakes, game theorists sometimes look for
equilibria of games that are robust to “trembling hands”; correlatively mechanism designers might look
for game rules that yield trembling hand perfect or robust equilibria. 140 We do not know if the
mechanisms we have discussed in this paper are robust to errors, though empirical work by Aghion et al.
(2017) 141 give us some hope that smaller mistakes might yield smaller deviations from first best
incentives to invest.

A third limitation of the smart contract penalties is that they only work if the parties have sufficient
assets to pay the penalties required by the smart contract. One way to ensure that smart contract
penalties can be implemented and are effective is for the parties to place enough assets in their
accounts on the blockchain network to cover penalties until both parties satisfactorily perform on the
contract. Note that these assets are available to be employed or spent until penalties are required if the
parties take out a loan collateralized by the assets in their account on the blockchain. Another way to
ensure penalties can be covered is to not require the parties to put up a bond on the blockchain but to
allow the smart contract to create debt on behalf of the penalized party to a lender, with the proceeds
from the lender being used to pay third parties pursuant to the penalty. The lender would be willing to
do so long as the party on the hook for the penalty had enough assets, on the blockchain or otherwise.
Of course, if either party did not have enough assets to cover optimal penalties, optimal penalties would
not be available. In that case penalties would have to be lowered, and hold-up risks would rise
commensurately.



VI.      CONCLUSION

In this paper, we have highlighted the problem of hold-up, a specific type of transaction cost that can
reduce parties’ incentives to make relationship-specific investments or to trade in the first place. We
argued that traditional contracts, made on paper and enforced with existing financial technology and
litigation strategies, cannot provide the very high level of commitment necessary to limit the harms
from hold-up. Finally, we explained that smart contracts on blockchain networks have features that,
when these technologies become widely deployed, may be able to provide a greater degree of
commitment and thus additional protection against hold-up.

We conclude by considering the implications of our argument for the size of firms, and offer some
thoughts about the benefits of smart contracts and blockchain for contract law more generally.

A. Implications for size of firms

One implication of our claim is that blockchain and smart contracts have to the potential to increase the
gains from, and thus amount of, relationship-specific investment and trade and thus total output that
we observe in the economy. 142 The degree of benefit is proportional to the extent to which hold-up is a
drag on investment and trade. In addition, we expect that blockchain should reduce the size of firms.
As blockchain increases the returns to market-mediated transactions, firms will move more transactions
outside the firm to the market. In this way, it functions much like prior technological innovations that
increased counterparty trust and accountability. 143 Blockchain may also do this by reducing the role of
trust intermediaries, such as banks, in the economy, though that is not a feature we emphasize in this
paper. 144



B. Speculation about effects on contracting generally

While our focus has been smart contracts on the blockchain can tackle the problem of hold-up in
contracts, there may be other benefits of these technologies to contract law generally. One that we
think particularly important is that they may reduce the need for centralized entities, especially courts,
to resolve contractual disputes. We think this is possible through at least two channels. First, as we
explained in Section V, smart contracts can reduce the need for court interpretation of contracts. A
smart contract script, like other computer code, does what it does. The language compiler is the
interpreter and it does not permit variation in interpretation. Parties can tackle bugs in the code via
simulation, but they get what the code does. In some sense, the compiler is the ultimate textualist
interpreter, with little regard for absurdities. Parties do not have to use it, but they have the option to.
When they do, the role of courts will decline to a greater or lesser extent.

Second, blockchain networks may use their validation mechanism or their consensus rules to adjudicate
smart contract disputes. If a smart contract crashes because it is poorly written or if a party feels the
counterparty somehow did not honor a smart contract, 145 the network can appoint a third party node
on the network not just to witness the contract, but to adjudicate the dispute. The idea would be that,
just as the Bitcoin network replaced banks as the intermediary for payments, it can replace courts as
arbiters of smart contract disputes.

Of course, the difficulty is that the work required to adjudicate smart contract disputes may not be as
algorithmic as mediating transactions. The latter require only that the third party verify the sender of
money has enough money in its account (which is evident from the blockchain ledger up until the date
of payment) and that the transfer to the receiver’s account is recorded in the updated blockchain ledge.
Resolving contract disputes requires, for example, determining what the parties would have scripted if

    E.g., perhaps the counterparty negotiated around it off the blockchain.

they had considered the state in which the smart contract crashed. This requires fact finding beyond
the information already available on the blockchain.

It is not clear that other nodes, or even a consensus among nodes, is a good way to resolve the
problems. The cost of fact finding of the sort required for adjudication is greater than the cost of fact
finding required to verify a payment. The third-party node has to be compensated for that higher cost,
just as it is compensated for verifying transactions. Moreover, the other nodes may not be well
qualified to adjudicate disputes. The idea of using blockchain is not entirely ludicrous, however. Civil
trials, including contract trials, in existing courts also impose great costs on parties. Moreover, the may
be tried to a jury, which also may not be qualified.

Even if a blockchain-mediated peer-to-peer network does not displace courts, it may be able to
complement courts in two ways. First, it may help courts better identify majoritarian default rules. The
more smart contracts are written on the blockchain, the easier it would be for courts to determine true
majoritarian default rules. This is difficult now as selection into litigation determines what judges see 146
and general fact finding is limited or biased by the adversarial process. 147 As a result, there are reason
to suspect that courts may not be filling in gaps in contracts with the right default rule. But because
contracts on the blockchain may be public, the court can directly query what most parties want in
specific situations. 148

Second, just as parties now can set the jurisdiction that will govern their contract disputes, smart
contracts may even allow parties to specify which set of (scripted) default rules should govern the gaps
in their contracts. This process would be similar to the way in which people putting up intellectual
property (IP) such as photos or images onto web might simply appeal to the Creative Common license to
govern the usage of their IP. This would lower the demand for courts, but in case disputes go to trial, it
would help courts decide cases.



C. The importance of blockchain and smart contracts

With many new technologies that come along, there are a wave of articles that claim the technology
fundamentally changes law. They risk creating what Judge Easterbrook called the law of the horse. 149
We do not yet think that blockchain and smart contracts will change contract law. Rather, we think it
may have a measurable impact on the sorts and amounts of contracts that can be written. To justify our
beliefs, we need only to point to the substantial amount of investment going into blockchain. A large
fraction of the largest banks, IT companies, and consulting firms are investing in blockchain. 150 The total

148
    This is not actually perfect because, even if everyone makes their contracts public, there may be selection into
who actually writes provisions that covers specific circumstances. However, it is true that blockchain reduces one
layer of selection – namely selection into litigation.

enough activity in the technology to begin considering the legal implications of this technology,

APPENDIX I: ADDRESSING HOLD-UP WITH OPTIONS CONTRACTS (NOLDEKE AND SCHMIDT 1995)

Noldeke and Schmidt (1995) show that certain option contracts can also achieve the social optimum. 153
Their reasoning is as follows. 154

The first step is for the buyer and seller to design the renegotiation bargaining game. Here, Noldecke
and Schmidt (1995) adopt the following formulation that was first contained in Hart and Moore
(1988). 155

After 𝑣𝑣 and 𝑐𝑐 have been realized, suppose the buyer and seller can simultaneously send each other new
offers. Each offer (from each party) is a pair of prices: one if there is trade and one if there is no trade.
Trade is assumed to be verifiable by a third party such as a court, and thus the specified payment can be
enforced. Said payment is the default, unless one of the parties decides to furnish the court with the
new offer from the other party. In equilibrium only two offers will be furnished: (i) the seller accepting a
higher price; or (ii) the buyer accepting a lower price.

Now, suppose the seller receives some default payment 𝑑𝑑 if no trade occurs, but has the option to
deliver the good to the buyer and receive an additional payment 𝑝𝑝, so that the total transfer 𝑡𝑡 = 𝑑𝑑 + 𝑝𝑝.
The question is how renegotiation works. There are three different cases to consider.

First, suppose that 𝑝𝑝 is less that “low 𝑐𝑐”. If there is no renegotiation the clearly the seller does not want
to trade because no matter what her production cost is she will receive less than that amount from the
buyer. But if the buyer’s valuation is high and the seller’s cost is low then there are gains from trade, and
thus renegotiation should occur. Raising 𝑝𝑝 to “low 𝑐𝑐” will be sufficient to do this, and the buyer does not
need to go any higher. To see this, note that if the buyer furnishes a letter offering 𝑑𝑑 + “𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑐𝑐”, the
seller will want to trade. Moreover, the buyer knows that the seller will want to deliver the letter to the
third party/court. Since 𝑝𝑝 is equal to “low 𝑐𝑐”, the buyer extracts all the surplus, which is equivalent to
saying that she has all the bargaining power.

Second, suppose that 𝑝𝑝 is between “low 𝑐𝑐” and “high 𝑐𝑐”. As before, the buyer can extract all the surplus
from renegotiation by sending furnishing a letter agreeing to a higher price if there is no trade.

Third, suppose that 𝑝𝑝 is greater than “high 𝑐𝑐”. Now the seller always wants to trade. Again, the buyer
can extract all the surplus from renegotiation by sending furnishing a letter agreeing to a higher price if
there is no trade.

Taken together this means that the buyer has all the bargaining power and therefore has appropriate
incentives to make the optimal level of investment.

APPENDIX II: MOORE-REPULLO REVELATION MECHANISM.

Moore and Repullo (1988) present a multi-stage mechanism that permits implementation of any social
objective, including truth telling, as the unique (subgame-perfect) equilibrium of the game induced by
that mechanism. 156 The following, based heavily on Aghion and Holden (2011), 157 is an example of this
kind of mechanism in the context of the Apple-Corning example we have been using.

      1. A(pple) announces either 40 or 32. If the announcement is 40 then A pays C(orning) a price equal
         to 40 and the mechanism stops.
      2. If A announces “32” and C does not challenge A’s announcement then A pays a price of 32 and
         the mechanism stops.
      3. If C challenges A’s announcement then
             a. A pays a fine of 30 to a T(hird party)
             b. A is offered the glass for 22
             c. If A accepts then C gets 30 from T (and 22 from A for the glass)
             d. If A rejects the glass then C pays 30 to T
             e. A and C Nash bargain over the glass.
We will not go through how to establish that truth-telling is the unique equilibrium here, but refer the
interested reader to Aghion and Holden (2011) for the requisite logic, though with different numerical
values. 158
