                                        ABSTRACT

We assess the power of forward guidance—promises about future interest rates—as a monetary
tool in a liquidity trap using a quantitative incomplete-markets model. Our results suggest the
effects of forward guidance are negligible. A commitment to keep future nominal interest rates
low for a few quarters—although macro indicators suggest otherwise—has only trivial effects on
current output and employment. We explain theoretically why in complete markets models
forward guidance is powerful—generating a “forward guidance puzzle”—and why this puzzle
disappears in our model. We also clarify theoretically ambiguous conclusions from previous
research about the effectiveness of forward guidance in incomplete and complete markets models.

1     Introduction
As a response to the decline in economic activity during the Great Recession, the monetary
authority lowered the nominal interest rate to zero in an attempt to stimulate output and
employment. Having reached the limit of conventional monetary policy (the zero lower bound)
and in the face of high unemployment and low output, the monetary authority attempted
to provide further accommodation by announcing its forecast of future policy rates. In the
liquidity trap, this “forward guidance” has become one of the main new tools for the monetary
authority to conduct policy.
    Understanding the efficacy of this new policy tool and the mechanism through which it
operates is crucial for helping to fight future recessions. In the benchmark model for monetary
policy analysis, the representative-agent New Keynesian (RANK) model, forward guidance
is very effective, driven by the effect on intertemporal substitution (Carlstrom et al., 2015).
The commitment to keep future interest rates at zero despite recovering economic conditions
(such as rising inflation) yields large positive contemporaneous output effects. More generally,
cutting future nominal interest rates has much larger effects than contemporaneous cuts and,
paradoxically, the effect is increasing in the horizon of the announced cut. This feature of the
RANK model gave rise to what is referred to as the “Forward Guidance Puzzle” (Del Negro
et al., 2012).
    Since the strong effects of forward guidance are driven by intertemporal substitution, one
hypothesis for the resolution of the puzzle was to depart from the assumption of complete
markets and instead incorporate incomplete asset markets. Most prominently, McKay et al.
(2016) make the case for forward guidance being less effective in incomplete than in complete
markets. In contrast, Werning (2015) argues that forward guidance is equally effective in
complete and incomplete markets models. Thus, the question of how to resolve the puzzle
remained open, and the extent to which incomplete markets help to resolve it was unclear.
McKay et al. (2016) say they help quite a bit, though even in their framework a few quarters
of forward guidance is powerful enough to effectively prevent “Great Recessions.” Werning
(2015) says incomplete markets help very little or not at all. But both agree that forward
guidance is likely to be an potent monetary tool.
    This paper resolves the puzzle — providing valuable insights to future policy makers —


                                               1
and simultaneously reconciles the disagreements outstanding in the literature. Our starting
point is the same incomplete markets model as used by Werning (2015) and McKay et al.
(2016). We add several features to the model which bring it closer to the data and provide
a quantitative assessment disciplined by data that builds on a large literature of incomplete-
markets models. To calibrate the incomplete market/ household block of the model we follow
Krueger et al. (2016), which allows the model to replicate income dynamics, and the income
and wealth distribution as observed in the data. This allows us to better match the observed
individual and the aggregate demand response which is essential to reliably infer demand
movements in response to policy changes. We also incorporate that government bonds are
nominal a characteristic feature of for example the U.S. bonds market. For the output block,
we follow the large New Keynesian literature (Christiano et al., 2005) and incorporate rigid
adjustments of wages in addition to rigidity in prices.
       The key finding is that the effects of forward guidance are small and the “forward guidance
puzzle” disappears. A commitment to keep nominal interest rates low for a few quarters despite
the fact that macro indicators signal that interest rates should be raised has minimal effects
on current output and employment. Future changes in nominal interest rates are less effective
than current ones and the contemporaneous output effects of future interest rate promises are
falling in the horizon of the promise. It is important to note that contemporaneous changes
to nominal interest rates are quite powerful in our model, so that our findings are not due to
a more general ineffectiveness of monetary policy in the model.
       To help understand our key result, we first show how the results in Werning (2015) and
McKay et al. (2016) depend on their assumptions on income dynamics, on the redistribution
of profits and on the allocation of taxes. Specifically we show that through varying those dis-
tributional assumptions, forward guidance can be more, equally or less effective in incomplete
markets models than in complete markets models.1
       Given this seemingly ambiguous prediction, what then explains our findings? We differ
from the model considered in Werning (2015) and McKay et al. (2016) along two crucial
dimensions. Our first modeling deviation is that we allow for the empirically relevant level of
   1
    Werning (2015) made a related theoretical point. We show that these theoretical arguments are quanti-
tatively relevant within the framework of McKay et al. (2016) and relate the quantitative results to the fiscal
policy induced redistribution emphasized in our theoretical analysis.




                                                      2
wage rigidities. Profits are inversely proportional to wages in the model implying that if wages
are not very volatile, neither are profits. Moreover, profits are small in our model, in line with
the data. Thus, movements in profits are small and they do not induce large distributional
consequences. This is contrast to e.g. McKay et al. (2016) who assumed flexible and thus
highly volatile wages and profits.
       A second difference is that our quantitative assessment takes into account that govern-
ment bonds, transfers and taxes are (partially) nominal. This assumption paired with incom-
plete markets generates small movements in the real interest rate from forward guidance,
indicating that the theoretical findings of Hagedorn (2016, 2018) carry over to realistically
calibrated incomplete-markets models.2 This is relevant because forward guidance operates in
part through changing inflation expectations (and thus real interest rates), which generates
feedback onto current prices and output. In complete-markets models, such movements in real
rates are sizeable and translate to higher current consumption (through the intertemporal
substitution channel), and thus yield higher employment today. In contrast, we find in our
incomplete markets model that the change in real interest rates is small implying that the
intertemporal substitution channel is weak as well.
       To summarize, in incomplete markets models the effect of forward guidance operates
through a distributional channel—induced by movements in prices, wages, and interest rates—
and an intertemporal substitution channel. We find that both channels are muted when mar-
kets are incomplete in the presence of the empirically relevant nominal rigidities and a par-
tially nominal government budget, implying the overall ineffectiveness of forward guidance.
The theoretical arguments for our findings are quite general, so that we conclude that forward
guidance is not a powerful monetary policy tool, even in a liquidity trap.
       The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the basic incomplete markets model
with price rigidities similar to the one used by McKay et al. (2016). Using this framework, in
Section 3 we study forward guidance in incomplete and complete markets models theoretically
and provide quantitative examples to illustrate our theoretical findings. In Section 4 we extend
   2
    The logic underlying this finding is that higher prices induced by forward guidance lower the real value
of government bonds, which are considered net wealth by households, inducing a negative demand response
in our incomplete markets model. This negative consumption response puts downward pressure on marginal
costs, and thus prices, counteracting the attempts of forward guidance to increase prices. As a consequence,
the equilibrium response of the real interest rate required to equate demand and supply is small.

the model to include rigid adjustment of wages and nominal government bonds. We calibrate
this model and conduct a quantitative evaluation of the effects of forward guidance. Section
5 concludes.


2     Model
To facilitate comparison with the existing results in the literature, we develop the model in
stages. In this Section we describe a basic heterogeneous-agent incomplete-markets model
(Aiyagari, 1994, 1995) with price rigidities that closely follows the framework of McKay et al.
(2016) with minor modifications. Specifically, we introduce a more general class of tax functions
and replace pricing frictions a la Calvo (1983) with those in the style of Rotemberg (1982).
These modifications facilitate the theoretical analysis and quantitative discussion to follow. In
Section 4, we will extend this basic model to incorporate the two empirically relevant features
— wage rigidity and a nominal government budget— for the full quantitative analysis.
    As is standard in the New Keynesian literature, final good producers in the model com-
bine intermediate goods to produce a good sold in a competitive market. Intermediate goods
producers are monopolistically competitive. They set a price they charge to the final good
producer to maximize profits taking into account the price adjustment costs they face. The
intermediate goods are produced with labor, rented in competitive markets.


2.1     Households

The economy consists of a continuum of agents normalized to measure 1 with CRRA prefer-
ences over consumption and additively separable preferences for leisure:

                                                                                                                    is the
inflation rate (Pt is the price of the final good) and (1 + it ) is the nominal interest rate.
   Thus, at time t an agent faces the following budget constraint:


                      ct + at+1 = (1 + rt )at + wt ht st − Tt (wt ht st , st ) + dt ,


where dt are dividends from firms and Tt (wt ht st , st ) is the tax function which can take positive
or negative (transfers) values and can depend on agent’s labor earnings and productivity.
Agents take prices and wages as given. We can rewrite the agent’s problem recursively as
follows:

where Ω(a, s) ∈ M is the distribution on the space X = A×S, agents asset holdings a ∈ A and
labor productivity s ∈ S, across the population, which will together with the policy variables
determine the equilibrium prices. Υ is an equilibrium object that specifies the evolution of the

Intermediate good producer Each intermediate good j is produced by a monopolistically
competitive producer using labor input nj . The production technology is linear,


                                                yjt = njt .


Intermediate producers hire labor at the nominal wage Pt wt in a competitive labor market.
With this technology, the real marginal cost of a unit of intermediate good is

The adjustment cost are “as-if”, that is they are not resource costs but price setters behave
as if they were, for example because they affect utility. We make this assumption to avoid
counterfactual “price-adjustment booms” that would arise from the large resource costs as-
sociated with large price movements in the liquidity trap. The equilibrium real profit of each
intermediate goods firm is then

The government issues real bonds bt+1 and collects real taxes Tt (wt ht st , st ) so that the gov-
ernment budget constraint is given by:

Note that, in our enriched quantitative model in Section 4, both bonds and taxes will be
nominal.


2.4    Equilibrium

Market clearing requires that the labor demanded by the firm is equal to the labor supplied by
households and that the bonds issued by the government equals the amount of assets provided
by households:

3     Forward Guidance in Complete and Incomplete mar-
      kets Models: Theory and Examples
In this Section we consider whether forward guidance is more powerful in complete or in
incomplete markets models. Our main result is that there is no clear answer to this question.
It depends on the distributional consequences of forward guidance whether forward guidance
is more or less powerful in incomplete than in complete markets models. We first address
this issue theoretically and explain the reason for this ambiguous finding and then move to
a quantitative analysis using the model in McKay et al. (2016). Within this model we show
that small changes to how fiscal policy is conducted lead to opposite findings when comparing
complete and incomplete markets.

3.1    Theory

Our starting point for the model comparison is the outcome of policy experiments - forward
guidance or not - in a New Keynesian complete markets model, which arises as a special case of
the incomplete markets model when all households are identical and s ≡ 1. Let the outcome of
such an experiment in the complete markets model be sequences of hours, HtCM , consumption,
CtCM , wages, wtCM , dividends, DtCM and gross real interest rates, RtCM = 1 + rtCM .
   Define the percentage deviations from steady state (e.g., in response to forward guidance)
of the impulse responses of consumption, hours, wages and real interest rates:

output, dividends, real interest rates and wages in the underlying complete markets model
respectively. Since the price-adjustment costs are as-if, consumption, output and hours always
coincide and deviate by the same percentage,

   To understand how the aggregate consumption demand in the incomplete markets model
differs from one with complete markets, it is useful to start by considering the behavior of each
individual household. Consider the following experiment: each household in the incomplete
markets model obtains the same percentage change in hours, wages and dividends as in the
complete markets model. Furthermore, apply the same percentage change in the real interest
rate and adjust the tax system to balance the budget at each point in time holding the real
amount of government debt constant. Households thus obtain a wage

This is the aggregate demand in the incomplete markets model when households face the same
changes in income and prices as in the complete markets model. This is a partial equilibrium
experiment since it uses complete markets prices, which are not adjusting to clear markets
in the incomplete markets model. It is important to note, however, that all prices and the
income households receive change—not only the real interest rate. This is important since
those changes have distributional consequences that matter in incomplete markets models
but not in complete markets models. If markets were complete and households faced these
sequences of income and prices, then the aggregate consumption demand response would
coincide with the complete markets case, CtIM,F G = γt Css

general equilibrium response it is instructive to consider whether or not the partial equilibrium
aggregate demand from the incomplete markets model experiments exceeds aggregate demand
scaled up by the same percentage deviation as in complete markets.

                                                      11
       The idea is as follows. Suppose that CtIM,F G > γt Css
                                                           IM
                                                              . Since γtC Css
                                                                           IM       IM
                                                                              = γt Hss =: HtIM,F G ,
this means that aggregate demand exceeds aggregate supply given complete markets prices
and income,


                                    CtIM,F G > γt Hss
                                                   IM
                                                      = HtIM,F G .                                          (26)


This inequality (which in complete markets would be an equality) now suggests, using standard
Keynesian-cross logic, where the general equilibrium outcome is likely to be. Since output is
demand determined, aggregate demand exceeding aggregate supply means that firms have
to increase labor demand to satisfy the excess demand. This higher labor demand means
higher income and higher consumption which again requires firms to hire more labor. The
process continues until supply equals demand in equilibrium3 . This reasoning suggest that the
equilibrium level of consumption and hours will be higher than HtIM,F G = γtC Css
                                                                               IM
                                                                                  .
       The same logic but with opposite signs applies if


                                    CtIM,F G < γt Hss
                                                   IM
                                                      = HtIM,F G .                                          (27)


The lack of demand leads to a downwards adjustment of hours until eventually the lower level
of equilibrium consumption and hours is reached.
       We now show theoretically that CtIM,F G can exceed or fall short of supply in this partial
equilibrium experiment and we explore the reasons why and when this occurs. Next, we will
confirm that this finding carries over to general equilibrium using a quantitative example,
hence confirming that forward guidance can be more or less powerful in incomplete than in
complete markets models.
       To understand aggregate demand CtIM,F G , we start with the consumption demand cIM,F
                                                                                       i,t
                                                                                            G

                                                      i,t   . If every household increased individual
consumption as much (in percentage terms) as the complete markets agents, cIM,F
                                                                           i,t
                                                                                G
                                                                                  = γt cIM,ss
                                                                                        i,t   ,
aggregate demand would do the same, CtIM,F G = γt Css
                                                   IM
                                                      , and demand would equal supply.
In this knife-edge case, the complete markets and the incomplete markets equilibrium would
coincide. Due to redistribution this is in general not the case and cIM,F

    Of course, in general equilibrium prices will also adjust. However, the presence of rigidities in prices will
prevent the full equilibrium adjustment happening through prices alone.

The earnings in the complete markets equilibrium change by (γtw γt − 1) and so too do the
earnings here. The path of dividends changes by (γtd − 1) so that households now receive
different dividends. We subtract the term (γt − 1)cIM,ss

spent if household i behaved as in the complete markets model and increased consumption
by γt − 1. This allows us to compare the demand in the two different environments as ∆i,t
describes the income redistribution relative to the complete markets income/consumption
changes. Finally, households have to make different tax payments and their return on assets
changes as well. Note that we use households’ steady-state assets aIM,ss
                                                                   i,t   and do not allow for
a re-optimization in response to the counterfactual income redistribution induced by using
complete markets prices when defining ∆i,t , which is exogenous to households. In particular,
∆i,t does not include a household’s consumption choices cIM,F

household’s optimization taking as given complete markets prices and income changes.
   We now show that ∆i,t is just a redistribution so that it integrates to zero across agents.

echoing the fact that ∆i,t just captures redistribution across households as a deviation from
hypothetical complete markets behavior. In other words, in the absence of idiosyncratic risk
(and thus trivially complete markets), aggregate demand would equal complete markets ag-
gregate demand. However, this is not the case and this incompleteness leads to heterogeneity
in the marginal propensity to consume. Define M P Ci,t as this propensity of household i at
time t which allows us to approximate the consumption choice of household i at time t as4

is the “covariance” since               ∆i,t di = 0. We can therefore use the sign of this covariance,
cov(M P Ci,t , ∆i,t ), to determine whether our experiment delivers an excess or a shortfall of
    4
    Note that M P Ci,t is an equilibrium object which is specific to the experiment we are considering and
that the consumption response depends on the all aspects of the experiment. For example, we suppress the
dependence on future income so that we only obtain an approximation that, however, is sufficiently good to
explain our findings. For analyses which fully take the dynamic interactions into account, see Auclert et al.

The interpretation is straightforward. If cov(M P Ci,t , ∆i,t ) > 0 — on average households who
receive a high ∆i,t have a high M P Ci,t — then forward guidance redistributes towards high-
MPC households. This redistribution increases aggregate demand above the supply HtIM,F G .
In contrast, if cov(M P Ci,t , ∆i,t ) < 0 — on average households who receive a high ∆i,t have
a low M P Ci,t — then forward guidance redistributes towards low-MPC households. This
redistribution reduces aggregate demand below the supply HtIM,F G .
   Considering two special cases of our environment helps to sharpen our understanding of
both the findings in this paper and in the literature.
   First, suppose that there is no heterogeneity in MPCs, M P Ci,t = M P C t as is the case in
complete markets models. Then
                                         Z                                 Z
               cov(M P Ci,t , ∆i,t ) =        M P Ci,t ∆i,t di = M P C t       ∆i,t di = 0.   (35)


As a result, demand in the incomplete and complete markets model is the same. Although there
is income heterogeneity in ∆i,t , this does not effect aggregate demand since each household
has the same MPC, M P C t .
   Second, if ∆i,t ≡ 0, then once again
                                          Z                         Z
                cov(M P Ci,t , ∆i,t ) =        M P Ci,t ∆i,t di =       M P Ci,t 0di = 0,     (36)


that is demand in the incomplete and complete markets model is again the same since there is
no income heterogeneity. This is the scenario considered in Werning (2015). He assumes that
the income of each household moves one-to-one with aggregate income and that bonds are in
zero net supply. Income includes all types of income - labor, dividend, transfers - so that his
assumptions imply ∆i,t ≡ 0. Our finding in this special case coincides with the conclusion of
Werning (2015): Forward guidance is equally powerful in incomplete and complete markets.
   We now provide quantitative examples which show that the sign of the covariance can
either positive or negative depending on the properties of fiscal policy.

3.2       Quantitative Examples

In this Section we use the same model, calibration and monetary policies as in McKay et al.
(2016) (MNS). We then allow for two different fiscal policies, one identical to the one used in
MNS and another one with different redistributive effects.
       MNS assume a quarterly income process with three states - s1 , s2 , s3 - which follows an
AR(1) with autoregressive coefficient 0.966 and innovation variance of 0.017.5 The disutility
                             1
                          1+ ϕ
of labor is g(h) = ψ h1+ 1 .6 To make these quantitative examples directly comparable to those
                            ϕ

in MNS, we now slightly deviate from the model used in the theoretical analysis above and
assume, as in MNS, that prices are set as in Calvo (1983), i.e. firms can re-optimize their price
with probability θ. Table I summarizes MNS’s parameter values which are also used here.
       In terms of fiscal policy, MNS assume the real value of debt to be constant, that there are
no transfers and that taxes are paid by the highest productivity type s3 only. Each households
receives an equal share of the dividends dt .
       To consider the effectiveness of forward guidance at the ZLB, MNS assume perfect foresight
and that the discount factor increases for a known number of periods and then reverts back
to its steady-state value, such that the ZLB binds for 20 quarters and generates an impact
output decline of 4 percent when monetary policy follows a “naive” policy, described next.

      MNS use productivity values [s1 , s2 , s3 ] = [0.4923, 1, 2.0313] so that aggregate productivity,   sP rob(s) =
s1 π1 + s2 π2 + s3 π3 exceed the value in the complete markets model which they set to 1. We keep the transition
probabilities but change the incomplete markets productivities to [s1 , s2 , s3 ] = [0.5, 1, 1.5], so that aggregate
productivity is exactly 1 as it is in complete markets. The population weights of groups 1, 2, 3 are the same as
in MNS and equal (π1 = 0.25, π2 = 0.5, π3 = 0.25).
    6
      We choose ψ = 1 for incomplete markets as MNS do, but adjust the complete markets value such that
aggregate hours are the same in both economies.

             Figure 1: Response of Output to the ZLB Shock: MNS Fiscal Policy


   MNS consider two types of monetary policy, which they label the “naive” one and the
“extended” one (and we use their terminology in what follows). The naive policy is a standard
Taylor rule where the net nominal interest rate it+1 = max{0, r̄ + φπt }, where φ = 1.5 and
r̄ is the steady-state real interest rate, which is fixed at 2 percent annually. In particular,
policy implements the Taylor rule as soon as it delivers a positive interest rate. This is policy
without any forward guidance. The extended policy — forward guidance policy — differs from
the naive policy in this respect as it sets the nominal interest rate to zero for several additional
quarters although the Taylor rule already prescribes a positive nominal interest rate. Policy
reverts back to the Taylor rule only after these additional quarters. We follow MNS who choose
3 additional quarters of monetary stimulus in order to obtain no initial output drop in the
complete markets model.
   The idea is then to first compare the effects of the two monetary policies within each model
with the interpretation that the difference between the naive and the extended policy is the
effect of forward guidance. Second, these effects are compared across models.

          Figure 2: Incomplete Markets & MNS Fiscal Policy: Aggregate Demand


3.2.1   Forward Guidance more Powerful in Complete Markets Models

Figure 1 replicates the main result (Figure 7) in MNS in our slightly modified economy. In this
scenario forward guidance is significantly less powerful in incomplete markets models than in
complete markets models. While the naive policy delivers an almost identical output path, the
results when implementing the extended policy are quite different. In the complete markets
case output losses are basically avoided whereas there are substantial output losses in the
incomplete markets case, justifying the conclusion that forward guidance is more powerful in
complete than in incomplete markets models.
   To understand this outcome, Figure 2 shows demand CtIM,F G and supply HtIM,F G in the
incomplete markets model for the extended policy when using complete markets model prices,
income and the discount factor shock. Remember, that these are not equilibrium objects as
we are not using the incomplete markets equilibrium prices. Instead, it is evident that demand
falls short of supply so that the general equilibrium adjustment process is correctly expected
to lead to lower output in incomplete markets in the extended policy case. Panel (a) of Figure
3 shows the demand of the three income groups, where demand of the income groups s1 and

s2 falls more than the increase by s3 , explaining the overall drop in aggregate demand. To
understand what drives these relative differences in demand, panel (b) of Figure 3 shows the
income redistribution across the three income groups induced by the policy. Resources are
redistributed from groups s1 and s2 towards group s3 , explaining why the demand of groups
s1 and s2 fall, but s3 rises. The fact that group s3 is the low MPC group explains why that
group’s increase in demand is more than offset by the decline in demand from the other two
groups, accounting for the aggregate demand response.
             There are two reasons why the interest rate shock leads to a redistribution of wealth away
from households with high marginal propensities to consume and toward households with low
marginal propensities to consume (which also tend to be the high productivity households).
First, the fall in interest rates implies that the tax burden falls, benefiting tax payers. Since
it is the high productivity households who pay all the taxes, they are the only beneficiaries
of this tax cut. The fall in interest rates hurts asset holders. If high productivity households
were to hold all assets, then this loss from lower asset income would have exactly canceled
the gain from lower taxes. But since assets are more equally distributed than the tax burden,
high productivity households benefit. The other income groups lose since they do not benefit
from the tax cut (as they pay no taxes) but now have lower asset income due to lower real
interest rates.

   A second reason is that an increase in output causes wages to rise and dividends to fall
when moving from the naive to the extended policy. Given the equal distribution of dividends
in MNS (all income groups receive the same amount), all income groups experience the same
loss from a fall in dividends. But the gain from higher wages is larger for high productivity
households, who also tend to have low MPCs. Thus, high productivity households benefit
relative to low productivity households.

We now make one change to the previous model. We assume a different tax policy and partly
shift the tax burden from high income households (productivity s3 ) towards lower income
groups with productivity s1 , s2 (recall previously that s3 households bore the entire tax burden
to finance interest expenditures on government debt). Consider a tax function defined by the
share of the interest burden paid by households of different productivities T (s). The benchmark
model had T (s1 ) = T (s2 ) = 0 and T (s3 )π3 = 1. Now consider the alternative tax burden:
T (s1 )π1 = 0.14, T (s2 )π2 = 0.5 and T (s3 )π3 = 0.36 where the tax burden is less progressive

than in the benchmark and shared more equally across all productivity levels.7
      Figure 4 shows the response of the incomplete markets model to the naive and extended
policies under this alternative tax regime. In this scenario forward guidance is more powerful in
incomplete markets models than in complete markets models. While the naive policy delivers
a larger output loss when markets are incomplete, the results when implementing the extended
policy are reversed. In the complete markets case output losses are basically avoided whereas
there are now even substantial output gains in the incomplete markets case, leading to the
conclusion that forward guidance is more powerful in incomplete than in complete markets
models when we use the alternative tax policy.
      To understand this result, Figure 5 shows demand CtIM,F G and supply HtIM,F G in the
incomplete markets model for the extended policy when using complete markets model prices,
income and the discount factor shock. Demand clearly exceeds supply so that the general
equilibrium adjustment process is correctly expected to lead to higher output in incomplete
markets in the extended policy case. Panel (a) of Figure 6 shows the demand of the three
income groups. Demand of income groups s1 and s2 increases more than the decline from s3 ,

      The population shares of groups s1 , s2 , s3 are (π1 , π2 , π3 ) = (0.25, 0.5, 0.25).

explaining the rise in aggregate demand. Correspondingly, panel (b) of Figure 6 shows the
income redistribution between the three income groups. The policy redistributes from group
s3 towards groups s1 and s2 , consistent with the sign of the demand of the three groups and,
since the s3 group has low MPC, also consistent with the aggregate demand response.
          The different conclusion about the power of forward guidance is due to the redistribution
induced by the changes in wages and real interest rates as shown in Figure 7 which in turn
are a result of policy. Now the drop in real interest rates (as a result of the policy) leads to a
redistribution of wealth towards low productivity households with high marginal propensities
to consume. Since all households are taxpayers, all households benefit from the tax reduction.
Therefore now all households benefit from lower taxes (due to lower real interest rates) and
all households suffer from lower asset income (due to lower real interest rates). To make our
point about the power of forward guidance, in this experiment we have chosen the tax policy
such that high productivity households lose and low productivity households gain. Due to the
higher MPC of low productivity households, aggregate demand increases.

We now quantitatively assess the effects of forward guidance using an enhanced model as in
Hagedorn et al. (2018).

We extend the basic model in Section 2 by incorporating rigid wages, nominal government
transfers, nominal government bonds and nominal taxes, and fixed costs paid by intermediate-
good firms.

4.1.1                Wage Setting

differentiated labor services, hit . These differentiated labor services are transformed by a rep-
resentative, competitive labor recruiting firm into an aggregate effective labor input, Ht , using
the following technology:

       The union sets a nominal wage Ŵt for an effective unit of labor (so that Wit = Ŵt ) to
maximize profits subject to wage adjustment costs modeled similarly to the price adjustment
costs in Rotemberg (1982). These adjustment costs are proportional to idiosyncratic produc-
tivity sit , are measured in units of aggregate output, and are given by a quadratic function of
                                                                                                         w

The wage adjustment process does not involve actual costs, but optimal choices are made is as-
if those costs were actually present. This is the same assumption as for the price adjustment
process, and for similar reasons: to avoid that wage adjustment costs become a non-trivial
fraction of output in the liquidity trap.
   8
   Equivalently Rone can think of a continuum of unions each setting the wage for a representative part of the
population with s = 1 at all times.


                                                                   24
4.1.2     Government

The government obtains revenue from taxing labor income and profits as well as issuing bonds.
Household labor income wsh is taxed progressively with a nominal lump-sum transfer T̃t and
a proportional tax τt :
                                  Tt (wt st ht ) = −T̃t + τt Pt wt st ht .

   Note that we slightly abuse the notation by using Tt to denote nominal taxes here whereas
it was denoting real taxes above. The government issues nominal bonds denoted by B g , with
negative values denoting government asset holdings and fully taxes profits away using a lump-
sum, and thus non-distortionary, profit tax and obtaining nominal revenue Pt dt . The govern-
ment uses the revenue to finance interest payments on bonds and transfers to households. The
government budget constraint is therefore given by:
                                                                 Z
                           g
                          Bt+1   = (1 +   it )Btg   − Pt d t −       Tt (wt st ht )dΩt .   (42)

4.1.3     Fixed Cost

Intermediate good firms have to pay a fixed cost Φ such that their equilibrium real profit is


                                          dt = Yt − wt Yt − Φ.

4.1.4     Equilibrium

The definition of a competitive equilibrium follows that from Section 2, with the following
modifications. In addition to previously listed conditions, we now require that wages are set
optimally by middlemen. The government budget constraint is now (42) and the market
clearing conditions now read:

        For all Ωt ∈ M:
                                                         Z

4.2    Calibration

To quantitatively assess the effects of forward guidance we now calibrate the model.


Preferences Households have separable preferences over labor and constant relative risk
aversion preferences for consumption. We set the risk-aversion parameter, σ, equal to 2. We
choose the discount factor, β, to target a quarterly risk-free rate of 50 BP. We assume the
functional form for g:

                                                      1
                                                 h1+ ϕ
                                        g(h) = ψ        .                                (43)
                                                 1 + ϕ1
We set the Frisch elasticity, ϕ = 0.5, following micro estimates. We choose ψ = 0.36 such that
in steady state h = 1.2 (we normalize earnings hw = 1).


Productivity Process We follow Krueger et al. (2016) who use data from the Panel Survey
of Income Dynamics to estimate a stochastic process for labor productivity. They estimate
that log income consists of a persistent and transitory component. They estimate that the
persistent shock has an annual persistence of 0.9695 and variance of innovations of 0.0384.
The transitory shock is estimated to have variance 0.0522. We follow Krueger et al. (2016)
in converting these annual estimates into a quarterly process. We discretize the persistent
shock into a seven state Markov chain using the Rouwenhorst method and integrate over the
transitory shock using Gauss-Hermite quadrature with three nodes.


Production Technology We choose the elasticity of substitution between intermediate
goods,  = 6, to match an average markup of 20%. The adjustment cost parameter on prices,
θ = 52, is chosen to match a slope of the NK Philips curve, /θ = 0.11 from MNS. We set
the firm operating cost Φ equal to 100% of the steady state markup such that steady state
profits equal 0% (Basu and Fernald (1997)). These profits are fully taxed and are distributed
to households as lump-sum transfers in the benchmark. We choose the same elasticity of
substitution between labor services as for intermediate goods  = w , to generate the same
markup. In addition, we choose the same adjustment cost parameter on wages as for prices
(θ = θw ) such that the slope of the wage Philips curve is also 0.11.

Government We set the proportional labor income tax, τ equal to 25%. We set debt to
annual GDP to 1.4. Residually, from the government budget constraint this implies that
transfers are approximately 22% of average income.


Monetary Policy For the benchmark specification we assume the same form of the Taylor
rule adopted by MNS. However, we set the coefficient on inflation to 0.5.


4.3    Results

To consider the effectiveness of forward guidance at the ZLB, we follow McKay et al. (2016)
and assume that the discount factor increases for a known number of periods and then reverts
back to its steady-state value, such that the ZLB binds for 8 quarters and generates an impact
output decline of 4% percent when monetary policy follows the naive policy.
   We consider the same two policy environments as in McKay et al. (2016). A naive policy
where monetary policy follows a Taylor rule and an extended - forward guidance - policy
where the nominal interest rate is kept at zero for 3 additional periods although the Taylor
rule already prescribes a positive value. As in MNS, we also assume perfect foresight.
   Figure 8 shows the induced distribution ∆i,0 in the first period 0 as a function of steady-

              i,0   and productivity si,0 .9 The left panel uses the complete markets prices
and incomes of the naive policy and the right panel uses the complete markets prices and
incomes of the extended policy. The distribution for the naive policy is as expected. The real
interest rate rises and the wage falls when the naive policy prices and income are used, so that
∆ is positive for asset-rich households and falls in productivity, but on net this results in a
redistribution towards low-MPC households. This suggests that the naive policy is even less
effective in our model than in the corresponding complete markets model.
       When using the complete markets extended policy prices and income, the real interest rate
decreases and the wage moves only little. These price movements are reflected in the shape of
∆ which falls in assets (since the real interest rate falls) and is basically flat in productivity
(since the real wage moves only little), which together results in a redistribution towards high-
MPC households. This suggests that forward guidance is more effective in our model than in
the corresponding complete markets model.
       While the distributional consequences are quite different in the two policy scenarios, they
are small for the extended policy and quite large for the naive policy, suggesting that the
deviations from the complete markets allocation can be substantial in our model. The deviation
is expected to be larger in the latter case since the distribution ∆ is larger in the latter case
because wages and real interest rates move more without forward guidance.
       This reasoning is, however, incomplete as it overlooks that we introduced two key differ-
ences in the quantitative model relative to the simpler one in Section 2: wages are sticky and
bonds are nominal. The comparison was based on complete markets prices which exhibited
large differences between the naive and the extended policies. In our quantitative incomplete
markets model this is not the case anymore. Figure 9 shows the results for output, infla-
tion, nominal and real interest rates and nominal and real wages, both for the naive and the
extended forward guidance policy. Clearly, the differences between the two policies are very
small.
       Our main finding is that forward guidance has only a very small impact on output and
inflation. On impact, output increases by 0.3% (from −4.1% to −3.8%), and inflation by 15
base points (from −2.16% to −2.01%).

Figure 8: Redistribution of Income ∆i,0 using Complete-Markets Prices for Naive/Extended
Policy


   There are two reasons for the much smaller effect of forward guidance in our incomplete
markets model than in the corresponding complete markets model. Both reasons are related
to the different response of prices - wages and real interest rates - in the two models. In our
model both prices respond very little as a result of forward guidance as shown in Figure 9
whereas there is a sizable response in the complete markets model considered by MNS as we
showed in Figure 7.
   First, wages respond little since wages are sticky (as opposed to flexible in the MNS). Since
wages move little, there is little redistribution of labor income. Furthermore, since productivity
is constant, the small movement in wages implies that dividends do not change much either.
As a result, there the redistribution induced by the change in dividends is small.
   Second, we find that the effect of forward guidance on real interest rates is small. This
has two consequences. First, small changes in real interest rates lead to small changes in the
intertemporal substitution behavior of households. Second, the small change in real interest
rates has only small effects on the government budget and thus on households’ tax burden.
As a result, the induced redistribution through taxes is small. Figure 10 shows that the
redistribution induced by forward guidance relative to the allocation resulting from the naive
policy in the first period is quite small. Naive policy allocations and equilibrium prices in
our incomoplete markets model are denoted by a superscript N P and the forward guidance

redistribution using non-equilibrium complete markets prices and allocations.
   Figure 10 shows that forward guidance has only a small effect on intertemporal substitution
and on redistribution and as a consequence only a small effect on aggregate consumption and
output. Thus, it is not a powerful monetary tool, even in a liquidity trap. It is important to
note that these findings are not driven by a general ineffectiveness of monetary policy in our
model environment. Contemporaneous changes in monetary policy can be quite potent even
when the economy starts off from being in steady state. But the contemporaneous effects of
future monetary policy changes are small. To illustrate this point we conduct the following
experiment. We lower the nominal interest by 50 base points to 0 for 4 quarters starting at
different times and leave the rate at its steady-state value in all other periods. We first consider
an immediate cut in rates from periods 1 − 4, then from periods 2 − 5, and so on until periods
33 − 36. For each of these different horizons of forward guidance we compute the current

5    Conclusions
Forward guidance, the communication of future policy actions, is a prominent tool of mon-
etary policy (Plosser, 2013). This is not surprising since it seems important to anchor the
expectations of the private sector about the future path of monetary policy as this matters
for example for investment, consumption and employment decisions. At this level the meaning
of forward guidance is just improved communication of present and future policy decisions.
During the Great Recession another aspect was added when forward guidance was discussed
as a means to avoid large output losses. It involved the commitment to keep future nominal
interest rates at zero although future economic conditions already ask for higher rates, for
example because the economy is recovering or inflation is picking up. In standard New Key-
nesian models such a commitment was found to be very effective in reducing or even avoiding
the initial output loss that would otherwise have occurred when the economy moved into a


                                                              32
liquidity trap (Carlstrom et al., 2015). The effects are so large and sometimes even counter-
intuitive that this finding was termed the “Forward Guidance Puzzle” since Del Negro et al.
(2012).
   The follow-up literature has addresses this puzzle along several dimensions. One approach,
most prominently taken by McKay et al. (2016) and Werning (2015), is to re-assess forward
guidance in incomplete markets models. Both these papers agree that forward guidance is
is likely to be an effective monetary tool but disagree about whether forward guidance is
different in complete and incomplete markets models. Whereas McKay et al. (2016) find
significant differences and forward guidance to be less effective in incomplete markets models,
Werning (2015) reaches the opposite conclusion that there is no difference.
   This paper makes two main contributions to this literature. First, we explain theoretically
and show quantitatively why the literature has reached opposite conclusions about the power
of forward guidance in complete and incomplete markets models. Our analysis shows that
the difference is due to different assumptions on the distribution of income, profits and tax
policies. For example, if forward guidance redistributes towards high marginal propensity to
consume (MPC) households then it is more effective in incomplete markets models as this
redistribution stimulates aggregate demand more than in does in complete markets models.
If on the other hand the redistribution is from high MPC households to low MPC households
then forward guidance is less effective in incomplete markets models as demand is depressed
relative to complete markets models.
   Our second contribution is to re-assess forward guidance in an empirically grounded quan-
titative model. We find that this policy is not an effective tool of monetary policy as promises
of future interest rates have only negligible effects on current output and employment. To
understand this result, recall that forward guidance operates through a distributional channel
and an intertemporal substitution channel. We find that both of these channels are not trig-
gered to an important extent by the forward guidance. Consider first the distributional effects.
We conduct our analysis in a model with a significant amount of individual heterogeneity in
income and wealth which resembles the extent of inequality in the data. The consequence is
a large heterogeneity in MPCs and that redistribution can have large demand effects. Thus
it is not the absence of redistribution channels which explains our findings, but the lack of
the redistribution induced by forward guidance. First, with the empirically relevant degree of

                                              33
wage rigidities, wages move relatively little, implying only minor redistribution across workers
with different productivity levels. Relatively stable wages imply that firms’ profits are also
stable so there is only little redistribution across individuals with heterogeneous asset hold-
ings through movements in dividends. Moreover, the theoretical arguments in Hagedorn (2016,
2018) suggest that the effects of forward guidance on the real interest rates are dampened in
an incomplete markets model. Our quantitative analysis reveals that the dampening is very
substantial so that real interest rates move only very little. This implies little redistribution
through the tax and transfer system as there is only a small impact on the government budget.
Taken together, these findings imply little overall redistribution and little effect on aggregate
demand coming through distributional channels. This leaves only the intertemporal substitu-
tion channel through which forward guidance can have significant economic effects. But this
channel is also not triggered in our incomplete markets model because we find forward guid-
ance to have only small effects on real interest rates. Thus, forward guidance does not appear
to be an effective monetary policy tool, even in a liquidity trap.
