Does the yield curve's ability to predict future output and recessions differ when interest rates are
low, as in the current global environment? In this paper we build on recent econometric work by
Shi, Phillips and Hurn that detects changes in the causal impact of the yield curve and relate that
to the level of interest rates. We explore the issue using historical data going back to the 19th
century for the US and more recent data for the UK, Germany, and Japan. This paper is similar in
spirit to Ramey and Zubairy (2018) who look at the government spending multiplier in times of
low interest rates.

                                         I.   Introduction

  Does the yield curve's ability to predict future output and recessions differ when
interest rates are low, as in the current global environment? Despite a variety of
work that examines the predictive content of the yield spread accounting for the
level of rates (Ang, Piazzesi, and Wei, 2006), monetary policy (Cooper, Fuhrer,
and Olivei, 2020) and the persistence of inflation (Benati and Goodhart, 2008)
this question remains open. The question recently arose again as the yield curve
inverted in the late summer and early fall of 2019. As it turns out, this inversion
did foreshadow a recession in 2020, though some may think that the advent of
COVID-19 made this example a coincidence; so perhaps the question remains
open after all. In fact, the monetary policy response to the pandemic makes the
question particularly relevant, with expectations of an extended period of rates
at the effective lower bound, quantitative easing, and suggestions that yield curve
control--the direct targetting of longer rates--could be used as a pollicy tool
(Belz and Wessel, 2020). In this paper we build on recent econometric work that

detects changes in the causal impact of the yield curve and relate that to the level
of interest rates. We explore the issue using several historical data sets going back
to the 19th century for the US and more recent data for the UK, Germany, and
Japan. Though using very different techniques and asking different questions,
this paper is similar in spirit to Ramey and Zubairy (2018) who look at the
government spending multiplier in times of low interest rates.
  In our data set, the US has had two extended periods of low interest rates: in
the 1930s and 1940s, and in the years during and following the Great Recession.
These episodes stand out in Figure 1, which plots the two short rates we use, the
commercial paper rate and the target fed funds rate. Ramey and Zubairy (2018)
look for episodes when interest rates are near the zero lower bound or times of
"extended monetary accomodation," which they define as either very low rates
or when rates "stay constant rather than follow the Taylor rule." They find that
this happens in two periods: 1932Q2­1951Q1 and 2008Q4­2015Q4. We compare
the predictive content of the yield curve in and out of these low rate periods,
and although the exact results depend on the time period and data set used, in
general the yield curve shows predictive power even in low rate environments.

                            II.    Testing for predictive content

  An old stylized fact in economics is that the yield curve helps to predict future
economic growth (Kessel 1965, Harvey 1988, and Estrella and Hardouvelis 1991
are early important papers in this area), but in recent decades, the evidence has
become quite strong that the predictive content of the yield curve changes over
time (Haubrich and Dombrosky 1996, Dotsey 1998). Exactly why the predictive
content changes is unclear, in part because the mechanism behind the predictive
ability has remained elusive despite some interesting attempts to understand it
(Rendu de Lint and Stolin 2003, Kurman and Otrok 2013). Bordo and Haubrich
(2008a,b) have suggested that the monetary regime may play a role, Giacomini
and Rossi (2006) provide evidence that changes in monetary policy have led to
breakdowns in predictive accuracy, and Benati and Goodhart (2008) show that
changing inflation persistence is important. The recent concern about low inter-
est rates fits into this tradition, but in one sense is rather surprising, as many of
the earliest papers explicitly account for the impact of short-term interest rates:
Estrella and Hardouvelis (1991) find the yield curve still has power even when
adding the federal funds rate or the 3-month Treasury rate. Plosser and Rowuen-
horst (1994) find that the slope of the term structure has information beyond
short-term rates. Ang, Piazzesi, and Wei (2006) find that the predictive content
of the spread resides in the short rate, but Bordo and Haubrich (2008b) add in
a short rate separately and find that the yield curve still matters. Timing the
changes in yield curve behavior has been difficult, however, making it hard to
align with regime shifts, low interest rates, or other factors. Recently, however,
Shi, Phillips and Hurn (2018) have developed a sophisticated recursive method for
testing when the yield curve has predictive content, using Wald tests for Granger
(1969) causality in a VAR, and this provides a more precise standard to compare
with macroeconomic events and regimes.

                                     A.    The SPH technique

   Shi, Phillips, and Hurn propose a new time-varying Granger causality test, in
which they estimate a vector autoregression (VAR)1 on a window that moves
through the data set. The test can identify multiple breaks between periods with
and without Granger Causality. The major contribution, of course, is developing
a time-varying test with good statistical properties, but they also compare three
different types of window: an increasing window, a rolling window, and a rolling
recursive window. The rolling window has the best statistical properties, so that
is the one we use. We compute the test statistics and critical values by adapting
the Matlab program for the paper provided by Shi. The rolling window size
suggested by Shi, Phillips, and Hurn, is 20 percent of the data set, and we follow
their advice.

4                                                 .


  SPH describe the test as a sup-Wald test, as it looks at the distribution of the
supremum (least upper bound) of the Wald test on the evolving window. The
Wald (1943) test is a standard test of the restrictions on the VAR coefficients, the
square of the regression coefficient divided by the estimated variance. In this case,
the test involves setting some coefficients to zero under the null hypothesis of no
Granger causality. The econometric difficulty is judging when the Wald statistic is
large enough to detect changes in Granger causality over time--interested readers
should consult the SPH paper for details.2 We use the fact that Phillips has
produced a test and calculated the 5 percent error levels that allow us to estimate
when the Granger causality switches on and off.
  Shi, Phillips and Hurn compare three different windows. The forward expanding
window, championed by Thoma (1984) (though he calls it a rolling window),
expands the window by adding successive observations, making the window larger
as later observations are included. The rolling window, used by Swanson (1998),
keeps the window the same size by dropping observations at the beginning as later
observations are added (hence the term rolling). Shi, Phillips, and Hurn also
propose a rather complicated recursive evolving window, but their simulations
show that the rolling window has the best properties in the sense of having the
highest successful detection probablity, and being more accurate in assigning a
switch-off date for the causality. In addition, though the rolling window has a
somewhat higher false detection proportion, the difference is negligible when the
sample size reaches 200, a bound our sample easily exceeds (and the successful
detection proportion (SDP) further improves with sample size).

                                             B.       Data

  Shi, Phillips and Hurn test for Granger causality of the yield spread on ag-
gregate output. They use a four-variable VAR with data at both quarterly and
monthly frequencies. The SPH paper uses data from 1980, but in fact, their data
set extends back to 1957 (Q1, or January), and, with our interest in historical
regimes, we use the longer series and extend it out to 2019 (Q1 for quarterly
and August for monthly data). For quarterly data, the four variables used in
the VAR are the real GDP gap (actual real GDP minus real potential from the
CBO), inflation calculated as the log difference of core CPI (mulitplied by 400
for quarterly data), the effective fed funds rate, and the difference between the
secondary market 3-month T-bill rate and 10-year government bond yield (Long-
Term Government Bond Yields: 10-year: Main (Including Benchmark) for the
United States from the OECD), with the immediate source of all variables being
the FRED database at the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank. As an alternative,
we also look at the year-over-year growth in real GDP. The monthly data use the

   2 Rossi (2005, 2013) has developed similar tests that Shi, Phillips, and Hurn argue have trouble
identifying breaks near the end of the sample. With our concern about the recent content of the yield
curve, we prefer the SPH approach.
VOL.   NO.                    LOW RATES AND THE YIELD CURVE                         5


annual growth rate of industrial production (IP) and multiplies the monthly log
difference in core CPI by 1200.
  To apply this procedure to historical data, we apply the analysis to a subset
of the quarterly data set of Balke and Gordon (1986), which covers 1875-1983
extended with the data from Ramey and Zubairy (2018), which brings the data
up to 1998. The current constraint is that 1998 is when the series for six-month
commerical paper stops. To follow Shi, Phillips and Hurn as closely as possible,
we use a gap measure (real GNP less trend real GNP), inflation from the GNP
deflator (quarterly log differences times 400), the commercial paper rate as a
short-term interest rate substituting for the policy rate (prior to the Federal
Reserve System, there was no official policy rate, and even using the discount
rate in the early years of the System has its difficulties), and the corporate bond-
commercial paper spread from Balke and Gordon as the term spead.
  Looking at early data provides a richer set of monetary regimes, including the
gold standard and a time without a central bank, but it also presents challenges.
Chief among these is that a risk-free Treasury yield curve is not reliably avail-
able, both because Treasury bills did not become standard until the 1920s, and
because it was not obvious that even longer-term Treasuries were the risk-free
benchmark--for most of the 19th century, railroad bonds had at least as great
a claim. Following Balke and Gordon, we use the spread between the yields on
corporate bonds and the commercial paper rate. Though neither yield is risk
free, it is hoped that their risk premiums will be roughly comparable; for more
discussion see Bordo and Haubrich (2008a). Figure 2 plots both spreads, and for
the quarter century in which they overlap, the correlation between them is 92
percent. Over this period there is not an obvious interest rate that can count as
the monetary policy rate; indeed, for much of the period, the United States did
not have a central bank. We use the short rate as a rough equivalent, as a proxy
for the stance of conditions in the money market. Using one short rate as both
the "policy" rate and in the yield spread is a departure from Shi, Phillips, and
Hurn, but the high correlation between policy rates and short-term rates in the
money market makes us confident that the problem is not large.
  For periods of low rates, we use the definition of Ramey-Zubairy (2018), 1932:Q2
to 1951:Q1 and 2008:Q4 to 2015:Q4, translated for monthly data as 1932 April
to 1951 March, and 2008 October to 2015 December. Our monthly data continue
until August 2019, but the FOMC increased the lower bound of the target federal
funds range above zero on December 16, 2015, so we judge the Ramey-Zubairy
ending date as appropriate. The US experience with yield curve control lasted
from 1942 to 1951, with caps on Treasury bills ending in July 1947 and caps on
longer rates expiring with the Treasury-Fed Accord of February 1951 (Garbade,
2020). Thus the yield curve control period is contained in the period of low rates,
and we cannot distinguish between their effects.
  Again, as an alternative, we use year-over-year growth in real GNP.
  It is also possible to form a long series of monthly data, although at this point we

have not been able to extend it up to the present. Monthly industrial production
data begin in 1919, and that forms the start of our data. For the short rate
and the policy rate, we use the discount rate from the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York, available since 1914. Before the New Deal reforms, discount rates at
Federal Reserve district banks varied, but New York, as the financial center of the
nation, is the most obvious single rate to choose. This series continues up until
January of 2003, when the adjustment credit program, which was extended at a
below market rate, was replaced by the primary credit program, whose rate was
set above the federal funds rate. This was not a change in the stance of monetary
policy, but rather in the administration of the discount window. For long rates
we use long-term Treasury bonds, putting together several surprisingly consistent
series. Finally, for inflation we use the NSA CPI, again available back to 1919.
This gives a near-century of monthly data, from 1919 to 2003.
   Figure 1 plots the two short rates used: the commercial paper rate and the tar-
get fed funds rate. Two periods of exceptionally low rates stand out: the 1930s and
1940s, and the recent post-crisis period. The short rate appears to have greater
high-frequency volatility in the pre-war years, but greater low-frequency volatil-
ity in the post-war years. Figure 3 plots the inflation rate, which is measured by
the deflator in the early days and the core CPI in the later days. Although the
measures differ, they track closely. Notice that pre-World War II, inflation was
more variable, and deflation was not uncommon. Four periods with low inflation
or deflation stand out. The years 1879 to 1897 mark the period from the resump-
tion of the gold standard until the inflation created by the massive gold strikes in
South Africa, Alaska, and Colorado. It is one of the periods of "good deflation"

as defined by Bordo, Redish and Landon Lane (2009), where output increased
despite prices falling, as the gold standard provided a nominal anchor. The years
1921 to 1937 stretched from the Federal Reserve's discovery of the scissors effect
of open market operations until the recovery from the Great Depression started
in 1937. These years encompassed most of the interwar period, where the anchor
of the gold standard operations led to the bad deflation associated with the Great
Depression. The years 1951 to 1967 mark the period from the Treasury-Fed Ac-
cord to the advent of the Great Inflation in 1968, when the Bretton Woods system
still provided a link to gold. And lastly, the period from the mid-1990s to the
present saw the Great Moderation, where the anchor was not the gold standard
but the credibility of the fiat regime under Alan Greenspan. It was followed by
the financial crisis of 2008 and its aftermath.

  This section applies the SPH sup-Wald test to several data sets to find periods
of causality between the yield curve and different measures of aggregate output.
It then checks for a relationship between such causality and the interest rate
environment, classifying periods as either showing Granger causality or not, or
having low interest rates or not, and assesses significance on the classification by
a simple 2 test on a contingency table.

                                   A.   Recent data

  For the recent period 1957-2019 we apply the heteroskedastic version of the
sup-Wald test with a rolling window, looking for periods where the term spread
Granger causes the real GDP gap, year-over-year real GDP growth, or industrial
production. In choosing the window size, we again follow SPH, and set the
fraction of the sample used for the rolling window, f0 to 0.2, which means that in
the recent quarterly data set, the window is set at 0.2x249=50 quarters, or just
over 12 years. For the monthly data the same fraction is used, giving a window
of 150 months or again a little over 12 years.
  First, consider the results for the quarterly data. Figure 4 shows the changing
causality from the spread to the real GDP gap, over the years 1957 Q1-2019
Q1. Since the size of the window is 50 quarters, the statistic starts only in
1969. The figure shows the test statistic sequence, the 5 percent critical value,
NBER recessions, and yield curve inversions (vertical lines). The statistic achieves
significance in 1969 Q1 to 1970 Q2, and in 1981 Q1-Q3,with the numbers getting
close in 2001.

                       Figure 4. Spread to Gap, SPH data



  The test statistic using year-over-year real GDP growth, shown in Figure 5,
shows a similar pattern to the gap series, but it has seveal additional detected
periods of causation. In addition to 1969 Q4­1970 Q1 and 1980 Q4­1981 Q4,
which correspond closely to dates in the gap series, it finds Granger causality in
2007 Q1 and 2010 Q4 to 2011 Q3. There are also a few close calls in the mid-1990s
and mid-2000s. Table 1 lists the periods of Granger causality for the quarterly

data.
  The monthly data, shown in figures 6 and 7 provides a somewhat different
perspective. Using monthly (annualized) industrial production numbers there
are more periods of causality: monthly growth from May to November of 1981,
September of 1998, and a variety of months between 2012 and 2019. The year-
over-year growth numbers show causality as early as May 1976 and show a variety
of other months, particularly in the mid- to late-2000s. Table 3 provides the de-
tails. Unlike the quarterly results, it does not find causality around 1969 (though
the test statistic is a bit elevated then), but like them it finds significance around
the double-dip recession of 1980-81, around 2005-6, and after the financial crisis,
which the quarterly approaches split on.

   If we consider the Ramey and Zubairy periods of extended monetary accom-
modations or zero lower bounds, we in general do not find overlap with periods
of causality, except briefly for the case of industrial production in 2012 and 2013.
In fact, periods exhibiting Granger causality from the yield curve to output are
rather sporadic. The situation is a bit different if we consider periods of low in-
flation, as there are periods of causality in the mid-to-late 1990s, the 2000s, and
post-crisis.
   We can, in fact, address the issue of connection between causality and low
rate environments more formally. A given time period (month or quarter) can
be classified in two ways: whether it is in a period where the yield curve shows
causality to output or not, and whether it is in a period of extended monetary
accommodation (according to Ramey and Zubairy) or not. This naturally leads
to a 2x2 contingency table and a 2 test for independence. Table 2 panel A
reports the results for the GDP gap for the 1957-2019 quarterly sample. The 2
is insignificant, suggesting independence, or that periods where the yield curve
Granger causes output are independent of the degree of monetary accommodation.
An alternative way to view the results is Cramer's V statistic, which can be
thought of as a measure of correlation between categorical variables, as it takes
on values between 0 and 1. For the gap, it measures 0.07. Causality is rare
whatever the interest rate environment. There is a bit more causality in the
Ramey-Zubairy low rate periods using year-over-year real GDP growth, where
10                                       .


the 2 = 3.56, p = 0.965, and a Cramer's V of 0.134. Those results for year-over-
year growth are reported in panel B. Standard statistical practice (McDonald,
2014) suggests that the 2 will be inaccurate and overstate significance if any
expected entries of the table are less than 5 or the total sample less than 1000.
Since both conditions obtain in many of our tables, we also report two exact tests,
Barnard's and Boschloo's, to correct for this. They show results similar to the
2 .

   The results are quite different for the monthly industrial production data, re-
ported in Tables 3 and 4, where there is a more substantial overlap between
periods of causality and of excessive monetary accommodation. There, indepen-
dence is rejected at a significant level, with a 2 value (df=13) of 25.4, p = 0.020.
Cramer's V, a measure of correlation for contingency tables, comes in at 0.206,
showing some correlation between low rate periods and causality periods. Using
year-over-year growth also rejects independence: here, there are substantial peri-
ods of causality in both low and high interest rate environments. The 2 statistic
is 24.0, with a p-value of 0.031 and a Cramer's V of 0.201.

                             B.   Results for older data


  The longer quarterly series, 1875-1998, shows both interesting parallels and
differences. Table 5 lists these periods of Granger causality from the yield spread
to the output gap and RGDP growth. Figure 8 shows the results for the gap and
Figure 9 shows the corresponding results for year-over-year real growth (GNP
until 1983, GDP from 1984 to 1998). Both charts show an extended period of
Granger causality from the late 1930s to the middle 1950s, with shorter episodes
at the start of World War I and in the 1970s. Note that causality occurs despite
there being no full-fledged yield curve inversions (with this spread measure) in the
Ramey-Zubairy period of low rates. Recall that the initial window of 20 percent
of the data set works out to 24 years, so unfortunately we cannot address the
causality of periods in the 1800s. Likewise, the data set ends in 1997, and so
consideration of the Great Recession period is also precluded.

  Using the output gap results in a fair number of episodes of Granger causality
from the spread. The test statistic exceeds the 5 percent bound in 1903, in 1914
­1915 Q1, a long period from 1938 to 1956, and again from 1977 to 1979. If
instead of the gap, we use year-over-year real GNP growth, there are intriguing
similarities and differences. Figure 9 shows shorter causality episodes in 1914,
1915, and 1916, again in 1921, and a long episode from 1938 to 1954, followed by
a short episode in 1955 and two brief episodes in 1975 and 1976.

   Note that the most extensive period of causality, 1938:Q4 to 1956:Q2, overlaps
extensively with the period of extended monetary accommodation of Ramey and
Zubairy, 1932:Q2 -1951:Q1. The long period of causality showing up in both
output series, from 1938 to the mid-1950s, also overlaps with the low inflation
environment of the 1950s. Again we can test for independence between the mon-
etary regime and yield curve causality, and Table 6 reports the contingency table
for the 1876-1998 data. In contrast to the shorter data set, in this case inde-
pendence is decisively rejected, and it appears that periods of causality are more
likely in a time of monetary accomomdation. The correlation from Cramer's V is
0.67 for the data using the gap as a measure, and 0.54 for year-over-year growth.

   The longer monthly data set provides a near-century of monthly data, from 1919
to 2003. As before, 20 percent of the sample (in this case seventeen years) are held
out at the beginning to initiate the rolling window, so the results do not begin
until 1938. Figure 10 shows the results using year-over-year growth in industrial
production, and Figure 11 shows the results using month-to-month growth. Both
figures show causality from the yield curve to output at the end of the sample,
with that for year-over-year IP growth starting around 1990 and month-to-month
growth starting a decade earlier. As seen in Table 7 there are some earlier periods
of causality, particularly in the late 1950s and late 1960s. In contrast to the
quarterly output results, there is scant causality indicated from the late 1930s
through the mid-1950s. Thus, there is little, in fact, no, overlap with either the
Ramey-Zubairy period of extended monetary accommodation or with periods of
low inflation: recall their early period ends in 1951. In contrast to some of the
quarterly results, the 2 tests reported in Table 8 suggest, if anything, a negative
correlation between low rates and causality: 2 = 173.3, df = 13, p = 3.9x10-30
for the monthly IP changes, and 2 = 91.5, df = 13, p = 7.1x10-14 . In contrast to
the previous results, this indicates that the yield curve has less predictive content
in low rate environments.

                               IV.   Other countries

   Other developed countries have also had periods of low interest rates and low
inflation under different monetary regimes, and we look at those cases as addi-
tional sources of information. We look at the UK, Germany, and Japan. The
UK has the financial system most similar to the US, and Germany and the UK
were the two European countries where the yield curve showed predictive power
in Chinn and Kucko (2015). Any discussion of low inflation and low interest rate
environments must include Japan, for which there is also some evidence that the
yield curve has predictive content (Nakaota and Fukuta, 2013). We take monetary
regimes for these countries based on Benati (2008).
   The UK adopted an inflation target in October of 1992, and inflation, which
had been persistent (both under Bretton Woods and after) nearly became white
noise, at least until the finanical crisis (Benati 2008). Since then inflation ap-
pears to fluctuate around a slowly moving trend that has varied from above 3
percent to below 1 percent over the period (Forbes, Kirkham and Theodoridis,
2017). Germany, the poster child of a hard money low inflation regime, also saw
a decrease in inflation persistence with reunification in 1990, though it was less
dramatic (Benati 2008). Since the financial crisis, trend inflation has fallen, but
the persistence has risen (Ciccarelli and Osbat 2017). Japan, despite having quite
low levels of inflation, displayed quite high levels of inflation persistence, with in-
flation looking quite similar to a random walk (Benati 2008). Okimoto (2018)

                 Figure 7. Spread to IP Growth (YOY), SPH data



finds a regime of extremely low interest rates from 1995 to 2012 where inflation
was steady but negative, followed by an inflation targeting regime since 2012 with
low but positive inflation. Japan also instituted a form of yield curve control in
September 2016. Figures 12, 13, and 14 show inflation and the monetary policy
rate for the UK, Germany, and Japan.
   While the UK has consistent series for the policy rate and a long-term interest
rate going back to the 17th century, consistent prices and industrial production
are more difficult to obtain, with monthly industrial production in a continuous
series going back to 1946 and the retail price index, extending back only to 1948.
For Germany, the main data constraints are again IP and prices, which both start
in 1960. For Japan, the consistent series also start in 1960, though data for yields
and recessions go back somewhat further. Figure 15 shows the test statistic for
the UK, Figure 16 shows Germany, and Figure 17 shows Japan. Table 9 lists the
periods of Granger causality for the UK, Germany, and Japan.
   These are monthly series, so for the UK, the data runs from 1948-2017 for
824 monthly observations; with the standard 0.2 fraction for the rolling window,
the rolling window is just over 13 years and the figure starts in 1961. The test
exceeds the critical value only in 2013-2015, but comes close in 2006 and in 1988.
In Germany and Japan, where the data start in 1960, the post-window period
starts in 1971. In Germany, the test statistic shows causality for most months
after mid-2016, but nothing before. Japan has many periods of causality from the
1970s through the 2000s, but they end in the early years of the Great Recession.

  To look for overlap with periods of low interest rates, we look for periods where
the monetary policy rate was half a percent (0.5 percent) or less. For the UK,
this was from April until January 2017, for Germany it was from May 2013 to
June 2018, and for Japan, from October 1995 until January 2007, and again
from November 2008 to July 2018 (in all three cases, to the end of our data set).
Table 10 reports the contingency table for the overlap and the associated 2 value
and Cramer's V statistic. The UK and Germany strongly reject independence of
Granger causality and low rates, not suprisingly because evidence of causality only
shows up in the recent low rate environment. Japan shows many more episodes
of causality, in periods of moderate and low rates, and independence cannot be
rejected.
  Table 11 lists the start of recessions (as determined by the ECRI) in the UK,
Germany, and Japan and associated yield curve inversions.

                                 V.   Conclusion

  Although it wasn't our main objective, this work confirms that the predictive
content of the yield curve varies over time, across countries, and even across data
sets. More importantly, in many episodes of low interest rates, whether by our
informal definition or that of others, such as Ramey and Zubairy's, the yield curve
has predictive power. While the results depend on the exact time period, interest
rate and output measure, it also appears that causality from the yield curve to
output is in fact more likely in low interest rate environments. The initial draft
of this paper was written before the COVID-19 outbreak, and it was a matter of
some concern whether the inversion in the summer of 2019 presaged a recession;
although a recession did occur, the question remains of whether the conjunction

is just a coincidence.
   Our results raise as many questions as they answer: If the level of rates matters,
does it matter why rates are low, whether inflation expectations are anchored
under a gold standard or a price level target, are explicitly pegged, or held down
by forward guidance or quantitative easing? Do aspects of inflation matter­such
as persistence? What is the economic mechanism that lies behind the observed
Granger causality in times of very different monetary policy? These are questions
for another day, though perhaps our results can contribute to the answers.

     2) Real GNP. Use BG till 83. Take natural logs to get YOY growth. From 83
        on, use the Ramey RGDP data, taking logs to get YOY growth. Specifically,
        the 1984 growth should use the Ramey 83 data. The reason is that the
        growth rates of the two series match pretty well, even if the levels dont, and
        in this way we avoid the jump when the series splice together.
     3) Gap: Same thing. Take ln(rgdp)ln(T rend) from BG as long as you can,
        and then ln(rgdp) - ln(rgdpp ott6).
     4) Inflation, again use the deflator from BG till 83, then use Ramey (again
        YOY log diffs), again using Ramey 83 levels to compute 84 growth.
At this point, the constraint is the six-month commercial paper rate, which ends
in 1998.
  We produce an "early" monthly data set as follows.
     1) Industrial production is monthly since January 1919, from FRED.
     2) CPI, not seasonally adjusted, from FRED, since 1913.
     3) For the policy rate (alternatively the short-term interest rate) we use the
        discount rate at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Prior to the New
        Deal reforms, discount rates were not uniform across the districts, but New

       York, as the financial center, has a certain priority (even post-New Deal
       reforms, there are occasional brief differences between district banks). This
       is available from November 1914 until 1969:7 from the St. Louis FRED
       database, series M13009USM156NNBR, and then the general discount rate
       from FRED until January of 2003:1, when the adjustment credit program,
       which was extended at a below market rate, was replaced by the primary
       credit program, whose rate was set above the federal funds rate. This was
       not a change in the stance of monetary policy, but rather in the adminis-
       tration of the discount window.
  4) For the long interest rate, we start with the Yield on Long-Term United
     States Bonds, from the NBER Macro History Database, m13033a start-
     ing in January 1919. Starting in December 1935 this is replaced with the
     COMPOSITE YIELD ON U.S. TREASURY BONDS WITH MATURITY
     OVER TEN-YEARS from the Federal H-15 discontinued series. For the
     months between January 1925 and November 1935, the NBER and H15
     rates match exactly, but diverge somewhat after that. That series ends in
     June of 2000 (2000:6) and we continue with the 10-year Treasury constant
     maturity rate, which has a correlation of 0.988 over the period during which
     both series exist (April 1953 to June 2000).
The intersection of available dates gives us a data set running from January 1919
to January 2003. at 84 years, this is substantially longer than the 58 years that

   Policy rate the CB rate from the UK from the GFD data. In 1948 the data are
monthly, but in September 1968 it changes to daily, so for the recent data use a

   Yield curve: 10-year rate minus 3-month rate, from the GFD data. The 3-
month rate turns weekly in May of 1973, and then daily in January of 1975. So
again take monthly averages. 10-year yields are already daily as of 1948. So again
take monthly averages. Recession from ECRI (2020).
