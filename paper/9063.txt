                                              ABSTRACT

        We construct linear projections of macro variables conditional on hypothetical paths of monetary
policy, using as an example an identified VAR model. Hypothetical policies are restricted to ones where
both the policy intervention and its impacts are consistent with history -- otherwise the linear projections
are likely to be unreliable. We use the approach to interpret Federal Reserve decisions, modeling their
frequent reassessment in light of new information about the tradeoffs policymakers face. The
interventions we consider matter: they can shift projected paths and probability distributions of macro
variables in economically meaningful ways.

                    Empirical Analysis of Policy Interventions

                                    Eric M. Leeper and Tao Zha*




1.      Introduction
     This paper offers a framework for interpreting the kinds of policy choices that central banks
make at regular policy meetings. The approach is positive, adopting the perspective of an
outside observer—the econometrician—to (i) address counterfactual questions with linear
projections of macro variables conditional on exogenous policy interventions; (ii) assess how
reliable linear projections are likely to be for a given intervention; (iii) account for uncertainty
about model parameters and realizations of shocks over the forecast horizon. The framework is
suited to consider interventions that would not be construed as changes in policy behavior that
bring forth systematic changes in private decision rules.
     Our approach differs from two dominant approaches to counterfactual policy evaluation—the
rational expectations program that Lucas and Sargent (1981) laid out and the reduced-form
forecasting approach that Doan, Litterman and Sims (1984) developed. The rational
expectations program identifies the mapping from policy behavior to private expectations and
decision rules to evaluate the impacts of adopting a new policy process. This paper does not
address questions associated with changing the policy process. Instead, it analyses policy
choices that are made sequentially and that are not wholly different from past choices.
     Doan, Litterman and Sims (1984) use forecasting models to project the effects of alternative
sequences of policy variables, taking private expectations and decision rules as given by history.
Their approach is designed to address routine policy interventions. Like us, they argue that if the
interventions do not constitute regime changes, then linear projections are likely to be reliable.

helpful suggestions and Marty Eichenbaum for detailed comments. The views expressed herein
are not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta or the Federal Reserve System.
Unlike us, Doan, Litterman and Sims focus on reduced-form forecasting models in which
monetary policy behavior is not identified. We extend Doan, Litterman and Sims’s methods to
environments in which policy behavior is identified, so exogenous variation in policy is
separated from systematic responses of policy to the economy. Identification allows us to check
whether the hypothetical policies we consider are consistent with linear projections, which hold
estimated private decision rules fixed over the projection period.
      We emphasize the reliability of linear projections because we interpret Lucas’s (1976)
critique as pointing toward a source of nonlinearity that may be important in practice.1 When
policy interventions create sustained dynamic patterns of change in policy variables, agents may
grow to believe policy regime has shifted and adjust their expectations and decision rules
accordingly. Learning dynamics can produce smoothly evolving private decision rules that
undermine the accuracy of linear projections: a model that is linear if regime is fixed, becomes
nonlinear, with the nonlinearity produced by the economic behavior that Lucas emphasizes.
Linear projections will remain reliable, however, if the interventions and their effects remain in
line with historical fluctuations.2
      An outgrowth of identifying policy behavior is the decomposition of policy choice into two
components: a deterministic function of observable variables and an exogenous random variable.
All empirical work on policy performs a similar decomposition—work ranging from Taylor’s
(1993) simple rules to Romer and Romer’s (1989) dummy variables to Fair’s (1984)
simultaneous equations, as well as identified VARs. The presence of a random exogenous term
in the policy rule implies that private agents put probability mass on more than one policy action,
even though their best estimate of the action is uniquely dictated by the deterministic part of the
rule. This leaves room for counterfactual policy analysis even in a linear model. It takes the
form of contemplating alternative interventions that a priori agents think could occur; and if
those actions are taken, agents are not shocked into thinking the underlying policy process has
changed. We show that the impacts of this class of interventions can be reliably projected using
a linear model. And these interventions matter: they can shift the projected paths and probability
distributions of macro variables in economically meaningful ways. How much they matter

    Sims (1998) puts forth this interpretation of the Lucas critique.

    Leeper and Zha (2001b) explore these points in a theoretical model.

                                                  2
depends on both the nature of the intervention and the elasticities of private behavior with
respect to policy.
     The efficacy of our approach hinges on whether it can be applied without implying policy
choices that would force the economy into a new policy regime. We offer some statistical
guards against this. We compute an ex-ante metric for assessing whether a contemplated
intervention is consistent with the prevailing policy regime. The metric is designed to flag any
hypothetical intervention that would trigger a change in private agents’ beliefs about the policy
process, shift their decision rules, and undermine the linear projections. By that metric we find
that many interventions the Federal Reserve actually considers fall within the prevailing regime.
We also compute an ex-post version of the metric, which reports whether the choices actually
taken affected macro variables in ways that are consistent with historical effects.
     We illustrate the approach in a small model of the U.S. economy that identifies monetary
policy behavior. We assess the estimated model’s in-sample and out-of-sample fits, examine the
model’s stability, and evaluate the model’s suitability for the policy questions we put to it.
     We focus on two recent episodes. The first episode is the 1990-1991 recession, which was a
time of aggressive easing of policy and one in which the Fed perceived that it faced difficult
tradeoffs between inflation and real activity. The analysis offers a probabilistic ex-ante
assessment of the tradeoffs, conditional on alternative policy actions. The second episode is the
Fed’s 1994 “pre-emptive strike” against inflation, during which the federal funds rate increased
300 basis points in a year. Sequential forecasts from the model suggest that the incremental
increases in the funds rate that occurred through the year are a natural outcome when policy
choices are reappraised in light of new information arriving in early 1994. The analysis shows
how uncertainty about future exogenous disturbances leads to conservative policymaking, as
Brainard (1967) advocates, and it formalizes Blinder (1997) description of how central banks
reappraise their policy decisions.

2.      An Econometric Framework for Policy Analysis
     This section specifies and estimates a small structural model of American monetary policy
behavior. The model’s fit, stability, and suitability for policy analysis are scrutinized. The
section also reports the model’s impulse response functions, which underlie the conditional
policy projections reported below, and develops a metric for assessing policy interventions.


                                                  3
2.1      The Model
      Actual policy behavior is a complicated function of a high-dimensional vector of variables.
Policymakers choose Rt , the vector of policy choices at date t, as a function of their information

set, Ωt . Actual policy behavior is a function g such that

                                              Rt = g ( Ωt ) .                                      (1)

(1) describes historical policy behavior.
      We assume that private agents are not privy to the details of the policymakers’ decision
problems, including the policymakers’ incentives and constraints. That is, they observe the
information set St ⊂ Ωt . Agents perceive that policy is composed of a regular response to the

state of the economy that they observe at time t, St , and a random part, ε Pt . The econometric
model of policy is:
                                            Rt = f ( St ) + ε Pt .                                 (2)

We take f to be linear. ε Pt is exogenous to the econometric model. A policy regime is a choice

of g , which implies an f and a stochastic process for ε P .3

      The econometric model embeds the policy behavior in (2) in a system of equations. If yt is

an ( m ×1) vector of time series, the structural form is
                                              p

                                             ∑A y
                                             s =0
                                                    s   t −s   = εt ,                              (3)

where ε t is a vector of i.i.d. structural disturbances that are exogenous to the model. Those

disturbances hit both nonpolicy and policy sectors of the economy, so
                                                     ε 
                                               ε t =  Nt  ,                                      (4)
                                                     ε Pt 
where ε Nt is the vector of nonpolicy disturbances.

      Counterfactual policy questions are addressed using the structure in (3) to project y
conditional on hypothesized paths for ε P , as Marschak (1953) and the Cowles Commission

  It is beyond the scope of this paper to rationalize randomness in policy behavior. See Sims
(1987) for one detailed rationale and Leeper, Sims and Zha (1996) for further discussion.

instructed. We impose that ε Pt is a vector of exogenous random variables, uncorrelated with all

the nonpolicy exogenous disturbances in the economy. The errors are Gaussian with

                            (                    )
                          E ε t ε t′ yt − s , s > 0 = I , E ( ε t yt − s , s > 0 ) = 0, all t.    (5)

The As matrices and the probability distribution of ε define the model’s structure.
      Assuming the matrix of contemporaneous coefficients, A0 , is non-singular, there is a
representation of y in terms of the impulse responses functions:
                                                       t −1
                                              yt = ∑ C sε t − s + E0 yt .                         (6)
                                                       s =0

The elements of Cs report how each variable in y responds over time to the behavioral
disturbances in ε. E0 yt is the projection of yt conditional on initial conditions. The reduced

form of (3) is
                                                      p

                                                  ∑B y
                                                     s =0
                                                              s   t −s   = ut ,                   (7)


with B0 = I and the covariance of the reduced-form errors, u, is Σ = A0−1 A0−1′ .
      Expressions (3) and (7) imply a linear mapping from the reduced-form errors to the
behavioral disturbances:
                                                          ut = A0−1ε t .                          (8)

Identification of the structural form follows from imposing sufficient restrictions on A0 so that
there are no more than m( m −1) 2 free parameters in A0 .

2.2      Identification
      We estimate a version of the model in (3) that contains six variables and three sectors. The
identification scheme follows the general approach in Gordon and Leeper (1994) and Sims and
Zha (1998b).4 Table 1 shows the restrictions placed on the contemporaneous coefficient matrix
A0 . There are no restrictions on lagged variables.
      Three goods market variables—real GDP (y), consumer prices (P), and the unemployment
rate (U)—compose the production sector, and are the ultimate objectives of monetary policy.




                                                                  5
We do not model the markets for reserves and a broad monetary aggregate, opting for
compactness to treat the M2 money stock as the aggregate and the federal funds rate ( R f )—the
monetary policy instrument—as the price that clears the money market. The third sector
describes an “information variable”—commodity prices (CP)—that is available at high
frequencies and reacts instantaneously to shocks from all sectors of the economy.
    The data are monthly from January 1959 to September 1998 and described in Appendix B.
Monthly GDP is interpolated from quarterly GDP using the procedure that Leeper, Sims and Zha
(1996) describe. All data are logarithmic except for the federal funds rate and the unemployment
rate. We estimate with 13 lags.
    The identification treats the production sector as predetermined for the rest of the system,
reflecting the view that production, pricing, and employment decisions do not respond
immediately to shocks from outside the sector. Production sector variables interact only with
each other within the period. Money market variables and information variables do not enter this
sector, reflecting sluggishness in the goods market due to contracts and advance planning of
production. Distinct behavioral equations within the production sector are not identified; instead,
the coefficients are arranged in lower triangular form in the order y, P, and U.
    The monetary and information sectors interact simultaneously, with the strongest
simultaneity determining the money stock and the federal funds rate. The demand for nominal
money balances depends on the short-term nominal interest rate, real income (proxied by real
GDP), and the price level. We do not impose short-run homogeneity in prices. Changes in ε MD
reflect exogenous shifts in money demand.
    We base the specification of monetary policy behavior in (2) on the information available to
the Federal Reserve within the month. During the month, the Federal Reserve sets its interest
rate instrument based on current observations on the money stock and commodity prices.5 We
set to zero the coefficients on y, P, and U in the policy function because within the month the

Sims and Zha (1996). Appendix A describes the Bayesian methods used to estimate the model.

  We allow policy to choose not to react strongly to commodity prices by shrinking the prior
standard deviation on the coefficient of CP toward the zero prior mean by a factor of .05.

                                                 6
Federal Reserve does not observe these variables directly.6 The error term in the monetary
policy equation, ε P , represents exogenous policy interventions.
      An efficient markets assumption guides the specification of the information sector, so
commodity prices may respond to all variables immediately. The error term ε I is the exogenous
information disturbance.

2.3      Parameter Estimates and In-Sample Fit
      Table 2 reports the contemporaneous coefficients along with 68 percent equal-tailed
probability intervals for the behavioral coefficients, estimated over the full sample period. The
money demand and monetary policy equations have reasonable economic interpretations. The
interest elasticity of demand is negative and the output elasticity is positive. The price elasticity
is small and imprecisely estimated. Monetary policy responds strongly to the money stock:
disturbances that raise the money stock induce the Fed to increase the federal funds rate.
Although the estimates seem to suggest the Fed does not react much to information contained in
commodity prices, this interpretation may be misleading. In the policy equation the coefficients
on R f and CP are highly correlated (.97), as are the coefficients on M2 and CP (.72); these
correlations muddy inferences about individual coefficients.
      All but two coefficients are tightly estimated in the information sector. The coefficients on
output and M2 are highly correlated with the coefficients on the price level and unemployment,
so the separate influences cannot be discerned. The estimates imply a quick reaction of
commodity prices to exogenous disturbances from elsewhere in the economy.
      We base a probabilistic assessment of the model’s overall fit on the shape of the likelihood
surface, rather than on tests of whether individual coefficients are different from zero [Sims and
Zha (1999)]. Table 2 nonetheless displays the (marginal) .68 probability intervals for individual
parameters to show that they are skewed, with most of the probability mass concentrated around
the maximum likelihood estimates. Because we care about the equilibrium effects of exogenous
policy actions, inferences do not rest on an individual parameter in A0 . Equilibrium effects,




6
  The Fed has some contemporaneous information about these variables. We experimented with
soft zeroes on P and U and found that the more we relaxed the zero restrictions the more likely
the identification was to produce nonsensical responses to exogenous monetary policy actions.

                                                   7
which section 2.4 discusses, depend on the joint distribution of all the parameters, not the
marginal distribution of an individual parameter.
    The model is overidentified. To evaluate whether the data favor the restricted model relative
to the unrestricted (reduced-form) model, we conduct an exact small-sample comparison using a
Bayes factor.7 Given the data, Y, we compare the probability densities of Y under the two
models, denoted by p(Y M R ) and p(Y MU ) where M R represents the restricted model and MU

the unrestricted model. Let Θ R be the restricted parameter space and ΘU be the unrestricted

parameter space. The Bayes factor is

                                 p (Y M R )    ∫        p (Y θ ) p (θ )dθ
                                               θ ∈Θ R
                                             =                              ,                    (9)
                                 p (Y M U   ) ∫         p (Y θ ) p (θ )dθ
                                               θ ∈ΘU


where p (θ ) is our reference prior probability density function, described in Appendix A. The
Bayes factor is a standard reporting procedure in Bayesian hypothesis testing. In our case, since
Θ R is a lower dimensional parameter space Θ R ⊂ ΘU , the Bayes factor compensates effectively

for over-parameterization by integrating the likelihood p (Y θ ) over the two different parameter

spaces Θ R and ΘU . Recent developments in Bayesian analysis and computer technology,
surveryed in Geweke (1999), allow us to calculate the Bayes factor accurately as
                                log p (Y M R ) − log p (Y M U ) = 0.9 .                        (10)

The data weakly favor the restricted model, suggesting that to determine the model’s consistency
with data it is important to compensate for over-parameterization.8
    To use the model to compute projections conditional on alternative interventions, the policy
disturbances must be uncorrelated with the other shocks. We use a small-sample procedure to
check whether ε Pt and ε Nt are uncorrelated. For each simulated draw from the posterior


7
  A number of statistics are used to approximate Bayes factors, including the likelihood ratio
criterion and the Schwarz criterion. The method of Laplace and the Schwarz criterion are
employed as higher-order corrections to the likelihood ratio criterion as an approximate Bayes
factor [Schervish (1995, chapters 4 and 7) and Sims (1999b)].
8
  The Schwarz criterion computes the chi-square statistic with degrees of freedom multiplied by
the log of the sample size. The chi-square statistic, which is twice the difference in log
likelihood values of the unrestricted and the restricted models at their peaks, is 18.56. With a
critical value of 18.11, the Schwarz criterion weakly rejects the restricted model.

distribution of the model’s parameters, we compute the sequences of exogenous disturbances
consistent with the data and calculate the correlation matrix for these sequences. Table 3 reports
.68 probability intervals for the correlations among the exogenous shocks, along with the
correlations calculated at the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters. ε Pt is

uncorrelated with ε Nt , so restriction (5) holds well.9 We also compute a posterior .68 probability

region for the correlations of policy shocks with five non-policy shocks. Zero values of all five
correlations fall jointly inside the region.10 With the policy disturbance uncorrelated with other
shocks, it is reasonable to condition on a path of exogenous policy interventions and draw
nonpolicy disturbances independently.

2.4      Dynamic Impacts of an Exogenous Monetary Policy Action
      Figure 1 displays the Cs ’s in (6) over 48 months for the six variables in the model when there
is a unit exogenous monetary policy contraction. The solid lines are the maximum likelihood
estimates of responses and the dashed lines are equal-tailed error bands containing .68
probability, following Sims and Zha (1999).
      The contraction raises the funds rate initially and immediately decreases the money stock and
commodity prices, both of which continue to decline smoothly over the four-year horizon. After
a brief delay, output falls and stays lower, while unemployment rises. Six months after the
exogenous action, both output and unemployment are likely to differ from their initial levels.
Consumer prices adjust more slowly and are unlikely to be appreciably lower for about a year.
After a year prices decline smoothly and remain well below their initial level.
      The response of the interest rate to an exogenous policy contraction stands out. In Figure 1
the initial liquidity effect lasts about eight months, but by 18 months the funds rate lies well



9
  The table suggests, however, that the model does not fit the correlation between the money
demand shock and the unemployment shock well, affecting some behavioral inferences, but not
the ones we pursue.

below its initial level. The decline in the funds rate then persists. Friedman (1968) and Cagan
(1972) describe this path following a monetary contraction as a short-lived liquidity effect
followed by income and expected inflation effects. After four years the declines in inflation and
the federal funds rate are the same size, as predicted if expected inflation is the dominant source
of fluctuations in nominal rates over long periods. The responses in the figures suggest that to
lower inflation persistently the Fed should raise the funds rate only briefly. Because lower
inflation is ultimately associated with a lower funds rate, the Fed must begin to reduce the rate
within about a year, and then keep it lower.

2.5      Parameter Stability
      Because many analyses work from the premise that U.S. monetary policy has shifted
substantially over the post-World War II period, some readers may object to our treating the
entire sample as a fixed policy regime. We think the issue is unsettled. Bernanke and Mihov
(1998a, 1998b) carefully test the stability of the reduced-form coefficients and the residual
covariance matrices in VARs containing many of the same time series in our model. They
conclude that the reduced-form parameters are stable. 11 In contrast, tests of the covariance
matrices of VAR innovations—from which the structural model’s A0 parameters are obtained in
(8)—find evidence of breaks in late 1979 or early 1980 and between early 1982 and early 1988.
The results conform to Sims’s (1999a) reaction function estimates. Using a hidden Markov
chain approach, he finds strong evidence that the Fed’s responsiveness to commodity price
inflation deviates from a linear, Gaussian reaction function. But in terms of model fit, he reports
that variations in the size of the errors in the policy rule are more important than variation in the
coefficients of the rule.
      Much recent attention focuses on the finding that coefficients in simple specifications of the
Fed’s policy rule shift over time [e.g., Clarida, Gali and Gertler (2000) and Taylor (1999)]. The




11
  They use a Lagrange multiplier variant of Andrew’s (1993) test, which checks every possible
break point and tests the significance of the associated LM statistics. Using quarterly data, Sims
and Zha (1998b) corroborate Bernanke and Mihov’s results by comparing a model fit from
1964:1 to 1994:1 to one fit separately to 1964:1-1979:3 and 1983:1-1994:1. Both the Akaike and
Schwartz criteria favor the restricted model.

                                                  10
simple rules emerge from restrictions on the policy behavior embedded in VARs.12 For our
purposes, what matters is whether the dynamic responses to exogenous policy interventions are
stable. Those responses depend on the system of equations, not just the policy rule. To explore
the system properties, we compute the dynamic effects of a one-period unit intervention using
models estimated over a variety of sub-periods.
     Figure 2 reports responses to all six exogenous disturbances for models estimated over four
sub-periods. The periods covered are 1959:1-1998:9 (entire sample); 1959:1-1979:9 (pre-
Volcker); 1959:1-1982:12 (including non-borrowed reserves targeting); 1959:1-1998:9 with
1979:10-1982:12 eliminated (excluding non-borrowed reserves targeting). The reserves
targeting period from 1979:10 to 1982:12 is too brief to obtain reliable estimates from just those
years, so we treat the three years as potentially anomalous relative to the entire sample.
Although it is popular to treat the Greenspan era (from late 1987 on) as a distinct policy regime,
we do not. The last 12 years of the sample contain only one mild recession and few interesting
exogenous disturbances, except possibly from the stock market.
     The qualitative responses in Figure 2 to exogenous policy interventions are robust across
sub-periods. 13 There is some tendency for the responses estimated by eliminating the reserves
targeting episode to be slightly weaker and for those estimated only through the end of 1982 to
be somewhat stronger. Otherwise, the responses to policy are even quantitatively very similar.
     Two implications flow from finding that parameters are stable. First, over the post-1959
period either monetary policy has resided in a single regime or the various regimes have been too
close to be detected statistically. Second, there is no evidence that agents’ beliefs about regime
have changed in ways that matter quantitatively for decision rules. This justifies our use of the
entire sample period to estimate the model and to form the history against which we evaluate
whether linear projections are likely to reliably predict the impacts of an intervention.
     Overall, the model’s fit is very good. The overidentifying restrictions do not invalidate our
uses of the model. Those uses rely on whether exogenous policy interventions are uncorrelated
with nonpolicy disturbances. Tests confirm that this assumption holds well. An exact small-

VARs.
13
   Qualitative differences do appear in responses to some non-policy disturbances, especially
money demand and goods market shocks. This finding is consistent with Hanson (2001).

                                                  11
sample comparison of the restricted and unrestricted models using a Bayes factor somewhat
favors the restricted model.14 Finally, the dynamic responses of the economy to exogenous
monetary policy interventions are quite stable over time. Taken together, these indicators of fit
and robustness lend credibility to the model’s projections conditional on policy.

2.6      Measuring Policy Interventions
      In the VAR the K-period forecast errors, given information at T, that arise from the
intervention IT = {ε!PT +1 ,..., ε!PT + K } are
                                                          K −1
                                           ηP (T , K ) = ∑ Cs (:, i )ε!PT + K −s ,                     (11)
                                                          s =0


where the Cs (:, i ) are the impulse response matrices associated with the monetary policy

disturbance in equation i. The vector η P (T , K ) is normally distributed with mean zero and
                    K −1
variance vector     ∑C
                    s =0
                           2
                           s   . We transform η P (T , K ) to a vector of standard normal variables,

η *P (T , K ) by scaling by the standard error of the η P ’s.
      Linear projections are reliable if both the intervention and its impacts are within two standard
deviations of their historical fluctuations. Specifically, we deem projections reliable if over a
specified forecast horizon K, for variable i, we find that
                                                    eiηP* (T , K ) < 2,                                (12)

where ei is a row vector of zeros with unity in the ith column. η * reports how unusual a

conditional projection is relative to the historical impacts of exogenous shifts in policy. Large
values of the statistic suggest the intervention is predicted to generate impacts on macro variables
that lie outside the historical range of policy effects. When an intervention violates (12), the
reliability of linear projections is called into doubt. The metric when K > 0 is ex-ante in the
sense that it assesses a hypothetical intervention. When K < 0 the metric is ex-post, computed
from the realized εˆP ’s, and it assesses actual interventions.
      The metric isolates exogenous policy changes as being most pertinent to evaluating policy
and assessing the impact of the Lucas critique. This improves on the reduced-form methods that


14
     The model’s out-of-sample fit compares favorably to other econometric models [Appendix C].

                                                            12
Doan, Litterman and Sims (1984) employ. The statistic at horizon K reflects the full impacts of
interventions up to time T + K . The metric emphasizes the dynamic impacts, rather than the
magnitude of the intervention itself because if policy impacts are small, even very large and
unprecedented interventions that shift beliefs about prevailing regime may not generate
significant changes in decision rules.

3.       Some Practical Analysis of U.S. Monetary Policy
      This section addresses some questions that Federal Reserve officials may have asked during
the 1990s. To do so we compute policy projections under several alternative scenarios tied to
actual U.S. policy experience. In each case we check the contemplated interventions to ensure
that the linear projections are likely to be reliable. We focus on two periods of aggressive policy
moves: the 500 basis point drop in the funds rate from late 1990 through 1993 and the 300 basis
point increase in the rate between January 1994 and early 1995.

3.1      “Exogenizing” Policy Can Produce Incredible Results
      The pure forecasting exercise that Doan, Litterman and Sims (1984) discuss, and which is
implemented in many practical applications, can generate implausible results. We illustrate the
point with the dramatic period beginning in September 1990. The period clarifies a problem that
applies generally. There are many ways to “exogenize” policy. One could change the
systematic part of policy—the function f in (11)—but this can be couched as a particular ε P
sequence. Bernanke, Gertler and Watson (1997) conduct the counterfactual exercise of changing
 f . Hamilton and Herrera (2000) convert the change in f to a sequence of εˆP ’s and compute
our metric to conclude the exercise is problematic.15 Here we provide two more examples.
      We mimic conventional out-of-sample forecasting by “exogenizing” the federal funds rate,
forcing the actual path of R f over the next 48 months to be produced solely by exogenous policy
actions. For each month of the forecast period we calculate the ε!Pt that produces a forecast that

equals the actual funds rate, Rt f , given the value of ε!Pt . Instead of conditioning on reduced-




15
 Other recent papers that “exogenize” policy in this manner include Bernanke, Gertler and
Watson (1997), Sims (1998), Sims and Zha (1998b), and Dungey and Pagan (2000).

                                                  13
form errors, our interpretation of Doan, Litterman and Sims derives the sequence of exogenous
policy actions consistent with the R f path.
     Table 4 reports the central tendencies for the paths of the funds rate, output growth, inflation,
and unemployment over the four-year forecast horizon. The actual funds rate fell dramatically
over the period, from an annual average of almost 8 percent in 1990 to an average of less than 3
percent in 1993. It takes a sequence of same-signed exogenous impulses to generate that decline
solely from exogenous policy actions. The impulses drive output growth and inflation into
double digits and the unemployment rate down to 3.5 percent. Given the actual path for the
policy instrument, the implausible paths for macro variables suggest that much of the movement
in R f over the period was an endogenous response of policy to nonpolicy disturbances.16
     The results in Table 4 come from hypothesizing policy behavior that deviates substantially
from any behavior observed over the sample. The forecast errors for each variable are extremely
unlikely, as shown by the statistics below:
                                      Variable     ηP* (90 : 9, 48)
                                         Rf              -2.93
                                          y             18.95
                                          P               9.64
                                          U             -18.96

The metric warns against placing much confidence in the linear projections.
     It is commonplace for central banks to condition forecasts on an unchanged path of the
policy instrument. The Bank of England (2000), for example, projects GDP growth and inflation
over horizons exceeding two years, under the assumption that the official interest rate is
constant.17 As the state of the economy is forecasted to change, however, an unchanged path of
the instrument always requires some pattern of intervention. Whether that intervention is likely
to shift private decision rules depends both on how persistent the intervention is and on how
large the dynamic impacts are.


16
   Altig, Carlstrom and Lansing (1995) assume a path of exogenous monetary policy
disturbances to use their general equilibrium model to simulate the effects of reducing inflation
by a percentage point over a two-year period and holding it at the lower value for three more
years. The model predicts implausible paths for the nominal interest rate and output growth.
17
   Central banks frequently interpret a constant instrument path an unchanged stance of policy
[Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (1999) or Sveriges Riksbank (1999)].

                                                  14
      In September 1990, the federal funds rate stood at 8.20 percent. Suppose the Fed were to
hold the rate fixed at 8.20 percent over the next 4 years. Doing this requires a sequence of
positive ε!P ’s that increase nearly monotonically over the forecast horizon, and average 1½
standard deviations in year 3 and over 2 in the last year. This intervention implies large forecast
errors:
                                      Variable ηP* ( 90 : 9, 48 )
                                          y            -7.09
                                          P            -4.51
                                          U            6.69

Linear forecasts are unlikely to be reliable.

3.2       Routine Policy Interventions Can Matter
      We now address whether conditioning on the class of interventions we consider is
informative about routine policy decisions. It turns out that this class of interventions is rich: it
can generate economically meaningful shifts in the distributions of forecasted macro variables
and clarify the tradeoffs facing policymakers. The analysis demonstrates that a complete
probability model, which quantifies the uncertainties that Brainard (1967) emphasizes, can
answer complex joint probability questions about those tradeoffs.
      We conduct the analysis through the eyes of an econometrician who has information about
the economy through September 1990. Minutes of the October 2, 1990 FOMC meeting reveal
that the Fed predicted a mild downturn in economic activity followed by a rapid resumption of
moderate growth. The minutes report that “insofar as could be judged on the basis of traditional
indicators, the available data did not point to cumulating weakness and the onset of a
recession.”18 Political developments in the Middle East, however, generated concerns about
future oil prices and created uncertainty about the outlook for inflation. Although the domestic
policy directive that emerged from the meeting sought “to maintain the existing degree of
pressure on reserve position,” several FOMC members dissented. One member favored
immediate easing and three members opposed the FOMC’s perceived leaning in favor of easing.

                                                  15
     In light of the dissension among FOMC members, we consider two scenarios. The first
scenario conditions forecasts on the actual path of the federal funds rate from October 1990 to
January 1991. An alternative scenario considers tighter policy over those four months.
     Figure 3 reports the actual time series, the out-of-sample forecasts conditional on the actual
path of the funds rate, and 68 percent probability bands for the forecasts. The actual funds rate
was 8.11 percent in October, 7.81 percent in November, 7.31 percent in December, and 6.91
percent in January. With that path of the funds rate, there is substantial probability that inflation
will rise above 5½ or 6 percent through 1993, real growth will fall below 1 percent in 1991, and
unemployment will rise to near 7 percent through 1993. Based on the path of the funds rate, it
may appear that the Fed was concerned primarily about recession. As it happened, inflation fell
to 3 percent by 1992, a recession occurred from July 1990 to March 1991 (according to the
NBER dating), and unemployment hit 7½ percent in 1992. Of course, as the model’s forecasts
confirm, policymakers were unaware in October that the recession began three months earlier.
     The FOMC minutes report that some policymakers were concerned about higher inflation.
Those FOMC members might want to see forecasts conditional on tighter policy. The forecasts
assume an intervention that raises the funds rate by 50 basis points in October (to 8.70 percent)
and an additional 25 basis points over the period from November 1990 to January 1991. Ex-ante
it appears that tighter policy would reduce the likelihood of higher inflation, but at the cost of
raising the probability of negative real growth in 1991 (Figure 4). The point forecasts of output
growth and unemployment, conditional on tighter monetary policy, come very close to the actual
paths of the variables in 1991 and 1992. In spite of the sharp decline in the projected funds rate
in 1991-93, the intervention exerts a contractionary influence.19
     Debate during the October 1990 FOMC meeting centered on the tradeoffs associated with
alternative policy choices. The tradeoffs can be framed as joint probability statements. To


19
  To hit the actual path of the funds rate the intervention is IT = {0.5, 0.1, −0.7, −0.7, 0,..., 0} and
for tightening it is IT = {2.3,1.7,1.0, 0.9, 0,..., 0} . The resulting metrics are

answer the concerns over economic slowdown and higher inflation, Table 5 reports a variety of
joint probabilities involving real GDP growth in 1991 or 1992 or 1993 and inflation in 1992 and
1993, conditional on two alternative policies. “Tighter” policy assumes the same counterfactual
policy behavior as in Figure 4, while “Actual R f ” adjusts policy to be consistent with Figure 3.
      The probabilities put a sharp point on the tradeoffs Federal Reserve officials perceived they
faced. In terms of the marginal probabilities, tighter policy makes it very likely that inflation
will remain low in 1992 and 1993 (below 5½ percent), but it also produces a better than 50
percent chance of a recession in 1991 (negative real GDP growth for the year). More relevant to
policymakers is the apparent tradeoff: tighter policy creates a one-third chance of a recession in
1991 or 1992 or 1993 and low inflation in 1992 and 1993.
      For an intervention to generate the actual path of the funds rate, the Fed would have to
tighten slightly in October and November and then ease in December and January. The column
in the table labeled “Actual R f ” reports these results. This policy reduces by half the marginal
probability of a recession in 1991 while lowering the marginal likelihoods of low inflation in
1992 and 1993. It also greatly reduces the joint probability of a recession in 1991 or 1992 or
1993 and low inflation in 1992 and 1993. Again the tradeoff is clear: the probability of no
recession coupled with inflation over 5½ percent now exceeds 40 percent, compared to 18
percent when policy is tighter.

3.3      Appraising and Reappraising Policy with Sequential Interventions
      Blinder’s (1997) description of the appraisal/reappraisal process inherent in routine
policymaking is echoed by Kohn (1995, p. 235) who observes that policymakers must “be
flexible in revising forecasts and the policy stance in response to new information.” This
perspective helps to understand the Federal Reserve’s “preemptive strike” against inflation in
1994. Our analysis shows that in February the tighter policy looked to be sufficient to offset
higher inflation in 1996 and 1997; it was not sufficient by April, once three months of new
information arrived. When we reappraise policy in April, a further tightening appears necessary
to preempt inflation. The analysis puts empirical flesh on Brainard’s (1967) argument for
gradualism.
      Figure 5 displays actual data and out-of-sample forecasts made in January under two
alternative policy scenarios for February through May. Given that the federal funds rate had


                                                  17
been nearly constant at 3 percent over the previous year, a natural baseline maintains this
constancy through May. The first intervention holds the funds rate constant for 4 months. That
policy portends rising inflation over the next several years, exceeding 3½ percent in 1996 and
1997; but policymakers do not seem to face an unpleasant tradeoff between inflation and real
activity. Real GDP is expected to grow at least 3 percent annually from 1995 to 1997, while the
unemployment rate is projected to continue to decline.
     Key policy questions at the time were when to raise the rate and how much to raise it. To
address these questions we consider an alternative policy of moderate tightening that raises the
funds rate along its actual path. Although the actual funds rate rose a full percentage point from
January to May, that path requires a relatively small exogenous intervention.20 Even moderate
tightening in January shifts the projected inflation path down without severely affecting real
activity (Figure 5).
     The Fed reappraises policy in April with three additional months of news about the economy.
Now the baseline of a constant funds rate at 3.75 percent leads policymakers to expect inflation
will once again drift toward the 3½ to 4 percent range in 1996 and 1997 (Figure 6). The
outlooks for output and unemployment remain promising, so the Fed still does not face a difficult
tradeoff. A somewhat stronger tightening move to match the actual path of the funds rate from
May through August pushes the funds rate to 4.47 percent in August. Tighter policy shifts the
mean forecast of inflation down below 3 percent through 1997 without risking recession.21




20
   Holding the funds rate constant requires the intervention IT = {−.3, −.2, −.2, −.2, 0,..., 0} , while
tracking the actual funds rate calls for the intervention IT = {.5, 0,.5,1.1, 0,..., 0} . The η *

   By reappraising their decisions in light of updated forecasts, policymakers move cautiously
against inflation. So long as forecasts extend far enough into the future to capture monetary
policy’s lagged effects, the gradual approach can be successful. This analysis formalizes
Blinder’s (1997) description of policymaking. It also illustrates why uncertainty about future
exogenous disturbances may lead policymakers to move cautiously, as Brainard (1967) instructs.
   Some readers might worry that if policy makers use the kind of on-going policy analysis that
we describe as a basis for policy decisions, agents’ beliefs about regime might shift. We perform
an ex-post check of how likely this situation was in January 1994. We estimate the model
through January 1994, back out the realized policy disturbances, εˆP ’s, over the preceding 48
months, and compute an ex-post metric using the realized disturbances. The metric yields

for forecasts beginning in February 1990 and ending in January 1994. These values for η * warn
that over this period agents’ beliefs may have shifted in favor of a new, tighter monetary policy
regime. This result would be consistent with Taylor’s (1999) finding that during the Greenspan
era the Federal Reserve responded more strongly to inflation than in previous periods.
   Although this ex-post metric raises a warning flag, we judge that the conditional projections
of interventions in January and April 1994 are reliable. The judgment call is based on three
considerations. First, a change in beliefs about regime is necessary but not sufficient for
undermining the reliability of the linear approximation. Second, as Appendix D shows, the
responses to policy disturbances are extremely stable across estimation periods ending in
September 1990, January 1994, and April 1994. If changes in beliefs generated quantitatively
important shifts in decision rules, one would expect to observe greater instability in the response

functions. Finally, the large η * ’s arise from only a few positive interventions larger than one
standard deviation and there is no clear sign pattern in the interventions that might systematically
shift beliefs. These observations underscore the bias that can arise from mechanically applying
the metric without factoring in the dynamic patterns an intervention implies.22

4.      Concluding Remarks
     Our framework unifies identification and forecasting. Identifying exogenous variation in
policy is essential for addressing counterfactual questions. A careful examination of both in-
sample and out-of-sample fits and the model’s stability allow the econometrician to assess the
model’s statistical properties. We showed how the approach can address practical counterfactual
policy questions. The approach frames answers in probabilistic terms, quantifying uncertainty
about the model and about future exogenous events.
     This is a framework for interpreting actual central bank behavior. We illustrated the
approach with an identified VAR model of U.S. monetary policy. We probed the range of policy
interventions for which an identified linear model is likely to be reliable. We checked that this
range of policies is consistent with an unchanged policy regime and showed that it is sufficiently
rich to address questions considered by central banks at regular policy meetings. The
interventions studied matter: they can shift the projected paths and probability distributions of
macro variables in economically meaningful ways.
     In line with recent work, the paper has not found compelling evidence that Federal Reserve
behavior has been unstable over the past 40 years. Although some readers may dispute our
inference that the Fed has operated in approximately one regime since 1959, this does not
diminish the usefulness of our approach. Researchers can simply estimate the model over any
sample period they deem constitutes a single regime, and then apply our approach to compute
linear projections. The approach assesses the projections’ reliability conditional on policy



22
  For the 4 years preceding September 1990, the example in section 3.2, the ex-post metrics for
the three variables are below 0.5 in absolute value.

regime: if two researchers can agree that a data sample constitutes a single regime, they should
also agree on whether a linear projection is reliable.
   Our methodology has broad applicability. We have stressed its usefulness for the kinds of
practical analyses central banks conduct. Closely related techniques are being used to study the
behavior of the central bank of Sweden as it implements inflation targeting [Jansson and Vredin
(2000)]. Our method also yields insights about the plausibility of answers to counterfactual
questions. Hamilton and Herrera (2000) apply the methodology to assess the plausibility of
Bernanke, Gertler, and Watson’s (1997) counterfactual analysis of the Federal Reserve’s
response to oil price shocks.

                                      Appendix A: Estimation
      Litterman (1986) shows that reduced-form Bayesian VARs forecast out-of-sample better than
other time series methods or commercial models do. We adopt the Bayesian procedures for
identified VARs that Sims and Zha (1998a) develop.
      There are two layers to the prior information. The first layer is a reference prior that reduces
the sampling error that produces erratic results in large models under a diffuse prior. We
postulate a joint normal prior, with a diagonal covariance matrix on the elements of A0 that the
identification does not constrain to equal zero. We then specify a joint normal prior on all the
coefficients in As , for s > 0 , conditional on A0 . To implement Litterman’s random walk

specification, we assume the conditional mean of A1 A0 is A0 , while the conditional mean of

As A0 , for s > 1 , is zero. The prior standard deviations of the elements of the As matrices shrink
as s increases, dampening unreasonably large lagged coefficients.
      The second layer of the prior corrects the overfitting problem endemic to VARs. Because the
number of parameters in As grows with the square of the number of variables, model (3) tends to
fit the data unrealistically well in sample but can fail badly when projecting post-sample. This
manifests as deterministic components of the model explaining implausibly large fractions of the
observed variation in the data. To express our belief that such outcomes are implausible, we add
to the reference prior parameters that control beliefs about the number of unit roots and the
number of cointegrating relationships in the m-variable system. The data determine the exact
number of unit roots and cointegrating vectors. In Sims and Zha’s (1998a) notation, the
tightness of the prior is set as λ 0 = 0.6 , λ 1 = 01                          . , µ 5 = 5 , and µ 6 = 5 .23
                                                    . , λ 2 = λ 3 = 1 , λ 4 = 01
      The prior accommodates an idea Hall (1996) proposed to relax the dogmatic zero restrictions
typical in simultaneous equations models. Instead of restricting a coefficient to be exactly zero
or freely estimating it, we specify a “soft zero” restriction. The restriction shrinks a coefficient’s
prior standard deviation around a zero mean without forcing the coefficient to be zero.




23
     These priors do not change the character of the results [Robertson and Tallman (2000)].

                   Appendix C: Out-of-Sample Forecast Performance
      To have confidence in the model’s projections conditional on alternative future policies, it is
important to evaluate the model’s out-of-sample forecast performance. This appendix compares
the annual forecast performance of our model under the Sims and Zha (1998a) prior to forecasts
with a VAR with a diffuse prior and a VAR with Litterman’s (1986) prior.
      Table 6 lists the root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) for unconditional forecasts over horizons
of one to four years using the three estimation methods. The models are estimated recursively
using data from January 1959 up to the beginning of each forecast period. The RMSEs are
computed from forecasts over four years beginning in December 1979 and running through
September 1994.
      The table shows that, except in the case of M2, the structural model outperfoms the diffuse-
prior VAR and the Litterman-prior VAR. The biggest improvement occurs in the inflation rate
and the federal funds rate. This is encouraging for our purposes: inflation is the Fed’s primary
concern and the funds rate is the policy instrument.24
      The forecasts compare favorably to the ones that Cecchetti (1995) computes and to the DRI
forecasts of inflation that Cecchetti reproduces. Kohn (1995) reports that the Federal Reserve’s
one-year forecasts of inflation have RMSEs of from 1 to 1¼ percentage points. Our structural
model’s RMSE for one-year inflation forecasts is .95 percentage points. The model’s
compactness relative to the Fed’s models makes its performance especially remarkable.




24
     Robertson and Tallman (1999) study the forecast performance of this model relative to others.
