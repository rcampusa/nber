        This paper contrasts Intcrnational Social Science Programme (ISSP) surveys for Hungary,

supplemented with related survey data for East Germany, Poland, and Slovenia, with ISSp data

for Western countries, to examine the extent to which workers in traditionally communist

societies differ in their attitudes toward woik cooditioas, wage inequality, the role of unions and

the role of the state in determining labor market outcomes. We find sufficiently marked

differences in responses between Hungary and the other previously communist countries and in

Western countries to suggest that communism left an identifiable common legacy in the labor

ares. The citizens of former communist countries evince a greater desire for egalitarianism, are

less satisfied with their jobs, and are more supportive of state interventions in the job market and

economy than Westerners. These differences suggest that the move to a market economy will

be marked by considerable "social schizophrenia" due to an attitudinal legacy of their communist

past.

        Labor relations in communist economies diverged from those in free market economies,

Under communism nearly all workers joined official "transmission bclC unions that operated as an

arm of the stale rather than as independent representatives of workers. The state set wages, prices,

and enterprise budgets in ways that created huge'job vacancies with no open unemployment;
produced low real wages and narrow skill and sectoral pay differentials; and resulted in inefficient

allocations of labor (Freeman,i992). While most analysts believe that communist labor practices
produced demoralized and disgruntled workers,. there have been no comparisons of worker
attitudes in historically communist economies and market economies using comparable survey
instruments that document or test this expectation.1

       To what extent do workers in traditionally communist societies differ in their attitudes
toward work conditions, wage inequality, job satisfacLion, the role of unions and the role of the
state in determining labor market outcomes from workers in the West? To what extent can any
observed differences be attributed to the 'legacy" of the communist past, per our tide?

       This paper uses the International Social Science Programme (ISSP)2 surveys for Hungary,
supplemented with related survey data for East Germany, Poland, and Slovenia, and ISSP surveys
from Western countries to tiy to answer these questions. Each year the ISSP focuses on a'
particular topic. The topics most relevant to our area of inquiry are: "social inequality" (1987
module); "work orientation" (1989 module); and "the role of government" (1990)) We find
sufficient differences in answers relating to these topics between respondents in Hungary and in
the other previously communist countries and in several Western countries to suggest that
communism left an identifiable common legacy in the labor area
Characteristics of Eastern European and Western data samples
       Most of our data for the formerly communist countries is for Hungary, which has been a
regular participant in the ISSPsince 1986. The sample size in the survey declines from relatively
large numbers at the outset (1747 in 1986 and 2606 in 1987) to smaller numbers by the turn of the

decade (1000 in 1989 and 977 in 1990). The Hungarian data are imperfect along several
dimensions. Unionizationdata are not available for 1990 and 1991. and we have no income data
                                                   2


 for the 1991 survey. Over 90% of respondents are public sector employees, which prevents us
 from making inferences about developments in the private sector. All of these factors suggest that
 the ISSP data will understate changes in labor market outcomes and practices as Hungary moved
 toward a market economy.

        The data for the other formerly communist countries are more limited, consisting largely of

 responses to attitudinal questions, rather than about labor market outcomes. East Germany and
 Slovenia were included in the 1991 ISSP but their surveys did not obtain data on incomes or
 unionization. The corresponding 1987 Polish survey contains even less information about the
labor market. Still, it is important to examine the responses to attitudinal questions for these
countries as well as for Hungary, so that we do not incorrectly infer something abput the
communist legacy from the distinct features of a single former communist country.

        For our comparison group we have data from sixteen ISSP countries as well as from
Switzerland in 1987 that gives us just over 93.000 individual responses. Details of the number of

responses by, country for each year from 1985 is presented in Appendix Table Al.5 By
comparing the former communist states with a set of Western countries, we avoid the danger that
differences between the East European countries and any particular Western country, such as the
United States, are due to the distinct characteristics of that Western country rather than to the legacy
of communist labor practices vis-a-vis market economies in general.
Unionism
        We begin by comparing levels of unionism and attitudes toward unionism across countries.
Table 1 shows some of the labor market characteristics of respondents in the four former
communist countries for which we have data. By 1989-1991 the rates of unionization in three
countries for which we have data are markedly below the 100% unionism that existed under
communism, though still relatively high. The unionization figures for Hungary6 show a sharp fall
in union membership from 1986 to 1989 with the collapse of communism. We doubt that the
ISSP data correctly capture the timing of the trend in unionization, but independent estimates of
union membership from Hungarian unions confirm that union density fell as workers no longer
                                                 3


 feel the compulsion to be members (Freeman, 1994) and in the face of changes in labor laws. In

 1989 Hungary passed laws establishing freedom for association along Western lines, as opposed

 to near compulsory union membership under communism. Independent unions were formed, and
 the old official unions began to act like real unions, so that by the early 1990s union membership

 had a different meaning than it did under communist dictatorships. In 1993 Hungary held union

elections in which workers could designate the union to represent them on the board responsible

for unemployment insurance?. The successors to the old official unions won about 80% of the
votes, indicating that they had attained some legitimacy as an independent voice of workers. The
difference between effectively compulsory unionism under communism and freely chosen
independent unionism suggests an alternative (extreme) reading of the evidence on change: 1mm
0% to 30-40% of genuine unionization. However one interprets this, union membership is
moving toward more nonnal numbers relative to the population in all of the former communist
countries.

        The ISSP contains several questions about attitudes toward unionism. Table 2 records the
responses of Hungarians and of ISSP respondents from Western countries toward unionism in the
1989 and 1990 ISSP surveys. The responses to the question "How good are trade/labor unions
for the country as a whole?" show that Hungarians are less likely to view unions favorably than
Westerners. Forty-two percent of Hungarians report that unions were "not very good" or "not
good at all" compared to 16% of West Germans, 27% of the British respondents and 25% of
American respondents, and so on. A large number of Italians (44%) also report that unions were
"not very good" or "not good at all". But the reason for the Hungarian response differs from the
reason for the Italian response. Asked "do you think that trade unions have too much power or too

little power?" Hungarians overwhelmingly thought that unions had too little power, whereas
Italians disapproved of unions as having too much power (responses to question 2 in Table 2).
Responses to an ISSP question on the need for unions to protect the interests of workers (question
3 in Table 2) are consistent with this: the proportion of Hungarians who believe that strong trade
unions are needed to protect workers exceeds that in any other country7.
                                                   4

         Why do Hungarians and Westerners respond so differently to the union questions in the
 ISSP? How can we rationalize the Hungarian view that unions are not good for the country, are

 too weak, and are needed to protect workers? Our explanation is that these responses reflect two

 aspects of Hungarian experience with unions: the past role of unions as transmission belts of the
 state in Hungary and the weakness of newly emerging or changing traditional unions, with
 ambiguous attitudes toward marketisation of the economy -- one of several legacies of the
 country's communist labor system.
 Earnings and attitudes toward earnings
        The ISSP contains information on the monthly earnings of Hungarians in each year of the
 survey. We have used these data to estimate log earnings equations for the period after the fall of
 communism, 1989-90. and for 1986. The results are given in Table 3. with and without the
 inclusion of a dummy variable for whether the worker was in a supervisory position. The
compression of earnings differentials under communism leads us to expect an increase in the
returns to skill as the economy moves to more market-based transactions, and this is what the
regressions show. The coefficient on the years of schooling rises from 1986 to 1989-90 in both
specifications, and the coefficient on being a supervisor also rises. This implies that the returns to
skill, measured by education and occupation, rose. However, the coefflcient on another standard

indicator of skill, years of work experience, falls (the linear term in the regression dominates the
quadratic term at the mean level of experience). In contrast to schooling and position, experience
paid off less in 1989-90 than in 1986-88. We interpret this as reflecting a deterioration in the value
of experience built up under the communist regime, and the potentially greater adaptability of
younger workers than of older workers to new market conditions.

       The 1987 ISSP survey contained information on perceptions of "what people earn each
year" and what they "ought to earn" in 11 occupations (such as doctor, bricklayer, cabinet officer)
that provides a unique look at how people from different economic systems perceive wage
structures and their attitudes toward occupational income inequality. Do respondents view wage
                                                  5

 structures as more compressed in the former communist countries? Did the communist ideology

 give East Europeans a stronger preference for egalitarian wage structures?

         The statistics in table 4 summarize the responses on what people earn and ought to earn for

 Hungary, Poland and the Western countries which also asked this question in terms of two
statistics: the log differential in pay between a chairman of a large national company and an
unskilled factory worker and the standard deviation of the natural log of 'perceived' pay for all of

the eleven occupations. The responses underlying the statistics are recorded in Table A2.

        In terms of perceptions of earnings differentials, the data tell a clear story: people in the
former communist countries perceive a much narrower wage distribution than those in the West.
This is an accurate description of what communist wage-setting did to occupational differentials

(though communist bureaucrats had special shops and privileges that produced greater inequality
than shown in wage structures). More intriguing are the results on perceptions of "what people
ought to earn". In every country the incomes that people think workers "ought to" earn are more
equally distributed than the perceived differentials. But here too there is a clear cx-
communist/Western gap: persons in Poland and Hungary favor markedly smaller differentials than

persons in the West (contrast the .389 and .359 standard deviations for those countries with the
.58 to .61 standard deviations in the Western countries). There are two possible reasons why

people in former communist countries favor more egalitarian wage distributions. One is that they
are imbued with the ideology of "socialist justice". Another is that existing (perceived) differentials

affect "ought to" differentials: people may simply scale down existing differentials in forming their
views of what ought to be. A strong form of the latter hypothesis would be that people in each
country scale down differentials proportionately. The data reject this hypothesis, as the differences

between the differentials in perceived incomes and ought to incomes are greater in Western
countries than in Poland and Hungary. For instance, the difference between the standard
deviations in what people earn and what they ought to earn for Hungary is .17, whereas the
difference for the United States is .27 and for Austria .29. If the scaling hypothesis is correct, it
                                                   6

  applies to the ex-communist countries and Western countries separately and does not explain why
 people in the latter favor more egalitarian wage distributions.

 Job satisfaction
         Questions about job satisfaction are difficult to interpret due to the subjective nature of the

 variable and problem of making interpersonal comparisons (Freeman, 1978). Still, the
 econometric literature based upon satisfaction data has yielded interesting and consistent results
 across data sets that show links between satisfaction and economic and demographic variables

 (see, for example. Hamermesh (1977), Borjas (1979), Freeman (1978), Blanchflower and Oswald
 (1992) and Clark and Oswald (1992)). Comparisons of responses to satisfaction questions across
 countries are fraught with even greater dangers, and we are aware of only studying making
 satisfaction comparisons across countries (Blanchflower and Oswald (1992) who compare the UK

 and the US). People in one country may "scale" responses differently than those in another. For
instance, Americans may be relatively optimistic, with an "everything will work out" mentality that
leads people with the same true satisfaction (on some objective scale)8 to respond more positively

to a "Are you satisfied with your job'?" question than the potentially more reserved British. Still,
the responses of people who lived under communism to questions about job satisfaction offer
some clue as to how that system affected their working lives; and enables us to examine, albeit
crudely, the widely held view that communist labor relations practices produced less satisfied
workers than free market practices, as one would expect from the standard view of communist
labor relations and individual reports, for instance in Haraszti (1978).

       The only former communist country for which we have job satisfaction data is Hungary.
which, along with 10 Western countries, asked a satisfaction question as part of the 1989 ISSP.
The specific question is a general one: "How satisfied are you in your job?". The tabulated
distribution of responses for Hungary and the Western countries in table 5 shows that relatively
few Hungarians are completely or very satisfied with their job (13%) compared to large
proportions of Westerners, ranging from 33% in Eire to 50% in the U.S. At face value, this is
striking confirmation for the notion that workers under communism are less happy with their jobs
                                                    7


 than workers under communism. But there are potential problems with this reading of the
 evidence. The differences in Table 5 could be due to differences in the composition of work fames

 across countries associated with job satisfaction. They could be due to entirety to differences in
 income rather than to labor relations practices. It seems reasonable to expect that higher paid
 Westerners are more likely to be satisfied with their job than lower paid Hungarians. Finally, our

 stress on differences at the upper end of the satisfaction scale could be erroneous, offset by
differences in other parts of the distribution of responses, in particular the relatively small
proportion of Hungarians who report themselves as dissatisfied.
      To check these possibilities, and use the entire distribution of responses to the job satisfaction

question to estimate country differences, we have employed an ordered probit model. Ordered
probits are the appropriate statistical procedure where, as in this case, respondents express their
preferences in the form of an ordinal ranking9. The ordered.probit is based on the following
specification:


        z=ftx+e
           —   N [0. 1]
        y =Oifz SPo
        1 if <z$i
        ZifJ'i cz P2
        Jifz >J.&j_i
where z is a latent (unobserved) indicator of job satisfaction, y is the reported categorical indicator,

and e is a random disturbance. Since the scale of z is not observed, we employ the usual probit
normalization and set the variance of z to unity. The p s are unobserved thresholds to be
estimated; different values of y are realized as the latent indicator z crosses these thresholds. The
dependent variable is coded 1, 2...J.
       Our model includes various demographic variables which are known to influence job
satisfaction including gender, age and marital status. We also include a unionism variable which
previous studies have found is negatively correlated with satisfaction (Freeman, 1978; Borjas,
1979) and self-employment which has been found to be positively related to satisfaction
                                                  8


 (Blanchflower and Oswald, 1993) along with a dummy variable for Hungary. The coefficient on
 this dummy variable tells us how the entire distribution of job satisfaction differs between
 Hungarians and Westerners, conditional on the diverse control variables. We estimate two
 equations: a basic job satisfaction equation and an equation that controls, as best wecan, for
 income, using an ISSP question that asked people whether they viewed their income as high: "For
 each of the following statements about your job, please tick one box to show how much you agree

 or disagree that it applies to your job: My income is high." Consistent with lower income in
 former communist countries, Hungarians were far more likely to disagree with this statement.
Some 70% of Hungarians disagreed or disagreed strongly that their income was high compared to
48% of the British, 27% of Germans, 33% of Italians, 43% of Americans, and comparable
fractions of other Westerners.

        The results of our ordered probit analysis of job satisfaction are given in Table 6. Column
1 shows that the "control variables" have their expected effects on job satisfaction, indicating that

the ISSP question on job satisfaction gives results comparable to those in other surveys: unionism,

in particular, is negatively related to job satisfaction while self-employment is positively related.
The coefficient on the Hungary dummy is large, negative and statistically significant -.53.
Hungarians are, indeed, less satisfied with their jobs than Westerners. Column 2 shows that
workers who report that their income is low are less likely to be satisfied (i.e. the coefficients on
the various categorical responses are increasingly negative compared to the omitted group of
persons who strongly agree that their income is high). The coefficient on the Hungary dummy
falls to -.41 upon addition of the "income is high" responses, but it remains substantial and
significant. At similar perceptions of income (if not similar incomes) Hungarians are less satisfied
with their jobs than Westerners.

       What factors might produce a "legacy" of greaterjob dissatisfaction in Hungary?
       Table 7 presents some evidence on worker perceptions of workplace conditions that cast
light on this question. It shows that Hungarian workers are far less likely to regard their jobs as
interesting than Western workers (question 1); are far more likely to see their workplace as
                                                  9

 involving dangerous conditions than Western workers (question 2); and are far more likely to see
 their workplace as involving unhealthy conditions (question 3). All of these factors are likely to
 feed into job satisfaction. In coulmn 3 of Table 6 we include a series of dummy variables to
 distinguish whether respondents considered their jobs to be "interesting" and/or their work
conditions to be "unhealthy" or "dangerous°. The inclusion of these variables reduces the size of

 the coefficient on the Hungary dummy by approximately a quarter, although its significance
remains. These factors contribute to the low levels of satisfaction in Hungaiy, but they are not the

whole story.
        We interpret the table 6 results in two ways: as confirming the reported lower job
satisfaction of Hungarians with evidence about objective features of workplaces; and more
strongly, as a legacy of transmission belt unions and absence of a free labor market. Workers in
Hungary seemingly lacked "voice" or sufficient influence through "exit" under communism to
obtain safe and interesting jobs.

        If our interpretation of the satisfaction data as reflecting a legacy of communism is valid.

we would expect similar patterns of response to satisfaction questions in other previously
communist countries. We have not been able to find such survey data. However, the 1991 ISSP
provides data on perceived overall "happinessTM for Slovenia and East Germany, as well as for
Hungary and Western countries.'0 At the minimum, we would expect citizens in those countries,
as in Hungary, to be less happy than those in the West, and this indeed is what we find.11 Since
work is such an important part of life, we infer from that we would obtain a similar pattern for job
satisfaction questions.
Role of the state in economic life
       Under communism the state dominated economic life, with adverse consequences for
economic progress, and worker and citizen satisfaction. By overturning communism, these
countries have committed themselves to developing a market economy with a much smaller
governmental role in economic affairs than in their past. Still, the decades of government-
dominated economic life and communist egalitarian ideology may have left a legacy of "statism" in
                                                 10


 these countries that would produce different attitudes toward state interventions in wage and
 employment than is found among people brought up in market economies.

        Table S tabulates responses to ISSP questions that cast light on this issue. It shows a wide
 difference in attitudes toward state interventions between East European and Western countries, but

 also reveals differences among the ex-cominunist countries and in some instances across
 questions, that makes any suong generalization difficult to reach. With respect to the role of the
 state in regulating the distribution of income and wages, a larger proportion of workers from the
 former communist countries than from the Western countries believe that the government is
 responsible for reducing differences in income. In 1987, 32% of Hungarians and 36% of Poles
strongly agree with this statement, proportions that far exceed those in Western countries ave for
Austria (question one); in 1990, 48% of East Germans and 46% of Hungarians strongly agreed,
which exceeds the proportion of workers who gave this response in all Western countries save
Eire. There is less consistency among the former communist countries in whether respondents
support controlling wages by law. The East Germans strongly favor such, but the Hungarians do
not (question 3). On the other hand, substantially more Hungarians believe that the government
should provide everyone with a guaranteed basic income (question 4).. On the net, there is greater
support for governmental interventions in wage setting in the former communist countries than in
the Western countries and much greater support for such interventions than in the United States
and Great Britain which are the most committed to letting the market determine wages and
incomes.

       On the employment side, the ISSP asked in several years if the government should provide
a job for all. In 1987 respondents in the two East European countries covered, Hungary and
Poland, were far more likely to agree with this than respondents in the Western countries (question

5). In 1989, however, large proportions of Italians and Norwegians also agreed strongly that the
government should provide jobs for all. The 1990 survey shows East Germans to be the most in
favor of government job provision, with Hungarians, Norwegians, and Israelis next (question 7).
                                                  11


 The East Germans also most strongly favored government financing of projects to create newjobs

 (question 8).

          The greater support for government playing a role in income and employment determination

 in former communist countries shows up, finally, in workers' desires to choose different sorts of

jobs. The ISSP asked: "Suppose you were working and could choose between different kinds of
jobs. Which of the following would you personally choose?" and gave them a choice of different
job settings (see question 9). Relatively more respondents in most western countries would choose
to work for a private business than would choose to work for the government-- for instance, 73%

of the British prefer private business to government., 56% of West Germans (and so on). But 60%

of Hungarians prefer to work for the government. Similarly. 58% of Hungarians would choose to
work in a manufacturing industry, which far exceeds the proportion of respondents in any western

country
        While there are some inconsistencies in the responses in table 8 across countries the genera!

pattern in these data is that East Europeans seem to have a greater proclivity for relying on the
state12 than on the private job market than do Westerners --          a   further potential legacy of
communist labor relations.
Conclusion
        This study has uncovered substantial differences in the responses to diverse questions
about attitudes towards labor market inequality, job satisfaction and happiness, and the role of the
state in regulating labor market outcomes between former communist countries and Western
countries. We have interpreted these differences as reflecting a legacy of communist economics,
as in our title. The citizens of former communist countries evince a greater desire for egalitarianism
than do Westerners, are less satisfied with their jobs, and are more supportive of state
interventions. If our interpretation is correct, their move to a market economy will be marked by
considerable "social schizophrenia" due to an attitudinal legacy of their communist past.

  Three papers have used attitudinal data to examine the development of markets in general, but
not specifically labor markets, in Eastern Europe. Akerlof and Yellen (1991) looked at various
worker attitudes in East Germany and compared them with comparable samples from West
Germany. Shiller et. al. (1991) compared random samples of the Moscow and New York
populations in their attitudes toward free markets. In another paper Shiller et. al. (1992) studied
individual attitudes in three ex-communist countrie -- Russia, the Ukraine and East Germany --
and compared them with three advancedcapitalist economies — the United States. Japan and West
Germany. In addition, Rose and, Haerpfer (1994) have contrasted attitudes toward the
transformation of ex-éómnlunist societies, and Frentze1-Zagork and Zagorski (1993) have
examined Polish opinion toward privatization and state interventionism.

individuals between the ages of 18 and 35. In what follows we make use of both samples: this has
little if any effect on our main conclusions.

5 In a number of cases the data were collected in a different year from that reported. For example,
Great Britain did not conduct a survey in 1988: the reported data were collected in 1989. Half thç
1989 respondents were asked the questions from the 1988 ISSP and the other half the 1989
component In a few cases, e.g. Italy in 1988 and 1989 and 1990 and 1991 and Austria in 1987
and 1988, the same group of respondents were asked the two years of questions.

6 There are some complications with these data. In the 1986 survey employed individuals
between the ages of 18 and 66 were asked if they were union members. In subsequent sweeps of
the ISSP all individuals were asked this question, whether they were employed or not. Our
estimate of union density is limited to employees, excluding pensioners and others who will report
union membership depending on whether pensions and social benefits are officially given by the
state or the union.
7     initially expected one additional ISSP question "in genetal, how would you describe relations
at your workplace between management and employees?" to be informative on possible attitudes
toward the need for unions. But the response of Hungarians relative to Westerners here was
ambiguous. A much smaller proportion (11.5%) stated that labor-management relations were very
good than in any Western country (the Netherlands was the next lowest at 18.5%) but at the same
time a smaller proportion of Hungarians (3.1%) described labor relations as quite or very bad than
workers in Western countries (the next lowest was Israel, with 4%).

8 One objective scaling would be to determine how satisfaction responses map into labor turnover,
Satisfaction correlates well with quit behavior, so that if the same response led to similar quitting
across countries, we would view responses as valid indicators of one form of objective behavior.
We do not have data contrasting satisfaction and quits across countries.

9The ordered probit model is discussed in Zavoina and McElvey (1975).

10 The 1991 ISSP asked respondents: "Ifyou were to consider your life in general these days,
how happy or unhappy would you say you axe, on the whole?".
11
   Thirty-eight percent of Hungarians, 23% of East Germans, and 40% of Slovenes are not at all
happy or not very happy compared. to 11% of West Germans, 9% of the British, 8% of
Americans, 7% of the Irish, 10% of New Zealanders, 10% of Norwegians. Only the Italians and
Israelis had reported "not at all" or "not very" happy percentages close to those of the East
Europeans -- 22% for Italians and 21% for Israelis. An ordered probit analysis to estimate
                                                                                           country
effects on happiness, controlling for standard demographic variables yielded negative significant
coefficients on dummy variables for each of the East European countries.

12 Frentzel-Zagorska and Zagorski (1993) analysis of Polish public opinion polls give results that
are consistent with ours. Table 7 in Rose and Haerpfer also show substantial "collectivist values"
in East European countries, though with variation among countries and questions.
