Trade and Workforce Changeover in Brazil

                                              ABSTRACT

Linked employer-employee data for Brazil over a period of large-scale trade liberalization document
two salient workforce changeovers. Within the traded-goods sector, there is a marked occupation downgrading
and a simultaneous education upgrading by which employers fill expanding low-skill intensive occupations
with increasingly educated jobholders. Between sectors, there is a labor demand shift towards the least
and the most skilled, which can be traced back to relatively weaker declines of traded-goods industries
that intensely use low-skilled labor and to relatively stronger expansions of nontraded-output industries
that intensely use high-skilled labor. Whereas these observations are broadly consistent with predictions
of Heckscher-Ohlin trade theory for a low-skill abundant economy, classic trade theory is a less useful
guide to the observed reallocation pattern. Establishment-level regressions show that exporters exhibit
significant employment downsizing. Workforce changeovers are neither achieved through worker
reassignments to new tasks within employers nor are they brought about by reallocations across employers
and traded-goods industries. Instead, trade-exposed industries shrink their workforces by dismissing
less-schooled workers more frequently than more-schooled workers especially in skill-intensive occupations,
while most displaced workers shift to nontraded-output industries or out of recorded employment.
It remains an important task for research to analyze the impact of economic reform on worker separations,
accessions and spell durations outside employment at the individual worker level.

1       Introduction
Linked employer-employee data are uniquely suited to document labor-market re-
sponses to economic reform. The present paper investigates Brazil’s labor demand
changes following its large-scale trade liberalization in the early 1990s. Measures
of labor-demand change document that the workforce in Brazil’s traded-goods sector
simultaneously undergoes an occupation downgrading and an education upgrading.
This workforce changeover is broadly consistent with Heckscher-Ohlin style trade the-
ory for a low-skill abundant economy, whose low-skill intensive activities are predicted
to expand and absorb larger shares of skilled workers to maintain full employment.
Tracing workers across their jobs within establishments, across establishments within
industries, and across firm types and industries in Brazil’s formal sector, documents
how employers achieve the observed workforce changeover. The reallocation pattern
is not what premises of classic trade theory imply: among the displaced workers with a
successful reallocation most shift to nontraded-output industries, but almost as many
displaced workers do not find formal reemployment at an annual horizon.
    The linked employer-employee data source is RAIS (Relação Anual de Informações
Sociais), a comprehensive register of workers formally employed in any sector in Brazil
(including the public sector). The data base is used to administer Brazil’s federal
minimum-wage supplement program and shared across statistical agencies. RAIS
offers information on worker characteristics such as age, gender, and education, and
job characteristics including the wage, dates of hiring and separation, and a detailed
occupational classification that permits inferences about the skill intensity of jobs.
In the present paper, I restrict attention to prime-age workers past their first entry
into the active labor force and to male workers because male workers are known to
exhibit relatively low labor supply elasticities.1 I complement the data with firm-level
information on export status and sector-level information on economic reforms.
    Much emphasis in the literature on job creation and destruction is placed on churn-
ing: gross job creation and destruction at shrinking or expanding employers beyond
their observed net employment changes. Churning is a particular aspect of the re-
allocation process and, from a worker’s perspective, mostly associated with the part
of job spells that are not necessarily related to ultimate reallocations across activities.
By definition, churning is an employer-level phenomenon. The present paper shifts
the focus from the employer to the individual worker and documents several worker-
related aspects of the reallocation process. The importance of churning and excess
turnover in the reallocation process not withstanding, a paramount efficiency concern
for the performance of labor markets is the ultimate reassignment of workers to new
activities.
    Brazil exhibits a shift towards low-skill intensive economic activities following trade
reform. For the least skilled illiterate workers and primary school dropouts, the long-
term trend of dropping demand is strongly reversed during the time of trade liberaliza-
    1
   Statistics are similar in the overall nationwide sample. Statistics and estimates on the overall
sample and alternative subsamples are available from www.econ.ucsd.edu/muendler/research.

tion and results in a net labor-demand increase through 2001. For college graduates
at the upper end of the skill rank, demand surges before and after liberalization es-
pecially in the nontraded sector are so strong that the drop in their demand during
trade liberalization weighs little; a net demand increase prevails through 2001. Inter-
mediate education groups suffer a demand decline in the traded-goods industries that
more than outweighs their moderate demand increase in the nontraded sector. A Katz
and Murphy (1992) decomposition into between-industry and within-industry changes
shows that a large part of the overall evolution is predicted by these between-industry
changes. But there is also a substantial workforce changeover within industries and
across occupations.
    Measuring jobholders’ years of schooling by occupation, and subtracting the mean
years of schooling across all occupations, shows a continuous and steady increase in
net schooling-intensity across all occupations in the traded-goods sector between 1990
and 2001. This workforce changeover is associated with employment shifts from high-
to low-skill intensive occupations, while employers simultaneously fill the low-skill in-
tensive occupations with more and more educated jobholders. Both processes, oc-
cupation downgrading and education upgrading, are reminiscent of an interpretation
of the Heckscher-Ohlin argument applied to occupational activities (instead of indus-
tries). Given Brazil’s relatively low-skill abundant labor force, a Heckscher-Ohlin style
argument would posit that Brazil increasingly specializes in less schooling-intensive
occupations but that the traded-goods sector employs in these expanding low-skill oc-
cupations relatively more high-skilled workers while their relative wage declines by the
Stolper-Samuelson theorem.
    Among several economic reforms—including macroeconomic stabilization, privati-
zation and some capital-account liberalization—, the trade liberalization programme
of 1990 played a dominant role for labor-market outcomes. In multivariate regressions
at the establishment level, I control for employer-fixed and year effects as well as var-
ious variables related to economic reforms and find that an employer’s export status
along with sectoral tariff protection levels exhibits most predictive power for employ-
ment changes. I therefore emphasize trade-related interpretations of labor-demand
changes.
    Beyond conventional labor-demand analysis, the comprehensive linked employer-
employee data for Brazil’s economy as a whole permit the tracking of individual workers
across occupations, establishments, firm types and industries in Brazil’s formal sector.
There is no evidence that employers reallocate workers across tasks in-house in response
to trade reform. The share of in-house job transitions is constant over time, and minor.
Surprisingly, there is also little evidence that the economy reallocates workers across
firms and industries. Trade theory would lead us to expect a shift of displaced workers
from nonexporting firms to exporters following trade reform. The dominant share
of successful reallocations within traded-goods sector is to nonexporters, however, and
this share is dwarfed by reallocations to nontraded-output industries. An equally large
share of displaced workers, of around a third, finds no formal-sector reemployment at
the annual horizon. Taken together, these findings imply that employers pursue the

                                           3
observed workforce changeover by laying off relatively less skilled workers especially
from skill-intensive occupation categories. This form of workforce changeover following
trade reform is potentially associated with important adjustment costs to the economy.
It remains a task for future research to analyze the impact of economic reform on worker
separations, accessions and spell durations outside formal-sector employment.
    In line with the descriptive evidence, but in contrast to what general-equilibrium
trade models with full employment might lead us to expect, a firm’s export status pre-
dicts significant job losses. There is no conclusive evidence, however, that exporting
status is causally related to employment reductions. When firm-level export status
and its interaction with product-market tariffs are instrumented for with sector-year
varying foreign components of the real exchange rate, export status loses its statisti-
cal significance. This speaks to the possible importance of employer-level workforce
heterogeneity and suggests the construction of worker-level hiring and firing samples
in future research.
    While there are only slight differences between metropolitan areas and the nation-
wide average regarding employer characteristics and the sectoral composition of the
labor market, metropolitan labor markets exhibit a markedly faster reallocation suc-
cess. During the sample period, almost two in three successfully reallocated workers in
metropolitan areas find a new job within the month of their separation. In contrast,
only one in seven reallocated workers nationwide is rehired within the same month
of displacement. In metropolitan areas, 95 percent of the successfully reallocated
workers start their new job within twelve months. But only 77 percent of the success-
fully reallocated workers nationwide find new employment nationwide within a year.
These stark differences in labor-market performance could be partly due to the slightly
more diverse size distribution or the more varied workforce composition of employers in
metropolitan areas, or to the somewhat larger nontraded-output sector in metropoli-
tan areas. Further investigations are called for to improve our understanding of the
labor-market specific differences in the reallocation process.
    In related studies to examine the effects of trade liberalization on employment,
Revenga (1992, 1997) finds that import competition reduces net employment at the
sector level in the U.S. and Mexico. Meanwhile, a large part of the literature adopts
the Davis, Haltiwanger and Schuh (1996) approach of generating gross job flow statis-
tics by industry and year and regressing those statistics on measures of trade exposure
and exchange rates. In that line of research, Roberts (1996), for instance, does not
find a strong effect of trade exposure on gross employment flows in Chile and Colom-
bia, once industry characteristics are taken into account. Neither do Davis et al.
(1996) identify a clear effect of trade on factor reallocation using U.S. data. However,
studies that consider exchange rate effects beyond trade exposure, such as Gourinchas
(1999) or Klein, Schuh and Triest (2003), do find systematic effects on employment
flows. Klein et al. (2003) find for the U.S. that job destruction, churning and net
employment growth respond to exchange rate movements, while job creation is unre-
sponsive. In the Brazilian case, Ribeiro, Corseuil, Santos, Furtado, Amorim, Servo
and Souza (2004) compute industry-level rates of job creation and destruction to find

                                           4
that greater openness reduces employment through increased job destruction, with no
effects on job creation, and that exchange rate depreciation increases job creation with
no effect on job destruction. Recently, Haltiwanger, Kugler, Kugler, Micco and Pagés
(2004) use a panel of industries in six Latin American countries to find that a reduction
in tariffs and exchange rate appreciations increase job reallocation within sectors and
that net employment growth tends to decline as trade exposure rises. In contrast
to the lacking evidence on an association between trade exposure and labor-market
outcomes in much of the earlier literature, a firm-level indicator of exporting status in
the employer regressions of this paper shows a highly significant relationship between
exporting status and employment reductions during a period of trade reform, and a
more pronounced association in less tariff-protected sectors. Beyond the prior litera-
ture, the linked employer-employee data of this paper permit the tracking of workers
across activities, employers and industries, and document these novel aspects of the
labor-market response to trade reform.
    The paper is organized in six more sections. Section 2 describes the main linked
employer-employee data source as well as complementary firm and sector data, while
details are relegated to the Appendix. Section 3 presents labor demand changes over
the sample period 1986-2001, discerns between-sector and within-sector changes using
a Katz and Murphy (1992) labor demand decomposition, and documents the workforce
changeover within sectors along educational and occupational dimensions. Section 4
investigates how much of the documented workforce changeover is brought about by
task reassignments within firms, worker reallocations across firms and industries, and
by worker separations without formal-sector reallocations. Multivariate regressions in
Section 5 document the predictive power of exports and trade related regressors com-
pared to competing employer and sector variables. Section 6 looks into labor-market
performance as measured by time to successful reallocation. Section 7 concludes.


2    Linked Employer-Employee Data
A group of particular concern for the labor-market restructuring process are prime-age
male workers. The focus on prime-age male workers is motivated by the intention to
select a worker group with little labor supply elasticity. Most evidence of this paper
nevertheless carries over to the universe of workers across gender and age groups. My
restriction to prime age (of 25 to 64 years) serves to capture workers past their first
entry into the active labor force. Beyond a one-percent nationwide random sample
of prime-age male workers, I also use a five-percent metropolitan random sample of
prime-age male workers to assess regional differences in labor-market outcomes.
    The linked employer-employee data derive from Brazil’s labor force records RAIS
(Relação Anual de Informações Sociais of the Brazilian labor ministry MTE ). RAIS
is a nationwide, comprehensive annual record of workers formally employed in any
sector (including the public sector). RAIS covers, by law, all formally employed



                                           5
workers, captures formal-sector migrants,2 and tracks the workers over time. By
design, however, workers with no current formal-sector employment are not in RAIS.
    RAIS primarily provides information to a federal wage supplement program (Abono
Salarial ), by which every worker with formal employment during the calendar year
receives the equivalent of a monthly minimum wage. RAIS records are then shared
across government agencies and statistical offices. An employer’s failure to report
complete workforce information can, in principle, result in fines proportional to the
workforce size, but fines are rarely issued. In practice, workers and employers have
strong incentives to ascertain complete RAIS records because payment of the annual
public wage supplement is exclusively based on RAIS. The ministry of labor estimates
that well above 90 percent of all formally employed workers in Brazil are covered in
RAIS throughout the 1990s.
    The full data include 71.1 million workers (with 556.3 million job spells) at 5.52
million establishments in 3.75 million firms over the 16-year period 1986-2001. Every
observation is identified by the worker ID (PIS ), the establishment ID (of which the
firm ID is a systematic part), the month of accession, and the month of separation.
Relevant worker information includes tenure at the establishment, age, gender, and
educational attainment; job information includes occupation and the monthly average
wage; establishment information includes sector and municipality classifications. To
facilitate tracking, RAIS reports, along with additional information on separations,
formal retirements and deaths on the job. RAIS identifies the establishment and its
firm, which in turn can be linked to firm information from outside sources such as
export data.
    The sample of this paper derives from a list of all proper worker IDs (11-digit
PIS ) that ever appear in RAIS at the national level, from which I draw a one-percent
nationwide random sample of the IDs and a five-percent metropolitan random sample,
and then track the selected workers through all their formal jobs. Industry information
is based on the subsector IBGE classification (roughly comparable to the NAICS three-
digit level), which is available by establishment over the full period (see Table 10 in
the Appendix for sector classifications). To mitigate potentially spurious reporting, I
remove multiple jobs and retain a worker’s highest paying job observation at any given
point in time.
    Table 1 shows the allocation of workers across industries in 1990 and 1997 (a detailed
employment share breakdown for the RAIS universe can be found in Table 10 in
the Appendix). The nationwide RAIS records represent almost 23 million formally
employed workers of any gender and age in 1990, and more than 24 million formal
workers by 1997. The bulk of Brazil’s formal employment is in manufacturing, services
and other industries (which include construction, utilities and the public sector), with
roughly similar formal employment shares between a quarter and a third of the overall
  2
     Migration among metropolitan workers is substantial. Among the prime-age male workers in
RAIS with a metropolitan job in 1990, for instance, 15 percent have a formal job outside the 1990
city of employment by 1991 and 25 percent by 1993. Similarly, among the metropolitan workers in
1994, 17 percent have a formal job elsewhere by 1995 and 27 percent by 1997.

formal labor force. Commerce (wholesale and retail) employs around one in eight
workers, and the primary sector (agriculture and mining) at most one in twenty-five
workers.
    Prime-age male workers nationwide make up slightly less than half of the total
workforce in 1990 and 1997. In both years, prime-age male workers are slightly more
frequently employed in the primary and manufacturing sector than the average worker
of any gender and age but less frequently in commerce, services and other sectors.
More than half of the RAIS -reported formal employment of prime-age males occurs in
the six metropolitan areas of Brazil: São Paulo city, Rio de Janeiro city, Belo Horizonte,
Porto Alegre, Salvador, and Recife. Compared to the nationwide average across gender
and age, prime-age males in metropolitan areas are slightly less frequently employed
in the primary sector, commerce, and other sectors, and somewhat more frequently
employed in manufacturing and services. Overall, however, the labor allocation across
sector is broadly similar across regions and gender and age groups, whereas changes
over time between 1990 and 1997 are more pronounced. Between 1990 and 1997, there
is a marked drop in formal manufacturing employment, which is accompanied by an
increase of employment in primary sectors, commerce, and especially services. Overall,
between roughly a quarter and a third of the nationwide and metropolitan prime-age
male workforces are employed in traded-goods sectors, and two thirds to three quarters


                                                       7
in nontraded-output sectors.

Complementary firm-level export data. At the firm level, annual customs office
records from SECEX (Secretaria de Comércio Exterior ) for 1990 through 1998 are
used to infer an indicator variable for a firm’s exporting status, which is set to one
when SECEX reports exports of any product from the firm in a given year. I link
the export-status indicator to RAIS at the firm level. SECEX includes merchandize
exports, but not services exports. National accounting data suggest that, during the
1990s, Brazilian services exports were of minor importance.
    Table 1 shows the allocation of prime-age male employment by exporting status of
the employer, and by sector, for the period from 1990 to 2001. Whereas nationwide
only 17 percent of prime-age makes work at exporters, that share is 22 percent in
metropolitan areas. Not surprisingly, the largest share of prime-age male employment
at exporters occurs in the manufacturing sector with more than fifty percent of the
sector’s workforce nationwide and over sixty percent in metropolitan areas. Primary-
goods producers in agriculture and mining employ only 12 percent (nationwide) and
24 percent (metropolitan) of the sector’s workforce—possibly because some of their
exports, especially in agriculture, are channelled through commercial intermediaries.
My focus will therefore lie on the manufacturing industries in the traded-goods sector.
There are merchandize exporters also among the commercial, service and other-sector
firms with employment shares in those sectors between 6 percent (nationwide) and 11
percent (metropolitan). These employment shares are small, however, compared to
those in the primary and manufacturing sectors, and the SECEX data show that those
firms’ exporting status mostly reflects occasional merchandize shipments.

Complementary sector data. Data on ad valorem tariffs by sector and year from
Kume, Piani and Souza (2000) serve as measures of output-market tariffs and, af-
ter combining them with economy-wide input-output matrices (from IBGE ), provide
intermediate-input tariff measures by sector and year. I transform those tariff series
from the Nı́vel 80 level to the subsector IBGE classification available in RAIS by
taking unweighted subsector means over the original Nı́vel 80 data.
    Ramos and Zonenschain (2000) report national accounting data to calculate the
effective rate of market penetration with foreign imports. I define the effective rate
of market penetration as imports per absorption under the assumption that domestic
firms find the absorption market the relevant domestic environment in which they
compete. Foreign direct investment (FDI) inflow data from the Brazilian central bank
(Banco Central do Brasil ) are available for 1986 through 1998.
    I construct sector-specific real exchange rates from the nominal exchange rate to
the U.S. dollar E, Brazilian wholesale price indices Pj (from FGV Rio de Janeiro), and
average foreign price series for groups of Brazil’s main trading partners Pj∗ by sector
j. I define the real exchange rate as qj ≡ EPj∗ /Pj so that a low value means an
appreciated real sector exchange rate. I re-base the underlying price series to a value
of 1 in 1995. Brazil’s import shares from its major 25 trading partners in 1995 are used

3       Economic Reform and Employment Changeovers
Since the late 1980s, Brazil’s federal government initiated a series of economic reforms
that by around 1997 resulted in a considerably more open economy to foreign goods
and investments, a stable macroeconomy, and a somewhat smaller role of the state in
the economy. In 1988, after decades of import substitution and industry protection,
the Brazilian federal government under president Sarney initiated an internal plan-
ning process for trade reform and started to reduce ad valorem tariffs but, lacking
public support, took little legislative initiative to remove binding non-tariff barriers
so that nominal tariff reductions had little effect (Kume et al. 2000). In 1990, the
Collor administration launched a large-scale trade reform that involved both the re-
moval of non-tariff barriers and the adoption of a new tariff structure with lower levels
and smaller cross-sectoral dispersion. Implementation of these policies was largely
completed by 1993.
    Figure 1 depicts Brazil’s product-market and intermediate-input tariff schedules in
1990 and 1997 for the twelve manufacturing industries at the subsector IBGE level.
Intermediate input tariff levels are calculated as re-weighted product tariffs using the
economy-wide input-output matrix. Both the level and the dispersion of tariffs drop

                                                                                                                      9
remarkably between 1990 and 1997. While ad valorem product tariffs range from 21
(metallic products) to 63 percent (apparel and textiles) in 1990, they drop to a range
from 9 percent (chemicals) to 34 percent (transport equipment) in 1997. Except for
paper and publishing in 1990, sectors at the subsector IBGE level receive effective
protection in both years, with mean product tariffs exceeding mean intermediate-input
tariffs. By 1997, however, the relatively homogeneous tariff structure results in a
small rate of effective protections for most industries—with the notable exception of
transport equipment.
    Brazil underwent additional reforms over the sample period. In 1994, during the
Franco administration and under the watch of then finance minister Cardoso, drastic
anti-inflation measures succeeded for the first time in decades. A privatization pro-
gram for public utilities was started in 1991 and accelerated in the mid 1990s, while
Brazil simultaneously liberalized capital-account restrictions. These measures were
accompanied by a surge in foreign direct investment inflows in the mid 1990s. The
pro-competitive reforms during the 1990s, mostly targeted at product markets, had
been preceded by changes to Brazil’s labor-market institutions in 1988. Brazil’s con-
stitution of 1988 introduced a series of labor-market reforms that aimed to increase
workers’ benefits and the right to organize, thus raising labor costs.3 Given their
constitutional status, these labor-market institutions remained unaltered throughout
the sample period.
    Among the reforms, trade liberalization played a dominant role for labor-market
outcomes. Multivariate regressions in Section 5 will control for sector and year effects
as well as variables related to simultaneous reforms and confirm the overwhelming
predictive power of trade liberalization and an employer’s export status for employment
changes. In light of these findings, I emphasize trade-related interpretations of the
labor-demand changes in this and subsequent sections.

Between and within industry demand shifts. Katz and Murphy (1992) derive
a framework to decompose labor demand changes into shifts between industries, as-
sociated with variations in sector sizes given sectoral occupation profiles, and within
industries through changing occupation intensities. The former shifts between indus-
tries relate to the changing allocation of employment across sectors, whereas the latter
shifts within industries reflect the change in relative skill intensities of occupations or
alterations to the sectoral production process. Applying the Katz and Murphy (1992)
framework to employment in the Brazilian formal sector over the years 1986-2001 re-
veals main patterns of labor-market adjustment. The decomposition into between and
within sector variation indicates how two important sources of change contribute to
   3
     The 1988 reforms reduced the maximum working hours per week from 48 to 44, increased the
minimum overtime premium from 20% to 50%, reduced the maximum number of hours in a continuous
shift from 8 to 6 hours, increased maternity leave from 3 to 4 months, increased the value of paid
vacations from 1 to 4/3 of the normal monthly wage, and increased the fine for an unjustified dismissal
from 10% to 40% of the employer-funded severance pay account (FGTS ). See Heckman and Pagés
(2004) and Gonzaga (2003) for further details.


                                                  10
workforce changeover. Between-industry shifts can be though of as driven by changes
in final-goods demands, sectoral differences in factor-nonneutral technical change, and
changes in the sector-level penetration with foreign imports. Within-industry shifts can
be related to factor-nonneutral technical change, factor-price changes for substitutes or
complements to labor, and international trade in tasks which allocates activities along
the value chain across countries.
    The Katz and Murphy (1992) decomposition is designed to measure the degree
of between-industry labor demand change under fixed relative wages, and tends to
understate the true between-industry demand shift in absolute terms when relative
wages change. Though possibly overstating the within-industry effects, the Brazilian
evidence suggests that within-industry demand changes are an important source of
employment changeover in Brazil especially since 1990. Beyond the Katz and Mur-
phy (1992) framework, I therefore offer statistics that document time variation in the
occupation profile within industries, and the skill changeover within occupations.
    Under the assumption that the aggregate production function is concave (so that
the matrix of cross-wage elasticities of factor demands is negative semi-definite), Katz
and Murphy (1992) show that an appropriate between-industry demand shift measure
∆Dk for skill group k is
                                          X       w0 dXj
                                 ∆Dk =       Xjk 0       ,                            (1)
                                           j
                                                  w  X j

where Xjk is the employment of skill group k in industry j, w is the k × 1 vector of
wages, and dXj and Xj are the k × 1 vectors of employment changes and levels in
industry j, respectively. So, this measure is the vector of weighted sums of sector
employments for each skill group, with the weights given by the percentage changes
in the wage bill in each sector at constant wages. Under the assumption of constant
wages, the measure reflects whether the employment data are consistent with stable
labor demands within sectors.
    To implement the measure empirically, I divide the formal-sector economy into 26
two-digits industries (using the subsector IBGE classification) and five occupations
(professional & managerial occupations, technical & supervisory occupations, other
white-collar occupations, skill-intensive blue-collar occupations, and other blue-collar
occupations). The classification of activities into both sectors and occupations is mo-
tivated by the idea that international trade of intermediate and final goods can be un-
derstood as trade in tasks along the steps of the production chain. Using the resulting
130 industry-occupation cells, an empirically attractive version of the between-industry
demand shift measure (1) is

                           ∆D  k
                                    X µ Eik ¶ µ ∆Ei ¶ P αik ∆Ei
                  ∆Xkdi =        =                      = i            ,             (2)
                            Ek       i
                                          E k     E i          Ek

where Ei is total labor input in sector-occupation cell i measured in efficiency units, and
αik ≡ Eik /Ei is skill group k’s share of total employment in efficiency units in sector i
in the base period. Measure (2) expresses the percentage change in demand for each

                                            11
skill group as a weighted average of the percentage changes in sectoral employments
measured, the weights being the group-specific efficiency-unit allocations. Following
Katz and Murphy (1992), I turn index (2) into a measure of relative demand changes
by normalizing all efficiency-unit employments in each year to sum to unity. The base
period is the average of the sample period from 1986 to 2001 so that αik is the share
of total employment of group k in sector i over the 1986-2001 period and Ek is the
average share of skill group k in total employment between 1986 and 2001.
    The overall (industry-occupation) measure of demand shifts for skill group k is de-
fined as ∆Xkdi from equation (2), where i indices the 130 industry-occupation cells. The
between-industry component of this demand-shift measure is defined as the group-k in-
dex ∆Xkdj from equation (2), where i = j now indexes only 26 industries. Accordingly,
the within-industry component of demand shifts is ∆Xkdw ≡ ∆Xkdi − ∆Xkdj .
    Table 2 presents the nationwide demand decomposition and the overall demand
shifts by group of educational attainment for the economy as a whole, and separately
for the traded-goods and the nontraded-output sectors. As in Katz and Murphy
(1992), the percentage changes are transformed into log changes with the formula
 ˆ d = log (1 + ∆X d ). By construction, in the (vertical) sectoral dimension the
∆X   k                 k
economy-wide demand shift indices for each skill group are a weighted sum of the
traded and nontraded sector indices (except for occasional rounding errors because of
the log transformation), where the weights are the skill groups’ shares in the sectors.
In the (horizontal) time dimension, the indices are the sum of the time periods for each
skill group.
    The entries for overall shifts across all sectors summarize Brazil’s labor-demand
evolution (five first rows of column 12). Over the full period from 1986 to 2001, the
least and the most skilled prime-age male workers experience a positive relative demand
shift of 1 and 8 percent, respectively, whereas the three intermediate skill groups suffer
a labor demand drop. This overall pattern, with demand surges at the extreme ends of
the skill spectrum and drops for the middle groups, can be traced back to two overlaying
developments. First, before and after the main economic liberalization episode, that
is in the periods 1986-90 and 1997-2001, demand for college graduates rises by around
5 percent while demand drops for all other skill groups in 1997-2001 and for all other
skill groups but high-school graduates in 1986-90. Second, however, during the period
of economic liberalization between 1990 and 1997 the reverse labor demand change
occurs, with demand for the least-educated males increasing by roughly 5 percent and
dropping for college graduates by -2 percent. The demand rise for the least-educated
during liberalization more than outweighs the demand drops before and after so that
a net demand increase remains by 2001. For college graduates, demand surges before
and after liberalization are so strong that the drop during liberalization is of little
importance and a strong net demand remains by 2001. This pattern is consistent
with a Heckscher-Ohlin interpretation of the specialization pattern following trade
liberalization. Brazil, whose labor force is relatively low-skill abundant, experiences a
shift towards low-skill intensive economic activities between 1990 and 1997—against the
longer-term trend manifested before (1986-90) and after (1997-2001) by which demand

     Source: PRAIS 1986-2001 (1% random sample), male workers, 25 years or older. Overall and between-industry demand shift measures for skill group k are of the form
     ∆Dk = j αjk (∆Ej /Ek ), where αjk is the average share for group k of employment in cell j over the period 1986-2001, Ej is the share of aggregate employment in cell
     j, and Ek is the average share of total employment of group k over the period 1986-2001 (Katz and Murphy 1992). Reported numbers are of the form log(1 + ∆Dk ).
     In the overall measure, j indexes 130 industry-occupation cells; in the between-industry measure, i = j indexes 26 industries (14 traded-goods and 12 nontraded-output
     sectors). The within-industry index for group k is the difference of the overall and between-industry measures. Employment is measured in efficiency units.
for highly skilled workers increases but drops for lower-skilled workers. Between and
within decompositions, as well as a distinction of traded and nontraded sectors, lend
additional support to a Heckscher-Ohlin interpretation of labor demand changes.
    The decomposition for all sectors (five first rows) into between-industry and within-
industry changes indicates that the overall evolution is mostly driven by between-
industry changes, with demand surges at the extreme ends of the skill spectrum and
drops for the middle groups (column 4). In contrast, the within-industry labor demand
changes favor the least skilled the least, with a demand drop of -3 percent, and the
most skilled the most, with a demand increase of 1 to 2 percent for high-school edu-
cated workers and college graduates. The within-industry demand changes are almost
monotonically increasing as we move up the educational attainment ranks (column 8)
in the 1986-2001 period, and would indeed monotonically increase if it were not for a
within-industry drop in demand for college graduates during the liberalization period.
I will return to the within-industry demand changes with additional evidence further
below. In fact, the within-industry workforce changeover will be found to reinforce a
broad Heckscher-Ohlin interpretation of Brazil’s experience.
    A distinction by sector relates the between-industry demand evolution to differences
across traded-goods industries (middle five rows) and nontraded-output industries (last
five rows). In the traded-goods sectors, where trade liberalization is expected to exert
its impact, Brazil experiences a salient labor demand drop—beyond -10 percent for
the three more educated skill groups between 1986 and 2001. Expectedly for a low-
skill abundant country, the demand drop is the strongest for the highly skilled and the
weakest for the low skilled workers (column 4). Most notably, during the liberalization
episode illiterate workers and primary school dropouts experience a rise in demand due
to between-industry shifts, whereas more skilled workers experience demand drops of
monotonically larger magnitudes as we move up the skill ladder (column 2). The
nontraded-output sectors exhibit a relatively homogeneous demand increase between 6
and 8 percent for workers with no college degree and a strong 12-percent increase for
college graduates (column 4). The demand increase for the least skilled in nontraded-
output sectors combined with only a slight demand drop for them in the traded-goods
sectors results in an overall positive demand for the skill group from the between-
industry component (column 4). Similarly, the strong demand for college graduates
in nontraded-output sectors more than outweighs their demand drop in traded-goods
sectors. For intermediate skill groups between these two extremes, the demand drop in
the traded-goods sectors outweighs their demand increase in nontraded-output sectors
and results in overall negative demand changes.
    Within industries there is a clear and pronounced pattern of falling demand for the
least skilled, and increasing demand for the more skilled, with monotonically stronger
demand changes as we move up the skill ranks, except only for college graduates (col-
umn 8). This pattern is similar across both traded and nontraded sectors and most
time periods. The reason for the break in monotonicity at the college-graduate level
(column 8) is a demand drop for this skill group during the liberalization period (col-
umn 6). A Stolper-Samuelson explanation is consistent with the outlier behavior of

collage graduates during this period. Note that the Stolper-Samuelson theorem pre-
dicts wage drops for more educated workers in a low-skill abundant economy after trade
reform, and Gonzaga, Menezes Filho and Terra (2006) document that skilled earnings
differentials indeed narrow over the course of the trade liberalization period. Because
I measure labor in current-period efficiency units, a relative drop in wages for college
educated workers tends to turn their within-industry demand index negative. With
this explanation for the outlier behavior of collage graduates in view, there is a striking
monotonicity in the increase in within-industry labor demand change as we move up
the skill ranks.

Within-industry employment changeovers. The demand decompositions above
show a noteworthy within-industry labor demand reduction for low-skilled workers and
a demand increase for high-skilled workers both in traded-goods and nontraded-output
sectors. The sources of this change deserve more scrutiny. Abandoning the efficiency-
unit perspective on employment in favor of counts of workers to keep wage effects
separate, I turn to an assessment of labor allocation to activities by period.4
    Figure 2 shows the evolution of the skill assignment by occupation over time. In
both traded-goods and nontraded-output sectors, there is a marked increase across all
five occupation categories in the educational attainment of the job holders. From 1986
to 2001, the mean number of years of schooling in unskilled blue-collar occupations
rises from below four years to more than five years in both traded and nontraded
sectors (in traded sectors schooling in unskilled blue-collar occupations even slightly
exceeds the schooling in skilled blue-collar jobs by 2001). The average number of

Figure 3: Difference between schooling intensity of occupations and annual
mean schooling level


school years increases from around four to more than five years for skilled blue-collars
jobs in traded sectors and to more than six years in nontraded sectors by 2001. For
unskilled white-collar occupations, the average job holder’s schooling goes from around
six to more than eight years both in traded and nontraded goods sectors. The shift
also extends to technical and supervisory positions, where the average job holder’s
schooling goes from less than ten to more than ten years of schooling both in traded
and nontraded sectors, and to managerial positions, where mean schooling rises from
eleven to almost twelve years over the period 1986-2001. These largely steady within-
industry changeovers in workers’ occupational assignments between 1986-2001 overlay
the shorter-lived between-industry changes with much time variation across the three
subperiods 1986-90, 1990-97 and 1997-01.
    One might suspect that the considerable surge in schooling levels is partly due to
labor supply changes such as the entry of increasingly educated cohorts of male workers
into the labor force, or relatively more frequent shifts of skilled male workers from
informal to formal work status over the sample period. In fact, the sector-wide average
schooling level rises from less than six to more than six years in the traded-goods sector,
and in the nontraded-output sector from more than six to more than eight years (as the
respective overall curves in Figure 2 show). To control for overall skill labor supply by
sector, I extend the Katz and Murphy (1992) idea to the present context and subtract
the mean annual years of schooling in a sector from the occupation-specific means in
the sector. For this purpose, I consider all traded-goods industries as one sector, and
all nontraded-output industries as another sector. Subtracting the annual mean years
of schooling, instead of dividing by the annual total as in Table 2 before, preserves
the cardinal skill measure of years of schooling and expresses occupation-specific skill
demands as deviations from the sector-wide employment evolution in terms of years of

                                                                                                          16
schooling.
    Figure 3 presents average years of schooling by occupation, less the sector-wide
mean schooling across all occupations. By this measure, skill demand within every
occupation category increases in the traded-goods sector since 1990: from a difference
of -1.6 to -0.9 years in unskilled blue-collar occupations, from -1.2 to -1.1 years in
skilled blue-collar occupations, from 0.8 to 1.7 in unskilled white-collar jobs, from 3.9
to 4.4 in technical jobs, and from 4.9 to 5.4 in professional and managerial positions.
For all three white-collar occupation categories, the schooling-intensity surge beyond
the sector average since 1990 is a reversal of the opposite trend prior to 1990, while
schooling-intensity continually increases for blue-collar occupations in the traded sec-
tor since 1986. By construction, the persistent occupation-level increases in worker
schooling since 1990 go beyond the change in the sector-wide workforce schooling. The
puzzling pattern that changes beyond the sector mean are uniformly directed towards
higher schooling in every single occupation since 1990 suggests that there must be an
employment expansion in less skill-intensive occupations—otherwise it would be impos-
sible for every single occupation category to exhibit a faster skill-intensity increase than
the average over all occupations. In contrast to the traded sector, nontraded-output
industries do not exhibit the uniform pattern of schooling increases across all occupa-
tions but a drop in schooling intensity in the technical and managerial occupations,
and a rise in schooling intensity in skilled blue-collar occupations.
    The evolution of schooling intensity in Brazil’s traded-goods sector is reminiscent
of a Heckscher-Ohlin interpretation as well—though not for industries but for tasks.
Think of production activities in the Heckscher-Ohlin framework not as sectors but
as occupations and suppose that Brazil has a relatively less schooled labor force than
its main trading partners. Brazil’s top five trading partners in total trade volume
during the 1990s are, in descending order, the U.S., Argentina, Germany, Italy and
Japan. As Brazil’s integration into the world economy advances, thus reinterpreted
Heckscher-Ohlin trade theory predicts that Brazil increasingly specializes in less school-
ing intensive occupations but that Brazil employs in these expanding occupations rel-
atively more high-skilled workers because their relative wage declines. Gonzaga et
al. (2006) document that Brazil’s skilled earnings differential narrows over the 1990s.
Of course, more research is required to discern this reinterpretation of classic trade
theory from alternative explanations. The simultaneous schooling-intensity increase
in every single occupation, above and beyond the sector mean, could also be related to
factor-nonneutral technical change or factor-price changes for substitutes to labor, and
not only to international trade in tasks. Yet, the prediction of reinterpreted classic
trade theory that foreign trade expands less schooling-intensive occupations in Brazil’s
traded-goods sector is fully consistent with the data.
    Figure 4 depicts the nationwide occupation profile within traded-goods sectors and
nontraded-output sectors for the years 1986 to 2001. In traded-goods industries, skilled
blue-collar jobs expand markedly with the conclusion of the first wave of trade reforms
between 1991 and 1993. The share of skilled blue-collar occupations increases from
below 60 percent in 1990 to 68 percent in 1994 and to 71 percent by 2001. Recall

from the evidence in Figure 2 that the average worker’s schooling in both skilled and
unskilled blue-collar jobs in the traded-goods sector is roughly the same. The growing
importance of skilled blue-collar occupations comes at the expense of all other occu-
pations in the traded-goods industries. At the low-skill intensity end, the share of
unskilled blue-collar occupations drops from more than 13 percent in 1990 to 8 percent
in 1994 (but recovers slightly to close to 9 percent by 2001). More importantly, the ex-
pansion of skilled blue-collar occupations in traded-goods sectors comes at the expense
of white-collar occupations, whose total employment share drops from 27 percent in
1990 to 24 percent in 1994 and 20 percent in 2001. In the nontraded-output sectors,
in contrast, it is the unskilled blue-collar occupation category that expands the fastest
from 13 percent in 1990 to close to 16 percent by 2001, whereas skilled blue-collar jobs
are cut back from a share of 34 in 1990 to around 29 percent by 1997. Similarly, within
white-collar occupations it is again the less skill-intensive occupations that exhibit a
relative gain: the share of unskilled white-collar workers rises from 16 to 18 percent
between 1990 and 1995 (with a crawling scale-back to 17 percent until 2001), and the
share of technical occupations increases from 20 in 1990 to 21 percent in 1995. But
the share of professional and managerial positions remains roughly constant between
16 and 17 percent, thus losing in relative importance to less skill-intensive white-collar
occupations.
     This shift across the occupation profile towards less skill-intensive occupations per-
mits a skill-upgrading workforce changeover, by which less skill-intensive jobs are being
filled with more educated workers especially in the traded-goods sector. In practice,
employers can achieve this workforce changeover in many ways. Employers can ei-
ther reallocate workers across tasks in-house, or the economy can reallocate workers
across firms and sectors, or there may be no reallocation for extended periods of time
if employers pursue the workforce changeover by laying off less skilled workers from

sector. The latter form of workforce changeover would arguable be associated with
considerable adjustment costs to the economy.


4       Worker Reallocations across Activities
Labor-demand decompositions so far have shown that there are two main components
to the observed workforce changeover in Brazil over the sample period. First, there is
a labor demand shift towards the least and the most skilled male workers, which can be
traced back to relatively weaker declines of traded-goods industries that intensely use
low-skilled labor and to relatively stronger expansions of nontraded-output industries
that intensely use higher-skilled labor. Second, there is a within-industry shift towards
longer-schooled workers, associated with a skill-upgrading of all occupations in traded-
goods industries. To track how employers achieve the observed workforce changeover
during the sample period, I exploit the comprehensive linked employer-employee data
for Brazil’s economy to trace individual workers across their jobs within establishments,
across establishments within sectors, and across firm types and sectors in Brazil’s formal
sector.

Reallocations across tasks. Employers may choose to reallocate workers across
tasks in-house. For this purpose, I define an in-house job change as a change in
employment between an occupation at the CBO base-group level to another base-group
occupation. The 354 CBO base groups roughly correspond to the 4-digit ISCO-88
occupations at the unit-group level.5 Table 3 shows both continuing and displaced
workers and tracks the workers through jobs at the annual horizon between 1986 and
1997. The task assignment pattern is remarkably stable both before and after trade
liberalization. Between 86 and 87 percent of formal-sector prime-age male workers

are assigned to new occupations within the same establishment. Less than one percent
of the workers switches establishments within the same firm. Between 7 and 9 percent
of the workers change employing firm at the annual horizon. So, the bulk of successful

trace the reallocations between exporters and nonexporters and across sectors shortly.

I will also turn to those failed reallocations shortly. Overall, the stable and minor
percentages of occupation and establishment reassignments within employers suggest
that the observed workforce changeovers, documented in the preceding section, are not
achieved through job reassignments in internal labor markets.

Reallocations across firms and sectors. Between 1990 and 1998, around 6 percent
of the formal-sector workforce nationwide is employed at primary-sector nonexporters,
one percent at primary-sector exporters, 11 percent at manufacturing nonexporters,
and 12 percent at manufacturing exporters. The remaining seventy percent of the
workforce are employed in the nontraded sector. I now look beyond internal labor
markets and investigate whether and how the relative expansion of certain traded-goods
industries, in the wake of an overall decline of the traded-goods sector, is associated with
reallocations of individual workers across firms and sectors. To capture differences in
the labor demand responses across subsectors and firms within the traded-goods sector,
I track individual workers across exporting and nonexporting employers in the primary
and manufacturing industries.
    Table 4 shows worker transitions between firms and sectors over the first year after
trade reform, between their last observed formal-sector employment in 1990 and their
last observed formal-sector employment in 1991. Only workers who experience a sep-

aration from their last employment of the year are included in the transition statistics.
Trade theory might lead us to expect a shift of displaced workers from nonexporting
firms to exporters following trade reform. The dominant share of successful realloca-
tions of former nonexporter workers within the traded-goods industries, however, is to
nonexporters again. Among the former nonexporter workers displaced from primary-
sector employment, close to 11 percent are rehired at primary nonexporters and 10
percent at manufacturing nonexporters, but less than two percent shift to exporters.
Among the former nonexporter workers in manufacturing, 19 percent move to manufac-
turing nonexporters and 7 percent no manufacturing exporters, and a very small share
to primary-sector firms. Former exporter workers, in contrast, mostly transition to
new formal-sector jobs within the sector of displacement and are roughly equally likely
to find reemployment at an exporter or a nonexporter. These patterns suggest that
reallocations within the traded goods sectors are mostly intra-sector reallocations from
exporter to exporter and from nonexporter to nonexporter—contrary to what classic
trade theory with full employment and only traded goods might lead us to expect.
    In the initial year after trade reform, between one third and two-fifths of displaced
traded-sector workers with a successful reallocation end up in nontraded-sector jobs.
An equally large fraction, however, fails to experience a successful reallocation to any
formal-sector job within the following calendar year (retirements, deaths, and workers
at or past retirement age are excluded from the displaced worker sample).6 Of the
workers with a failed reallocation before year-end 1990, by far the largest fraction (of
78 percent) with a successful reallocation by year-end 1991 finds employment in the
nontraded-sector. In summary, at the time of the largest impact of trade liberaliza-
   6
    The slightly smaller unaccounted percentage in Table 3 compared to the reallocation failure rates
in Tables 4 and 5 is largely due a restriction of the initial sample to workers with comprehensive
occupation information in Table 3.



                                                       21
tion in 1990-91, traded-goods industries exhibit little absorptive capacity for displaced
workers compared to nontraded-output industries and compared to the prevalence of
failed transitions out of the formal sector. Among those failed reallocations can be
transitions to informal work, unemployment, or withdrawals from the active labor force,
which are not directly observed in the RAIS records.
    In comparison, Table 5 tracks annual transitions six years after the beginning of
trade liberalization and three years after its conclusion. By 1996-97, more firm and
sector reallocations from the primary sector are directed to jobs within the traded-
goods sector. In the manufacturing sector, however, the dominant destination sector
of displaced workers remains the nontraded sector in 1996-97, both for workers from
exporters and for workers from nonexporters. As in the initial period 1990-91, in
1996-97 former nonexporter workers most frequently find reemployment at nonexporter
firms, and former exporter workers are roughly equally likely to find reemployment at
exporter and nonexporter firms in manufacturing but less likely to transition to an
exporter in the primary sector. By 1996-97, an even larger fraction of displaced
primary-sector workers than in 1990-91 fails to experience a successful formal-sector
reallocation and a roughly equally large share of former manufacturing workers as in
1990-91 fails to find a formal-sector job within the following calendar year.
    Together with the evidence on infrequent task reassignments in-house, these labor-
market transitions suggest that the observed workforce changeovers from the preceding
section are neither achieved through worker reallocations within employers nor are they
brought about by labor reallocations across employers and sectors. By exclusion, the
remaining explanation is that formal-sector employers in the traded-goods industries
shrink their workforces by dismissing less-schooled workers more frequently than more
schooled workers while the thus displaced workers fail to find reemployment at least
at the annual horizon. In the aggregate, the lacking traded-sector reallocations result
in a considerable decline of formal manufacturing employment from 26 to 22 percent
(Table 1). The simultaneous expansion of nontraded-output industries can partly be
driven by a long-term shift from primary to manufacturing to services activities in the
economy, or by Brazil’s overvalued real exchange rate during the sample period, or
by foreign direct investment (FDI) flows in the wake of Brazil’s concomitant capital-
account liberalization and privatization programme, by trade liberalization, or by a
combination of these changes. I turn to the predictive power of these competing
explanations and their associated variables in the next section. In the then following
section, I return to the issue of reallocation durations beyond the annual horizon.


5    Establishment Workforce Changes
While the timing of labor-demand changes, workforce changeovers and variations in the
reallocation pattern is suggestive of the role that trade reform may play for the labor
market, it remains to investigate the predictive power of competing policy variables.
For this purpose, I aggregate the universe of employment records on December 31st


                                           22
to the establishment level and turn to a employer-level version of the linked employer-
employee data by retaining all establishments that employ at least one worker from
the nationwide and metropolitan random worker samples in the preceding sections.
Employer-level regressions are most closely comparable to prior evidence (Davis et al.
1996, Ribeiro et al. 2004). The interest lies on employment change at the establishment
level and its covariation with various policy variables during the 1990-97 period. I
restrict attention to manufacturing industries, where the bulk of Brazil’s traded-goods
sector employment occurs.

Statistical model. Consider the regression model
                  `k,t+1 − `kt = 1(exp kt )β + zjt γ + xkt δ + αk + αt + ²kt             (3)
for employment change `k,t+1 − `kt at establishment k conditional on an indicator
1(exp kt ) whether establishment k belongs to an exporting firm at time t, sector-level
control variables zjt for establishment k’s sector j, and establishment-level variables xkt ,
where αk are time-invariant establishment-fixed effects, αt are establishment-invariant
time effects, and ²kt is a well-behaved error term. The sector-level variables zjt include
predictors related to Brazil’s time-varying trade regime. In the regression sample, t
spans 1990 to 1997.
    A concern is whether predictors can be causally related to employment changes.
Establishment-fixed effects subsume sector-fixed effects and thus remove potentially
confounding sector differences in labor-market consequences from the constitutional
changes to labor-market institutions prior to trade reform. Recall that Brazil’s abrupt
trade policy shift in 1990, though surprisingly implemented by the executive and largely
designed in the absence of private-sector consultations, hits previously highly protected
industries with the strongest tariff reductions so that the tariff dispersion drops—thus
turning trade policy into an endogenous instrument, potentially correlated with sec-
toral labor-market differences. Similarly, differences in establishment-level employ-
ment growth rates may be related to export status not only through an employer’s
export status itself. Drawing on prior work in Muendler (2004), I use as instrumental
variables (IVs) foreign components of the real exchange rate. These components are:
the U.S. PPI by industry, the PPI of select Western European countries by industry,
the OECD-wide PPI by industry, and a worldwide mix of WPI and PPI for Brazil’s
twenty-five major trading partners for all OECD countries. These foreign prices are
plausibly exogenous to Brazil’s price and cost evolution. These four sector and time
varying instrumental variables are used to predict the export indicator 1(exp.kt ) and
its interaction with product tariffs as well as the product tariff and intermediate-input
tariff (in zjt ). Brazil’s nominal exchange rate is not an instrument for model 3 because
time variation is already controlled for with year indicators. Four instrumental vari-
ables for these four potentially endogenous predictors make the model just identified.
I retain the sector real exchange rate itself among the predictors in zjt because its vari-
ation depends on Brazil’s sectoral (wholesale) price index beyond the four instrumental
variables.

Data and estimates. As Table 6 shows, the nationwide mean manufacturing estab-
lishment between 1990 and 1997 reduces employment by 2.5 workers over the course
of the subsequent year (1991-98), and the mean metropolitan establishment cuts em-
ployment by a net number of 2.6 workers. Though slightly higher in levels, there is
less dispersion in net employment changes across metropolitan establishments. Six-
teen percent of the establishments belong to an exporting firm both nationwide and
in metropolitan areas (but average employment at metropolitan exporters is larger,
recall Table 1). Not conditioning on exports status, the average size of metropolitan
establishments is below nationwide average with 16.3 workers (2.792 in logs) compared
to 17.7 (2.876 in logs), while the size dispersion is wider in metropolitan areas than
nationwide. Metropolitan establishments retain their workers slightly longer than na-
tionwide average, resulting in a higher mean tenure at the establishment, and show both
more educated workforces and a more skill-intensive occupation profile. Metropoli-
tan manufacturing establishments produce in slightly less tariff protected sectors and
in sectors with slightly higher levels of foreign penetration. In summary, metropoli-
tan manufacturing establishments face somewhat tougher foreign competition and are
slightly smaller and more skilled, but metropolitan establishments are more diverse
along several dimensions.

tive specifications. All specifications condition on establishment and year fixed ef-
fects. Sector-level tariff variables have no statistically significant predictive power
when included by themselves in the first specification. Establishment-level variables
are salient predictors in terms of statistical significance. Large establishments in terms
of log employment grow significantly less in the subsequent year, establishments with
high-tenure workers (and thus high worker retention rates) grow significantly more.
Establishments that have a larger share of professional occupations or a larger share of
unskilled white-collar occupations add to their workforces during the 1990-97 period,
whereas establishments with a larger share of skilled blue-collar occupations add fewer
workers to the workforce (unskilled blue-collar occupations are the omitted category).
Taken together with the prior evidence that the share of blue-collar occupations ex-
pands in the traded-goods sector, these findings suggest that workforce changeovers
are largely driven by more than proportional worker layoffs from high-skill occupations
at low-skill intensive employers. The overall goodness of fit of merely .6 percent indi-
cates that the bulk of the variation in establishment-level employment changes remains
unexplained. These findings remain unaltered as the specifications become richer.
    Including additional sector variables related to Brazil’s international economic inte-
gration and industrial structure does not result in better predictive power of tariffs in
specification 2. Import penetration partly captures unobserved non-tariff barriers, the
sectoral real exchange rate controls for sector variation in Brazil’s relative prices beyond
the time variation of the year fixed effects, FDI flows into the sample manufacturing
sectors partly measure the effect of capital-account liberalization and privatization on
employment changes, and Herfindahl concentration indices approximate domestic com-
petitive conditions. No single sector variable is a statistically significant predictor of
establishment-level employment changes itself, and neither are tariff variables good pre-
dictors. The lacking statistical significance stands in surprising contrast to the salient
correlation of these regressors with firm-level productivity in Brazil’s manufacturing
sector (Muendler 2004).
    The establishment’s parent-firm export-status, however, is a significant predictor
of employment change once included in specification 3. Being an exporter predicts a
net employment loss of more than two workers, a substantial number given the mean
establishment size of 16 workers. Contrary to what classic trade theory might lead
us to anticipate, exporter establishments significantly reduce their workforces over the
1990-97 period. The predicted employment loss at exporters between 1990 and 1997
needs to be qualified, however, as the interaction of tariff protection with exporting
status is a significant control variable (specification 4). The typical exporter cuts al-
most nine jobs in an unprotected sector with zero tariffs, but tariff protection mitigates
the effect. Given a .11 standard deviation of product-market tariffs in the nationwide
sample, the point estimate on the interaction term implies that raising tariffs by a
standard deviation reduces the predicted job loss at exporters by four jobs from al-
most nine to under five jobs lost. At the sample mean product-market tariff level of
.19, the mean exporter has a predicted job loss of 2.1 jobs. There is no conclusive
evidence, however, that exporting status is causally related to employment reductions.

When firm-level export status and its interaction with product-market tariffs (as well
as product and intermediate-input tariffs) are instrumented for with sector-year vary-
ing foreign components of the real exchange rate (specification 5), export status loses
its statistical significance.7 Yet, there is no evidence against the causal impact of ex-
porting status on employment changes either in that the sign remains negative and the
point estimate increases in absolute value. Establishment heterogeneity in unobserved
workforce composition, or other unobserved sources of heterogeneity, may be associated
with both exporting status and employment change and could hamper identification
in the IV approach.
    I estimate model 3 also for the metropolitan sample. Table 8 presents the results.
Sign patterns and point estimates are remarkably similar between the nationwide and
the metropolitan samples. The predicted number of lost jobs at exporters in un-
protected sectors (with zero tariffs) is now eight—with a standard-deviation increase
in tariffs predicting three lost jobs less or around five lost jobs after a one-standard
deviation increase. At the sample mean product-market tariff, exporting status pre-
dicts a net job loss of 2.2 jobs, slightly above the nationwide average because of a
lower tariff protection effect. Similar to the nationwide results, an IV approach raises
point estimates but shows no statistically significant effect of exporting status on net
employment change.
    In principle, linked employer-employee data also permit the construction of estima-
tion samples that trace changes to establishment-level employment through hires and
fires at the job level. The construction of according estimation samples is a promising
path for future research in that such samples make it possible to control for establish-
ments’ workforce heterogeneity at the individual worker and job level. A remaining
concern of this paper is what consequences the documented trade regime changes may
have for labor-market outcomes.


6       Labor Market Performance
Most evidence so far suggests that the metropolitan areas of Brazil are strikingly similar
to the national average. If anything, the lower levels of tariff protection in the sec-
tors of the typical metropolitan exporters and the higher levels of import penetration
(Table 6) would suggest a stronger impact of trade reform on labor-market perfor-
mance. Accordingly, establishment level regressions in the preceding section predict
that, at the sample mean, exporters reduce employment by 2.2 jobs in metropolitan
areas but only by 2.1 jobs nationwide. On the other hand, metropolitan areas have
a somewhat larger services sector in employment terms (Table 1), and a majority of
displaced manufacturing workers with successful formal-sector reallocations shifts to
    7
    F test statistics for the predictive power of the four instrumental variables are above values of
1,000 for the two endogenous sector-level regressors (product-market and intermediate-input tariffs)
and above 100 for the two endogenous firm-level regressors (export status and its interaction with
product-market tariffs).

services. Metropolitan establishments also exhibit more diversity (as measured by
standard deviations) in terms of employment size and the skill composition of their
workforces (Table 6). Inasmuch as the presence of a larger services sector or the di-
versity of manufacturing establishments are conducive to faster re-absorptions, it is an
open question whether the stronger exposure of the metropolitan areas in Brazil to
the international economy would result in a better or worse labor-market performance
following trade liberalization.
    The empirical answer is unambiguous. In order to measure times to successful re-
allocation, I take a sample of workers with a separation at any time between 1990 and
1997 and track whether they are successfully rehired into a formal-sector job within
the 48 months following their separation. Table 9 shows that almost two in three
successfully reallocated workers in metropolitan areas find a new job within the month
of their separation. In contrast, only one in seven workers nationwide is successfully
rehired within the same month of displacement. In metropolitan areas, 95 percent of
the successfully reallocated workers start their new job within twelve months. But
only 77 percent of the successfully reallocated workers nationwide find new employ-
ment nationwide within a year, 13 percent need up to two years, six percent need
up to three years and four percent need up to four years. There is a slight wors-
ening in the time-to-reallocation in both metropolitan and nationwide labor markets
between 1990 and 1997 but this time variation is small compared to the substantial
regional differences. In short, metropolitan labor markets perform considerably faster
in the reallocation process even though evidence in the earlier sections shows only small
differences between the metropolitan employer and employee characteristics and the
nationwide characteristics.
    Two candidate explanations for the substantial difference between metropolitan and
national labor markets, consistent with the documented evidence in this paper, are the
presence of a larger services sector and the diversity of the manufacturing establish-
ments in metropolitan areas. The differences along these two dimensions seem small,
however, to give rise to the considerable differences in labor-market performance across

regions, and more research into the functioning of labor-market adjustment seems war-
ranted for an understanding of the economic performance after pro-competitive re-
forms.


7     Conclusions
This paper documents the changes to labor demand and workforce composition that
accompany Brazil’s large-scale trade reform in the early 1990s. Several aspects of
the labor-market adjustment and workforce changeover in traded-goods industries are
broadly consistent with the insights of Heckscher-Ohlin trade theory. Being a low-skill
abundant country relative to its main trading partners, Brazil exhibits a shift towards
sectors that intensely use low-skilled labor. Within sectors, Brazil shifts towards low-
skill intensive occupations and fills those occupations with relatively better schooled
workers—just as a Stolper-Samuelson argument applied to occupational activities in-
stead of sectors would suggest. The setting of classic trade theory in a context of full
employment within traded-goods industries is a less useful guide to Brazil’s evidence,
however. Among the displaced traded-goods sector workers with a successful realloca-
tion, most shift to nontraded-output industries and almost as many displaced workers
do not find formal reemployment at an annual horizon. Unexpectedly, regressions show
that exporter establishments exhibit a significant employment downsizing over the pe-
riod following trade liberalization, controlling for a large set of other establishment-level
and sector-level predictors as well as establishment and year effects.
    Though a firm’s exporting status is a significant predictor of employment downsiz-
ing, an instrumental-variable approach provides neither evidence in favor nor against
a causal interpretation of this prediction. Substantial workforce heterogeneity may
affect the prediction. To control for the heterogeneity in workforce characteristics,
linked employer-employee data can be used to construct worker-level samples and as-
sess separations from and accessions to employers at the individual job level in future
research. Although Brazil’s metropolitan labor markets only slightly differ from the
national average in sectoral composition and establishment-level diversity, workers ex-
perience much shorter times to successful reallocation. The striking but unexplained
difference points to the limits in our current understanding of labor-market adjustment
following large-scale pro-competitive reform.

Appendix
Brazilian law requires all Brazilian establishments to submit detailed annual reports
with individual information on their workers and employees to the ministry of labor
(Ministério de Trabalho, MTE ). Data collection is typically concluded at the parent
firm by March following the year of observation.

Screening. In RAIS, workers are identified by individual-specific PIS (Programa de
Integração Social) IDs that are similar to social security numbers in the U.S. (but
PIS IDs are not used for identification purposes other than the administration of the
wage supplement program Abono Salarial ). A given establishment may report the
same PIS ID multiple times within a single year in order to help the worker withdraw
deposits from the worker’s severance pay savings account (Fundo de Garantia do Tempo
de Serviço, FGTS ) through spurious layoffs and rehires. Moreover, bad compliance
causes certain PIS IDs to be recorded incorrectly or repeatedly. To handle these
issues, I screen the census records as follows. (1) Observations with PIS IDs having
fewer than 11 digits are removed. These correspond to either informal (illegal) workers
or measurement error from faulty bookkeeping. (2) Multiple employments with the
same accession and separation date at the same employer are removed. For a worker
with such multiple employments, I only keep the observation with the highest average
monthly wage level (in cases of wage level ties, I drop duplicate observations randomly).

Age, education and occupation. The following tables present age and education
classifications from RAIS. I use the age range information in RAIS to infer the “typ-
ical” age of a worker in the age range as follows.

                              RAIS Age Category        Imputed Age
                         1.   Child (10-14)              excluded
                         2.   Youth (15-17)              excluded
                         3.   Adolescent (18-24)         excluded
                         4.   Nascent Career (25-29)        27
                         5.   Early Career (30-39)         34.5
                         6.   Peak Career (40-49)          44.5
                         7.   Late Career (50-64)           57
                         8.   Post Retirement (65-)      excluded


For much of the analysis, I reduce the number of education categories for presentation
and I regroup the nine education categories included in RAIS to correspond to five
categories as shown below. Some statistical applications require a continuous years-of-
schooling variable, which is defined as follows.

    The occupation indicator variables are obtained from the CBO classification codes
in RAIS, and are reclassified to conform to the ISCO-88 categories. For a description
of the Brazilian occupation classification system CBO and a mapping to ISCO-88, see
Muendler et al. (2004). In the available RAIS version for the nation as a whole, CBO
classes are only reported at the three-digit level. I adjust the mapping from CBO to
ISCO-88 accordingly. For most of the aggregate analysis, I ultimately map ISCO-88
categories to occupation levels as follows:


           ISCO-88 Category                                     Occupation Level
