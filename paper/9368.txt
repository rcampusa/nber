Financial Sector Profitability and Double-Gearing

NBER Working Paper No. 9368

                                           ABSTRACT

       In this paper, I show that Japan will not be able to have a viable banking sector without
stopping deflation. The banking industry has not shown a profit since fiscal 1993 (ended March
1994) if one excludes capital gains from stock and real estate portfolios. I quantify the financial
condition of the sector and show that interest margins have been too low to cover the increase in
loan losses brought about by the weak economy.

       Banks cannot raise margins for several reasons: competition with subsidized government
sponsored financial institutions (GFIs); intense political pressure, backed by the Financial Services
Agency (FSA), to make new loans to small and medium companies; and deflation-weakened
borrowers. I expect that the Japanese government will have to nationalize most of the banking sector
by 2005. Capital injections will not solve the problems.

       Established Japanese life insurance companies are also troubled because they over-promised
the amount that they could pay. This can be corrected through a reorganization where the promised
interest rates are cut. But this is complicated because Japanese banks and life insurance companies
are providing each other capital – a practice called double-gearing. Weakened banks ask insurance
companies to provide equity capital and subordinated loans. In return, the mutual life insurers ask
banks to subscribe their surplus notes (similar to non-voting redeemable preferred shares) and
subordinated debt. The risks of double-gearing are analyzed.

The Japanese economy's average annual real growth rate was only 0.8% from 1991 to 2001.
Reflecting the weak economy, Japan has not been able to restore stability in its financial
sector even though more than a decade has passed since the 1980s bubble. The Bank of
Japan (BOJ) has had a zero nominal interest rate policy most of the time since February 1999,
but it has been ineffective because of deflation. By the end of 2001, the GDP deflator was
about 7% below its 1994 peak when adjusted for the 1997 consumption tax hike. The index
was falling at annual rate of 1.5% at the end of 2001. Given the estimated 6% deflationary
GDP gap and expected negative real growth in 2002, deflation is likely to accelerate to more
than 2.0% by early 2003. (See JCER 2002, ch 1).
         In this chapter, I show that Japan will not be able to have a viable banking sector
without stopping deflation. The banking industry has not shown a profit since fiscal 1993
(ended March 1994) if one excludes capital gains from stock and real estate portfolios.
Interest margins have been too low to cover the increase in loan losses brought about by the
weak economy.
         Banks cannot raise margins for several reasons: competition with subsidized
government sponsored financial institutions (GFIs); intense political pressure, backed by the
Financial Services Agency (FSA), to make new loans to small and medium companie s; and
deflation-weakened borrowers. I expect that the Japanese government will have to
nationalize most of the banking sector by 2005. Capital injections will not solve the
problems.
         Established Japanese life insurance companies also face a serious situation. In the
1980s and early 1990s they promised high minimum yields on long-term contracts. For
whatever reason, the companies did not match these long-term liabilities with long-term
fixed- income investments. Under the BOJ zero- interest rate policy, insurers thus are
suffering large negative carry. (Carry is the industry term for the difference between a
product's income and its associated costs).
         A complicating factor in this dire picture is banks and life insurance companies
providing each other capit al – a practice called double-gearing. Weakened banks ask
insurance companies to provide equity capital and subordinated loans. In return, the mutual
life insurers ask banks to subscribe their surplus notes (similar to non-voting redeemable
preferred shares) and subordinated debt. When Chiyoda Life failed in October 2000, Tokai
Bank lost ¥74 billion. The Financial Services Agency (FSA) actively encourages this
dangerous practice. Thus, Shokichi Takagi, Director of FSA's Supervision Department, has
                                             2
    publicly stated that double-gearing among financial institutions is highly beneficial to
    enhance public confidence (Nihon Keizai Shinbun, 27 Nov 2001).
             The life insurers' problem is easier to solve than the banks' problem. Using a
    reorganization procedure, life insurance companies can fail, and cut promised interest rates
    on their policies. On the other hand, banks runs would ensue if the government did not
    fully pay the depositors of a failed large bank because a large part of the banking sector is
    either insolvent or very nearly so. In such a situation, the government would have to bear
    the full brunt of defaulting loans at a time when its own debt to GDP ratio is rising by 10
    percentage points a year. If things continue as they are, the Japanese government is unlikely
    to maintain investment-grade credit ratings on its bonds.
             The chapter continues with an analysis of banks' bad loans and their under-reserving
    for them. The deteriorating condition of banks is then considered, and the causes of bank
    unprofitability examined. As part of this, the effects of deregulation and the role of
    government-sponsored financial institutions is considered. Turning to life insurance
    companies, their problems and weak supervision are discussed. The risks of the banks and
    insurers engaging in double-gearing is then analyzed.



1   Banks' Bad Loans


    Table 1 and Table 2 show data on problem loans of Japanese banks. Japanese banks have
    acknowledged ¥82 trillion in losses from bad loans for the ten years through March 2002.
    In spite of this enormous loss, they still have more than ¥42 trillion of disclosed bad loans,
    about 8% of their loan portfolios.
            I am one of the many who feel the disclosed figures understate the real situation.
    The FSA collects data on "classified loans", a broader concept of problem loans, but does not
    discloses it for individual banks. Under the FSA's Bank Examination Manual, banks are
    required to rate their loans, taking account of default risk and quality of collateral. There are
    four grades: normal, substandard, doubtful, and estimated- loss loans. The last three are
    considered "classified" loans. Banks then estimate their loan-loss reserves and the amount of
    write-offs. Because of the broader definition, the amount of classified loans is almost twice
    that of disclosed bad loans. Total classified loans for all banks was ¥71.1 trillion in March
    2002.
                                                   3
1.1   Under-Reserving


      Total loan loss reserves of Japanese banks have been low relative to those of US banks.
      While US bad loans declined from 3% of total loans in 1992 to 1% in 1999, the Japanese
      ratio rose from 2% to 6% (Figure 1). Loan-loss reserves in the United States have been
      above 160% of bad loans since 1994, while in Japan they have been in the 40% to 60% range
      (Figure 2). We can clearly see that although the US banking sector recovered quickly from
      its bad- loan problems in early 1990s, the Japanese situation has been deteriorating even with
      the 1999 capital injection by the government.
              Many analysts of Japanese banks suspect that the banks are not recording enough
      loan-loss reserves. This problem is exacerbated by the lenient reserving policy stipulated by
      the FSA Bank Examination Manual. Japanese banks usually calculate loan-loss reserves by
      dividing their loans into the FSA- mandated categories, then estimated losses for each group
      using the following time horizons.


      1      Normal loans and sub-standard loans without arrears or reduced interest rates:
             expected one-year loss rate;
      2      Sub-standard loans with arrears or reduced interest rates and doubtful lo ans:
             expected three-year loan loss rate;


      Most loans are routinely rolled over, so the one- year figures understate the net present value
      of future losses over the true life of the loans in category (1). Thus, instead of a one- year
      rate, banks should reserve using, as a minimum, the three-year cumulative rate for all
      sub-standard loans.
              To estimate more appropriate reserve figures, I have estimated required loan loss
      reserves based on FSA data of classified loans. A Bank of Japan (1997) sample study
      looked at the actual subsequent loan losses of 18 banks for each category of classified loans
      on their fiscal 1993 reports (Table 3). At the end of three years (in March 1997) about 17% of
      substandard loans and over 75% of doubtful loans had been lost and almost 100% of
      estimated loss loans.
              These figures indicate that banks should keep larger loan loss reserves. I have
      calculated estimated reserves requirements based on 20% of substandard loans, 70% of


                                                    4
    doubtful loans, and 1% of normal loans. This last is because of the migration of normal loans
    to classified loans. The results are in Table 2 row C.
             By comparing rows C and D, we can estimate the lower bound of under-reserving
    (row C minus row D).                Although substantially below the estimated 1997 level,
    under-reserving remains large.



2   The Banks' Deteriorating Condition


    Figure 3 provides further evidence of the deteriorating condition of banks. Although the
    bad-loan to total- loan ratio has stabilized for city banks, for first- and second-tier regional
    banks it has been increasing rapidly. The large 1995 increase for regional banks in part
    reflects changes in disclosure requirements, but the trend since is due primarily to
    deteriorating loan quality.
             Corresponding to the flow – profit – figures, the capital position of Japanese banks
    has been deteriorating. Under Japanese accounting rules for banks and lenient application
    by the regulators, BIS capital ratios have been manipulated in many ways.
             First, banks have under-reserved against bad loans, as explained above. This tends
    to increase bank core capital by the same amount.
             Second, banks have large deferred-tax assets on their balance sheets even though they
    have been losing money continually since 1993 and loss carry-forwards are limited to five
    years. There is little prospect of utilizing the deferred-tax asset by showing genuine profit
    in the near future, so it should be written off.
             Third, most of banks' subordinated loans are held by friendly life insurance
    companies. The banks, in turn, hold subordinated loans and surplus notes of the life
    companies. This is double- gearing and the cross-held quasi-capital should not be treated as
    genuine capital for either the banks or the life insurance companies.
             Table 4 shows core (tier-1) capital adjusted for unrealized capital gains, under
    reserving, and deferred taxes for major Japanese banks since March 1998. On this calculation,
    eight banks had negative equity in 1998, but only two were nationalized. The capital ratio
    recovered in fiscal 1998, part due to the ¥6.2 trillion in capital injected by the government,
    and rose further as stock prices recovered. But it began deteriorating again in 2000, the result


                                                  5
      of more loans going bad and stock prices falling. In September 2001 was at 0.86%, below
      where it had been 3 years earlier.
               The capital position of banks is quite sensitive to stock prices. Table 5 shows the
      capital structure of all commercial banks. Core capital based on traditional historical cost
      accounting is adjusted for unrealized capital gains on stocks, deferred taxes, the public
      capital injection, and under-reserving for loan losses. Although banks show ¥29.3 trillion of
      capital on their balance sheet at the end of March 2002, this figure is inflated with ¥10.7
      trillion of deferred-tax credits (present value of the future tax shelter), ¥6.9 trillion of
      under-reserving, and ¥7.2 trillion of government capital. Removing these amounts, the
      privately held equity of the banking sector is only ¥4.5 trillion yen. This is very small
      compared to their ¥71.8 trillion of problem loans.
               Because the ¥34.4 trillion market value of stocks held by banks is about 7.5 times
      their net capital, a 10% fall in the stock price index wipes out about 76% of their net capital.
      In the late 1980s and early 1990s, unrealized capital gains (the difference between column A
      and B) was very large and banks could withstand fluctuations in stock prices. However, in
      the 1990s, banks sold stock to realize gains to offset huge loan losses. The increase in book
      value of shares (column B) during the 1990s shows the banks were buying back most of the
      stock they sold.


2.1   An Unprofitable Business


      Banking in Japan has become an unprofitable, structurally depressed industry. Excluding
      capital gains realized by selling shares and real estate, Japan's banks as a group have been in
      the red since the year ended March 1994 (fiscal 1993). The primary cause of this is low
      interest rates, which are squeezing profits.
                Let us look at the profit structure of banks nation-wide. Table 6 shows the
      profit-loss accounts of all commercial banks. In the nine years from fiscal 1992 to fiscal
      2000, banks made around ¥10 trillion each year as lending margin (row A, defined as interest
      and dividends earned minus interest paid). Revenue from such sources as bond and
      currency dealing and service charges were over ¥2 trillion, and ¥3 trillion more recently (row
      B). This includes all other revenue except capital gains realized on stocks and real estate.
      Revenues from banks' principal operations therefore amount to roughly ¥12 trillion to ¥13
      trillion yen a year (row A + row B).
                                                    6
             Total costs – including personnel and other operating expenses – were over ? 7
    trillion (row C). Operating costs declined during 1998-2000 because of cost cutting
    measures. It is likely to be difficult to continue that pace of cost cutting. Certainly,
    the banks may cut labor costs further by reducing employment and cutting average
    compensation. But the banks have to invest heavily in information technology to remain
    competitive.
           In the 1990s bank stinted on improving systems because of preoccupation with
    bad-loan problems, and now they have poor quality computer systems. Thus, for
    example, the zengin electronic fund transfer system, which is the main payment system
    among bank customers, cannot handle 2-byte codes, so it cannot send customer names
    and messages in kanji (characters).) As a result, more and more payments (especially
    utility bills) are handled by convenience store chains, which have installed sophisticated
    terminals.
           Since the early 1990s more and more loans held by banks have turned into
    non-performing assets. Banks have suffered over ¥6 trillion in loan losses each year
    since fiscal 1994, and ¥9 trillion in the last year (row E). As a result, banks have not
    reported positive net operating profit since fiscal 1993 (row F). However, because of
    occasional realization of capital gains on stocks and real estate (row G), banks have
    shown a positive bottom line (row F + row G).



3   Causes of Bank Unprofitability


    The profit margin of Japanese banks is too small to cover the increase in default risk
    since the bubble burst. Two principal elements of this – the deregulation that has been
    going on since the 1980s and competition from government-sponsored financial
    institutions – are taken up in the following sections.
            The nature of government regulation is a third factor. Thus, under the terms and
    condition of the government capital injection in March 1999, banks are legally required
    to maintain and increase loans to small and medium firms. Shinsei Bank, which reduced
    loans to such firms, was ordered by the FSA to increase its lending. Under these
    conditions, banks often dis regard their procedures to make new loans to small
    companies, at ultimate cost to the banks and the economy as a whole because of the
    misallocation of resources.




                                                7
3.1   Effects of Deregulation


      The average lending rate of Japanese banks was 1.8% in fiscal 2000, while the average
      funding cost was 0.3% and the average intermediation cost was 1.2%. Thus, the gross
      spread was only 0.35% (Japanese Bankers Association 2001). The average credit
      rating of borrowers from banks is about BB, the annual loan loss rate is well over 1%,
      which means a negative margin of 0.65%. Part of this is offset by fees from borrowers
      and other customers, but a key fact is that the banks are making losses from lending.
              One of the reasons for the small gross spread is the overhang of deposit interest
      rate controls until the early 1990s. When the government controlled deposit rates,
      banks easily made money taking deposits. This is seen in Figure 4.
              Figure 4 decomposes the lending margin (interest earned minus interest paid)
      into regulatory rent and the true profit margin (the spread between the average lending
      rate and the market rate). The regulatory rent is taken as the difference between the
      banks' funding cost and the risk-free short-term money market rate. Notice that the true
      lending margin in much of the 1980s was negative, which suggests banks passed part of
      the rent on to borrowers
             As deposit-rate controls were phased out in the late 1980s and early 1990s,
      banks tried to keep up profit margins by increasing lending rates relative to short-term
      market rates.
             Although the banks have not raised their profit margin, borrowers are paying a
      higher interest rate in relation to the money market rate. Figure 5 shows movements of
      the average new lending rate, overnight call rate, and the implied ex post real interest
      rates computed by subtracted the GDP deflator inflation rate. Reflecting the BOJ's
      loose monetary policy, the real call rate fell from 1991 until 1998. On the other hand,
      the real rate of new lending has not fallen much because of the increasing gap between
      the new lending rate and the call rate.
              Although the opportunity cost of borrowing for large creditworthy companies is
      close to the call rate, the cost for small and medium companies is close to the new
      lending rate. The refore, smaller companies have been less able than larger ones to
      enjoy the expansionary effect of loose money. This may have contributed to the
      relatively weak recovery of the small-business sector in the 1990s.
               It was natural for banks to raise lending rates relative to market rates after
      removal of deposit rate controls. However, banks have not succeeded in obtaining
      enough of a margin to cover loan losses in a weak economy. At the same time, smaller
      borrowers have suffered from higher borrowing costs relative to large companies that
      have access to capital markets.


                                                  8
3.2   Government Financial Institutions


      In Japanese financial markets, the presence of government financial institutions (GFIs)
      is extremely large. Table 7 shows the market share of private banks and GFIs at the
      end of 2000.
             In the loan market, the GFI share reaches 30% to 40% in rural prefectures,
      although it is only 26% overall. GFIs make very long-term loans at about 2%. They
      are especially dominant in housing loans, holding more than half the outstanding
      balance.
            Table 8 shows the base lending rates of GFIs on 9 February 2001. Their rates
      on new lending are similar to those for short-term loans from private banks, but the
      average term is much longer.
              GFIs obtain subsidies of about ¥1 trillion per year as direct subsidy and indirect
      subsidy of zero-cost capital. These are estimated to provide a 60 basis point cost
      advantage relative to private financial institutions. Further, they usually accept
      prepayment without penalties, so their loans are more attractive to borrowers. As a
      result, the rates banks can charge are significantly constrained. (See Higo (2001) on the
      role of GFIs and their institutional details.)
              In the deposit market, the Postal Saving System (PSS) is a dominant player.
      Deposits are fully guaranteed by the government. Rates are set competitively against
      private deposit-taking institutions. There are more than 24,000 post offices, giving the
      system a branch network larger than all the city and regional banks combined. The
      largest private banking group, Mizuho, has only about 600 offices. The PSS does not
      charge account- maintenance fees, so it is difficult for private banks to charge such fees
      without alienating a large number of customers.
             My calculations indicate banks have to raise their lending margin by 80 to 100
      basis points to break even in the current economic environment of deflation and
      recession.
              The loan losses in Table 6 for 1999 and 2000 understate true losses by some ¥1.5
      trillion each year due to under-reserving for bad loans. Therefore, banks lost about ¥3
      trillion in each of those years before capital gains. Macroeconomic conditions
      deteriorated in 2001, so banks reported more than 9 trillion yen of loan losses in FY
      2001 alone, partly recognizing the past understated losses.
               By raising lending rates 100 basis points, banks can obtain an additional ¥5
      trillion from their ¥500 trillion loan portfolio, which would allow them to write-off bad
      loans as they surface. However, they can neither raise lending rates nor charge higher
      fees on depositors due to the institutional environment. If the rate of deflation


                                                  9
    accelerates, banks will run out of capital sooner or later and the government will be
    forced to take control of the sector.



4   Life Insurance Companies


    Private life insurers are the second largest part of the financial services industry after
    commercial banks, with December 2000 total assets of ¥180 trillion, which is about
    35% of GDP. Limited competition and the robust economy allowed life insurance
    companies to enjoy fairly high growth and reasonably good profits until the early 1990s.
    Before the current crisis, there were 20 established companies, almost all organized as
    mutual companies.
           Although the companies are less affected by the bad loan prob lem than banks,
    they face a serious problem. In the late 1980s and early 1990s they effectively sold
    massive amounts of what are forward-rate agreement options. The most important
    insurance products sold by Japanese companies in the 1980s and early 90s were
    whole- life insurance with term rider and long-term annuities. Moreover, most of them
    are sold as monthly payment plan. These promised high minimum guaranteed returns
    (yotei riritsu) over the life of a policy. As a result, life insurance companies effectively
    guaranteed high returns on future cash flow. Thus, until 1992, major Japanese
    life- insurance companies assumed a return on their assets of 5.5% or more in designing
    policies. In 1992 someone buying even a life annuity or whole - life insurance was
    guaranteed 5.5% by all the companies.
          The profitability of an annuity to its issuer depends on the difference between
    assumed and actual results of three factors : return on invested assets, costs, and death
    rates. For cautious actuaries, assumed death rates and operating costs tend to be higher
    than actual rates. This provides some cushion for any short- fall in expected investment
    returns. However, for many insur ers, the shortfalls in asset returns were too big to be
    covered.
            Most companies did not match the terms of their assets and liabilities. Generally,
    the term on the asset side has been about 5 years, while the average on the liability side
    has been 15 to 20 years. When interest rates fell sharply in the 1990s, firms faced
    massive negative carry. Some companies were operating with little or no equity by the
    late 1990s. When they finally filed bankruptcy, most were deeply insolvent.
            Beginning with the collapse of Nissan Life in April 1997, seven insurers had
    failed by mid 2002. Together they left ¥2.68 trillion in negative equity. This loss has to
    be born by policyholders and the Policyholder Protection Fund (PPF) that depends on


                                                10
      the contribution by healthie r companies. Table 9 shows the financial conditions of the
      failed companies. Although the companies reported fairly high solvency margins just
      before their failures, all were found to be insolvent after their bankruptcy. Table 10
      shows solvency margins. Note that no company has failed since March 2001.
             When a life insurance company fails, the court-appointed administrator cuts the
      liability of the company so as to make the company viable again. Most of the liability
      of an insurance company is policy reserve that corresponds to the accumulated saving of
      policyholders. Generally speaking, the surrender value of a policy corresponds to this
      value. Under the Japanese policyholder protection scheme, the PPF guarantees only
      90% of the policy reserve and it does not protect guaranteed minimum returns. The
      PPF can also introduce a cancellation penalty on the policy reserve to reduce the cost of
      resolution.
               As a result, policyholders at bankrupt insurers are hit on three sides.       On
      average, they have lost about 10% of their accrued past saving. Guaranteed returns in
      most cases were cut down to 1% to 2%. In addition, heavy early-withdrawal charges
      are levied on cancellations of policies of all types. In the case of Chiyoda Life, a
      policyholder faces a 20% charge for immediate cancellation. This charge declines
      gradually to two percent in the tenth year. One must wait 10 years to cancel without an
      early cancellation penalty. Because policyholders can realize the surrender value of
      policies quite easily before a firm fails, companies thought to be weak have faced heavy
      cancellations.
              It is usually better for a healthy person to quickly cancel a cash-value life
      insurance policy with a failing company and get a new policy elsewhere than to stick to
      the existing po licy. However, getting a new life policy is more expensive, and perhaps
      not possible, for an unhealthy person. This means the burden of an insurer's failure falls
      more heavily on those who have become less insurable.


4.1   Weak Supervision


      The life insurance industry's crisis has been exacerbated by the forbearance policy of its
      supervisory authorities, the former Ministry of Finance and the FSA. Because of
      extremely lenient capital requirements and reluctance to close down unhealthy firms,
      most failed life insurance companies had large negative equity by the time of their
      formal failure.
              The regulatory measure of capital requirements in insurance is the solvency
      margin, which relates net assets to estimated risk. The net assets are capital + risk
      reserves + general loan loss reserves + excess reserves over surrender value of polices +


                                                 11
future profits + tax effect + subordinated debt.      The estimated risk equals [(insurance
     2                                          2 ½
risk) + (interest rate risk + asset value risk) ] + management risk. The net assets are
divided by the estimated risk and multiplied by 200 to obtain the solvency margin. The
minimum ratio for sound companies is 200. Below that, regulators are required to take
corrective action.
      The requirement was imported from the United States, but Japanese regulators
have made a number of modifications that weaken the rule considerably, including
setting the trigger levels for prompt corrective action much lower. Table 11 illustrates
the major differences.
       For a number of reasons the numerator in Japa n is overstated. Especially
worrisome is inclusion of a large deferred tax asset and future profits. Moreover, Japan
generously includes assets with no liquidation value, although the US standard excludes
them. Regarding the denominator side, Japanese risk weights are considerably lower
than those of the United States. Thus, for publicly traded corporate equity (stock), the
risk weight is about one -third the US level. For real estate and foreign currency assets,
the risk weights are one-half the US levels.


        The Financial Studies Group of the Japan Center for Economic Research, which
I head, have tried to adjust for the differences in the solvency margin requirements in
Japan and the United States. The quality of disclosure by life insurance companies has
improved considerably since the mid 1990s, so we can do this from publicly available
data. Figure 6 shows the results for the end of March 2000.
       Based on what they disclose, all the major companies are above the 200% level,
implying that they are all hea lthy. We have made three types of adjustments. The first
uses US risk weights and adjusts for unrealized capital gains and losses, but allows
inclusion of assets with no liquidation value. With these adjustments, two companies
are deemed insolvent.
       The second is closer to – but still somewhat less stringent than – the US standard.
Specifically, we removed assets with no liquidation value. Three companies are
insolvent under this definition.
        The third approach involves removing subordinated debt from the capital base
because its quality as capital is less than that of retained earnings and surplus notes
(which are similar to the non- voting redeemable preferred shares of joint stock
companies). Under this measure, four companies were insolvent even when the
Nikkei 225 was at 20,337, significantly higher than it is two years later as this is written.
       Three companies that had negative adjusted solvency margins failed within a
year: Chiyoda Life and Kyoei Life filed bankruptcy in October 2000, as did Tokyo Life


                                               12
    in March 2001. The fourth company, Nichidan Life, received a capital injection from
    Axa, a French insurance company.
            Figure 7 shows the same picture for March 2002. The disclosed ratios are
    more than 500% except for one company. However, "Adjusted 2" indicates that the FSA
    should intervene in at least three weaker companies: Mitsui, Asahi, and Sumitomo Life.
    The Nikkei was 11,025 at that time. We estimated that a 20% fall in the index would
    pull the solvency margin of weaker companies down by about 100 points. Therefore, a
    Nikkei below 10,000 means three companies probably are critically under-capitalized
    and three others would require prompt corrective actions under US standards.



5   Increasing Double-Gearing


    All the major life insurance companies are mutual companies, so there is no formal
    cross-holding of shares. However, the insurers are major shareholders of the banks –
    collectively owning 10% or more of each city bank during the 1990s. Moreover,
    banks and life insurers have relied on each other to raise broadly defined capital.
    Between March 2000 and March 2001 the bankruptcies of Chiyoda, Kyoei, and Tokyo
    Life reduced the double - gearing, but it is still significant. At the end of March 2001, 7
    life insurance companies collectively held 5.4 trillion yen of bank stocks and 5.1 trillion
    yen of bank subordinated debts. In exchange, banks hold 1 trillion yen of surplus
    notes and 1.2 trillion yen of subordinated debts of 7 life insurance companies.
            The double -gearing generates two important problems: poor-quality capital in
    Japan's financial sector, which increases systemic risk, and a weaker governance
    structure of banks.
           As regards systemic risk, suppose a major life insurer filed for bankruptcy. The
    banks that hold the company's subordinated loans and surplus notes lose money. The
    price of the stock of these banks falls to reflect the write-offs, which reduces the assets
    of insurance-companies holding bank stocks. It may even trigger a chain reaction of
    failures among Japanese financial institutions.
             The corporate governance structure of Japan's major life insurance companies is
    weak. The "representative policyholder meeting" plays the role a shareholder meeting
    does for joint stock companies. Each representative policyholder has one vote. They
    are inevitably chosen by management. Sometimes, they become policyholders only
    after being asked to be a representative policyholder. In other cases, a manager of a
    company that borrows from the insurance company is asked.




                                                13
6   Conclusion


    Stock prices of listed Japanese banks have been very weak since the end of 2001. I
    believe that this reflects a number of remaining problems in Japan's financial system.
    First, profit margins are too small to cover the increased default risk since the bubble
    burst more than 10 years ago. Many firms have not overcome their debt overhang and
    are surviving on the indulgence of their banks. Banks have not succeeded in
    increasing their lending margins because of strong competitive pressure from
    government-backed financial institutions. They also are facing strong political
    pressure to lend to small and medium firms regardless of merit. More broadly, revisions
    to the banking law require regulatory approval of new investors, and a condition of
    approval is that they "fully understand a bank's social responsibilities."
            Second, there is massive double-gearing between life insurance companies and
    banks. Systemic risk remains very high.    Financial sector problems can be stabilized
    by public money; either by injecting capital into the banks or by extending a full
    government guarantee of deposits, the government can stabilize the fragile financial
    system. However, a far larger problem will surface in that event: the critical situation
    of the national debt. Because of deflation and high real interest rates, the Japanese
    economy is shrinking. Nominal GDP declined 2% in 2001 and such negative growth
    is likely to continue unless there are very strong policy actions.
         Table 12 shows a simple projection of Japan's budgetary situations under minus
    2% nominal growth and an unchanged primary deficit of 6% of GDP. I did not take
    account of the cost of stabilizing the financial system, but I did assume a massive
    cutting of government expenditures in line with declining tax revenue. The gross debt
    of the general government will exceed 200% of GDP by 2008.
            If the government cannot stabilize the macro economy by stopping deflation, I
    expect Japanese yen government bonds (JGB) to be downgraded to speculative by 2007.
    (In July 2002 they had the lowest rating among major countries: AA- by Standard &
    Poor’s and A2 by Moody’s.) If downgraded further, the government will have to shift
    to short-term notes to reduce interest costs. However, shortening maturity will
    increase vulnerability to a sharp rise in interest rates.
             A junk bond status of JGB will generate enormous problems for the corporate
    sector. Sovereign credit usually sets a ceiling for private companies. Japanese banks
    will not be able to use JGBs as collateral in dealing with foreign banks. Moody's
    downgraded the major banks' financial strength to its lowest ratings on 2 July 2002.
    Japanese savers are shifting assets from yen deposits to foreign-currency deposits and


                                               14
gold. The relative weakness of the yen in the face of rapidly declining dollar interest
rates in 2001 may have indicated a mild form of capital flight.
         Massive capital flight will cure Japan's deflation by sharply devaluing the yen.
However, other Asian countries will devalue against the dollar to remain competitive.
That will export deflation to the rest of the world, including the United States. In that
event, the United States may have to follow the Japanese example of a zero interest rate
policy.
       The end of deflation may trigger a budgetary crisis in Japan. Suppose Japan
has 200% gross debt, mostly financed by short-term liabilities. Most of its financial
assets are long-term and at fixed interest rates, so the government cannot count on a
higher interest income in the short run under increasing interest rates. A 500 basis
point rise in interest rates (which would make rates about the same as they were in
1991) will increase interest payments to 10% of GDP, ¥50 trillion. This is about the
same as total national government tax revenue excluding social security contributions.
         Many Japanese policy makers and corporate leaders have spent more than 10
years assuming time will solve whatever the problems are with less pain and cost than
will aggressive confrontation. Time not only has not solved the problems, it has made
many of them worse. I would like to say the scenarios I have depicted are pessimistic
assessments, but sadly they are all too possible. The pain and the cost will continue to
grow, as the economy stagnates, unless a more immediate, comprehensive, and
aggressive attack is made on the known problems.

1 Adjusted capital is defined as core capital plus unrealized capital gains and losses plus loan
   loss reserves minus estimated loan losses minus deferred tax asset. As in Table 2, estimated
   loan losses is defined as 1% of normal loans plus 20% of substandard loans plus 70% of
   doubtful loans plus 100% of estimat ed loss loans. Individual banks do not disclose data on
   classified loans individually, so I relied on disclosed bad loan data.

Source of data:      Federation of Bankers Associations of Japan, "Analysis of Bank Financial Statements," various issues; securities reports for
                     individual banks. Both market and book values represent listed shares only. The Table pertains to banking accounts of all banks in
                     Japan.
Note: The market value of stock portfolios was not published prior to March 1990, so we have estimated backwards using the Niikkei 225 share price
        index from the end of March 1991. However, the tables for 1985-1986 should be discounted, because bank stock portfolios have been gradually
        increasing, so that values estimated from the end of fiscal 1990 will have an upwards bias the father back one goes. 40% corporate tax rate is
        assumed. See Table 2 for the estimation of under reserving.
