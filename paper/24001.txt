Artificial Intelligence and the Modern Productivity Paradox: A Clash of Expectations and
Statistics

JEL No. D2,O3,O4

                                           ABSTRACT

We live in an age of paradox. Systems using artificial intelligence match or surpass human level
performance in more and more domains, leveraging rapid advances in other technologies and
driving soaring stock prices. Yet measured productivity growth has declined by half over the past
decade, and real income has stagnated since the late 1990s for a majority of Americans. We
describe four potential explanations for this clash of expectations and statistics: false hopes,
mismeasurement, redistribution, and implementation lags. While a case can be made for each, we
argue that lags have likely been the biggest contributor to the paradox. The most impressive
capabilities of AI, particularly those based on machine learning, have not yet diffused widely.
More importantly, like other general purpose technologies, their full effects won’t be realized
until waves of complementary innovations are developed and implemented. The required
adjustment costs, organizational changes, and new skills can be modeled as a kind of intangible
capital. A portion of the value of this intangible capital is already reflected in the market value of
firms. However, going forward, national statistics could fail to measure the full benefits of the
new technologies and some may even have the wrong sign.

        The discussion around the recent patterns in aggregate productivity growth
highlights a seeming contradiction. On the one hand, there are astonishing examples of
potentially transformative new technologies that could greatly increase productivity and
economic welfare (see e.g. Brynjolfsson and McAfee, 2014). There are some early concrete
signs of these technologies’ promise, the recent leaps in artificial intelligence (AI)
performance being the most prominent example. However, at the same time, measured
productivity growth over the past decade has slowed significantly. This deceleration is
large, cutting productivity growth by half or more of its level in the decade preceding the
slowdown. It is also widespread, having occurred throughout the OECD and, more recently,
among many large emerging economies as well (Syverson, 2017). 1
        We thus appear to be facing a redux of the Solow (1987) Paradox: we see
transformative new technologies everywhere but in the productivity statistics.
        In this paper, we review the evidence and explanations for the modern productivity
paradox and propose a resolution. Namely, there is no inherent inconsistency between
forward-looking technological optimism and backward-looking disappointment. Both can
simultaneously exist. Indeed, there are good conceptual reasons to expect them to
simultaneously exist when the economy undergoes the kind of restructuring associated
with transformative technologies. In essence, the forecasters of future company wealth and
the measurers of historical economic performance show the greatest disagreement during
times of technological change. In this paper we argue and present some evidence that the
economy is in such a period now.


Sources of Technological Optimism
        Paul Polman, Unilever’s CEO, recently claimed that “The speed of innovation has
never been faster.” Similarly, Bill Gates, Microsoft’s co-founder, observes that “Innovation is
moving at a scarily fast pace.” Vinod Khosla of Khosla Ventures sees “the beginnings of... [a]
rapid acceleration in the next 10, 15, 20 years.” Eric Schmidt, Executive Chairman of
Alphabet Inc., believes “we’re entering… the age of abundance [and] during the age of


1A parallel yet more pessimistically oriented debate about potential technological progress is the active
discussion about robots taking jobs from more and more workers (e.g., Brynjolfsson and McAfee, 2011;
Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2017; Bessen, 2017; Autor and Salomons, 2017).

                                                      1
abundance, we’re going to see a new age… the age of intelligence.” Ray Kurzweil famously
predicts that The Singularity – when AI surpasses humans – will occur sometime around
2045. 2 Assertions like these are especially common among technology leaders and venture
capitalists.
          In part, these assertions reflect the continuing progress of IT in many areas, from
core technology advances like further doublings of basic computer power (but from ever
larger bases) to successful investment in the essential complementary innovations like
cloud infrastructure, and new service-based business models. But the bigger source of
optimism is the wave of recent improvements in AI, especially machine learning. Machine
learning represents a fundamental change from the first wave of computerization.
Historically, most computer programs were created by meticulously codifying human
knowledge, step-by-step, mapping inputs to outputs as prescribed by the programmers. In
contrast, machine learning systems use categories of general algorithms (e.g., neural
networks) to figure out the relevant mapping on their own, typically by being fed very large
data sets of examples. By using these machine learning methods leveraging the growth in
total data and data processing resources, machines have made impressive gains in
perception and cognition, two essential skills for most types of human work. For instance,
error rates in labeling the content of photos on ImageNet, a dataset of over 10 million
images, have fallen from over 30% in 2010 to less than 5% in 2016 and most recently as
low as 2.2% with SE-ResNet152 in the ILSVRC2017 competition (see Figure 1). 3 Error rates
in voice recognition on the Switchboard speech recording corpus, often used to measure
progress in speech recognition, have improved from 8.5% to 5.5% over the past year (Saon
et al., 2017). The five percent threshold is important, because that is roughly the
performance of humans on each of these tasks on the same test data.

provided by humans. For instance, there are 339,000 labeled as flowers, 1,001,000 as food, 188,000 as fruit,
137,000 as fungus, and so on.

       Although not at the level of professional human performance yet, Facebook’s AI
Research team recently improved upon the best machine language translation algorithms
available using convolutional neural net sequence prediction techniques (Gehring et al.,
2017). Deep learning techniques have also been combined with reinforcement learning, a
powerful set of techniques used to generate control and action systems whereby
autonomous agents are trained to take actions given an environment state to maximize
future rewards. Though nascent, advances in this field are impressive. In addition to its
victories in the game of Go, Google DeepMind has achieved superhuman performance in
many Atari games (Fortunato et al., 2017).
       These are notable technological milestones. But they can also change the economic
landscape, creating new opportunities for business value creation and cost reduction. For
example, a system using deep neural networks was tested against 21 board certified
dermatologists and matched their performance in diagnosing skin cancer (Esteva et al.,
2017). Facebook uses neural networks for over 4.5 billion translations each day. 4

          An increasing number of companies have responded to these opportunities. Google
now describes its focus as “AI first,” while Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella says AI is the
“ultimate breakthrough” in technology. Their optimism about AI is not just cheap talk. They
are making heavy investments in AI, as are Apple, Facebook, and Amazon. As of September
2017, these companies comprise the five most valuable companies in the world.
Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite stock index more than doubled between
2012 and 2017. According to CBInsights, global investment in private companies focused
on AI has grown even faster, increasing from $589 million in 2012 to over $5 billion in
2016. 5


The Disappointing Recent Reality
          Although the technologies discussed above hold great potential, there is little sign
that they have yet affected aggregate productivity statistics. Labor productivity growth
rates in a broad swath of developed economies fell in the mid-2000s and have stayed low
since then. For example, aggregate labor productivity growth in the U.S. averaged only
1.3% per year from 2005 to 2016, less than half of the 2.8% annual growth rate sustained
from 1995 to 2004. Fully 28 of 29 other countries for which the OECD has compiled
productivity growth data saw similar decelerations. The unweighted average annual labor
productivity growth rates across these countries was 2.3% from 1995 to 2004 but only
1.1% from 2005 to 2015. 6 What’s more, real median income has stagnated since the late
1990s and non-economic measures of well-being, like life expectancy, have fallen for some
groups (Case and Deaton, 2017).
          Figure 2 replicates the Conference Board’s analysis of its country-level Total
Economy Database (Conference Board, 2016). It plots highly smoothed annual productivity
growth rate series for the U.S., other mature economies (which combined match much of

intelligence-startup-funding/
6 These slowdowns are statistically significant. For the U.S., where the slowdown is measured using quarterly

data, equality of the two periods’ growth rates is rejected with a t-statistic of 2.9. The OECD numbers come
from annual data across the 30 countries. Here, the null hypothesis of equality is rejected with a t-statistic of
7.2.

the OECD sample cited above), emerging and developing economies, and the world overall.
The aforementioned slowdowns in the U.S. and other mature economies are clear in the
figure. The figure also reveals that the productivity growth acceleration in emerging and
developing economies during the 2000s ended around the time of the Great Recession,
causing a recent decline in productivity growth rates in these countries too.
       These slowdowns do not appear to simply reflect effects of the Great Recession. In
the OECD data, 28 of the 30 countries still exhibit productivity decelerations if 2008-09
growth rates are excluded from the totals. Cette, Fernald, and Mojon (2016), using other
data, also find substantial evidence that the slowdowns began before the Great Recession.




     Figure 2. Smoothed Average Annual Labor Productivity Growth (Percent) by Region


       Both capital deepening and total factor productivity (TFP) growth lead to labor
productivity growth, and both seem to be playing a role in the slowdown (e.g., Fernald,
2014; OECD, 2015). Disappointing technological progress can be tied to each of these
components. TFP directly reflects such progress. Capital deepening is indirectly influenced
by technological change because firms’ investment decisions respond to improvements in
capital’s current or expected marginal product.
       These facts have been read by some as reasons for pessimism about the ability of
new technologies like AI to greatly affect productivity and income. Gordon (2014, 2015)


                                              5
argues that productivity growth has been in long-run decline, with the IT-driven
acceleration of 1995 to 2004 being a one-off aberration. While not claiming technological
progress will be nil in the coming decades, Gordon essentially argues that we have been
experiencing the new, low-growth normal and should expect to continue to do so going
forward. Cowen (2011) similarly offers multiple reasons why innovation may be slow at
least for the foreseeable future. Bloom et al. (2017) document that in many fields of
technological progress, research productivity has been falling, while Nordhaus (2015) finds
that the hypothesis of an acceleration of technology-driven growth fails a variety of tests.
           This pessimistic view of future technological progress has entered into long-range
policy planning. The Congressional Budget Office, for instance, reduced its 10-year forecast
for average U.S. annual labor productivity growth from 1.8 percent in 2016 (CBO, 2016) to
1.5 percent in 2017 (CBO, 2017). Although perhaps modest on its surface, that drop implies
U.S. GDP will be considerably smaller 10 years from now than it would in the more
optimistic scenario—a difference equivalent to almost $600 billion in 2017.


Potential Explanations for the Paradox
           There are four principal candidate explanations for the current confluence of
technological optimism and poor productivity performance: 1) false hopes, 2)
mismeasurement, 3) concentrated distribution and rent dissipation, and 4) implementation
and restructuring lags. 7


False Hopes
           The simplest possibility is that the optimism about the potential technologies is
misplaced and unfounded. Perhaps these technologies won’t be as transformative as many
expect, and although they might have modest and noteworthy effects on specific sectors,
their aggregate impact might be small. In this case, the paradox will be resolved in the
future because realized productivity growth never escapes its current doldrums, which will
force the optimists to mark their beliefs to market.




7   To some extent, these explanations parallel the explanations for the Solow Paradox (Brynjolfsson, 1993).

                                                        6
           History and some current examples offer a quantum of credence to this possibility.
Certainly one can point to many prior exciting technologies that did not live up to initially
optimistic expectations. Nuclear power never became too cheap to meter, and fusion
energy has been 20 years away for 60 years. Mars may still beckon, but it’s been more than
40 years since Eugene Cernan was the last person to walk on the moon. Flying cars never
got off the ground, 8 and passenger jets no longer fly at supersonic speeds. Even AI, perhaps
the most promising technology of our era, is well behind Marvin Minsky’s 1967 prediction
that “Within a generation the problem of creating ‘artificial intelligence’ will be
substantially solved” (Minsky, 1967, p. 2).
           On the other hand, there remains a compelling case for optimism. As we outline
below, it is not difficult to construct back-of-the-envelope scenarios in which even a modest
number of currently existing technologies could combine to substantially raise productivity
growth and societal welfare. Indeed, knowledgeable investors and researchers are betting
their money and time on exactly such outcomes. Thus, while we recognize the potential for
over-optimism—and the experience with early predictions for AI makes an especially
relevant reminder for us to be somewhat circumspect in this essay—we judge that it would
be highly preliminary to dismiss optimism at this point.


Mismeasurement
           Another potential explanation for the paradox is mismeasurement of output and
productivity. In this case, it is the pessimistic reading of the empirical past, not the
optimism about the future, that is mistaken. Indeed, this explanation implies that the
productivity benefits of the new wave of technologies are already being enjoyed but have
yet to be accurately measured. Under this explanation, the slowdown of the past decade
illusory. This “mismeasurement hypothesis” has been put forth in several works (e.g.,
Mokyr, 2014; Alloway, 2015; Feldstein, 2015; Hatzius and Dawsey, 2015; Smith, 2015).
           There is a prima facie case for the mismeasurement hypothesis. Many new
technologies, like smartphones, online social networks, and downloadable media involve
little monetary cost, yet consumers spend large amounts of time with these technologies.


8   At least not yet: https://kittyhawk.aero/about/.

                                                       7
Thus, the technologies might deliver substantial utility even if they account for a small
share of GDP due to their low relative price. Guvenen, Mataloni, Rassier, and Ruhl (2017)
also show how growing offshore profit shifting can be another source of mismeasurement.
        However, a set of recent studies provide good reason to think that mismeasurement
is not the entire, or even a substantial, explanation for the slowdown. Cardarelli and
Lusinyan (2015); Byrne, Fernald, and Reinsdorf (2016); Nakamura and Soloveichik (2015);
and Syverson (2017), each using different methodologies and data, present evidence that
mismeasurement is not the primary explanation for the productivity slowdown. After all,
while there is convincing evidence that many of the benefits of today’s technologies are not
reflected in GDP and therefore productivity statistics, the same was undoubtedly true in
earlier eras as well.


Concentrated Distribution and Rent Dissipation
        A third possibility is that the gains of the new technologies are already attainable,
but that through a combination of concentrated distribution of those gains and dissipative
efforts to attain or preserve them (assuming the technologies are at least partially
rivalrous), their effect on average productivity growth is modest overall, and is virtually nil
for the median worker. For instance, two of the most profitable uses of AI to date have been
for targeting and pricing online ads, and for automated trading of financial instruments,
both applications with many zero-sum aspects.
        One version of this story asserts that the benefits of the new technologies are being
enjoyed by a relatively small fraction of the economy, but the technologies’ narrowly
scoped and rivalrous nature creates wasteful “gold rush”-type activities. Both those seeking
to be one of the few beneficiaries, as well as those who have attained some gains and seek
to block access to others, engage in these dissipative efforts, destroying many of the
benefits of the new technologies. 9
        Recent research offers some indirect support for elements of this story. Productivity
differences between frontier firms and average firms in the same industry have been


9Stiglitz (2014) offers a different mechanism where technological progress with concentrated benefits in the
presence of restructuring costs can lead to increased inequality and even, in the short run, economic
downturns.

                                                     8
increasing in recent years (Andrews, Criscuolo, and Gal, 2016; Furman and Orszag, 2015).
Differences in profit margins between the top and bottom performers in most industries
have also grown (McAfee and Brynjolfsson, 2009). A smaller number of superstar firms are
gaining market share (Autor et al., 2017; Brynjolfsson et al., 2008) while workers’ earnings
are increasingly tied to firm-level productivity differences (Song, Price, Guvenen, Bloom,
and von Wachter, 2015). There are concerns that industry concentration is leading to
substantial aggregate welfare losses due to the distortions of market power (e.g., De
Loecker and Eeckhout, 2017; Gutiérrez and Philippon, 2017). Furthermore, growing
inequality can lead to stagnating median incomes and associated socio-economic costs,
even when total income continues to grow.
       Although this evidence is important, it is not dispositive. The aggregate effects of
industry concentration are still under debate, and the mere fact that a technology’s gains
aren’t evenly distributed is no guarantee that resources will be dissipated in trying to
capture them—especially that there would be enough waste to erase noticeable aggregate
benefits.


Implementation and Restructuring Lags
       Each of the first three possibilities, especially the first two, relies on explaining away
the discordance between high hopes and disappointing statistical realities. One of the two
elements is presumed to be somehow “wrong.” In the misplaced optimism scenario, the
expectations for technology by technologists and investors are off base. In the
mismeasurement explanation, the tools we use to gauge empirical reality aren’t up to the
task of accurately doing so. And in the concentrated distribution stories, the private gains
for the few may be very real, but they don’t translate into broader gains for the many.
       But there is a fourth explanation that allows both halves of the seeming paradox to
be correct. It asserts that there really is good reason to be optimistic about the future
productivity growth potential of new technologies, while at the same time recognizing that
recent productivity growth has been low. The core of this story is that it takes a
considerable time—often more than is commonly appreciated—to be able to sufficiently
harness new technologies. Ironically, this is especially true for those major new
technologies that ultimately have an important effect on aggregate statistics and welfare.

                                               9
That is, those with such broad potential application that they qualify as general purpose
technologies (GPTs). Indeed, the more profound and far-reaching the potential
restructuring, the longer the time lag between the initial invention of the technology and its
full impact on the economy and society.
       This explanation implies there will be a period in which the technologies are
developed enough that investors, commentators, researchers, and policy makers can
imagine their potentially transformative effects even though they have had no discernable
effect on recent productivity growth. It isn’t until a sufficient stock of the new technology is
built and the necessary invention of complementary processes and assets occurs that the
promise of the technology actually blossoms in aggregate economic data. Investors are
forward-looking and economic statistics are backward looking. In times of technological
stability or steady change (constant velocity), the disjoint measurements will seem to track
each other. But in periods of rapid change, the two measurements can become
uncorrelated.
       There are two main sources of the delay between recognition of a new technology’s
potential and its measureable effects. One is that it takes time to build the stock of the new
technology to a size sufficient enough to have an aggregate effect. The other is that
complementary investments are necessary to obtain the full benefit of the new technology,
and it takes time to discover and develop these complements are and to implement them.
While the fundamental importance of the core invention and its potential for society might
be clearly recognizable at the outset, the myriad necessary co-inventions, obstacles and
adjustments needed along the way await discovery over time, and the required path may
be lengthy and arduous. Never mistake a clear view for a short distance.
       This explanation resolves the paradox by acknowledging that its two seemingly
contradictory parts are not actually in conflict. Rather, both parts are in some sense natural
manifestations of the same underlying phenomenon of building and implementing a new
technology.
       While each of the first three explanations for the paradox might have a role in
describing its source, the explanations also face serious questions in their ability to
describe key parts of the data. We find the fourth—the implementation and restructuring


                                               10
lags story— to be the most compelling in light of the evidence we discuss below. Thus it is
the focus of our explorations in the remainder of this essay.


The Argument in Favor of the Implementation and Restructuring Lags Explanation
           Implicit or explicit in the pessimistic view of the future is that the recent slowdown
in productivity growth portends slower productivity growth in the future. We begin by
establishing one of the most basic elements of the story: that slow productivity growth
today does not rule out faster productivity growth in the future. In fact, the evidence is
clear that it is barely predictive at all.
           Total factor productivity growth is the component of overall output growth that
cannot be explained by accounting for changes in observable labor and capital inputs. It has
been called a “measure of our ignorance” (Abramovitz, 1956). It is a residual, so an
econometrician should not be surprised if it is not very predictable from past levels. Labor
productivity is a similar measure, but instead of accounting for capital accumulation simply
divides total output by the labor hours used to produce that output.
           Figure 3 and Figure 4 plot, respectively, U.S. productivity indices since 1948 and
productivity growth by decade. The data include average labor productivity (LP), average
total factor productivity (TFP) and Fernald’s (2014) utilization-adjusted TFP (TFPua). 10

       Productivity has consistently grown in the post-war era, albeit at different rates at
different times. Despite the consistent growth, however, past productivity growth rates
have historically been poor predictors of future productivity growth. In other words, the
productivity growth of the past decade tells us little about productivity growth for the
coming decade. Looking only at productivity data, it would have been hard to predict the
decrease in productivity growth in the early 1970s or foresee the beneficial impact of IT in
the 1990s.
       As it turns out, while there is some correlation in productivity growth rates over
short intervals, the correlation between adjacent ten-year periods is not statistically
significant. We present below the results from a regression of different measures of
average productivity growth on the previous period’s average productivity growth for 10-
year intervals as well as scatterplots of productivity for each 10-year against the
productivity in the subsequent period. The regressions in Table 1 allow for autocorrelation
in error terms across years (1 lag). Table 2 clusters the standard errors by decade. Similar
results allowing for autocorrelation at longer time scales are presented in the appendix.
       In all cases, the R2 of these regressions is low, and the previous decade’s
productivity growth does not have statistically discernable predictive power over the next
decade’s growth. For labor productivity, the R2 is 0.009. Although the intercept in the
regression is significantly different from zero (productivity growth is positive, on average),
the coefficient on the previous period’s growth is not statistically significant. The point
estimate is economically small, too. Taking the estimate at face value, one percent higher
annual labor productivity growth in the prior decade (around an unconditional mean of
about two percent per year) corresponds to less than 0.1 percent faster growth in the
following decade. In the TFP growth regression, the R2 is 0.023, and again the coefficient on
the previous period’s growth is insignificant. Similar patterns hold in the utilization-
adjusted TFP regression (R2 of 0.03). The lack of explanatory power of past productivity
growth is also apparent in the scatterplots.

       The old adage that “past performance is not predictive of future results” applies well
to trying to predict productivity growth in the years to come, especially in periods of a
decade or longer. Historical stagnation does not justify forward-looking pessimism.


A Technology-Driven Case for Productivity Optimism
       Simply extrapolating recent productivity growth rates forward is not a good way to
estimate the next decade’s productivity growth. Does that imply we have no hope at all of
predicting productivity growth? We don’t think so.
       Instead of relying only on past productivity statistics, we can consider the
technological and innovation environment we expect to see in the near future. In particular,
we need to study and understand the specific technologies that actually exist and make an
assessment of their potential.
       One does not have to dig too deeply into the pool of existing technologies or assume
incredibly large benefits from any one of them to make a case that existing but still nascent

                                              16
technologies can potentially combine to create noticeable accelerations in aggregate
productivity growth. We begin by looking at a few specific examples. We will then make the
case that AI is a GPT, with broader implications.
       First, let’s consider the productivity potential of autonomous vehicles. According to
the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2016 there were 3.5 million people working in private
industry as “motor vehicle operators” of one sort or another (this includes truck drivers,
taxi drivers, bus drivers, and other similar occupations). Suppose autonomous vehicles
were to reduce, over some period, the number of drivers necessary to do the current
workload to 1.5 million. We do not think this is a far-fetched scenario given the potential of
the technology. Total nonfarm private employment in mid-2016 was 122 million.
Therefore, autonomous vehicles would reduce the number of workers necessary to achieve
the same output to 120 million. This would result in aggregate labor productivity
(calculated using the standard BLS nonfarm private series) increasing by 1.7 percent (=
122/120). Supposing this transition occurred over 10 years, this single technology would
provide a direct boost of 0.17 percent to annual productivity growth over that decade.
       This gain is significant, and it doesn’t include many potential productivity gains from
complementary changes that could accompany the diffusion of autonomous vehicles. For
instance, self-driving cars are a natural complement to transportation-as-a-service rather
than individual car ownership. The typical car is currently parked 95% of the time, making
it readily available for its owner or primary user (Morris, 2016). However, in locations with
sufficient density, a self-driving car could be summoned on demand. This would make it
possible for cars to provide useful transportation services for a larger fraction of the time,
reducing capital costs per passenger-mile, even after accounting for increased wear-and-
tear. Thus, in addition to the obvious improvements in labor productivity from replacing
drivers, capital productivity would also be significantly improved. Of course, the speed of
adoption is important for estimation of the impact of these technologies. Levy (2017) is
more pessimistic, suggesting in the near term that Long Distance Truck Driver jobs will
grow about 2% between 2014 and 2024. This is 3% less (about 55,000 jobs in that
category) than they would have grown without autonomous vehicle technology and about
3% of total employment of Long Distance Truck Drivers.


                                              17
        A second example is call centers. As of 2015, there were about 2.2 million people
working in more than 6,800 call centers in the United States, and hundreds of thousands
more work as home-based call center agents or in smaller sites. 11 Improved voice-
recognition systems coupled with intelligence question-answering tools like IBM’s Watson
might plausibly be able to handle 60-70% or more of the calls, especially since, in
accordance with the Pareto principle, a large fraction of call volume is due to variants on a
small number of basic queries. If AI reduced the number of workers by 60%, it would
increase US labor productivity by 1%, perhaps again spread over 10 years. Again, this
would likely spur complementary innovations, from shopping recommendation and travel
services to legal advice, consulting, and real-time personal coaching. Relatedly, citing
advances in AI-assisted customer service, Levy (2017) projects zero growth in Customer
Service Representatives from 2014-2024 (a difference of 260,000 jobs from BLS
projections).
        Beyond labor savings, advances in AI have the potential to boost total factor
productivity. In particular, energy efficiency and materials usage could be improved in
many large-scale industrial plants. For instance, a team from Google DeepMind recently
trained an ensemble of neural networks to optimize power consumption in a data center.
By carefully tracking the data already collected from thousands of sensors tracking
temperatures, electricity usage, and pump speeds, the system learned how to make
adjustments in the operating parameters. As a result, the AI was able to reduce the amount
of energy used for cooling by 40% compared to the levels achieved by human experts. The
algorithm was a general-purpose framework designed to account complex dynamics, so it
is easy to see how such a system could be applied to other data centers at Google, or indeed
around the world. Overall, data center electricity costs in the U.S. are about $6 billion per
year, including about $2 billion just for cooling. 12
        What’s more, similar applications of machine learning could be implemented in a
variety of commercial and industrial activities. For instance, manufacturing accounts for

about $2.2 trillion of value added each year. Manufacturing companies like GE are already
using AI to forecast product demand, future customer maintenance needs, and analyze
performance data coming from sensors on their capital equipment. Recent work on
training deep neural network models to perceive objects and achieve sensorimotor control
at the same time have yielded robots that can perform a variety of hand-eye coordination
tasks (e.g., unscrewing bottle caps and hanging coat hangers) (Levine et al., 2016). Liu et al.
(2017) trained robots to perform a number of household chores, like sweeping and
pouring almonds into a pan, using a technique called imitation learning. 13 In this approach,
the robot learns to perform a task using a raw video demonstration of what it needs to do.
These techniques will surely be important for automating manufacturing processes in the
future. The results suggest that artificial intelligence may soon improve productivity in
household production tasks as well, which in 2010 were worth as much as $2.5 trillion in
nonmarket value-added (Bridgman et al., 2012). 14
         Although these examples are each suggestive of non-trivial productivity gains, they
are only a fraction of the set of applications for AI and machine learning that have been
identified so far. James Manyika and his colleagues analyzed 2000 tasks and estimated that
about 45% of the activities that people are paid to perform in the US economy could be
automated using existing levels of AI and other technologies. They stress that the pace of
automation will depend on factors other than technical feasibility, including the costs of
automation, regulatory barriers, and social acceptance.


Artificial Intelligence is a General Purpose Technology
         As important as specific applications of AI may be, we argue that the more
important economic effects of AI, machine learning, and associated new technologies stem
from the fact that they embody the characteristics of general purpose technologies (GPTs).




13Videos of these efforts available here: https://sites.google.com/site/imitationfromobservation/
14One factor that might temper the aggregate impact of AI-driven productivity gains is if product demand for
the sectors with the largest productivity AI gains is sufficiently inelastic. In this case, these sectors’ shares of
total expenditure will shrink, shifting activity toward slower-growing sectors and muting aggregate
productivity growth a la Baumol and Bowen (1966). It is unclear what the elasticities of demand are for the
product classes most likely to be affected by AI.

                                                         19
Bresnahan and Trajtenberg (1996) argue that a GPT should be pervasive, able to be
improved upon over time, and be able to spawn complementary innovations.
       The steam engine, electricity, the internal combustion engine, and computers are
each examples of important general purpose technologies. Each of them increased
productivity not only directly but also by spurring important complementary innovations.
For instance, the steam engine not only helped to pump water from coal mines, its most
important initial application, but also spurred the invention of more effective factory
machinery and new forms of transportation like steamships and railroads. In turn, these
co-inventions helped give rise to innovations in supply chains and mass marketing, to new
organizations with hundreds of thousands of employees, and even to seemingly unrelated
innovations like standard time, which was needed to manage railroad schedules.
       AI, and in particular machine learning, certainly has the potential to be pervasive, to
be improved upon over time, and to spawn complementary innovations, making it a
candidate for an important GPT.
       As noted by Agrawal, Gans, and Goldfarb (2017), the current generation of machine
learning systems is particularly suited for augmenting or automating tasks that involve at
least some prediction aspect, broadly defined. These cover a wide range of tasks,
occupations and industries, from driving a car (predicting the correct direction to turn the
steering wheel) and diagnosing a disease (predicting its cause) to recommending a product
(predicting what the customer will like) and writing a song (predicting which note
sequence will be most popular). The core capabilities of perception and cognition
addressed by current systems are pervasive, if not indispensable, for many tasks done by
humans.
       Machine learning systems are also designed to improve over time. Indeed, what sets
them apart from earlier technologies is that they are designed to improve themselves over
time. Instead of requiring an inventor or developer to codify, or code, each step of a process
to be automated, a machine learning algorithm can discover on its own a function that
connects a set of inputs X to a set of outputs Y as long as its given a sufficiently large set of
labeled examples mapping some of the inputs to outputs (Brynjolfsson and Mitchell, 2017).
The improvements reflect not only the discovery of new algorithms and techniques,
particularly for deep neural networks, but also their complementarities with vastly more

                                                20
powerful computer hardware and the availability of much larger digital datasets that can
be used to train the systems (Brynjolfsson and McAfee, 2017). More and more digital data
is collected as byproduct of digitizing operations, customer interactions, communications
and other aspects of our lives, providing fodder for more and better machine learning
applications. 15
        Most importantly, machine learning systems can spur a variety of complementary
innovations. For instance, machine learning has transformed the abilities of machines to
perform a number of basic types of perception that enable a broader set of applications.
Consider machine vision—the ability to see and recognize objects, to label them in photos,
and to interpret video streams. As error rates in identifying pedestrians improve from one
per 30 frames to about one per 30 million frames, self-driving cars become increasingly
feasible (Brynjolfsson and McAfee, 2017).
        Improved machine vision also makes practical a variety of factory automation tasks
and medical diagnoses. Gill Pratt has made an analogy to the development of vision in
animals 500 million years ago, which helped ignite the Cambrian explosion and a burst of
new species on earth (Pratt, 2015). He also noted that machines have a new capability that
no biological species has: the ability to share knowledge and skills almost instantaneously
with others. Specifically, the rise of cloud computing has made it significantly easier to scale
up new ideas at much lower cost than before. This is an especially important development
for advancing the economic impact of machine learning because it enables cloud robotics:
the sharing of knowledge among robots. Once a new skill is learned by a machine in one
location, it can be replicated to other machines via digital networks. Data as well as skills
can be shared, increasing the amount of data that any given machine learner can use.
        This in turn increases the rate of improvement. For instance, self-driving cars that
encounter an unusual situation can upload that information with a shared platform where
enough examples can be aggregated to infer a pattern. Only one self-driving vehicle needs
to experience an anomaly for many vehicles to learn from it. Waymo, a subsidiary of
Google, has cars driving 25,000 “real” autonomous and about 19 million simulated miles



15For example, through enterprise resource planning systems in factories, internet commerce, mobile
phones, and the “Internet of Things.”

                                                    21
each week. 16 All of the Waymo cars learn from the joint experience of the others. Similarly,
a robot struggling with a task can benefit from sharing data and learnings with other robots
that use a compatible knowledge-representation framework. 17
        When one thinks of AI as a GPT, the implications for output and welfare gains are
much larger than in our earlier analysis. For example, self-driving cars could substantially
transform many non-transport industries. Retail could shift much further toward home
delivery on demand, creating consumer welfare gains and further freeing up valuable high-
density land now used for parking. Traffic and safety could be optimized, and insurance
risks could fall. With over 30,000 deaths due to automobile crashes in the U.S. each year,
and nearly a million worldwide, there is an opportunity to save many lives. 18


Why Future Technological Progress Is Consistent with Low Current Productivity
Growth
        Having made a case for technological optimism, we now turn to explaining why it is
not inconsistent with—and in fact may even be naturally related to—low current
productivity growth.
        Like other GPTs, AI has the potential to be an important driver of productivity.
However, as Jovanovic and Rousseau (2005) point out (with additional reference to David’s
[1991] historical example), “a GPT does not deliver productivity gains immediately upon
arrival” (p. 1184). The technology can be present and developed enough to allow some
notion of its transformative effects even though it is not affecting current productivity
levels in any noticeable way. This is precisely the state that we argue the economy may be
in now.
        We discussed above that a GPT can at one moment both be present and yet not
affect current productivity growth if there is a need to build a sufficiently large stock of the


16 http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2017/8/20/winner-takes-all
17 Rethink Robotics is developing exactly such a platform.
18 These latter two consequences of autonomous vehicles, while certainly reflecting welfare improvements,

would need to be capitalized in prices of goods or services to be measured in standard GDP and productivity
measures. We will discuss AI-related measurement issues in greater depth below. Of course it is worth
remembering that autonomous vehicles also hold the potential to create new economic costs if, say, the
congestion from lower marginal costs of operating a vehicle is not counteracted by sufficiently large
improvements in traffic management technology or certain infrastructure investments.

                                                    22
new capital, or if complementary types of capital, both tangible and intangible, need to be
identified, produced, and put in place to fully harness the GPT’s productivity benefits.
        The time necessary to build a sufficient capital stock can be extensive. For example,
it wasn’t until the late 1980s, more than 25 years after the invention of the integrated
circuit, that the computer capital stock reached its long-run plateau at about 5 percent (at
historical cost) of total nonresidential equipment capital. It was at only half that level 10
years prior. Thus, when Solow pointed out his now eponymous paradox, the computers
were finally just then getting to the point where they really could be seen everywhere.
        David (1991) notes a similar phenomenon in the diffusion of electrification. At least
half of U.S. manufacturing establishments remained unelectrified until 1919, about 30
years after the shift to polyphase alternating current began. Initially, adoption was driven
by simple cost savings in providing motive power. The biggest benefits came later, when
complementary innovations were made. Managers began to fundamentally re-organize
work by replacing factories’ centralized power source and giving every individual machine
its own electric motor. This enables much more flexibility in the location of equipment and
made possible effective assembly lines of materials flow.
        This approach to organizing factories is obvious in retrospect, yet it took as many as
30 years for it to become widely adopted. Why? As noted by Henderson (1993; 2006), it is
exactly because incumbents are designed around the current ways of doing things and so
proficient at them that they are blind to or unable to absorb the new approaches and get
trapped in the status quo—they suffer the “curse of knowledge.” 19
        The factory electrification example demonstrates the other contributor to the time
gap between a technology’s emergence and its measured productivity effects: the need for
installation (and often invention) of complementary capital. This includes both tangible
and intangible investments. The timeline necessary to invent, acquire, and install these
complements is typically more extensive than the time-to-build considerations just
discussed.


19 Atkeson and Kehoe (2007) note manufacturers’ reluctance to abandon their large knowledge stock at the

beginning of the transition to electric power to adopt what was, initially, only a marginally superior
technology. David and Wright (2006) are more specific, focusing on the “the need for organizational and
above all for conceptual changes in the ways tasks and products are defined and structured” (p. 147,
emphasis in original).

                                                   23
       Consider the measured lag between large investments in IT and productivity
benefits within firms. Brynjolfsson and Hitt (2003) found that while small productivity
benefits were associated with firms’ IT investments when one-year differences were
considered, the benefits grew substantially as longer differences were examined, peaking
after about seven years. They attributed this pattern to the need for complementary
changes in business processes. For instance, when implementing large enterprise planning
systems, firms almost always spend several times more money on business process
redesign and training than on the direct costs of hardware and software. Hiring and other
HR practices often need considerable adjustment to match the firm’s human capital to the
new structure of production. In fact, Bresnahan, Brynjolfsson, and Hitt (2002) find evidence
of three-way complementarities between IT, human capital, and organizational changes in
the investment decisions and productivity levels. Furthermore, Brynjolfsson, Hitt, and Yang
(2002) show each dollar of IT capital stock is correlated with about $10 of market value.
They interpret this as evidence of substantial IT-related intangible assets and show that
firms that combine IT investments with a specific set of organizational practices are not
just more productive: they also have disproportionately higher market values than firms
that invest in only one or the other. This pattern in the data is consistent with a long stream
of research on the importance of organizational and even cultural change when making IT
investments and technology investments more generally (e.g., Aral et al., 2012;
Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 2000; Orlikowski, 1996; Henderson, 2006).
       But such changes take substantial time and resources, contributing to organizational
inertia. Firms are complex systems that require an extensive web of complementary assets
to allow the GPT to fully transform the system. Firms that are attempting transformation
often must reevaluate and reconfigure not only their internal processes but often their
supply and distribution chains as well. These changes can take time, but managers and
entrepreneurs will direct invention in ways that economize on the most expensive inputs
(Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2017). According to LeChatelier’s principle (Milgrom and
Roberts, 1996), elasticities will therefore tend to be greater in the long run than in the
short run as quasi-fixed factors adjust.
       There is no assurance that the adjustments will be successful. Indeed, there is
evidence that the modal transformation of GPT-level magnitude fails. Alon, Berger, Dent,

                                              24
and Pugsley (2017) find that cohorts of firms over five years old contribute little to
aggregate productivity growth on net—that is, among established firms, productivity
improvements in one firm are offset by productivity declines other firms. It is hard to teach
the proverbial old dog new tricks. Moreover, the old dogs (companies) often have internal
incentives to not learn them (Arrow, 1962; Holmes, Levine, and Schmitz, 2012). In some
ways, technology advances in industry one company death at a time.
       Transforming industries and sectors requires still more adjustment and
reconfiguration. Retail offers a vivid example. Despite being one of the biggest innovations
to come out of the 1990s dot-com boom, the largest change in retail in the two decades that
followed was not e-commerce but instead the expansion of warehouse stores and
supercenters (Hortaçsu and Syverson, 2015). Only very recently did e-commerce become a
force for general retailers to reckon with. Why did it take so long? Brynjolfsson and Smith
(1999) document the difficulties incumbent retailers had in adapting their business
processes to take full advantage of the internet and electronic commerce. Many
complementary investments were required. The sector as a whole required the build out of
an entire distribution infrastructure. Customers had to be “retrained.” None of this could
happen quickly. The potential of ecommerce to revolutionize retailing was widely
recognized, and even hyped in the late 1990s, but its actual share of retail commerce was
miniscule, 0.2% of all retail sales in 1999. Only after two decades of widely predicted yet
time-consuming change in the industry, is ecommerce starting to approach 10% of total
retail sales and companies like Amazon are having a first-order effect on more traditional
retailers’ sales and stock market valuations.
       The case of self-driving cars discussed earlier provides a more prospective example
of how productivity might lag technology. Consider what happens to the current pools of
vehicle production and vehicle operation workers when autonomous vehicles are
introduced. Employment on production side will initially increase to handle R&D, AI
development, and new vehicle engineering. Furthermore, learning curve issues could well
imply lower productivity in manufacturing a these vehicles during the early years (Levitt,
List, and Syverson, 2013). Thus labor input in the short run can actually increase, rather
than decrease, for the same amount of vehicle production. In the early years of autonomous
vehicle development and production, the marginal labor added by producers exceeds the

                                                25
marginal labor displaced among the motor vehicle operators. It is only later when the fleet
of deployed autonomous vehicles gets closer to a steady state that measured productivity
reflects the full benefits of the technology.


Viewing Today’s Paradox through the Lens of Previous General Purpose Technologies
        We have indicated in the discussion above that we see parallels between the current
paradox and those that have happened in the past. It is closely related to the Solow Paradox
era circa 1990, certainly, but it is also tied closely to the experience during the diffusion of
portable power (combining the contemporaneous growth and transformative effects of
electrification and the internal combustion engine).
        Comparing the productivity growth patterns of the two eras is instructive. Figure 8
is an updated version of an analysis from Syverson (2013). It overlays U.S. labor
productivity since 1970 with that from 1890 to 1940, the period after portable power
technologies had been invented and were starting to be placed into production. (The
historical series values are from Kendrick [1961].) The modern series timeline is indexed
to a value of 100 in 1995 and is labeled on the upper horizontal axis. The portable power
era index has a value of 100 in 1915, and its years are shown on the lower horizontal axis.
        Labor productivity during the portable power era shared remarkably similar
patterns with the current series. In both eras, there was an initial period of roughly a
quarter century of relatively slow productivity growth. Then both eras saw decade-long
accelerations in productivity growth, spanning 1915 to 1924 in the portable power era and
1995 to 2004 more recently.
        The late-1990s acceleration was the (at least partial) resolution of the Solow
Paradox. We imagine that the late 1910s acceleration could have similarly answered some
economist’s query in 1910 as to why one sees electric motors and internal combustion
engines everywhere but in the productivity statistics. 20




20We aren’t aware of anyone who actually said this, and of course today’s system of national economic
statistics did not exist at that time, but we find the scenario amusing, instructive, and in some ways plausible.

            Figure 8. Labor Productivity Growth in the Portable Power and IT Eras


       Very interestingly, and quite relevant to the current situation, the productivity
growth slowdown we have experienced after 2004 also has a parallel in the historical data,
a slowdown from 1924 to 1932. As can be seen in the figure, and instructive to the point of
whether a new wave of AI and associated technologies (or if one prefers, a second wave of
IT-based technology) could re-accelerate productivity growth, labor productivity growth at
the end of the portable power era rose again, averaging 2.7 percent per year between 1933
and 1940.
       Of course this past breakout growth is no guarantee that productivity must speed up
again today. However, it does raise two relevant points. First, it is another example of a
period of sluggish productivity growth followed by an acceleration. Second, it demonstrates
that productivity growth driven by a core GPT can arrive in multiple waves.


Expected Productivity Effects of an AI-Driven Acceleration
       To understand the likely productivity effects of AI, it is useful to think of AI as a type
of capital, specifically a type of intangible capital. It can be accumulated through
investment; it is a durable factor of production; and its value can depreciate. Treating AI as



                                               27
a type of capital clarifies how its development and installation as a productive factor will
affect productivity.
       As with any capital deepening, increasing AI will raise labor productivity. This
would be true regardless of how well AI capital is measured (which we might expect it
won’t be for several reasons discussed below) though there may be lags.
       AI’s effects on total factor productivity (TFP) are more complex and the impact will
depend on its measurement. If AI (and its output elasticity) were to be measured perfectly
and included in the both the input bundle in the denominator of TFP and the output bundle
in the numerator, then measured TFP will accurately reflect true TFP. In this case, AI could
be treated just like any other measurable capital input. Its effect on output could be
properly accounted for and “removed” by the TFP input measure, leading to no change in
TFP. This isn’t to say that there wouldn’t be productive benefits from diffusion of AI; it is
just that it could be valued like other types of capital input.
       There are reasons why economists and national statistical agencies might face
measurement problems when dealing with AI. Some are instances of more general capital
measurement issues, but others are likely to be idiosyncratic to AI. We discuss this next.


Measuring AI Capital
       Regardless of the effects of AI and AI-related technologies on actual output and
productivity, it is clear from the productivity outlook above that the ways AI’s effects will
be measured are dependent on how well countries’ statistics programs measure AI capital.
       The primary difficulty in AI capital measurement is, as mentioned above, that many
of its outputs will be intangible. This issue is exacerbated by the AI the extensive use of as
an input in making other capital, including new types of software, as well as human and
organizational capital, rather than final consumption goods. Much of this other capital,
including human capital, will, like AI itself, be mostly intangible (Jones and Romer, 2010).
       To be more specific, effective use of AI requires developing datasets, building firm-
specific human capital, and implementing new business processes. These all require
substantial capital outlays and maintenance. The tangible counterparts to these intangible
expenditures, including purchases of computing resources, servers, and real estate, are
easily measured in the standard neo-classical growth accounting model (Solow, 1957). On

                                               28
the other hand, the value of capital goods production for complementary intangible
investments is difficult to quantify. Both tangible and intangible capital stocks generate a
capital service flow yield that accrues over time. Realizing these yields requires more than
simply renting capital stock. After purchasing capital assets, firms incur additional
adjustment costs (e.g., business process redesigns and installation costs). These adjustment
costs make capital less flexible than frictionless rental markets would imply. Much of the
market value of AI capital specifically and IT capital more generally may be derived from
the capitalized short-term quasi-rents earned by firms that have already reorganized to
extract service flows from new investment.
       Yet while the stock of tangible assets is booked on corporate balance sheets,
expenditures on the intangible complements and adjustment costs to AI investment
commonly are not. Without including the production and use of intangible AI capital, the
usual growth accounting decompositions of changes in value added can misattribute AI
intangible capital deepening to changes in TFP. As discussed in Hall (2000) and Yang and
Brynjolfsson (2001), this constitutes an omission of a potentially important component of
capital goods production in the calculation of final output. Estimates of TFP will therefore
be inaccurate, though possibly in either direction. In the case where the intangible AI
capital stock is growing faster than output, then TFP growth will be underestimated, while
TFP will be overestimated if capital stock is growing more slowly than output.
       The intuition for this effect is that in any given period t, the output of (unmeasured)
AI capital stock in period t+1 is a function the input (unmeasured) existing AI capital stock
in period t. When AI stock is growing rapidly, the unmeasured outputs (AI capital stock
created) will be greater than the unmeasured inputs (AI capital stock used).
       Furthermore, suppose the relevant costs in terms of labor and other resources
needed to create intangible assets are measured, but the resulting increases in intangible
assets are not measured as contributions to output. In this case, not only will total GDP be
undercounted but so will productivity, which uses GDP as its numerator. Thus periods of
rapid intangible capital accumulation may be associated with lower measured productivity
growth, even if true productivity is increasing.
       With missing capital goods production, measured productivity will only reflect the
fact that more capital and labor inputs are used up in producing measured output. The

                                              29
inputs used to produce unmeasured capital goods will instead resemble lost potential
output. For example, a recent report from the Brookings Institution estimates that
investments in autonomous vehicles have topped $80 billion from 2014 to 2017 with little
consumer adoption of the technology so far. 21 This is roughly 0.44% of 2016 GDP (spread
over 3 years). If all of the capital formation in autonomous vehicles was generated by
equally costly labor inputs, this would lower estimated labor productivity by 0.1% per year
over the last 3 years since autonomous vehicles have not yet led to any significant increase
in measured final output. Similarly, according to the AI Index, enrollment in AI and ML
courses at leading universities has roughly tripled over the past 10 years, and the number
of venture-back AI-related start-ups has more than quadrupled. To the extent they create
intangible assets beyond the costs of production, GDP will be underestimated.
           Eventually the mismeasured intangible capital goods investments are expected yield
a return (i.e. output) by their investors. If and when measurable output is produced by
these hidden assets, another mismeasurement effect leading to overestimation of
productivity will kick in. When the output share and stock of mismeasured or omitted
capital grows, the measured output increases produced by that capital will be incorrectly
attributed to total factor productivity improvements. As the growth rate of investment in
unmeasured capital goods decreases, the capital service flow from unmeasured goods
effect on TFP can exceed the underestimation error from unmeasured capital goods.
           Combining these two effect produces a “J-Curve” wherein early production of
intangible capital leads to underestimation of productivity growth, but later returns from
the stock of unmeasured capital creates measured output growth that might be incorrectly
attributed to TFP.

         The right side of the equation describes a hidden capital effect and a hidden
investment effect. When the growth rate of new investment in unmeasured capital
multiplied by its share of output is larger (smaller) than the growth rate of the stock of
unmeasured capital multiplied by its share of output, the estimated Solow Residual will
underestimate (overestimate) the rate of productivity growth. Initially, new types of capital
will have a high marginal product. Firms will accumulate that capital until its marginal rate
of return is equal to the rate of return of other capital. As capital accumulates, the growth
rate of net investment in the unmeasured capital will turn negative, causing a greater
overestimate TFP. In steady state, neither net investment’s share of output nor the net
stock of unmeasured capital grows and the productivity mismeasurement is zero. Figure 9
below provides an illustration. 22

       Looking forward, these problems may be particularly stark for AI capital, because its
accumulation will almost surely outstrip the pace of ordinary capital accumulation in the
short-run. AI capital is a new category of capital—new in economic statistics, certainly, but
we would argue practically so as well.
       This also means that capital quantity indexes that are computed from within-type
capital growth might have problems benchmarking size and effect of AI early on. National
statistics agencies do not really focus on measuring capital types that aren’t already
ubiquitous. New capital categories will tend to either be rolled into existing types, possibly
with lower inferred marginal products (leading to an understatement of the productive
effect of the new capital), or missed altogether. This problem is akin to the new goods
problem in price indexes.
       A related issue—once AI is measured separately—is how closely its units of
measurement will capture AI’s marginal product relative to other capital stock. That is, if a
dollar of AI stock has a marginal product that is twice as high as the modal unit of non-AI
capital in the economy, will the quantity indexes of AI reflect this? This requires measured
relative prices of AI and non-AI capital to capture differences in marginal product.
Measuring levels correctly is less important than measuring accurate proportional


                                              32
differences (whether intertemporally or in the cross section) correctly. What is needed in
the end is that a unit of AI capital twice as productive as another should be twice as large in
the capital stock.
       It is worth noting that these are all classic problems in capital measurement and not
new to AI. Perhaps these problems will be systematically worse for AI, but this is not
obvious ex ante. What it does mean is that economists and national statistical agencies at
least have experience in, if not quite a full solution for, dealing with these sorts of
limitations. That said, some measurement issues are likely to be especially prevalent for AI.
For instance, a substantial part of the value of AI output may be firm-specific. Imagine a
program that figures out individual consumers’ product preferences or price elasticities
and matches products and pricing to predictions. This has different value to different
companies depending on their customer bases and product selection, and knowledge may
not be transferrable across firms. The value also depends on companies’ abilities to
implement price discrimination. Such limits could come from characteristics of company’s
market, like resale opportunities, which are not always under firms’ control, or from the
existence in the firm of complementary implementation assets and/or abilities. Likewise,
each firm will likely have a different skill mix that it seeks in its employees, unique needs in
its production process, and a particular set of supply constraints. In such cases, firm-
specific data sets and applications of those data will differentiate the machine learning
capabilities of one firm from another (Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2017).


Conclusion
       There are plenty of both optimists and pessimists about technology and growth. The
optimists tend to be technologists and venture capitalists, and many are clustered in
technology hubs. The pessimists tend to be economists, sociologists, statisticians, and
government officials. Many of them are clustered in major state and national capitals. There
is much less interaction between the two groups than within them, and it often seems as
though they are talking past each other. In this paper, we argue that in an important a
sense, they are.
       When we talk with the optimists, we are convinced that the recent breakthroughs in
AI and machine learning are real and significant. We also would argue that they form the

                                               33
core of a new, economically important potential GPT. When we speak with the pessimists,
we are convinced that productivity growth has slowed down recently and what gains there
have been are unevenly distributed, leaving many people with stagnating incomes,
declining metrics of health and well-being, and good cause for concern. People are
uncertain about the future, and many of the industrial titans that once dominated the
employment and market value leaderboard have fallen on harder times.
       These two stories are not contradictory. In fact, any many ways, they are consistent
and symptomatic of an economy in transition. Our analysis suggests that while the recent
past has been difficult, it is not destiny. Although it is always dangerous to make
predictions, and we are humble about our ability to foretell the future, our reading of the
evidence does provide some cause for optimism. The breakthroughs of AI technologies
already demonstrated are not yet affecting much of the economy, but they portend bigger
effects as they diffuse. More importantly, they enable complementary innovations that
could multiply their impact. Both the AI investments and the complementary changes are
costly, hard to measure, and take time to implement, and this can, at least initially, depress
productivity as it is currently measured. Entrepreneurs, managers and end-users will find
powerful new applications for machines that can now learn how to recognize objects,
understand human language, speak, make accurate predictions, solve problems, and
interact with the world with increasing dexterity and mobility.
       Further advances in the core technologies of machine learning would likely yield
substantial benefits. However, our perspective suggests that an underrated area of
research involves the complements to the new AI technologies, not only in areas of human
capital and skills, but also new processes and business models. The intangible assets
associated with the last wave of computerization were about ten times as large as the
direct investments in computer hardware itself. We think it is plausible that AI-associated
intangibles could be of a comparable or greater magnitude. Given the big changes in
coordination and production possibilities made possible by AI, the ways that we organized
work and education in the past are unlikely to remain optimal in the future.
       Relatedly, we need to update our economic measurement toolkits. As AI and its
complements more rapidly add to our (intangible) capital stock, traditional metrics like
GDP and productivity can become more difficult to measure and interpret. Successful

                                              34
companies don’t need large investments in factories or even computer hardware, but they
do have intangible assets that are costly to replicate. The large market values associated
with companies developing and/or implementing AI suggest that investors believe there is
real value in those companies. In the case that claims on the assets of the firm are publicly
traded and markets are efficient, the financial market will properly value the firm as the
present value of its risk-adjusted discounted cash flows. This can provide an estimate of the
value of both the tangible and intangible assets owned by the firm. What’s more, the effects
on living standards may be even larger than the benefits that investors hope to capture. It is
also possible, even likely, that many people will not share in those benefits. Economists are
well positioned to contribute to a research agenda of documenting and understanding the
often-intangible changes associated with AI and its broader economic implications.
       Realizing the benefits of AI is far from automatic. It will require effort and
entrepreneurship to develop the needed complements, and adaptability at the individual,
organizational, and societal levels to undertake the associated restructuring. Theory
predicts that the winners will be those with the lowest adjustment costs and that put as
many of the right complements in place as possible. This is partly a matter of good fortune,
but with the right roadmap, it is also something for which they, and all of us, can prepare.
