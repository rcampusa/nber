             How Much Care Do the Aged Receive from Their Children?
                  A Bimodal Picture of Contact and Assistance



                                    ABSTRACT

      This paper presents some preliminary findings about contact between the
 aged and their children based on a new survey of the aged and their children,
 entitled The Hebrew Rehabilitation Center for the Aged-NBER (HRC-NBER) Child
 Survey. Data on extended families is quite limited. The HRC-NBER Child
 Survey represents one of the few attempts to collect economic and demographic
 data on the elderly and their children. While these data will be used in
 future research to test structural models of the living arrangements, the
 purposes of the current paper are to describe the survey and to examine
 contact between the elderly and their children.
      While our findings are preliminary and will be updated and expanded as we
 receive more data, it appears that a significant minority of the elderly, many
 of whom need assistance with the activities of daily living, have either no
 children or have only limited contact with their children. Contact between
 children and the vulnerable elderly appears to be less than that between
 children and the nonvulnerable elderly, and the amount of contact between
 children and the institutionalized elderly seems the least of all. In
 addition, although many of the parents in our data are very poor, financial
 support from children to parents, other than in the form of shared housing, is
 uncommon. The impression given by these data is that many of the elderly are
 very well cared for by their children, while a significant minority either
 have no children or have no children who provide significant time or care.
      Some of the findings for this sample are striking:

       (1) over a fifth of the elderly have no children.

       (2) over one half of the elderly either do not have a daughter or do
            not have a daughter who lives within an hour of them.
       (3) over half of single elderly males and females and over two fifths of
            vulnerable single elderly males and females live completely alone.

       (4) of the elderly who have children, fewer than a quarter live with
            their children.
       (5) a small fraction of elderly with children hear from them at most on
            a yearly basis.

       (5) almost 10 percent of the children of the elderly have at most yearly
            contact.
       (7) financial assistance from children to the elderly, even in cases
            where the elderly are quite poor, is extremely rare.
       (8)  in a typical month over a quarter of elderly who have children do
            not physically spend time with their children.

I.   Introduction

     This paper presents some preliminary findings about contact between the

aged and their children based on a new survey of the aged and their children,

entitled The Hebrew Rehabilitation Center for the Aged—NBER (HRC-NBER) Child

Survey. Data on extended families is quite limited. The HRC-NBER Child

Survey represents one of the few attempts to collect economic and demographic

data on the elderly and their children. While these data will be used in

future research to test structural models of the living arrangements, the

purposes of the current paper are to describe the survey and to examine

contact between the elderly and their children.

     The HRC-NBER Child Survey collects information on the children of elderly

individuals residing in Massachusetts. Since 1982 The Hebrew Rehabilitation

Center for the Aged has been conducting a panel survey of the elderly in

Massachusetts, which we will refer to as the HRC Elderly Survey. The original

sample of 3000 elderly individuals in the HRC elderly Survey was randomly

drawn based on Massachusetts police records which record the ages and

addresses of Massachusetts residents. The initial sample included only the

non-institutionalized elderly, but each subsequent survey has followed the

noninstitutionalized elderly to their institutions if they became

institutionalized. The primary purpose of the HRC Elderly Survey is to

collect information on the living arrangements, health status, and helpers of

the elderly. In the most recent and still on-going reinterview of the elderly

we added additional economic questions as well as questions about children.

We also requested permission to interview the children of the elderly.
                                     —2—


     In the HRC-NBER Child Survey we are interviewing one child of each of the

elderly in the HRC Elderly Survey who had children and who granted permission

for the interview. The child contacted is not randomly selected from the set

of children of the elderly; we felt it was most appropriate to let the elderly

tell us which of their children they were willing to let us contact. To date

we have completed 399 child surveys. Each child survey asks questions about

the child, the child's spouse, and the child and spouses' children. It also

asks about the elderly parents and about the child's siblings.

     The elderly in the HRC panel are now quite old and over two fifths have

health problems or difficulties in performing daily activities. Hence, the

combination of panel data on the elderly and data on their children from the

child survey provide a unique opportunity to examine the behavior of the

extended family for a sample of elderly many of whom appear to need assistance

of one kind or another.

     The next Section, Section II, briefly discusses the child survey.

Section III presents data from 2354 HRC Elderly reinterviews tht were

completed between June 1986 and June 1987. Section IV presents some

preliminary findings from the initial 399 respondents in our child survey.


II. A Description of The HRC-NBER Child Survey

     The HRC-NBER Child Survey is a telephone interview survey roughly 45

minutes in length. Interviews with the child's spouse were conducted if the

child was unavailable. The current survey is the product of three small

pretests. Our primary objective in conducting the pretests was to find a

sequence of questions about siblings' income and net wealth positions that
                                     -3—


would elicit a high response rate. The respondents in our child survey appear

to know, within a range, how much income their siblings receive and the amount

of their siblings' net wealth. But if one asks them straight off about their

siblings' resources, their inclination is to say "I don't know". "I don't

know" appears really to mean "I don't know precisely". Hence, to elicit the

admittedly imprecise, but potentially still quite useful information about

siblings, the respondent needs to be coaxed a bit by first asking much broader

questions.

     The sequence of questions about income (net wealth) that worked best

involves first asking the child whether the sibling owns a home and, if so,

its market value. Next we askthe child to rank his and his spouse's combined

income (net wealth) relative to the combined incomes (net wealth) of his

siblings and their spouses. Next we ask how much larger or smaller each

sibling's and sibling's spouse's combined income (net wealth) is relative to

the combined income (net wealth) of the sibling and his spouse. The response

rate to these questions is to be about 75 percent.

     The response rates to other questions in the survey, including other

questions about siblings, are closer to 100 percent. In the case of siblings

these other questions include age, geographic location, marital status, number

of young children, work and health status, occupation, industry, education, and

grades in high school. Most of these questions are repeated for the sibling's

spouse. In addition, the child was asked to indicate the frequency of contact

between the sibling and his spouse and the child's parent(s), the amount of

time the sibling and his spouse spent helping the child's parent(s), and the

amount of financial assistance the sibling and his spouse give to or receive

from the child's parent(s).
                                        -4-


      The ch1d is also asked about his parents' health status as well as their

 income and net wealth. Since we have information directly from the parent on

 these and other questions, we are in a position to compare the responses of

 the child to those of the parent(s).


III. Some Findings on Child-Parent Contact from the 1986-87 NRC Survey
     of the Elderly

      In the 1986-87 NRC Survey of the Elderly we asked the elderly questions

about their children including their geographic location, their contact with

the elderly parent(s), their time spent helping the elderly parent(s), and the

amount of financial support they give to or receive from the elderly

parent(s).

     Table 1 presents the distribution by age, sex, and vulnerable status of

the 1986-87 sample of elderly that has been surveyed to date. The elderly

respondent is designated vulnerable if he or she has problems of low fatigue

or physical function or has difficulties in performing chores such as

preparing meals or shopping. The sample is clearly quite old. Less than 10

percent of the total 2354 respondents are under age 70. A total of 14.4

percent are 90 or older. Over two thirds of the respondents are elderly

women. The female respondents tend to be somewhat older than the male

respondents.

     Table 2 enumerates parents by the number of their children. The table

distinguishes the elderly respondents by their marital status and children by

their sex. Of the 2354 elderly in the sample, over one fifth, 22.4 percent,

have no children. Another 19.8 percent have only one child.   Slightly under

half have two, three, or four children, and less than 10 percent have five or

more children.
                                       -5—


     Elderly couples are more likely to have children than the single elderly.

This reflects both the fact that some of the single elderly never married and

that parent and child lifespans are positively correlated. Only 13.2 percent

of elderly couples have no children, compared with over a quarter of single

males and single females.

     Daughters are often viewed as more important providers of care to the

elderly than sons. In total, 40.5 percent of the sample have no daughters,

and one half of the sample have either no daughters or just one daughter; 43.5

percent of single elderly males in the sample have no daughters. The

comparable figures for single elderly females and elderly couples are 44.4

percent and 31.1 percent respectively.

     Table 3 repeats Table 2 for the vulnerable sample. Of the 2354 elderly

respondents, 985 are vulnerable. The distribution of vulnerable elderly by

number and sex of children -is quite similar to that of the nonvulnerable.

     Table 4 examines the geographic location of children. Fewer than one

fifth of the elderly live with their children. One third of the elderly

have either no children or no children who live within 1 hour. Of those

elderly who have children, but are not living with any of them, only 44.6

percent have more than one child within 1 hour. These numbers suggest a

rather limited ability of the children of a sizeable minority of elderly to

provide direct care for the elderly.

     Surprisingly, the figures for vulnerable elderly reported in Table 5 are

quite similar. Despite their health problems, the vulnerable elderly are only

slightly more likely to live with or near their children than the

nonvulnerable elderly.
                                      -6-


     The next two tables, 6 and 7, consider in more detail the living

arrangements of the entire sample of elderly and the subsample of vulnerable

elderly. Only 13.1 percent of all the elderly and only 15.4 percent of the

vulnerable elderly live with their children. The majority of single elderly

and over 40 percent of the single vulnerable elderly live completely by

themselves. Some 11.8 percent of the 1986-1987 NRC Elderly Sample are

institutionalized, while over one fourth of the vulnerable elderly are

institutionalized. Taken together, these tables suggest only a modest amount

of support by children in the form of living with their elderly and often

vulnerable parents.

     Tables 8, 9, and 10 consider contact with children of the entire elderly

sample and the vulnerable elderly sample, respectively. The question in the

NRC Elderly Survey on contact is "How often do you hear from your child?" The

elderly respondent was asked this question about each of his (her) children.

The tables consider the extent of contact between the elderly parent and the

child who is designated most in contact with the elderly parent.

     There are a number of interesting features in these tables. First, there

are a few elderly parents who have no contact or very little contact with

their children. Of the 1410 elderly with children, but not living with

children, 67 reported no contact or only yearly contact with the most

attentive child. The sum of these parents who are either estranged from their

children or have very little contact plus those with no children is just under

one quarter of the total elderly sample. The corresponding figure for the

vulnerable elderly is 26.3 percent.

    A second interesting feature of these tables is the large fraction of

elderly with children who either live with a child or have daily or weekly
                                       —7-.



contact with the child who is designated as having maximum contact. Of the

1811 elderly with children, 1526 have immediate, daily, or weekly contact.

The corresponding fraction for the vulnerable elderly contained in Table 9 is

quite similar.

     Table 10 distinguishes the extent of contact with children between the

institutionalized and non-institutionalized elderly. The table indicates that

almost one third of the institutionalized elderly either have no children or

have very little contact with their children. For the noninstitutionalized

the figure is less than one quarter.

     The HRC Elderly Survey also asks the elderly respondents about time spent

talking on the phone or visiting with their family during the previous week.

Table 11 provides the responses to this question cross tabulated by the number

of children, income, vulnerable status, and, given vulnerability, whether the

elderly respondent is institutionalized. The poor-not poor distinction is

based on whether the elderly respondent's income is less than or greater than

$5,000. The table indicates that just under 4 percent of those elderly who

have children, but who do not live with their children, report no contact

with family in the previous week. Another ten percent of this group reported

little telephone contact. At the other extreme, over half of the elderly

living apart from their children reported considerable contact with their

children in the previous week.

     The institutionalized vulnerable elderly with children, according to

Table 11, indicate less contact with their families than the rest of the

elderly. One quarter of the institutionalized with children reported no

contact or little contact in the week preceding the survey. According to this
                                      -8-


 table there is no indication that families provide less assistance in the form

 of shared housing or have less contact with the poor elderly as compared with

the nonpoor elderly.

      The next two tables, 12 and 13, examine, respectively, differences in

contact among the children of the elderly. The first row of Table 12

indicates that there are 462 children who have no siblings. Of these, 16.0

percent live with their parents, 63.9 percent talk daily or weekly with their

parents, and 8.0 percent talk yearly or very rarely. Note that only children

are in somewhat more contact with their parent(s) on average than children

with one or more siblings; the percentage of only children who have at least

weekly contact with their parents is 79.9 percent, compared with 70.1 percent

for children who have four or more siblings. Apparently, children in such

larger families can share the burden of contact, to the extent it is a burden,

and each child doesn't feel the need to engage in as much contact.

Interestingly, close to one tenth of children are reported by their parents to

have no or very little contact over the course of the year.

     The figures in Table 13 for contact of children of the vulnerable elderly

suggest a quite similar degree of child—parent contact. In contrast, children

of the institutionalized elderly have less contact with their parents than

other children. According to Table 13a, over 17 percent have no contact or

very little contact over the course of the year with their institutionalized

parent(s).

     Table 14 and 15 document the fact that financial transfers from children

to parents and from parents to children are quite rare, even in the case of

parents who are very poor. The income categories "very poor," "poor,"
                                     —9—


"middle," and "rich" correspond, respectively, to income levels of zero to

$5000, $5000 to $10,000 to $40,000, and above $40,000. The tables consider

only those parent(s) who have children, but live apart from their children.

     Of the 1349 parents listed in Table 14, only 44, 3.26 percent, report

receiving regular monthly financial help from their children. Of the 235 very

poor parents, only 10 (4.25 percent), report receiving transfers. These

figures are surprising; and what is even more surprising is that even in cases

where there are a large number of children, there are few transfers to poor or

very poor parents.

     Of the 1349 parents in Table 15, 35 report they provide regular monthly

help to one or more of their children. Rich parents are most likely to

     Of the 1349 parents in Table 15, 35 report they proivide regular monthly

help to one or more of their children. Rich parents are more likely to

provide such transfers; but there are also 8 cases of very poor parents

transferring to their children.


IV. Some Preliminary Findings from the HRC-NBER Child Survey

     Table 16 considers the telephone contact between the 399 children we have

interviewed to date in the HRC-NBER Child Survey and their parent who is a

respondent in the HRC elderly survey. Of the 399 children, 87 live with their

parent, 76 reported daily telephone contact, 127 reported weekly telephone

contact, 48 reported telephone monthly contact, and 61 (15.3 percent) reported

no telephone contact in the previous month. Of the 137 children with

vulnerable parents, the no telephone contact percentage is 31.4 percent. It

is a much higher 79.1 percent for the children of the institutionalized.
                                     -10-


     Table 16a repeats the analysis of Table 16, but includes the siblings of

the 399 children. Of the total of 1055 children of the 399 HRC elderly

respondents, 12.4 percent live with their parents, 13.3 percent have daily

telephone contact, 32.3 percent have weekly telephone contact in the previous

month. Again, there is evidence of less contact with the vulnerable and

institutionalized elderly. Over one third of the children of the vulnerable

elderly and over four fifths of the children of the institutionalized elderly

are reported to have had no telephone contact with their parent(s) in the pre-

vious month.

     Table 17 and 17a repeat the contact calculations of Tables 16 and 16a,

but consider time spent with the elderly parent in the previous month. Table

17a indicates that over a quarter of all children spent zero hours with their

elderly parent. In contrast almost a quarter of children, including those

living with their parent(s), spent over 30 hours in th previous month with

their parents.

     Table 18 examines the 230 of the 399 parents who received five or more

hours last month in assistance from their children and for whom we have

information about each of their children's income. The "low" and "high"

income distinction is based on income below and above $20,000. These data

suggest that most of the elderly are receiving some child time, and that some

of this child time is provided by high income children to low income parents.

     Table 19, 20, and 21 cross-tabulate parent and child income levels for

cases with complete child and parent income information. Table 19 considers

all parents, Table 20 considers only the vulnerable elderly cases, and Table

21 classifies parents based on their medicaid status and institutionalization
                                      —11—


status. These very preliminary data suggest that most poor arid most very poor

parents have one or more children with incomes above $20,000.


V. Preliminary Conclusions

     While our findings are preliminary and will be updated and expanded as we

receive more data, the tables represented above suggest that a significant

minority of the elderly, many of whom need assistance with the activities of

daily living, have either no children or are not in contact with their

children. Contact between children and the vulnerable elderly appears to be

less than that between children and the nonvulnerable elderly, and the amount

of contact between children and the institutionalized elderly seems the least

of all. In addition, although many of the parents in our data are very poor,

financial support from children to parents, other than in the form of shared

housing, is uncommon. The impression given by these data is that many of the

elderly are very well cared for by their children, while a significant

minority either have no children or have no children who provide significant

time or care.

     Some of the findings for this sample are striking:

     (1)   over a fifth of the elderly have no children.

     (2)   over one half of the elderly either do not have a daughter or do

           not have a daughter who lives within an hour of them.

     (3) over half of single elderly males and females and over two fifths of

           vulnerable single elderly males and females live completely alone.

     (4) of the elderly who have children, fewer than a quarter live with

           their children.
                               —12--



(5) a small fraction of elderly with children hear from them at most on

    a yearly basis.

(6) almost 10 percent of the children of the elderly have at most yearly

    contact.

(7) financial assistance from children to the elderly, even in cases

    where the elderly are quite poor, is extremely rare.

(8) in a typical month over a quarter of elderly who have children do

    not physically spend time with their children.
