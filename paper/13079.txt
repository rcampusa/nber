                                             ABSTRACT

We study the determinants and consequences of cross-listings on the New York and London stock
exchanges from 1990 to 2005. This investigation enables us to evaluate the relative benefits of New
York and London exchange listings and to assess whether these relative benefits have changed over
time, perhaps as a result of the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of Congress (SOX) in 2002. We
find that cross-listings have been falling on U.S. exchanges as well as on the Main Market in London.
This decline in cross-listings is explained by changes in firm characteristics rather than by changes
in the benefits of cross-listings. We show that, after controlling for firm characteristics, there is no
deficit in cross-listing counts on U.S. exchanges related to SOX. Investigating the cross-listing premium
from 1990 to 2005, we find that there is a significant premium for U.S. exchange listings every year,
that the premium has not fallen significantly in recent years, that it persists even when allowing for
unobservable firm characteristics, and that there is a permanent premium in event time. In contrast,
there is no premium for London listings for any year. Cross-listing in the U.S. leads firms to increase
their capital-raising activity at home and abroad while a London listing has no such impact. Our evidence
is consistent with the theory that an exchange listing in New York has unique governance benefits
for foreign firms. These benefits have not been seriously eroded by SOX and cannot be replicated
through a London listing.

1. Introduction

    In 1998, the major New York exchanges (New York Stock Exchange, NYSE, American Stock

Exchange, AMEX, and NASDAQ) collectively attracted 31% of all the foreign listings in the world, the

London Stock Exchange’s (LSE) Main Market and Alternative Investment Market (AIM) had 16%, and

no other exchange had more than 7%.1 In recent years, London’s market share of foreign listings has

increased while the market share of the U.S. has fallen. It is now almost conventional wisdom in policy

circles and in the financial press that London has become more competitive in attracting foreign listings

than New York.2 In this paper, we investigate how and why the flow of listings on the New York and

London stock exchanges has evolved as it has and whether one should infer from this evolution that

foreign corporations now find a New York exchange listing less attractive.

    A popular explanation for the decrease in foreign listings on the exchanges in New York is that the

passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Act of Congress in 2002 has made U.S. listings significantly less

attractive to foreign companies – so much so, it is argued, that many listed firms would delist if it were

easy to do so.3 The argument is that SOX makes a U.S. listing less advantageous because it imposes

severe costs on companies and their managers, especially through the compliance requirements of Section

404, which aims to reduce the market impact of accounting “errors” from fraud, inadvertent

misstatements, or omissions, by assuring effective management controls over reporting and which, in

turn, creates significant legal exposures for companies as well as for executives.

    A number of observers have taken the view that a decrease in the flow of new listings in New York

and an increase in the flow of new listings in London is, in and of itself, evidence that New York has

  Technically, the listings of foreign firms are cross-listings of their existing shares in home markets. It has become
common to refer to listings by foreign firms as foreign listings. In this paper, we use the term “foreign listing” to
denote a cross-listing of the home-market shares of a firm in an market abroad.

become less attractive.4 A listing has both costs and benefits. If all firms for which it is advantageous to

list in New York are already listed there and nothing else changes, we would not expect new listings in

New York. In this case, this dearth of new listings in New York would not be evidence that New York

has become less competitive. It would just be evidence that all firms that can benefit from a New York

listing already have one. For the purpose of our analysis, we regard New York as having become less

competitive if it no longer attracts listings it would have attracted in the past – say, for example, during

the 1990s.

    A London listing is not the same as a New York listing; each listing location offers a unique bundle of

attributes. For a firm to choose to cross-list when it was not cross-listed before, the attractiveness of a

listing must have changed. The attractiveness of a listing to a firm can change because the bundle of

attributes of the listing location has changed or because the firm itself changed so that a different bundle

of attributes has become more attractive. Consequently, London listings could have become more

attractive even if the bundle of attributes of a listing in New York did not change. After all, changes in

firm characteristics may have rendered London listings more valuable for firms that did not yet have a

listing. To use an analogy, an increase in Nice’s market share of the tourism market compared to St.

Moritz’s does not necessarily mean that St. Moritz has become less competitive – it could just mean that

the season has changed. Similarly, it could be that the firms that did not list in the U.S. in the 1990s have

characteristics that now make a London listing advantageous compared to a U.S. listing. Such an outcome

could be possible even if the New York exchanges are as competitive as ever in attracting listings from

the types of firms that found these listings valuable in the 1990s.

    As reviewed in Karolyi (2006), there are many benefits to listing. In particular, through cross-listing,

firms can access new investors, can have their stock traded on a more efficient market, can overcome

barriers to international investment, and so on. However, much of the recent literature on cross-listings

4
 The CEOs of both the NYSE and NASDAQ have also voiced their concerns about the costs that foreign companies
have to bear to comply with SOX and the implications of these costs for the flow of listings (Thain, 2004; Greifeld,
2006). See also “Taking their business elsewhere: Foreign companies are spurning U.S. exchanges” BusinessWeek
(May 22, 2006).



                                                         2
has emphasized the governance benefit of cross-listing on a major U.S. exchange. By the term

“governance benefit,” we mean the fact that firms that list on a U.S. exchange benefit from opting into the

U.S. regulatory environment, which includes securities laws and regulations, regulatory oversight and

enforcement by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and monitoring by “gatekeepers” such

as analysts and institutional investors. We focus on this benefit because it crucially distinguishes among

different types of listings and because the benefit of listing that most financial economists focused on in

the past - namely, overcoming barriers to international investments - is losing its relevance in an

increasingly global financial marketplace.5

    The typical foreign firm has a controlling shareholder and comes from a country where controlling

shareholders have more of an opportunity to make themselves better off at the expense of minority

shareholders compared to the U.S. There is a governance benefit from cross-listing on a U.S. exchange

because listing reduces controlling shareholders’ ability to extract private benefits from the corporations

they control (see, e.g., Doidge, 2004, for empirical evidence). Some controlling shareholders are willing

to bear the cost of better governance because it enables them to raise capital on better terms to fund their

firm’s growth opportunities. Consequently, controlling shareholders trade off the cost of cross-listing,

defined by the improved governance systems which reduce their private benefits, against the benefit of

cross-listing, captured by their ability to fund growth opportunities on better terms. Only firms where the

benefit more than offsets the cost will list in the U.S. As a result, U.S. cross-listed firms are worth more –

there is a “cross-listing premium” (Doidge, Karolyi, and Stulz, 2004). It will always be the case that many

firms will choose not to list in the U.S. as long as, by not doing so, controlling shareholders have more

freedom to run their corporations to benefit themselves at the expense of minority shareholders.




5
 The bonding hypothesis, originally proposed by Coffee (1999, 2002) and Stulz (1999), predicts that after listing on
a U.S. stock exchange, foreign firms become subject to more stringent investor protections and it becomes more
difficult for insiders to expropriate from minority shareholders. Benos and Weisbach (2004) and Karolyi (2006)
provide comprehensive surveys of the cross-listing literature and, in particular, of the emergence of corporate
governance explanations of the cross-listing phenomenon.



                                                         3
    For a listing on a U.S. exchange to have become less attractive, it has to be that the net benefit from

such a listing for a firm with given characteristics has fallen. The net benefit from a listing on a U.S.

exchange that is relevant for the listing decision is the gain made by the controlling shareholder of a

corporation from listing in New York rather than listing in London or not listing at all. If the costs for the

controlling shareholder of a U.S. exchange cross-listing rise or if the benefits fall, there will be fewer new

listings and the value of firms with listings will fall relative to the value of firms without listings.

    To examine if cross-listings on the major exchanges in New York have become less attractive, we

first evaluate aggregate evidence on the market share of foreign listings in New York and London.

Strikingly, the market share of the NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ increased from 1998 to 2005 relative to

the market share of the LSE’s Main Market. However, once the LSE’s Alternative Investment Market is

taken into account, the picture changes and London’s market share increased relative to New York’s.

Though the number of foreign listings in New York and on London’s Main Market has fallen in recent

years, the total number of foreign listings in London has increased because of the increase in foreign

listings on AIM. The number of listings on AIM has increased most dramatically in recent years: foreign

listing counts increased from only 2 within one year of its launch in 1995 to 220 at the end of 2005.

    We show that, though the success of AIM is impressive, it is critical to understand that the typical

firm that lists on AIM is a small firm that would not have listed on a U.S. exchange, either in the 1990s or

in more recent years. Consequently, it is simply wrong to interpret the success of AIM and the resulting

growth in market share of London as evidence of a decline in the attractiveness of U.S. exchanges.

However, U.S. exchanges could have become less attractive because they no longer attract new listings

that they would have attracted in the 1990s. We therefore examine next whether a firm with given

characteristics is less likely to list on a major exchange in New York now than it would have been in the

1990s. We find little evidence to support such a conclusion. In particular, we find that firm attributes that

affect the listing decision are mostly the same now as they were then. Further, and strikingly, we find no

evidence that the number of listed firms is smaller than that we would have expected based on how firms




                                                        4
made the choice to cross-list in the pre-SOX period before 2001. These results are sensitive to how we

define the pre-SOX base period: as we adjust the base period to be more recent (e.g., 1997-2001 instead

of 1990-2001), evidence of a shortfall in actual U.S. exchange listing counts emerges for 2004 and 2005.

However, this additional evidence is of little help to those who blame the SOX legislation, because we

uncover a larger shortfall among London exchange listing counts.

    If New York has become less attractive, we would expect the cross-listing premium originally

uncovered by Doidge, Karolyi, and Stulz (2004) to decrease, everything else remaining constant. We

investigate this hypothesis in several steps. We first estimate the listing premium on U.S. exchanges every

year from 1990 to 2005. Not only is this premium significantly positive every year, but there is no

convincing evidence in our data that it has fallen in recent years. Next, we test and confirm that there is no

evidence that the listing premium in New York decreased relative to the listing premium in London. In

fact, we show that there is no listing premium in London over the 1990 to 2005 period. Consequently,

firms that list in London do so for reasons other than for a governance benefit. Our conclusions on the

listing premium hold using several different estimation approaches, including an approach that allows for

unobservable firm characteristics to influence the valuation of firms. Thus, the listing premium in our

approach does not proxy inadvertently for such characteristics. Finally, we show that the listing premium

on U.S. exchanges is not a temporary phenomenon but that it is permanent.

    It is surprising that we find no evidence of a cross-listing premium in London, but this result is fully

consistent with our evidence on the actions of firms following a listing. Earlier work by Reese and

Weisbach (2002) shows that, following a U.S. cross-listing, firms raise more funds, both in their home

markets and abroad, than firms without such a listing because investors believe that they are better

protected when investing in such firms. We build on the work of these authors by investigating the

security issuance behavior of firms cross-listed in New York compared to firms cross-listed in London.

We provide evidence that firms listed in New York raise more funds after the listing (including in the




                                                      5
home, U.S., U.K., and other markets) than firms that list in London, so that there is more evidence of a

benefit of listing for firms that list in New York than for firms that list in London.

    The paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we introduce our data and show the evolution of the

number of listings over time across types of listings in New York and London. We compare the

characteristics of new cross-listings in New York and London in Section 3. We then examine in Section 4

the determinants of the listing decision in New York and London and investigate whether there are fewer

New York listings in recent years than we would expect given how firms made their listing decision in the

1990s. In Section 5, we report evidence on the listing premium over time across types of listings. In

Section 6, we show the capital raising activities of firms before and after listings in New York and

London. We conclude in Section 7.



2. The evolution of cross-listings in New York and London over time

    Before we commence with a detailed examination of the cross-listing flows in New York and London

over time, it is useful to first show the importance of New York and London in the world of cross-listings

using data from the World Federation of Stock Exchanges (WFE). These data rely on reports from

member exchanges of the Federation and include companies which have shares listed on a specific

exchange, excluding investment funds and unit trusts. Companies with multiple classes of shares are

counted once. The Federation reports separately data for major exchanges, for markets specifically

designed for small and medium sized enterprises (such as London’s AIM), and other markets (such as

affiliated and correspondent exchanges that are not members).

    Figure 1 shows that New York and London have attracted the lion’s share of foreign listings during

the past decade relative to the other exchanges that are members of the Federation. In 1998 (Figure 1a),

the LSE’s 466 foreign listings together with AIM’s 21 listings constituted 16% of the 2,978 foreign

listings around the world, and those on the three major exchanges in New York totaled 894, or 30% of the

total. The next three largest exchanges in terms of the global market share of foreign listings in 1998 were




                                                       6
the Luxembourg exchange (7%), Deutsche Börse (7%), and the Swiss exchange (6%). By 2005, London’s

Main Market and AIM exchanges increased their global market share to 19% thanks to the growth of

AIM (220 listings, or 8% global market share). The New York-based exchanges together maintained their

30% market share (884 listings out of the 2,929 globally). Both the Deutsche Börse and the Swiss

Exchange lost market share (4%) and, though Euronext (a consolidation of the former Paris, Amsterdam,

Brussels, and Lisbon bourses) emerged as the next largest with a 10% global market share, its market

share was actually lower than what it would have been in 1998 (15%).6

    Figure 1b shows that, by 2005, the AMEX, NASDAQ, and NYSE had increased their market share

relative to London’s Main Market. In 1998, the New York exchanges had 92% more foreign listings than

London. But, by 2005, the New York exchanges had 165% more foreign listings than London’s Main

Market. However, when we include the foreign listing counts on AIM in addition to the LSE’s Main

Market, the NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ had only 60% more foreign listings than London in 2005. The

growth of the share of foreign listings of London is due fully to a dramatic increase in AIM that offsets a

decrease in foreign listings on London’s Main Market. Over the period from 1998 to 2005, the Main

Market’s foreign listings dropped from 466 to 334, while those on AIM jumped from 4 to 220.

    The data from the WFE cannot be used to assess whether London’s increased market share relative to

New York’s implies that New York is now less attractive. The WFE provides aggregate data only, which

makes it impossible to track the characteristics of listed firms by type of listing and to evaluate the

success of New York and London in attracting new listings and retaining existing listings. It could be

therefore that London was more successful in attracting new listings on the Main Market than were the

exchanges in New York, but this increased competitiveness of London is not discernible with aggregate

data on listing counts. The WFE data also ignores listings that do not take place on the exchanges but are

important in the U.S.: namely, Rule 144a private placements and OTC listings. For our analysis, it is


6
  Of course, this decline may be over-estimated because the sum of foreign listings of the Paris, Brussels,
Amsterdam, and Lisbon stock exchanges in 1998 ignores double-counting of cross-listings among the four
exchanges, which would not have been included in the 2005 Euronext count.



                                                    7
therefore necessary for us to construct a database that tracks listings at the firm-level and distinctly by

listing type. Before we turn to the construction of that database, however, we review the types of listings

available in New York and in London and the implications of these types of listings for corporate

governance.



2.1. Regulatory and listing requirements for foreign listings in New York and London

    To understand the corporate governance and regulatory implications of listing in New York and

London, it is important to make a distinction between listing rules required by the exchanges, the laws

and regulations that listed firms must satisfy, and, most importantly, the specific combination of listing

rules, laws, and regulations that apply to foreign listed firms.

    Firms that list in the U.S. via Rule 144a or in the OTC market are exempt from SEC registration and

many disclosure requirements and therefore face very few additional obligations when they list. In

contrast, foreign firms that list on U.S. exchanges have to register with the SEC and become subject to

U.S. securities laws. These laws not only increase disclosure and financial reporting requirements (e.g.

reconciliation of financial accounts with U.S. GAAP and other disclosures), but also reduce agency costs

and restrain controlling shareholders by imposing substantive obligations on them.7 Since 2002, foreign

firms listed on U.S. exchanges have been subject to some of the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.8 In

addition to the SEC’s requirements, foreign firms also have to satisfy the listing requirements and

governance standards of the individual exchanges, although the exchanges can waive some of the

governance standards on a case-by-case basis. In general, firms are subject to SEC oversight, they are


7
  Because the regulatory and listing requirements for U.S. listings have been discussed extensively in the literature,
our discussion of these requirements does not detail all of the specific rules. We refer readers to papers by Coffee
(1999, 2002, 2007), Doidge (2004), and Greene, Beller, Rosen, Silverman, Braverman, and Sperber (2000) for a
more complete discussion.

  Actually, reporting foreign companies initially were expected to comply with the internal control reporting
provisions of Section 404 in connection with their fiscal years ending on or after June 15, 2004. On February 24,
2004, the SEC, in recognizing the importance of these provisions and the time needed to implement them properly,
extended these compliance dates to fiscal years ending July 15, 2005. The deadlines were extended a second time on
March 2, 2005 and a third time on September 22, 2005 for fiscal years ending July 15, 2007. See SEC Release No.
33-8618 (Sept. 22, 2005) [70 FR 56825] at www.sec.gov.



                                                          8
exposed to class action lawsuits, and face additional monitoring by market participants, such as analysts

and institutional investors. The bottom line is that controlling shareholders of foreign firms that list on a

U.S. exchange face more constraints and obligations than controlling shareholders of similar firms that

are not listed.

    In London, firms can list on the Main Market as a Depositary Receipt (DR) or ordinary issue or they

can list on the Alternative Investment Market. There are different requirements for each listing type.9

Firms that list as ordinary issues must be admitted to listing by the U.K. Listing Authority (UKLA), part

of the Financial Services Authority (FSA), and then be admitted to trading by the LSE. Most foreign

firms that list as ordinary issues in London seek a “secondary” listing (the “primary listing” being the

home market – foreign firms typically do not incorporate in the U.K.). In general, the provisions of the

UKLA’s listing rules that seek to protect minority investors do not apply to foreign firms with a

secondary listing (Coffee, 2007).10 For example, the Combined Code on Corporate Governance applies

only to companies incorporated in the U.K., which means that firms with foreign listings are not required

to comply with the code.11 Moreover, these firms are not required to explain why they have chosen not to

comply. The main requirement for firms with ordinary listings on the Main Market is to file financial

information prepared in accordance with U.K. or U.S. GAAP or International Accounting Standards

(IAS), although exceptions are made to this requirement in some cases. For example, the UKLA will

accept local accounting standards from Japanese firms. The requirements for firms that list on the Main

Exchange” (2003), “London Stock Exchange Admission and Disclosure Standards” (2005), and “Joining AIM: A

reporting requirements of the U.K. Listing Authority can be found in the “Index to Listing, Disclosure and
Prospectus Rules” (particularly LR 18.1 – 18.4 and 19.1 – 19.3) at the U.K. Financial Services Agency website

10
    See MacNeil and Lau (2001) for further details on listing requirements. They conclude that the considerable
exceptions from the listing rules made for foreign firms suggests a deliberate policy of competing for foreign listings
and that bonding is not the main explanation for London’s success in attracting foreign listings.
11
   The Cadbury Report, published in 1992 included a “Code of Best Practice”. In 1998, the Hampel Report led to the
publication of the Combined Code of Corporate Governance (“Combined Code”). The Combined Code, which is
annexed to the UKLA’s listing rules, contains two sections, “Principals of good governance” and “Code of best
practice.” In 2003, the code was further revised.

Market via DRs are even less demanding than those for ordinary listings in that financial information

need not be prepared in accordance with IAS, U.K., or U.S. GAAP.12

     Firms listing in London can also choose to list on AIM. It is well-known that listing requirements on

AIM are minimal – there is no prior trading requirement, prior shareholder approval for transactions is not

required, admission documents are not pre-vetted by the exchange or by the UKLA, there is no minimum

market capitalization, and there is no minimum public float requirement. In fact, all that is required for a

firm to be admitted to AIM is that it has the support of a nominated advisor (“Nomad”) and subsequently

the firm has to satisfy only the exchange’s weak disclosure duty. AIM rules impose a “general duty of

disclosure requiring information which it (the issuer) reasonably considers necessary to enable investors

to form a full understanding of the financial position of the applicant.” Although there is a common belief

that listing in London provides a certain level of good governance, firms with foreign listings in London

generally need only comply with the governance rules of their home country. That is, firms with foreign

listings in London are subject to a “light touch” approach to regulation. Recently, institutional investors

expressed concerns to the FSA about the governance standards of foreign firms listing in the U.K. In

April 2007, the FSA announced a plan to review the rules which apply to foreign listings and to consider

stricter rules for foreign listings on the LSE.13



2.2. Data sources on foreign listings in New York and London

     To conduct our study, we construct a dataset that contains information on firms’ listing decisions,

firm characteristics, as well as home country characteristics. Our first step is to construct a list of firms

that have foreign listings in the U.S. or in the U.K., at the end of each year from 1990 through 2005.

Firms can cross-list in the U.S. by means of a Rule 144a private placement, an OTC listing as Bulletin
12
    Most firms issue Global Depositary Receipts (GDRs), which cannot be traded by ordinary retail investors.
Recently, the LSE introduced Retail Depositary Receipts (RDRs). Because these can be traded by all investors, the
listing requirements are more stringent and are similar to those for ordinary issues. To date, few firms have chosen
to list RDRs.

Board (OTCBB) or Pink Sheet issues, or on the AMEX, NASDAQ, or NYSE. We keep track of listings

on U.S. exchanges that are created as direct listings, New York Registered Shares, or as Level II or Level

III (capital raising) ADR programs. Firms can cross-list in the U.K. on the Main Market via depositary

receipts or an ordinary listing. Starting in 1995, firms could also choose to list on AIM.

    Information on foreign listings comes from a variety of sources, including the Bank of New York,

Citibank, JP Morgan, the NYSE, NASDAQ, the London Stock Exchange, the OTCBB, end-of-year

editions of the National Quotation Bureau’s Pink Sheets, the Center for Research on Security Prices

(CRSP), firms’ annual reports, SEC Form 20-F filings, and Factiva searches. Information from the

various datasets is manually cross-checked and verified. The data provided by Citibank and CRSP allows

us to keep track of both active and inactive issues for U.S. listings, which mitigates concerns about

survivorship bias. However, a limitation of the data provided by the London Stock Exchange is that the

earliest information on Main Market listings we are able to obtain is from 1997. Further, that list contains

only firms that were listed as of 1997. As such, we are unable to verify that we have the complete list of

U.K. listings prior to that year. Our list in 1997 and later years is complete, however.

    In addition to listing dates, we also keep track of changes in firms’ foreign listing status, either

through upgrades, downgrades, or delistings. If a firm upgrades from a Rule 144a private placement or

OTC listing to a U.S. exchange listing, the upgrade is counted as a new U.S. exchange listing and as a

delisting from the Rule 144a or OTC markets. Firms that change their listing location are assigned to a

listing type according to their status as of December 31 of the year, regardless of when the change took

place during the year. Firms’ foreign listings are frequently terminated and we keep track of the dates on

which a firm delists. For firms that delist from a U.S. stock exchange or from an ordinary listing in the

U.K., we also record the reason for delisting. A delisting is classified as “voluntary” if a firm is in

compliance with an exchange’s listing standards and voluntarily takes steps to delist its shares or

depositary receipts. Firms are also delisted when they are acquired and these cases are classified as a

“merger/acquisition.” The final category is “other.” This includes cases where firms are delisted when




                                                     11
they fail to meet their exchange’s listing requirements, when firms are bankrupt, in financial distress, or

are undergoing some kind of restructuring or liquidation.



2.3. The time-series of listings: levels and flows

     Table 1 provides summary statistics for the total number of cross-listings from 1990 to 2005 in the

U.S. (separately by Rule 144, OTC, and exchange listings) and in the U.K. (separately by AIM, DRs, and

ordinary shares).14 The number of exchange listings in the U.S. peaks in 2000 at 960. The number of

exchange listings increases each year before the peak and falls in all years afterwards except 2004. By

2005, the number of listings had fallen by 94 from its peak, standing at 866. The number of OTC listings

peaks in 2002 at 993. Though the number of OTC listings increases monotonically from 1990 to 2002, it

falls by 98 listings in 2003 and then stays close to that number until 2005. Finally, the number of Rule

144a issues reached its peak of 312 in 2005, but there is little variation in the number of Rule 144a issues

from 1999 to 2005. In the U.K., there has been a steady decline in DR and ordinary listing counts since

1997 from a peak of 491 to only 327 in 2005. AIM listings jumped dramatically in 2004 and 2005 to 242

following a slow, steady increase over the 1995 to 2003 period. So, foreign listing counts have been

steadily decreasing on the major exchanges in New York since 2001 and the Main Market in London

since 1998. The listing counts on the Rule 144a and OTC markets in the U.S. have held steady and those

on AIM in London have been increasing, especially in 2004 and 2005.

     Table 2 presents the flows of new listings and delistings that correspond to the listing counts in Table

1. These data are again reported by year for New York and London and by type of listing. The biggest

years on record for new listings on U.S. exchanges were 2000 (164), which coincides with the peak

foreign listing count, as well as 1996 and 1997. The new listings have slowed since 2000. Interestingly,

the pace of delistings rose from a level that averaged 25% of new foreign listings to 50% between 1998

14
   The exchange listing counts are almost identical to those reported in the WFE statistics (the Rule 144a and OTC
counts are not reported by WFE). The LSE Main Market counts are very similar to those reported by the Exchange
to WFE, although the differences widen for 1995. As noted earlier, we were unable to obtain annual listing counts
directly from the LSE prior to 1997.



                                                       12
and 2000, and, finally, to a level over 100% of new foreign listings after 2001. New foreign listings on the

OTC market peaked in 2001 (205 in total) and in only one year (2003) has the pace of OTC foreign

delistings exceeded that of new listings. Similarly, there have been only two years (2001-2002) in which

foreign delistings from the Rule 144a market have exceeded those of new listings, but the delisting rate

has distinctly risen since 1999. The annual rates of new foreign listings in London on the Main Market

have slowed since 1996 for DRs and since 2000 for ordinary shares. Like the New York exchange

listings, the pace of delistings in London has increased since 1999 to the point where the delisting rate

exceeds (and often more than doubles) the rate of new listings in each year. The AIM market represents a

distinct exception with few delistings relative to the high rate of new listings.

     Table 3 breaks out the cumulative count of new listings over the period from 1990 to 2005 by

country. Canadian and U.K firms dominate the new OTC and exchange listings in New York. Together,

they comprise 28% and 10%, respectively. India, Taiwan, Mexico, and South Korea have the greatest

numbers of listings on the Rule 144a market. For ordinary listings on the LSE’s Main Market, Irish firms

are well represented (58 firms), as well as those from Canada, Japan, and the United States.15 As noted by

Salva (2003), firms from developed countries are more likely to have an ordinary listing, while firms from

emerging markets, such as India, Poland, South Korea, and Taiwan, dominate the DR market. Finally,

Australian, Canadian, Irish, and U.S. firms dominate the AIM sample of new listings, constituting

together over 61% of the total.

     Most delistings on the exchanges in New York and London over the 1990 to 2005 period are due to

either mergers/acquisitions or for other reasons such as distress, restructuring, or failure to comply with

the exchange’s listing standards. Table 4 presents the annual delisting flows for exchange listings in New

York and for ordinary listings in London separately for voluntary, merger/acquisition, and other reasons.

Overall, voluntary delistings represented only 13% (95 of 726 total delistings) in New York and 33%

15
   There are also a substantial number of ordinary listings from tax-haven countries such as Bermuda and the
Cayman Islands. The raw data on foreign listings provided by the LSE contains investment funds and trusts and we
include these in our listing counts. These mainly affect the listing counts from tax-haven countries, such as the
Cayman Islands, where almost all of the foreign listings are funds or trusts.



                                                       13
(105 of 317 total delistings) in London.16 If we include delistings by firms with DRs in London, the count

of voluntary delistings in London is even higher. It is noteworthy that the rise in delisting activity since

2000 has been mostly voluntary in nature. But, the salient fact is that the increase in annual delisting

activity in recent years, measured as a fraction of the respective total number of outstanding foreign

listings, has been somewhat greater in London than in New York (around 2% per year in New York and

around 4% per year in London). The fact that voluntary delistings are easier in London than on the U.S.

exchanges may explain the sharp increase in voluntary delistings in London compared to the increase in

voluntary delistings in New York.

     What, then, can we learn from this analysis of listing counts and flows about the competitiveness of

New York’s markets relative to London? Foreign listings increased sharply in both markets in the 1990s,

but, after 2000, the numbers fell on the main exchanges both in London and in New York, as well as on

the OTC market in the U.S. The shift resulted from both a decrease in the number of new listings and an

increase in the number of voluntary delistings. In comparing the magnitudes of the new listings and

delistings in both markets, there is no evidence that New York is losing market share of foreign cross-

listings to London. The growth and pace of the AIM market in the past decade, however, tilts the market

share toward London. At first glance, the firms that are attracted to AIM appear to be those that are also

attracted to the major exchanges in New York and London, at least in terms of their home markets. But, in

order to judge the success of AIM as evidence of a potential decline in U.S. market competitiveness, we

need to understand whether the typical firm that lists on AIM has similar characteristics to a firm that




16
   Classification of voluntary and involuntary delistings can be complex. Our count of 95 voluntary delistings risks
overstating the number of “true” voluntary delistings. Many firms are often close to financial distress so that what
appears to be a firm’s choice may, in fact, simply be a pre-emptive action of an inevitable involuntary delisting by
the exchange. We identify 14 (out of 95) cases, where the delisting is announced as voluntary, but coincides with
financial difficulties, cost-cutting, or restructuring programs. For example, Germany’s Lion Bioscience delisted its
ADRs from NASDAQ on December 22, 2004 at the same time when it forecasted operating losses, announced
management changes, reductions in staff by half, and a major board restructuring. The U.K.’s Mid-States PLC
simultaneously announced in July 1997 lower profits, restructured cash-management activity, and cost-cutting
programs, including a delisting from NASDAQ. Chaplinsky and Ramchand (2007) use a conservative classification
approach and uncover only 48 voluntary delistings from U.S. exchanges over the 1961-2004 period.

would have listed on a U.S. exchange in the 1990s. One of the goals of the next section is to answer this

question.



3. The characteristics of foreign listings in New York and London over time

    If New York has become less competitive, some firms that would have listed in New York in the

1990s would not do so today. Consequently, we would expect the characteristics of firms that list to be

different in recent years than they were in the 1990s. Previous research has established that larger, more

profitable, and faster growing firms from countries with better-developed financial and legal institutions

and economies are more likely to pursue U.S. listings, in the first place, and to do so on major exchanges

rather than OTC or Rule 144a private placements, as predicted by theory (Reese and Weisbach, 2002;

Pagano, Roell, and Zechner, 2002; Doidge, Karolyi, and Stulz, 2004). Less is known about the attributes

of firms that pursue U.K. listings (Baker, Nofsinger, and Weaver, 2002; Salva, 2003). In this section, we

investigate whether the characteristics of listing firms have changed over time and how these

characteristics differ between firms that list in London versus those that list in New York. We also divide

our sample into listings that took place before the end of 2001 and listings that were made after that year.

During the first subperiod, listing counts on U.S. exchanges increase and then reach a plateau. In the

second subperiod, delistings outpace new listings both in New York and in London (from Table 1, there

are 960 listed firms on U.S. exchanges in 2000 and 950 in 2001). The choice of subperiod also

corresponds roughly to a pre-SOX and a post-SOX period.

    Our data source for firm characteristics such as Tobin’s q, sales growth, total assets, ownership,

leverage, and SIC (Standard Industrial Classification) codes is Thomson Financial’s Worldscope

database. Therefore, we match our sample of foreign listings to Worldscope. Worldscope covers over

24,000 public companies in more than 50 developed and emerging markets, representing more than 96

percent of the market value of the world’s publicly traded companies. Although the Worldscope database

provides the broadest available coverage of international companies, not all firms in our lists are covered




                                                    15
by Worldscope and many of the smaller countries listed in Table 3 (e.g., the Bahamas, Bahrain, Barbados,

among others) are not covered at all.

    Following the literature, we use Tobin’s q as our valuation measure and compute it as follows. For the

numerator, we take the book value of total assets, subtract the book value of equity, and add the market

value of equity. For the denominator, we use the book value of total assets. All variables are in local

currency, although it makes no difference if we use local currency or U.S. dollars since the numerator and

denominator are denominated in the same currency. Sales growth is measured as the two-year geometric

average of annual inflation-adjusted growth in sales. Sales growth is winsorized at the 1st and 99th

percentiles to reduce the impact of outliers. Total assets are measured in millions of U.S. dollars and

leverage is defined as total debt divided by total assets. Ownership is the data item “Closely-held shares.”

Worldscope defines closely-held shares as shares held by insiders, which include senior corporate officers

and directors, and their immediate families, shares held in trusts, shares held by another corporation

(except shares held in a fiduciary capacity by financial institutions), shares held by pension/benefit plans,

and shares held by individuals who hold five percent or more of shares outstanding. In Japan, closely-held

shares represent the holdings of the ten largest shareholders. For firms with more than one class of shares,

closely-held shares for each class are added together. The ownership measure is far from perfect since it

relies on information disclosed by firms and this disclosure is often voluntary and difficult to check.

    We also use a number of country-level variables in our analysis. For each country in each year, we

obtain a measure of inflation from Datastream, which is the change in the CPI provided by the IMF. We

adjust sales growth and total assets for inflation. We also use a number of variables to proxy for country

characteristics. We use the anti-director rights variable from Djankov, La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and

Shleifer (2006) as a measure of shareholder rights. Another proxy for home country investor protection is

legal origin, from La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny (1998). We construct a dummy

variable, “Common”, that equals one for firms from countries with a common law tradition and equals

zero for firms from countries with a civil law tradition. The rule of law index is a measure of enforcement




                                                     16
and is obtained from La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny (1998), although this variable is

not available for China, Hungary, Poland, or Russia. We obtain values for the rule of law for these

countries from Pistor, Raiser, and Gelfer (2000). As other authors before us, we define the variable

“Legal” as the product of anti-director and rule of law. Stock market capitalization divided by GDP

(Gross Domestic Product) and Gross National Product (GNP) per capita is from the World Bank’s World

Development Indicators database.

    Table 5 reports summary statistics on each of these characteristics for listed firms by type of listing in

New York and London in the listing year and for non-listed firms over the full period. Panels a and c

present results for the whole period (1990 – 2005) and panels b and d present results by subperiod (1990 –

2001 or “Pre-SOX” versus 2002 – 2005 or “Post-SOX” periods). The count of firms and the medians of

these attributes are reported as well as Wilcoxon rank-sum statistics, which test whether two different

samples are from the same distribution across listing types or across subperiods. The tests across different

listing types always compare attributes relative to the sample of U.S. exchange listed foreign firms. Panels

a and b present the statistics for the entire sample of new cross-listings by non-U.S. firms that are in the

Worldscope database whereas, in panels c and d, the statistics are reported for the subset of new cross-

listings by non-financial, non-U.S., non-U.K. firms that are in the Worldscope database with available

data on firm characteristics a given year. To make firms comparable across countries, we exclude

financial firms and require that firms have total assets of at least $100 million (in 1990 dollars). We also

tried using a size cutoff of $10 million and find that our results are similar and this is true for all

subsequent tables as well. Firms from tax-havens, such as Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, are excluded

because, though they are foreign-domiciled firms, they typically have their listing in New York or

London rather than a cross-listing and are foreign firms only for tax purposes. U.S. and U.K. firms are

excluded because they are domiciled in the target host markets for foreign listings.

    Panel a of Table 5 confirms the fact that, in the listing year, the foreign firms attracted to the

exchanges in New York and London are large (median total assets between $600 and $700 million for




                                                     17
U.S. exchange-listed firms and for London ordinaries), fast growing with trailing two-year annualized

sales growth figures in excess of 14%, moderately leveraged (less than 20% of debt to total assets), and

have somewhat concentrated ownership structures.17 There are mostly statistically significant and

economically large differences in size, sales growth, and leverage between U.S. and U.K. exchange-listed

firms and their counterparts on the Rule 144a/OTC markets in New York and AIM listings (median size

of only $11.5 million, sales growth of 10%, and median leverage of 0%). The differences in size between

firms listing on U.S. exchanges and those listing on AIM are striking. Only 11% of the firms listing on

AMEX, 5.5% of firms listing on NASDAQ, and none of the firms listing on the NYSE had total assets

less than the median total assets of firms listing on AIM.

     The firms that are attracted to the U.S.’s Rule 144a market and LSE’s DR market are larger firms

than those that cross-list on U.S. exchanges or as ordinaries in the U.K., have notably higher fractions of

closely-held shares, and are also more likely to come from less-developed countries with lower GNP per

capita, lower market capitalization-to-GDP ratios, and lower scores on legal protections of minority

shareholders. Finally, there are statistically significant differences in Tobin’s q valuation ratios not only

between U.S. exchange listings and Rule 144a/OTC firms (median ratios of 1.56 versus 1.35), but also

between AIM firms and London’s Main Market listings (median of 2.01 versus 1.35 for DRs and ordinary

shares). The striking result is that AIM firms have extremely large q ratios in the listing year, compared to

those that choose any other way to cross-list. However, these are small firms concentrated in a few high q

industries. Panel c, which repeats the analysis of panel a with more stringent data requirements, tighter

size screens, and without U.K. and tax-haven-domiciled firms, indicates that the valuation difference

between AIM and Main Market firms disappears as firm size becomes more comparable.18 Finally, in the



17
   Doidge, Karolyi, Lins, Miller, and Stulz (2007) show that more shares are held by controlling shareholders in
firms that are not cross-listed than in firms that are cross-listed. The data used in their study uses ownership by
controlling shareholders, so it is not directly comparable to the blockholder data we use.
18
   No doubt that much of any statistical precision is lost because so many of the AIM firms are bound by the data
and country screens (80 AIM firms in panel a reduce to only 5 AIM firms in panel c). Panel a shows that the median
total assets of AIM firms is only $11.5 million and recall from Table 3 that 39 firms on AIM (18% of the sample)
firms are from Bermuda and the Cayman Islands.



                                                        18
listing year, the valuation of London-listed firms is indistinguishable from the valuation of U.S. exchange

listed firms.

    Both panels a and c show that non-listed firms are quite different from U.S. exchange-listed firms.

Not surprisingly, the number of non-listed firms (actually, firm-year counts) is extremely large compared

to the total number of newly listed firms. The median total assets of non-listed firms correspond to less

than 20% of the median total assets of U.S. exchange-listed firms. In fact, the median total assets of non-

listed firms are much smaller than the median total assets for all firms with a listing except relative to

AIM firms which are one-tenth of the median total assets of non-listed firms. Non-listed firms have low

sales growth, low Tobin’s q ratios, and high insider ownership compared to U.S. exchange-listed firms or

even compared to other listed firms.

    The differences in listing year firm characteristics between the pre-SOX 1990-2001 and post-SOX

2002-2005 periods are neither statistically nor economically large. Panel b shows that there are negligible

differences in total assets (in constant 1990 dollars), leverage, ownership, sales growth, and even Tobin’s

q ratios across the two subperiods. There are exceptions in the U.S. markets: foreign firms listing on the

OTC market and on the major exchanges were smaller, had slightly lower sales growth, and less leverage

in the post-SOX period. There is also some evidence that foreign firms on AIM were drawn from

industries with higher median Tobin’s q ratios and from countries with better economic and financial

development (GNP per capita and market capitalization/GDP ratios) after SOX. However, panel d with its

more stringent data screen shows again that these differences disappear. Of course, one has to be cautious

about interpreting changes across subperiods for AIM as there are so few listings before 2002.

    Strikingly, while the characteristics of newly listed firms on U.S. exchanges do not appear to change

much from before to after SOX, the characteristics of non-listed firms change significantly. In particular,

the typical non-listed firm has much smaller size in total assets and its Tobin’s q ratio falls. Though sales

growth increases for non-listed firms, it is still very small compared to the sales growth of listed firms. As

non-listed firms change, it is not surprising that their appetite for listings might change also.




                                                      19
    Put together, this evidence on firm characteristics across listing types and across pre/post-SOX

periods reveals that (a) the firms that are attracted to the major exchanges in New York and London are

not very different, (b) the firms that are attracted to the Rule 144a/OTC markets in New York and AIM in

London, however, are different from those that pursue exchange listings, and (c) little about these

characteristics changes between the pre- and post-2001 periods, especially in the U.K. The evidence on

the changes in characteristics of non-listed firms shows that the characteristics of these firms have

changed. This evidence suggests that costs and benefits of listings have not changed and points to a

decrease in the number of firms with characteristics that make listing attractive as the explanation for the

decrease in the number of listings. However, simply looking at comparisons of medians is not convincing

evidence. The next step in our analysis is to calibrate the new listing activity over time in Section 2 with

the firm characteristics presented in this section using models of firm listing choices to see if the

determinants of the listing choices are different across listing types and whether they have changed

structurally over time.



4. The determinants of listing choices

    If the rising-then-falling pattern of foreign listings on U.S. exchanges is explained by a decrease in

the competitiveness of these exchanges, we would expect that firms make their listing decisions

differently now than they used to, so that a firm with characteristics that made it likely to list in the past

would be less likely to list now. In this section, we first examine the determinants of firms’ decisions to

cross-list in the U.S. or U.K. using a competing-risks hazard model. Specifically, we estimate a model

that simultaneously considers the determinants of listings in both the U.S. and the U.K. This allows us to

test whether the factors that affect these listing choices differ. This first step helps us to understand which

characteristics influence the different types of foreign listing outcomes in the U.S. and U.K. markets

during the overall 1990-2005 period. Next, in order to evaluate the decline in the competitiveness of U.S.




                                                      20
markets, we examine whether the propensity of firms with given characteristics to list in the U.S. and

U.K. changed after 2001.



4.1. Competing risks models for New York and London listings

    The competing risks model we estimate extends the standard Cox (1972) proportional-hazard model

developed for single event data to multiple event data. Although previous papers have estimated single-

event Cox models to investigate the factors that affect firms’ foreign listing decisions, they do not

distinguish among different types of listings (Pagano, Roell, and Zechner, 2002; Doidge, Karolyi, Lins,

Miller, and Stulz, 2007). Pagano, Roell, and Zechner (2002) model separately the probability of a

European firm cross-listing in another European country or one of the U.S. exchanges or both in a year t,

given that the firm has not yet listed. Other listing choices are not considered and after a firm lists abroad

on one market or another, it is excluded from the model estimation because it is no longer “at risk” of

listing. The key point is that the listing location choices are modeled with separate Cox models. With a

competing-risks model where listing choices include both the U.S. and the U.K., a firm that lists on a U.S.

exchange is no longer “at risk” of listing in the U.S., but it is still “at risk” of listing in the U.K. Similarly,

a firm that lists in the U.K. would continue to be at risk of listing in the U.S. In other words, the listing

location choices are modeled in the same Cox model.

    There are several variations of competing risks hazard models and the specific choice depends on the

nature of the data being analyzed (Cleves, 1999; Box-Steffensmeier and Zorn, 2002). The case we

analyze is sometimes referred to as “unordered failure events of different types” and the model we

estimate is referred to as a stratified proportional hazard model. In our application, there are two possible

failure events, cross-listing in the U.S. or listing in the U.K., and the listings can occur in either order. For

each firm j, the model is specified as:

          (       )               (       )
         h t x jk = h0 k ( t ) exp β′k x jk ,




                                                        21
where h0k(t) is the baseline hazard for the kth event, xjk, is a vector of independent variables for the kth

event, and βk is a vector of parameters to be estimated. Therefore, the model allows both the baseline

hazard and the parameter estimates to differ for U.S. and U.K. listings.

    To estimate this model, we follow the procedure outlined in Cleves (1999) and Lunn and McNeil

(1995). Lunn and McNeil show that by augmenting the data using a duplication method, Cox models can

be adapted to take account of multiple failure types. In our case, there are two failure types, given by δ

equal to 0 or 1. The first failure type is listing in the U.S. (δ = 0) and the second is listing in the U.K. (δ =

1). Because there are two failure types, each firm-year observation in the dataset should be duplicated

once. For each pair of observations, the first observation is associated with U.S. listings and the second

observation is associated with U.K. listings. Each year, each firm is at risk for both types of listings.

However, if a firm lists in the U.S. (U.K.) it is no longer at risk for a U.S. (U.K.) listing and future

observations associated with U.S. (U.K.) listings are removed from the dataset. However, the firm is still

at risk for a U.K. (U.S.) listing so those observations remain in the dataset. If the firm later lists in the

U.K. (U.S.), then any future observations for that firm would be removed from the dataset.

    We use this augmented dataset to estimate a stratified proportional-hazard model, with the

stratification variable being δ (listing type) and the covariates being x for U.S. listings, together with their

interactions, δ′x for U.K. listings. While estimating this model is equivalent to estimating proportional-

hazard models separately for each listing type (treating the other listing type as censored data), this

approach allows us to test whether the estimated parameters for each listing type are different.

    In this “event time” experiment, we consider firms over the period from 1991 to 2005. The firm-level

and country-level explanatory variables we use are given in Table 5, although we lag all variables by one

year since we are trying to explain why a firm with specific characteristics at the end of one year chooses

to list during the following year. Because variables are lagged by one year, we cannot use new listings in

1990. We also remove from the sample firms that have a U.S. and U.K. listing prior to 1991. We report

the coefficients in exponentiated form. The advantage of exponentiated coefficients is that they can be




                                                       22
interpreted as the effect of a unit change in the explanatory variable on the hazard. For example, an

exponentiated coefficient of 1.2 (0.8) implies that a one unit increase (decrease) in the explanatory

variable increases (decreases) the probability of cross-listing by 20 percent. The standard errors are

adjusted for firm-level clustering, so that we assume errors are independent across firms, but not across

time.

    In Table 6, we report the results. The first two models include all types of listings in the U.S. and

U.K. and provide a broad comparison of firms that choose to list in each market. The next two models

focus only on exchange listings in the U.S. and ordinary listings in the U.K. We focus on ordinary listings

in the U.K. as they are the most comparable type of listing in London to exchange listings in New York.

This choice should make it more difficult to find differences between New York and London listings,

especially because the majority of firms that list as ordinaries in London are from developed markets.

Models (1) and (3) report results that exclude the ownership variable and models (2) and (4) report results

that include the ownership variable. Requiring data on lagged ownership imposes a tight constraint on the

dataset, which is why we report both sets of results. In model (1), there are 573 new listings by firms in

the U.S. and 39 new listings in the U.K. that have all the required data available and have total assets of at

least $100 million (in 1990 dollars). In model (2), there are 425 new listings by firms in the U.S. and 30

new listings in the U.K. By focusing only on exchange listings in models (3) and (4), the number of

“failure” events is approximately halved.

    Overall, we find that large firms with positive sales growth in industries with high Tobin’s q ratios

and from countries with better legal regimes for minority investors are more likely to cross-list in the U.S.

and the U.K. markets. There are some differences in the exponentiated coefficients between the U.S. and

U.K. listings, but none of them are statistically significant (likely a lack of precision due to so few U.K.

listing events). For example, leveraged firms are less likely to pursue a U.S. listing and the larger positive

coefficient on Log(Assets) and Legal for U.S. listings suggests a notably stronger bias for large firms and

those from better legal regimes to list there. In model (2), the coefficient on ownership is significantly




                                                     23
below one for U.S. listings and not for U.K. listings, indicating that closely-held foreign firms are less

likely to pursue a U.S. listing.

    When we replicate the competing risk estimation for exchange listings in New York and ordinary

share listings in London, the important differences noted above widen and some even become statistically

significant. For example, the positive coefficients on Legal widen further and the negative coefficient on

ownership for U.S. listings in model (4) is significantly different from that for U.K. listings indicating that

it is the major exchanges in New York, rather than the Rule 144a and OTC listings, that represent the

primary deterrent for closely-held firms from poorer legal regimes at home. In fact, U.K. ordinary listings

do not deter such firms at all. This latter result is important as it is consistent with the findings in Doidge,

Karolyi, Lins, Miller, and Stulz (2007) and with the idea that U.S. listing choices tend to be significantly

associated with a governance benefit. That is, if foreign firms with closely-held shares are, in fact,

controlled by a dominant shareholder and if they come from a country where it is easier for the

controlling shareholders to expropriate firm assets at the expense of minority shareholders, they are less

likely to seek a listing on a U.S. exchange since the additional scrutiny of regulatory institutions, like the

SEC, and more rigorous monitoring by various capital market participants makes it harder for them to run

the corporations they control for their own private gain.



4.2. Changing firm characteristics and the propensity to list in New York and London

    If New York has become less competitive in attracting foreign listings since 2001, perhaps because of

the passage of SOX in 2002, the actual number of listing firms would have declined relative to what

would have been expected based on information of how firms made listing choices before 2001. The

expected number of listing firms is jointly a function of the propensity to list given certain firm

characteristics and the changing characteristics of the eligible set of firms. We next estimate logistic

regression models separately for U.S. and U.K. listings for the pre-SOX period (1990-2001) and then

apply these estimated models to the pool of firms available in Worldscope in the post-SOX period to




                                                      24
estimate the expected fraction of these firms that would have listed had firms made listing decisions post-

SOX in the same way that they made these decisions pre-SOX.19 Since the models are estimated in the

1990s, variation in the expected fraction of listed firms after 2001 is due to the changing characteristics of

sample firms. We then use the difference between the expected fraction of listed firms and the actual

fraction to measure the change in the propensity to list in these markets. A decline in the competitiveness

of the U.S. market for foreign listings should result in a smaller fraction of actual relative to the expected

number of listings predicted by our model. As before, we focus only on exchange listings in the U.S. and

ordinary listings on the Main Market in the U.K. as these are the primary competing venues that would

have been affected by the changes due to SOX.

     Table 7 summarizes annual logit regressions that document the relation between the probability that a

firm is listed and the firm’s sales growth, global industry Tobin’s q, size as Log(Assets), leverage,

ownership, and the country variables Legal, Log(GNP), and the Stock market cap/GDP ratio, associated

with the firm’s domicile. Following Fama and French (2001), rather than one overall regression, we

estimate the logit regressions year-by-year and, in the spirit of Fama and MacBeth (1973), we report the

time-series means of the coefficients. To make inferences about the precision of these means, we use the

time-series standard deviations of the coefficients, which allow for the correlation of the regression

residuals across firms, and adjust for first-order serial correlation. Models (1) to (4) present results for the

U.S. exchange listings and models (5) to (8) do so for U.K. ordinary share listings. The first two models

in each set report average coefficients over the whole sample period (1990-2005) and the latter two

models in each set report average coefficients by two subperiods. The full-period average slopes from the

regressions confirm our inferences about the roles of sales growth, size, and leverage from the competing

risk Cox models in Table 6. U.S. and U.K. exchange listings attract larger firms with positive sales

growth, lower leverage, and less-closely-held ownership structures in industries with high median Tobin’s

q ratios and from countries with stronger legal traditions. As in Table 6, the coefficients on sales growth

19
  This approach is similar to the approach used by Fama and French (2001) to evaluate whether the propensity to
pay dividends has declined.



                                                      25
are positive for U.S. exchange listings and they are negative (or insignificant) for U.K. ordinary listings.

In these logit regressions the ownership coefficients are significantly negative for U.S. listings, as before,

but it is surprising that they are also negative for the U.K. listings, which we did not see in the competing-

risk Cox models.

    In comparing the average slopes across the two subperiods, we see that most coefficients have the

same sign and are similar in magnitude. Though none of the coefficients in the London regressions

change signs, two of them in the U.S. exchange listing regression do. First, sales growth has a negative

and statistically significant sign in the 2002-2005 period in contrast to a positive and statistically

significant sign in the 1990-2001 period. Second, the market-capitalization-to-GDP coefficient has a

statistically significant and positive sign in the second subperiod in contrast to a negative and statistically

significant sign in the first subperiod. The negative sign on the sales growth coefficient is puzzling, since

theory suggests that firms with better growth opportunities are more likely to seek an exchange listing.

The average pseudo-R2s are only moderately smaller in the post-SOX period compared to the pre-SOX

period for both U.S. and U.K. listings. Overall, except for the puzzling result on sales growth, these

findings offer little evidence of changes in the characteristics of listing firms from the pre-SOX period to

the post-SOX period.

    Section 2 showed that there has been a decline in the number of new listings on the exchanges in New

York and on the Main Market in London in the past several years. If the propensity to list given certain

firm characteristics has not changed as Table 7 indicates, the decline is due to the changing characteristics

of firms. That is, fewer large firms with large asset size, positive sales growth, low leverage, less closely-

held ownership in high Tobin’s q industries are available in the population of firms to seek out U.S. or

U.K. listings. We observed in Table 5 that there was precisely such an evolution in the population of non-

cross-listed firms. Table 8 shows the expected percent of U.S. and U.K. foreign listings. The expected

percent of firms with a listing is computed by applying the average logit coefficients for 1990 to 2001

(from Table 7) to the values of the explanatory variables for each firm each year between 2002 and 2005.




                                                      26
We obtain the predicted probability that a firm has an exchange listing each year, sum the predicted

probabilities over firms each year, and divide by the number of firms in the sample that year to compute

an expected percent. We also report the actual percent of listed firms in those years for comparison. Three

sets of calculations are reported based on three different logit model specifications: (1) with firm-level

attributes only, (2) with the three country-level variables only, and (3) with all explanatory variables.

Strikingly, the actual listing percents are higher than expected for the U.S. exchange listings, while those

for the U.K. listings are lower than expected. For example, in 2002 on the major U.S. exchanges, there

were 343 listings, or 7.24% of 4,738 eligible firms in the Worldscope database (nonfinancial firms with

over $100 million in assets and available data, from non-U.K., non-tax-haven countries) while the logit

models would have predicted between 2.64% and 3.72% U.S. exchange listings. The economic magnitude

of this difference is large: in terms of total firm counts, there are about 166 fewer expected listings than

actual listings. The differences between actual and expected listing propensities for U.K. listings are

smaller than those for U.S. listings; for example, there were 78 ordinary listings on the Main Market in

2005, 1.63% of the 4,708 eligible firms, but more than 2.75% were expected to do so based on the

propensity to list during the 1990-2001 period. Finally, it is interesting to note that the proportion of firms

expected to be listed is very low in 2002 compared to the 1990s, but it increases thereafter. Perhaps not

surprisingly, the economic difficulties of the early 2000s had an impact on the demand for listings – in

particular, they reduced growth opportunities and firms are more likely to list when they have good

growth opportunities.

    We investigated further whether our inferences about the U.S. and U.K. expected listing counts in the

post-SOX period are sensitive to the base period chosen to estimate the logit models which predict the

expected percent of listed firms. If we use two recent subperiods, 1995-2001 or 1997-2001, instead of the

full period, 1990-2001, the expected percent of U.S. listed firms does increase in the post-SOX period.

The surplus of U.S. listed firms in 2002-2005 using the full-period logit model transforms into a small

deficit (0.35%) of listed firms in 2005 using 1995-2001 as the base period for estimation and a larger




                                                      27
deficit for 2004 (0.98%) and 2005 (1.97%) for the 1997-2001 base period. However, as we use these

more recent periods, the deficit of listed firms in London increases as well. Consequently, using a

different base period does not change the conclusion that SOX did not make London more attractive

relative to the U.S. exchanges for firms wishing to list on a foreign exchange.

     It is worth dwelling a bit more on these results. If firms could easily exit from the U.S. exchanges by

delisting and deregistering and if the competitiveness of the U.S. exchanges had declined, we would

observe missing listings. That is, firms predicted to have been listed based on their characteristics would

not have been listed. Table 8 shows no missing listings. In fact, each year, there are more firms listed than

predicted. One might argue that this reflects the difficulty that firms listed on U.S. exchanges face in

removing themselves (technically, by terminating their registration with the SEC) from the obligations

they are subject to from the time they list in a way that makes a delisting worthwhile.20 With this

argument, if firms had been able to deregister more easily, we would observe missing listings. This may

well be true. In this case, our results would predict a steady decline of foreign listings on the U.S.

exchanges. However, none of our evidence is consistent with the claim that London has become more

competitive relative to New York. If London had become more competitive, we would expect that

London would have more foreign listings compared to the number expected by extrapolating from the

behavior of firms in the 1990s. Exactly the opposite is true. We expected to find a deficit in listing counts

for the U.S. exchanges, but instead found it for ordinary listings on the Main Market in London. Put

together, it is difficult to make a case for the decline in the competitiveness of the U.S. markets relative to

the U.K. based on the propensity for foreign listings or changing firm and country characteristics.




20
  Delisting from a U.S. exchange eliminates the obligation to meet the exchange’s listing requirements, but it does
not eliminate SEC registration requirements. It is difficult for foreign firms to meet the SEC’s deregistration
requirements, especially so for large firms with broad share ownership in the U.S. In fact, the rules governing
deregistration are more arduous for foreign firms than they are for U.S. firms. See Leuz, Triantis, and Wang (2006)
and Chaplinsky and Ramchand (2007) for further details on the specific requirements for delisting and for
deregistering. On March 21, 2007, the SEC adopted amendments to the deregistration rules which ease the
deregistration process for foreign firms.

5. The valuation premium for New York and London listings over time

     The governance benefit for a foreign firm listing on a U.S. exchange arises because controlling

shareholders of such firms face more constraints on their ability to extract private benefits at the expense

of public shareholders due to the U.S. investor-protection apparatus. For firms with valuable growth

opportunities, the lower private benefits for controlling shareholders are more than offset by the fact that

firms are now able to raise funds from public investors on better terms to finance these growth

opportunities. As a result, U.S. cross-listed firms should be worth more because (1) they can take

advantage of growth opportunities that they could not have taken advantage of without a listing and (2) a

smaller fraction of the cash flows generated by the firms are appropriated as private benefits by insiders

(Doidge, Karolyi, and Stulz, 2004; Hail and Leuz, 2006). As firms take advantage of growth

opportunities, we expect their Tobin’s q ratios to fall (see, for instance, Li, Livdan, and Zhang, 2007). So,

the first source of the valuation effect of a listing does not persist. However, the second valuation effect

persists. Consequently, on theoretical grounds, part of the high Tobin’s q ratios of firms at the time they

list is temporary, but part is not.

     In this section, we investigate whether and how the relative valuation of listed firms has changed over

time and across listing venues. If the net benefits for shareholders of a listing on a New York exchange

has fallen, we would expect to see a decrease in the listing premium in New York, or at least a decrease in

that premium relative to London. We therefore estimate cross-listing premiums from annual regressions

of Tobin’s q on control variables based on firm characteristics and country-level factors each year from

1990 to 2005. Previous research by Doidge, Karolyi, and Stulz (2004) established that there is premium,

but their analysis focuses on U.S. listings in 1997 only. To our knowledge, no study has tested for the

existence of a premium for U.K. foreign listings.21 Because we have panel data, we can use firm fixed-



21
   Baker, Nofsinger, and Weaver (2002) uncovered an insignificant negative abnormal share price reaction to foreign
listings in London following a sizeable pre-listing run-up in returns (8.7% over the pre-listing year), but mostly in
conjunction with increases in analyst coverage and media attention for those firms. Salva (2003) found a significant
3.78% abnormal return for foreign listing announcements, but only for DR listings on the Main Market. A recent
2006 study by Oxera, a U.K.-based consultancy, argued that “a listing in London may deliver higher valuations and



                                                         29
effects to account for unobservable firm characteristics. We expect that a permanent benefit accrues to

firms cross-listed on U.S. exchanges. We therefore investigate our premise that there is a permanent

premium associated with U.S. exchange listings. Finally, we perform a subperiod analysis of the cross-

listing premium comparing the pre-SOX 1990-2001 and post-SOX 2002-2005 periods.



5.1. The cross-listing premium in New York and London over time

    Table 9 reports regression results of Tobin’s q on different dummy variables associated with various

types of U.S. and U.K. listings as well as a set of firm characteristics, including sales growth, the median

Tobin’s q of the global industry to which the firm belongs, total sales as size proxy, and country dummy

variables. The regressions are estimated using OLS and the standard errors are clustered on countries –

that is, observations are assumed to be independent across countries, but not within countries.22 Panel a

presents the regression results year-by-year across the 1990-2005 period and panel b provides panel data

results using Fama and MacBeth (1973) methods, pooled OLS with firm-level clustering to compute the

standard errors, and pooled OLS with firm fixed effects. The sample includes, as before, all non-financial,

non-U.S., non-U.K. and non-tax-haven-country firms with available data in Worldscope with assets over

$100 million. The size of this sample ranges from 2,764 firms in 1990 to 7,302 firms in 2005. The

dummy variable associated with a given type of listing requires at least 10 listings with available data for

q ratios as well as the independent variables, so, for example, Rule 144a listings are not considered until

1992, U.K. DR listings until 1996, and U.K. AIM firms until 2005.

    Panel a shows that the cross-listing premium for U.S. exchange listings is large, positive, and

statistically significant in each year from 1990 through 2005. The magnitude and precision of the

premium is weaker in the first three years of the sample period, but it averages around 0.24 for the



a lower cost of equity” than comparable listings in other markets, but provide no estimates other than discounts on
IPOs (10-15% abnormal first-day returns), listing fees, and trading cost quotations.
22
   An alternative approach would be to estimate a country random-effects model following La Porta, Lopez-de-
Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny (2002). However, Hausman (1978) tests indicate that the assumptions of the model are
not met in all years.



                                                        30
remainder of the sample period. Even after controlling for firm and country characteristics, the premium

is economically large: compared to the average Tobin’s q ratios of firms that are not cross-listed, our

estimates imply that firms listed on U.S. exchanges are worth about 17% more. There is no statistically

significant cross-listing premium for U.S. Rule 144a private placements, except marginally so in the very

early years of the program (1992-1993). Interestingly, there is a premium for OTC cross-listings in many

years (12 of 16 years), although the overall magnitude averages around 0.13, which is about half that of

cross-listings on the exchanges. This is consistent with the findings of Doidge, Karolyi, and Stulz (2004).

Most surprisingly, there is no discernible premium for U.K. cross-listings in any year of the sample period

for any of the three types of listings (AIM, DR, or ordinary shares). In fact, the ordinary share and DR

listings actually have cross-listing discounts (though insignificant) in 13 of the 16 years. The adjusted

R2’s are higher than those in previous studies likely because of the use of country dummy variables to

account for cross-country variation. The firm-level control variables are also important with reliably

positive coefficients on sales growth and global industry median Tobin’s q. Log(Sales) is a weaker

control with a negative coefficient in the first seven years of the period and positive in more recent years.

     The results in Table 9 provide a first opportunity to assess whether the premium for a U.S. exchange

listing has declined since the passage of SOX in 2002. Figure 2 presents another perspective in which we

compare the valuation premium of cross-listed firms to the average q ratios of non-cross-listed firms.

When we use the U.S. exchange coefficients from Table 9 and compute the percentage valuation

difference relative to the average q of firms that are not cross-listed each year, we find that from 1990-

2001, U.S. exchange listed firms are worth an average of 17.5% more than firms that are not listed. From

2002-2005, U.S. exchange listed firms are worth 14.3% more.23 A t-test for the equality of means

(unreported) indicates that the difference between 17.5% and 14.3% is not significant (p-value equals

0.49). If we exclude 1999, arguably an anomalous year in terms of valuations, U.S. listed firms are worth


23
  For example, in 1997, the coefficient in Table 9 is 0.22 and the average q of firms that are not cross-listed is 1.30.
Therefore, in 1997, after controlling for firm and country characteristics, firms listed on U.S. exchanges are worth
16.9% more.



                                                          31
15.4% more in the 1990-2001 period. This initial test suggests that the U.S. listing premium has not

significantly declined after the passage of SOX.

     Firms are more likely to list if they have better growth opportunities. This means that firms with

higher q ratios are more likely to list. The endogeneity of this firm choice leads to a “self-selection”

problem that can, in turn, lead to econometric problems that induce an upward bias in our estimate of the

valuation premium. This is mainly a concern for U.S. exchange listings because these are the only listings

that have a positive and statistically significant premium each year. Previous studies of the valuation of

cross-listed firms (e.g., Doidge, Karolyi, and Stulz, 2004) have handled this problem by estimating

selection models (Heckman, 1979) which specify a separate selection (cross-listing) decision equation in

addition to the observation (valuation) equation. In unreported tests, we investigated how our inferences

about the valuation premium in panel a of Table 9 change when we employ a selection model. Our model

(like that in Doidge, Karolyi, and Stulz, 2004) employs country variables like the market-capitalization-

to-GDP ratio, log of GNP per capita, and Legal as well as the firm’s log of sales. The premium remains

positive in each of the 16 years of our sample period and statistically significant in all but four years.

     The estimates over the entire period from 1990-2005 are presented in panel b. The first set of results

uses the method of Fama and MacBeth (1973). We average the coefficients from the annual regressions

of panel a and perform inference tests on the time-series means and standard deviations. The advantage of

this procedure is that it incorporates unknown cross-correlation structure in residuals.24 The estimates

confirm the reliably positive and significant valuation premiums for U.S. OTC (0.12) and exchange

listings (0.22) seen in panel a, the insignificant coefficients for U.S. Rule 144a private placements and

U.K. DR listings, and a statistically significant discount (-0.05) for U.K. ordinary listings. The pooled

OLS estimation (with standard errors adjusted for clustering on firms) with country and year fixed effects

are almost identical to those of the Fama-MacBeth regressions. Finally, while the firm fixed-effects

regressions (no country fixed effects, but year fixed effects retained) confirm the positive valuation

  The t-statistics are adjusted for first order serial correlation. If we do not make this adjustment, the t-statistics are
higher in all cases.

premiums for U.S. OTC and exchange listings – though much smaller in magnitude at 0.05 and 0.08,

respectively – they now assert a reliably large negative premium for U.K. listings. The advantage of using

firm fixed-effects is that we control for unobserved firm-level heterogeneity (not captured by our control

variables), but the finding for U.K. listings is surprising and raises potential concerns about using fixed-

effects.25 We do not include a dummy variable for AIM listings in these regressions because we can only

include the dummy for 2005.

     Table 9 confirms that a U.S. cross-listing premium exists every year from 1990 to 2005 for exchange

listed firms. We also have shown that there is a smaller premium for U.S. OTC listings, but this premium

does not exist every year. Finally, there is no premium for U.S. Rule 144a listings or Main Market listings

on the LSE, either DRs or ordinary listings. Moreover, we find no evidence that the premium for U.S.

exchange listing firms has disappeared since SOX or that a premium has emerged in the U.K. The

coefficient on AIM for the one year available (2005) is positive and large in magnitude, but it is not

significant. There are simply too few firms listing on AIM that are not small firms to make much of the

valuation of firms on AIM.



5.2. Is the cross-listing premium permanent or transitory?

     We interpret the premium to reflect a permanent benefit that accrues to firms that list on U.S.

exchanges. Recent literature raises concerns about such an interpretation. In an event-time analysis,

Gozzi, Levine, and Schmukler (2007) show that Tobin’s q valuation premiums for their

“internationalized” firms disappear beyond the two years following the internationalization event.

However, their internationalization events include other cross-listings besides U.S. exchange cross-

listings and hence include cross-listings for which a valuation premium is not predicted by theory.



25
   A major concern with firm fixed effects is that, in de-meaning the dependent and independent variables in the
regression, it is forced to measure only firm-specific time-variation in the premium and it ignores all cross-sectional
variation across firms. For our analysis, many firms never cross-list on a U.S. or U.K. market so what little time-
series variation in mean-adjusted Tobin’s q ratios or other control variables that might be identified for the cross-
listing firms might be overwhelmed by the absence of it for the non-cross-listing firms.



                                                          33
Sarkissian and Schill (2007) examine long-run abnormal returns using standard event-study methods for

1,256 cross-listings in 24 host countries around the world, including the U.S. (323 listings) and U.K. (191

listings). They show how the negative post-listing abnormal returns for foreign listings in the U.S.

markets, first observed by Foerster and Karolyi (2000), eliminate and outweigh the positive valuation

gains achieved in the pre-listing and listing periods to render a net negative valuation impact.26

     In Table 10, we re-examine whether the valuation premiums for U.S. exchange listings are transitory.

In order to facilitate comparison, we follow the panel regression methodology of Gozzi, Levine, and

Schmukler as exhibited in their Figure 2 and Table 7. They estimate pooled OLS regressions of Tobin’s q

with country and year fixed effects on a variety of control variables and dummy variables equal to one for

firms in years with “internationalization” events, and separately within three years of such events. Their

internationalization events, of course, are not directly comparable to our analysis of foreign listings in the

U.S. and U.K., as they include international cross-listings in major financial centers (which include the

U.S., U.K., and others like Frankfurt and Hong Kong) as well as global equity capital raising events

through private or public placements. Panel a of Table 10 shows the count of the number of cross-listing

firm observations in each of the three years around the listing events and separately for Rule 144a private

placements, OTC, and exchange listings in the U.S. and for DRs and ordinary listings on the LSE. Given

that our horizon of analysis begins in 1990, there are many firms that listed prior to that date, which is

why we have so many observations in the “> 3 years after listing” category. The sample grows, as

expected, over the course of the six-year event period as more firms cross-list on one of the two markets

in one form or another over the 1990-2005 period. It should also be noted that the regressions include a

benchmark sample of all non-cross-listing firms.

     Panel b presents the estimation results. In each Tobin’s q regression, the form of U.S. or U.K. cross-

listing event is examined one at a time relative to the benchmark of non-cross-listing firms. There are

several important findings. First, for each type of listing and in both markets, there is a significant

26
   One of the earliest studies to uncover the increases and then decreases in valuation ratios around U.S. cross-
listings is actually by Sundaram and Logue (1996), which pre-dates the current studies by a decade.



                                                       34
increase in the Tobin’s q valuation premiums in the years leading up to the listing and a decrease in the

premiums in the years following the listing. Second, the increase arises for all three types of U.S. listings

and DRs in London, but not for ordinary shares in London. More importantly, however, the magnitude of

the increase in the premium during the pre-listing period is considerably greater for the U.S. exchange

listings than for any other type of foreign listing. The average premium for U.S. exchange-listing firms

three or more years before the listing is positive (0.07), but is small and is statistically insignificant. It

increases to a statistically significant 0.59 in the year before listing. The premium for DR listings in

London also increases to a comparably large 0.65 in the year before listing while those for Rule 144a

private placements (0.23) and OTC listings (0.14) in the U.S. are smaller. There is no detectable premium

for ordinary listings in London any time around the listing event. Third, the premium declines in the years

following the listing event (although as noted earlier, this is expected). This is mostly consistent with the

findings of Gozzi, Levine, and Schmukler, as well as indirectly with those of Sarkissian and Schill, except

in the most critical dimension: the cross-listing premium for firms listing on major U.S. exchanges

remains positive and statistically significant even beyond three years following the listing. Further, the F-

statistics indicate that the coefficients for “>3 years after listing” (0.21) and for “3 years after listing”

(0.28) are significantly greater than the coefficients for “>3 years before listing” (0.07) and for “3 years

before listing” (0.11). There is no permanent valuation increase for U.K. DR listings or for U.S. Rule

144a private placements. Firms with U.S. OTC listings have a positive and significant coefficient for

“>than 3 years after listing” (0.09), although this coefficient is significantly lower than the coefficient for

“>3 years before listing” (0.13). In contrast to our results for U.S. exchange listings, Gozzi, Levine, and

Schmukler (Table 7) show that there is a Tobin’s q premium of -0.02 more than three years after

internationalization for all internationalizing firms.

    In summary, we find that there is a pre-listing increase and a post-listing decline in valuations for

cross-listing firms, in a way similar to related papers, but, unlike these other studies, we find that the

premium persists permanently beyond three years following the listing on a U.S. exchange. Why are our




                                                         35
results so different from those of Sarkissian and Schill and Gozzi, Levine, and Schmukler? We can think

of at least two different reasons. First, these studies employ different methodologies. It is difficult to

compare our analysis to the long-run event-study analysis of Sarkissian and Schill. Second, the events

under investigation are different. While the paper by Gozzi, Levine, and Schmukler represents the

analysis closest to our work in terms of methodology, they focus on a broad range of

“internationalization” events. Their analysis does break down the valuation analysis into just exchange

listings (which include U.S., U.K. and other markets) and just U.S. listings (including Rule 144a private

placements and OTC listings) in their Table 7, but we have shown that the results are very different for

U.S. exchange listings than for other types of U.S. listings and even for U.K. exchange listings. Our

evidence is consistent with the theory presented in Doidge, Karolyi, and Stulz (2004). With this theory, it

is inappropriate to mix cross-listings on exchanges in different countries or to mix U.S. exchange listings

with Rule 144a private placements or OTC listings because the governance constraints imposed by U.S.

exchange listings are not imposed by other forms of listings.



5.3. The cross-listing premium before and after 2001

    Has there been a decline in the valuation premium for U.S. exchange listings in the aftermath of the

passage of the SOX Act in 2002? If U.S. capital markets have become less competitive in the market for

foreign listings, even if we have not seen a change in the propensity to list in U.S. or U.K. markets or a

change in the characteristics of the firms choosing to list in one market or the other, the net benefits for

foreign firms from being listed on U.S. exchanges may still have declined. Our valuation analysis up to

this point suggests that the valuation premium for U.S. exchange listed firms is permanent and is

significant in all sample years. We did report, however, that, from 1990-2001, the average valuation

premium was 17.5% compared to 14.3% from 2002-2005. Recent studies by Zingales (2006) and Litvak

(2006) examining Tobin’s q and market-to-book valuation ratios also suggest that the premium may be




                                                    36
lower since 2002.27 Zingales shows that the decline in the Tobin’s q valuation premium for cross-listed

firms following the passage of SOX (his subperiods are 1997-2001 for pre-SOX versus 2003-2005 for

post-SOX) is concentrated in firms from countries with better legal protections of minority shareholders

(as measured by the average control premiums paid in large block transactions in various countries – see

Dyck and Zingales, 2004). Similarly, Litvak (2006) shows that the largest declines in valuation premiums

arise for firms with the highest pre-SOX disclosures. That is, the companies cross-listed in U.S. markets

with higher quality corporate governance were the most adversely affected by the passage of SOX.

     We investigate whether the cross-listing premium changes after SOX in Table 11. We compute the

valuation premiums for the firms that list on U.S. exchanges as in our panel regression from panel b of

Table 9. We estimate the regressions with OLS and include with country and year dummy variables, as

well as our usual set of firm-level control variables (sales growth, global industry q, log(sales)) – that is,

we investigate whether the premium has declined post-SOX, after controlling for firm and country

characteristics. We add a dummy variable for the passage of SOX for the U.S. exchange listings (“U.S.

Exchange × Post SOX”). This dummy variable equals zero for exchange listings in the period from 1990

to 2001 and one for the post-SOX period from 2002 to 2005. In model (1) we estimate the model with all

non-financial firms with our usual data constraints related to Worldscope and $100 million or more in

total assets, while in model (2) we further exclude U.K. cross-listings on U.S. exchanges. In both

specifications, the coefficient for the U.S. exchange-listed valuation premium is statistically significant

and large (0.25 and 0.23, respectively) as before, and the interactive coefficient on the post-SOX dummy

variable is positive, but statistically insignificant.28 These results suggest that SOX had no effect on the

cross-listing premium for U.S. exchange listings, but it is legitimate to be concerned as to whether our

findings result from an “averaging” effect since we include together firms from countries with better and
27
   These two studies are distinct from the returns-based event-study papers of SOX and firm valuations by Berger,
Li, and Wong (2005), Li (2006), Litvak (2007), and Smith (2006). The results vary across the various studies in
terms of the implications of SOX, but this is not surprising given that they employ different event dates surrounding
the passage of SOX, the announcement dates of delistings or other types of events and given that they utilize
different sets of benchmark firms.
28
   If we exclude the year dummies, the coefficient for U.S. exchange × Post SOX becomes negative (between -0.02
and -0.04), but is still statistically insignificant (t-statistic is between -0.47 and -1.20).



                                                         37
worse legal protections. Models (3) and (4) perform the same regressions as in models (1) and (2), but

include an additional variable, “U.S. exchange × Post SOX × Low legal”, where Low legal is a dummy

variable that equals one for countries with below-median scores on Legal and zero, otherwise. Based on

Zingales (2006) and Litvak (2006), we would expect to see a statistically significant and positive

coefficient on this interactive dummy. We do not. In fact, the coefficient is negative, though statistically

insignificant.29

     We have failed to find evidence that is supportive of the hypothesis that the U.S. exchanges are losing

their competitive edge in attracting foreign listings. Not only are we unable to discern any major changes

in the flows of listings to the U.S. and U.K. markets (with a special recognition of the growth of the AIM

market in the U.K.) that would be consistent with a loss of competitiveness, but also the characteristics of

the firms pursuing these listings have changed very modestly and the valuation premiums typically

ascribed to those listings continue. The governance benefits of listing on a U.S. exchange appear as

important as they once were and have not diminished in recent years. In the next section, we pursue one

more line of inquiry related to the governance benefit of U.S. listings beyond just the flow of listing

activity, the characteristics of the cross-listing firms, and their valuations; namely, the capital raising

activity around the listings.



6. Capital raising activity around U.S. and U.K. cross-listings

     La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny (1997, 1998) and Reese and Weisbach (2002) argue

that a useful way to test the effectiveness of a legal system and its ability to enforce any financial contract

is to focus on the ease with which a firm can raise external capital. La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer,

and Vishny show that, in countries where legal protections are weak, it is considerably more difficult for



29
  To be fair, we cannot really make direct comparisons with the Zingales (2006) and Litvak (2006) studies. Zingales
uses the Dyck and Zingales (2004) control premiums (which are not available for all our countries) to score
good/poor governance countries instead of our Legal variable. Moreover, rather than using using year-by-year
country-level averages, our approach uses firm-level data and controls for firm and country characteristics. Litvak
focuses on valuations in 2001 and 2002 and uses a matched-firm sample analysis for her benchmarking approach.



                                                        38
firms to raise external finance than for firms in countries that protect minority interests well. Coffee

(1999) and Stulz (1999) point out that foreign firms that cross-list effectively borrow some of the legal

protections of the U.S. regulatory environment bond themselves to protect the interests of their minority

stockholders better. This is what we refer to as the governance benefit. Reese and Weisbach test, and

provide evidence in support of, the bonding hypothesis by showing that foreign firms that cross-list on

U.S. exchanges increase the number of equity issues after the listing, that the increase is larger for firms

from countries with weak protections and, most interestingly, that the increase arises for equity issues in

their home market as well as in the U.S. market, the original target market for the listings. In other words,

the desire to protect shareholder rights appears to be such an important reason for why foreign firms

cross-list in the U.S. that their doing so enhances their ability to raise capital not only in the U.S., but at

home and elsewhere. Since we fail to find evidence that U.K. listings have a governance benefit, we

would expect that firms that list on U.S. exchanges raise more equity after listing, but firms that list on the

Main Market in the U.K. do not.

    In this section, we extend the experiment of Reese and Weisbach (2002) and measure the extent of

equity issuance activity of firms listing on U.S. exchanges and firms listing on the Main Market in the

U.K. in the years before and after their listing over the period of analysis from 1990 to 2005. We examine

whether they raise equity in the U.S. or U.K. markets, in their home market, or in other markets. To the

best of our knowledge, no study has yet examined the consequences of a foreign listing in the U.K. for

capital raising activity at home or outside the U.K. If the governance gain is exclusively attributable to

U.S. exchange listings, then we would expect no major changes in equity issuance activity for those firms

following their listing in the U.K. markets.

    Information about the capital raising activity for our foreign firms comes from a number of data

sources, including Securities Data Corporation (SDC) and the London Stock Exchange. SDC contains the

date of issue, the market (country) in which the security was issued, and the proceeds from each issue. We

compare the issuance dates from SDC with the cross-listing dates drawn from the sources described




                                                      39
above in order to determine whether they took place up to three years before or within three years after

the listing (therefore we consider new cross-listings from 1993-2002). We apply the usual screens to

focus our analysis on non-financial, non-U.S., and non-U.K. firms with available data in the Worldscope

database and with total assets of at least $100 million (in 1990 dollars) in a given year. For U.K. listings,

the SDC data is supplemented with international issuance data directly from the London Stock Exchange.

These data include the issuance date, the issue type, sector, price, the proceeds of the issue, and the

underwriter name and its country of origin.30 Unfortunately, the LSE data begins only in 1998. To ensure

that we do not exclude any relevant capital raising activity on the Main Market in the U.K., we include

both DRs and ordinary listings in our analysis.

     Table 12 presents the results. We report the issuance activity by market location including the number

of capital raising events and the dollar amount both before and after a cross-listing and separately for U.S.

exchange listings and Main Market listings in the U.K. Overall, we identify 61 (12%) of the 530 firms

with U.S. cross-listings with equity issues before the listing and 157 (30%) with issues after the listing.

Among the 119 U.K. cross-listing firms, 7 (6%) have equity issues before the listing and 30 (25%)

afterward. The increase in the number of issues around the listing events is similar in the two cross-listing

markets. However, the dollar magnitudes are not. Total equity raised among the U.S. cross-listing firms

increases from $29 billion to $151 billion over the listing period – a statistically significant difference for

the mean listing firm – while that for the U.K. cross-listing firms increased modestly from $8 billion to

almost $13 billion.

     Another important result in this table is that there is a significant increase in the dollar magnitude of

equity issuance around U.S. cross-listings not just in the U.S. markets (which represents a statistically

significant increase from $3 billion to $17 billion), but also in the home markets ($15 billion to $79



30
  The authors are grateful to Matthew Leighton in the Market Information and Analysis division of the London
Stock Exchange for his help and for supplying the data. We performed extensive cross-checking of the SDC and
LSE information and always supplemented SDC in favor of the LSE data when in doubt. We also evaluated how
much our Worldscope, sector, and asset-size constraints are binding on the size of the issuance sample of firms and
how much they issue.



                                                        40
billion) and other markets ($10 billion to $55 billion). Each of these increases is statistically significant

for the mean firm. This result can be interpreted in a way that is consistent with that of Reese and

Weisbach (2002). Though they only examine post-listing equity issuances, they find that firms from

countries with poor legal protections in the home market raise a higher fraction of capital in their home

markets and in other markets than firms from countries with good legal protections. We find no similar

changes around U.K. exchange-listings. There is an increase in equity issuances in the home market (from

$5 billion to $7 billion), in other markets ($2 billion to $5 billion) and certainly in the target U.K. market

(up to $1 billion), but none of these changes are statistically significant.

    One possible problem we face with this analysis is that some firms from around the world cross-list

on both London and New York. If a firm cross-lists in London after having already listed on a U.S.

exchange, the firm may not realize any incremental governance gain as a result or, worse, it may appear

to do so, but it would be falsely associated with a London listing (especially if the two listing events occur

close in calendar time). To address this potential problem, we repeat the analysis, but exclude all firms

with exchange listings in both London and New York. The number of firms is much smaller, especially

for London, but our inferences are very similar to those above.

    These results reaffirm the role of a governance gain for foreign firms listing on U.S. exchanges. Firms

that list on U.S. exchanges increase their equity issuance activity following the listing, at home, and in

other markets in ways that firms that pursue listings in the U.K. do not.



7. Conclusions

    In this paper, we investigate the evolution of cross-listings in the U.S. and the U.K. over time. We

find that the number of cross-listed firms in the U.S. and on the LSE’s Main Market in London follows a

similar pattern, increasing from 1990 to 1999, with a peak around the turn of the century, and then a

steady decline thereafter. The fact is that listing counts have been falling in London as well as in New

York. This broader phenomenon makes it difficult to explain the decrease in New York alone using an




                                                       41
argument that New York is becoming less competitive, perhaps because of SOX and other regulatory

changes. It is true that the number of listings on AIM in London has been growing dramatically since

2001, but most firms that list on AIM are small firms that would have been unlikely candidates to cross-

list on the U.S. exchanges.

    The argument that the U.S. exchanges have become less competitive only makes sense if some firms

that would have listed in New York in the 1990s would no longer do so. We investigate this proposition

and find no support for it. The characteristics of listing firms have not significantly changed since the

adoption of SOX. There is little evidence that firms have been making listing decisions differently in

recent years from how they made them from 1990 to 2001. If anything has changed in the aftermath of

SOX, it is that the non-listed firms have become smaller and are therefore less likely to list on the U.S.

exchanges or the Main Market in London. The changing composition of firms that are not listed implies

that there were actually more listed firms than one would expect based on the listing decision patterns

from 1990 to 2001.

    To ascertain further whether the benefits and costs of listing on the U.S. exchanges have changed

over time, we conduct the most complete analysis of the relative valuation of U.S. listed firms to date. We

use several distinct approaches to measure the cross-listing premium: cross-sectional regressions, Fama-

MacBeth regressions, pooled regressions with firm fixed-effects, and event-time regressions. With each

approach, we find that there is a listing premium for firms that list on U.S. exchanges but that there is no

listing premium for firms that list in London. The listing premium is also extremely robust: it exists every

year and it is permanent in event time. We find no evidence that the listing premium falls after 2001, even

for listed firms from countries with good investor protection.

    All of our evidence is consistent with the theory that there is a distinct governance benefit for firms

that list on the U.S. exchanges. This benefit is not shared by firms that list in the U.S. outside the

exchanges or in London. There is no evidence in our data that this benefit has weakened over time.

Table 2. New cross-listings and delistings: 1990 to 2005.
This Table shows the total number of new cross-listings and delistings, in either the U.S. or the U.K., each year from 1990 to 2005. The Table includes all cross-
listings in the U.S. and the U.K. in a given year. Information on cross-listings comes from a variety of sources described in Table 1. Firms can cross-list in the
U.S. via Rule 144a, over-the-counter as OTCBB or Pink Sheet issues, or on the AMEX, NASDAQ, or NYSE. Firms can cross-list in the U.K. via the Alternative
Investment Market (AIM), or on the Main Market via depositary receipts or an ordinary listing. All delistings are included in the counts, regardless of the reason
for delisting. If a firm upgrades from a Rule 144a or OTC listing to a U.S. exchange listing, the upgrade is counted as a new U.S. exchange listing and as a
delisting from the Rule 144a or OTC market.

Table 4. The type and frequency of delistings: 1990 to 2005.
This Table shows the number of delistings from U.S. stock exchanges (AMEX, NASDAQ, or the NYSE) and from the ordinary listings on the Main Market in
the U.K. over the period from 1990 to 2005. Information on cross-listings comes from a variety of sources described in Table 1. A delisting is classified as
“Voluntary” if a firm is in compliance with an exchange’s listing standards and voluntarily takes steps to delist its shares or depositary receipts. Firms are also
delisted when they are acquired and these cases are classified as “Merger / acquisition”. Finally, firms are delisted for other reasons, most often by the exchanges
when they fail to meet listing standards, when a firm is bankrupt, in financial distress, or undergoes restructuring. The first number for each category is the
number of delistings of that type. The second number is the number of delistings as a % of the total number of listings that year.

     Table 5. Characteristics of newly cross-listed firms.
     This Table compares the characteristics of firms with new cross-listings in a given year and firms that are not cross-listed over the period from 1990 to 2005.
     Firms can cross-list in the U.S. via Rule 144a, over-the-counter as OTCBB or Pink Sheet issues, or on the AMEX, NASDAQ, or NYSE. Firms can cross-list in
     the U.K. via the Alternative Investment Market (AIM), or on the Main Market via depositary receipts or an ordinary listing. Information on cross-listings comes
     from a variety of sources described in Table 1. In panels a and b, the sample includes all new cross-listings by non-U.S. firms that are in the Worldscope database
     in a given year. In panels c and d, the sample includes all new cross-listings by non-financial, non-U.S., non-U.K. firms that are in the Worldscope database and
     have total assets of at least $100 million (in 1990 dollars) in a given year. Firms from Bermuda and the Cayman Islands are excluded. The median value for a
     given characteristic is computed for firms with new cross-listings. For firms that are not cross-listed, the median is computed over all firm-year observations. For
     the common law dummy, the percentage of firms with new cross-listings from common law countries is reported. Tobin’s q is computed as ((Total Assets –
     Book Equity) + Market Value of Equity) / Total Assets (all variables are in local currency). Sales growth is inflation adjusted two-year sales growth (winsorized
     at 1% and 99% tails), global industry q is the median global industry q, total assets is in $ millions, adjusted for inflation, leverage is defined as total debt divided
     by total assets, and ownership is the data item “closely-held shares” from Worldscope. Common law is a dummy variable that equals one if a country’s legal
     origin is based on common law. Legal is anti-director × rule of law, from Djankov et al. (2006) and La Porta et al. (1998). Log of GNP per capita ($) and stock
     market capitalization to GDP are from the World Bank WDI Database. The tests at the bottom of each panel report p-values from Wilcoxon rank-sum tests,
     which test the hypothesis that two samples are from populations with the same distribution. In panels a and c, the characteristics of firms with new U.S. exchange
     listings are compared to the characteristics of firms with other new cross-listing types and with firms that are not cross-listed. In panels b and d, the
     characteristics of new cross-listings and firms that are not cross-listed are compared before and after SOX (the period from 1990 to 2001 vs. 2002 to 2005).

Table 6. Competing risks models of the determinants of the listing decision.
The Cox proportional hazard models estimate the probability of listing in the U.S. or in the U.K. in year t, given that the firm does not yet have a listing of that
type, over the period from 1991 to 2005. The sample includes all non-financial, non-U.S., non-U.K. firms that are in the Worldscope database and have total
assets of at least $100 million (in 1990 dollars) in a given year. Firms from Bermuda and the Cayman Islands are excluded. Information on cross-listings comes
from a variety of sources described in Table 1. Models (1) and (2) include all types of listings in New York and London, while Models (3) and (4) include only
exchange listings in New York and ordinary listings in London. Sales growth is inflation adjusted two-year sales growth (winsorized at 1% and 99% tails), global
industry q is the median global industry q, total assets is in $ millions, adjusted for inflation, leverage is defined as total debt divided by total assets, and
ownership is the data item “closely-held shares” from Worldscope. Legal is anti-director × rule of law, from Djankov et al. (2006) and La Porta et al. (1998). Log
of GNP per capita ($) and stock market capitalization to GDP are from the World Bank WDI Database. All independent variables are lagged by one year. The
hazard ratios for U.S. exchange listings and U.K. ordinary listings are estimated jointly, but are allowed to vary across outcomes and the baseline hazard for each
listing choice is assumed to be different. The model does not estimate a constant. The Table reports hazard ratios (i.e., exp(βx), not βx). The t-statistics test the
null hypothesis that the hazard ratio is equal to one. The t-statistics are adjusted for clustering on firms – they are computed assuming observations are
independent across firms, but not across time. The column, “Test” tests whether the hazard ratios for U.S. listings are different from U.K. listings. *, **, and ***
indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

Table 7. Logit regressions of the characteristics of exchange-listed firms.
This Table analyzes the characteristics of firms that cross-list on a U.S. stock exchange (Amex, NASDAQ, or the NYSE) and on the LSE (ordinary listings) over
the period from 1990 to 2005. The sample includes all non-financial, non-U.S., non-U.K. firms that are in the Worldscope database and have total assets of at
least $100 million (in 1990 dollars) in a given year. Firms from Bermuda and the Cayman Islands are excluded. Information on cross-listings comes from a
variety of sources described in Table 1. Firms with other types of cross-listings (Rule 144a or OTC in the U.S. and AIM or depositary receipts in the U.K.) are
excluded. Sales growth is inflation adjusted two-year sales growth (winsorized at 1% and 99% tails), global industry q is the median global industry q, total
assets is in $ millions, adjusted for inflation, leverage is defined as total debt divided by total assets, and ownership is the data item “closely-held shares” from
Worldscope. Legal is anti-director × rule of law, from Djankov et al. (2006) and La Porta et al. (1998). Log of GNP per capita ($) and stock market capitalization
to GDP are from the World Bank WDI Database. Each year from 1990 to 2005, a logit regression is estimated, where the dependent variable equals one if a firm
is cross-listed on a U.S. exchange (models 1-4) or on the LSE via an ordinary listing (models 5-8). The Table reports the average coefficients of the 16 logit
regressions (one for each year over 1990-2005). This Table also analyzes firms’ decisions to cross-list over the period from 1990 to 2001 (pre-SOX) and then
from 2002 to 2005 (post-SOX). The t-statistics, in parentheses, are calculated using the Fama-Macbeth approach from the time series of estimated logit
coefficients, adjusted for serial correlation (one lag). Pseudo-R2 is a goodness-of-fit measure based on the difference between unrestricted and restricted
likelihood functions. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

Table 8. The propensity to cross-list on major exchanges over time.
This Table examines whether the propensity to cross-list on a U.S. stock exchange (Amex, NASDAQ, or the NYSE) and on the LSE (ordinary listings) has
declined since 2001. The sample includes all non-financial, non-U.S., non-U.K. firms that are in the Worldscope database and have total assets of at least $100
million (in 1990 dollars) in a given year. Firms from Bermuda and the Cayman Islands are excluded. Information on cross-listings comes from a variety of
sources described in Table 1. Firms with other types of cross-listings (Rule 144a or OTC in the U.S. and AIM or depositary receipts in the U.K.) are excluded.
Each year from 1990 to 2001, a logit regression is estimated, where the dependent variable equals one if a firm is cross-listed on a U.S. exchange (Panel a) or on
the LSE via an ordinary listing (Panel b). In model (1), the explanatory variables are sales growth, global industry q, log of total assets, leverage, and ownership.
In model (2), the explanatory variables are legal, log of GNP, and stock market capitalization to GDP. Model (3) includes all explanatory variables. “Firms” is
the number of firms in the sample for a given year. “Listed” is the number of firms with a cross-listing in a given year. “Actual %” is the percent of firms with a
cross-listing. “Expected %” is computed by applying the average logit coefficients for 1990 to 2001 (Table 7) to the values of the explanatory variables for each
firm each year between 2002 and 2005, obtaining the predicted probability that a firm has a listing each year, summing the predicted probabilities over firms each
year, dividing by the number of firms, and multiplying by 100.

      Table 9. Regression analysis of the valuation of cross-listed firms: 1990 to 2005.
      Panel a presents the cross-sectional regression estimates of the valuation differential of cross-listing in the U.S. or in the U.K, each year from 1990 to 2005. The
      sample includes all non-financial, non-U.S., non-U.K. firms that are in the Worldscope database and have total assets of at least $100 million (in 1990 dollars) in
      a given year. Firms from Bermuda and the Cayman Islands are excluded. Information on cross-listings comes from a variety of sources described in Table 1. The
      dependent variable in each regression is Tobin’s q, computed as ((Total Assets – Book Equity) + Market Value of Equity) / Total Assets (all variables are in local
      currency). U.S. Rule 144a, U.S. OTC, U.S. Exchange, U.K. AIM, U.K. DR, and U.K. Ordinary are dummy variables that equal one if a firm has a cross-listing of
      that type in a given year. Cross-listing dummies of a given type are excluded if there are less than 10 listings in a year. Sales growth is inflation adjusted two-year
      sales growth (winsorized at 1% and 99% tails), global industry q is the median global industry q, and sales is in $ millions, adjusted for inflation. All regressions
      include country dummies (not reported). The t-statistics, in parentheses are adjusted for clustering on countries – they are computed assuming observations are
      independent across countries, but not within countries. t-statistics greater than 1.65, 1.96, and 2.55 are significant at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.
      Panel b presents results from panel data regressions. The regressions are estimated three ways: 1) Fama-Macbeth, 2) pooled OLS with the standard errors
      corrected for clustering on firms, and 3) with firm-fixed effects. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

Table 10. Valuation changes around cross-listings: 1990 to 2005.
This Table presents regression estimates of valuation changes around cross-listings in the U.S. or in the
U.K. that took place between 1990 to 2005 The sample includes all non-financial, non-U.S., non-U.K.
firms that are in the Worldscope database and have total assets of at least $100 million (in 1990 dollars) in
a given year or in the year of listing. Firms from Bermuda and the Cayman Islands are excluded.
Information on cross-listings comes from a variety of sources described in Table 1. For each type of cross-
listing (in the U.S., Rule 144a, OTC, or Exchange; in the U.K., Depositary receipt, or Ordinary listing), an
“event time” dummy variable is created, where year 0 is the cross-listing year for a given firm. The dummy
variable, “> 3 years before listing” equals one for years prior to year -3 and is zero in all other years; “3
years before listing” equals one in year -3; “2 years before listing” equals one in year -2, etc. Panel a shows
the counts for each dummy variable by type of cross-listing. Panel b shows the regression results. The
dependent variable in each regression is Tobin’s q, computed as ((Total Assets – Book Equity) + Market
Value of Equity) / Total Assets (all variables are in local currency). Sales growth is inflation adjusted two-
year sales growth (winsorized at 1% and 99% tails), global industry q is the median global industry q, and
sales is in $ millions, inflation adjusted. Each regression includes country and year dummies (not reported).
The t-statistics, in parentheses are adjusted for clustering on firms – they are computed assuming
observations are independent across firms, but not across time for each firm. F-test 1 tests the hypothesis
that the coefficient on the dummy for “3 years after listings” is equal to the coefficient on the dummy for “3
years before listing”. F-test 2 tests the hypothesis that the coefficient on the dummy for “>3 years after
listings is equal to the coefficient on the dummy for “>3 years before listing”. *, **, and *** indicate
statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

Table 11. The cross-listing valuation premium before and after Sarbanes-Oxley.
This Table presents results from panel data regressions that estimate the valuation differential of cross-listing
in the U.S. before and after Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX). The period before SOX is 1990 to 2001 and the period
after SOX is 2002 to 2005. In model (1), the sample includes all non-financial, non-U.S. firms that are in the
Worldscope database and have total assets of at least $100 million (in 1990 dollars) in a given year. Firms
from Bermuda and the Cayman Islands are excluded. In model (2), U.K. firms are also excluded. Information
on cross-listings comes from a variety of sources described in Table 1. The dependent variable in each
regression is Tobin’s q, computed as ((Total Assets – Book Equity) + Market Value of Equity) / Total Assets
(all variables are in local currency). U.S. Rule 144a, U.S. OTC, and U.S. Exchange are dummy variables that
equal one if a firm has a cross-listing of that type in a given year. Post SOX equals 1 during 2002 to 2005.
Models (3) and (4) repeat the same regressions as in (1) and (2), except they add the variable, “U.S. exchange
× Post SOX × Low legal”, where Low legal is a dummy variable that equals one for firms from countries with
below-median scores on legal and zero otherwise. Sales growth is inflation adjusted two-year sales growth
(winsorized at 1% and 99% tails), global industry q is the median global industry q, and sales is in $ millions.
The regressions are estimated by pooled OLS and the t-statistics are adjusted for clustering on firms – they
are computed assuming observations are independent across firms, but not across time for each firm. *, **,
and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

Table 12. Capital raising activity before and after cross-listing.
This Table reports capital-raising activity from 1993-2002 by firms that cross-listed on U.S. exchanges or on the Main Market in the U.K. (as DRs or ordinary
listings) within three years before and after the cross-listing date. It reports the number of cross-listing firms that raise capital by means of public and private
issues, the aggregate quantity (in U.S. dollar millions) as well as the component activity (with percentage of total) taking place in the U.S. markets, the U.K.
markets, the home market in which the firm is domiciled, and other markets. The “Before” (“After”) period presents all capital raising in the three year period
before (after) the cross-listing. The “after” period also includes capital raised during the cross-listing event itself. The sample includes all non-financial, non-U.S.,
non-U.K. firms that are in the Worldscope database with total assets of at least $100 million (in 1990 dollars) in a given year. Firms from Bermuda and the
Cayman Islands are excluded. Capital raising data is obtained from SDC and is supplemented with data from the LSE. t-statistics are computed to test the
differences in before/after means. *, **, and *** indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.
