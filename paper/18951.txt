                                              ABSTRACT

The price of crude oil in the U.S. never exceeded $40 per barrel until mid-2004. By 2006 it reached
$70, and in July 2008 it peaked at $145. By late 2008 it had plummeted to about $30 before increasing
to $110 in 2011. Are speculators at least partly to blame for these sharp price changes? We clarify
the effects of speculators on commodity prices. We focus on crude oil, but our approach can be applied
to other commodities. We explain the meaning of "oil price speculation," how it can occur, and how
it relates to investments in oil reserves, inventories, or derivatives (such as futures contracts). Turning
to the data, we calculate counterfactual prices that would have occurred from 1999 to 2012 in the absence
of speculation. Our framework is based on a simple and transparent model of supply and demand in
the cash and storage markets for a commodity. It lets us determine whether speculation is consistent
with data on production, consumption, inventory changes, and convenience yields given reasonable
elasticity assumptions. We show speculation had little, if any, effect on prices and volatility.

Commodities have become an investment class: declines in their prices may simply reflect
the whims of speculators.
                                     The Economist, June 23, 2012.

Tens of billions of dollars went into the nation’s energy commodity markets in the past few
years, earmarked to buy oil futures contracts. Institutional and hedge funds are investing
increasingly in oil, which has prompted President Obama and others to call for curbs on oil
speculation.
                                          The New York Times, September 4, 2012.
Federal legislation should bar pure oil speculators entirely from commodity exchanges in the
United States.
                                      Joseph Kennedy II, New York Times, April, 10, 2012.


1     Introduction.
The price of crude oil in the U.S. had never exceeded $40 per barrel until mid-2004. By 2006
it reached $70 and in July 2008 it peaked at $145. As shown in Figure 1, by the end of 2008
it had plummeted to about $30 before increasing to $110 in 2011. What caused these sharp
changes in oil prices since 2004? Were they due to fundamental shifts in supply and demand,
or are “speculators” at least partly to blame? This question is important: the wide-spread
claim that speculators caused price increases has been the basis for attempts to limit—or
even shut down—trading in oil futures and other commodity-based derivatives.
    Other commodities also experienced large price swings, as shown in Figure 2. On several
occasions during the past decade the prices of industrial metals such as copper, aluminum,
and zinc more than doubled in just a few months, often followed by sharp declines. And as
the figure suggests, price changes across commodities tend to be correlated; the correlation
coefficients for crude oil and aluminum, copper, gold, and tin range from .74 to .89 in levels,
and .52 to .71 in monthly first differences. Should we infer from the volatility of commodity
prices—and their correlations—that commodities have indeed “become an investment class?”
Or might commodity prices have been driven by common demand shocks, e.g., increases in
demand from China and other developing countries?
    The claim that speculators are to blame and futures trading should be limited is well
exemplified by a recent Op-Ed piece in the New York Times by Joseph P. Kennedy II. He
wrote that “the drastic rise in the price of oil and gasoline” is at least partly attributable

                                              1
to “the effect of pure speculators—investors who buy and sell oil futures but never take
physical possession of actual barrels of oil.” He argues that “Federal legislation should bar
pure oil speculators entirely from commodity exchanges in the United States. And the United
States should use its clout to get European and Asian markets to follow its lead, chasing oil
speculators from the world’s commodity markets.”
   Was Kennedy on to something? Unfortunately there is considerable confusion—even
among economists—over commodity price speculation and how it works. Even identify-
ing speculators, as opposed to investors or firms hedging risk, is not simple. Claiming, as
Kennedy did, that anyone who buys or sells futures but does not take possession of the com-
modity is a “pure speculator” is nonsensical. Hardly any person, firm, or other entity that
buys or sells futures contracts ever takes possession of the commodity, and we know that a
substantial fraction of futures are held by producers and industrial consumers to hedge risk.
   This paper attempts to clarify the potential and actual effects of speculators, and investors
in general, on the prices of storable commodities. We focus on the price of crude oil because it
has received the most attention as the subject of speculation. More than other commodities,
sharp increases in oil prices are often blamed, at least in part, on speculators. (Interestingly,
speculators are rarely blamed for sharp decreases in oil prices.) But our theoretical and
empirical approach can be applied equally well to other commodities.
   We begin by addressing what is meant by “oil price speculation,” and how it relates to
investment in oil reserves, inventories, or derivatives (such as futures contracts). Given that
oil price speculation is just an investment designed to pay off if the price of oil goes up (or
alternatively, if it goes down), we outline the ways in which one could engage in speculation.
What kind of instruments are available for speculation, and how costly and effective are
they? Most importantly, how can these various forms of price speculation affect the current
price of oil? We clarify the mechanisms by which speculators (and investors) affect oil prices,
production, and inventories, and thereby provide a “simple” explanation of the economics
of price speculation. Finally, we turn to the data, and answer the questions raised in the
first paragraph: What role did speculation have in the sharp changes in oil prices that have
occurred since 2004?
   Other researchers have also investigated the causes of oil price changes and the possible

                                               2
role of speculation. Fattouh et al. (forthcoming) summarize the literature; we briefly mention
the most relevant papers here. Kilian and Murphy (forthcoming) note (as we do) a connection
between speculative activity and inventory changes, and estimate a vector-autoregressive
(VAR) model that includes inventory data to identify the “asset price component” of the
real price of oil.1 They find no evidence that speculation increased prices. But Juvenal and
Petrella (2011) estimate an alternative VAR model, also using inventory data, and conclude
that “speculation played a significant role in the oil price increase between 2004 and 2008
and its subsequent collapse.” Hamilton (2009a,b) provide an overview of possible causes of
oil price changes and conclude that speculation played some role in the price increase in the
summer of 2008. Smith (2009) does not find any evidence that speculation increased prices
between 2004 and 2008 noting that inventories were drawn down during this time and there
was no evidence that non-OPEC producers reduced output.2
       Our framework is based on a simple and transparent model of supply and demand in the
cash and storage markets for a commodity. Using that model, we can determine whether
speculation as the driver of price changes is consistent with the data on production, consump-
tion, inventory changes, and spot and futures prices, given reasonable assumptions about
elasticities of supply and demand. We believe that the simplicity of our approach makes our
results quite convincing.
       We show that although we cannot rule out that speculation had any effect on oil prices,
we can indeed rule out speculation as an explanation for the sharp changes in prices since
2004. Unless one believes that the price elasticities of both oil supply and demand are close
to zero, the behavior of inventories and futures-spot spreads are simply inconsistent with the
view that speculation was a significant driver of spot prices. Across our sample, speculation
decreased prices on average or left them essentially unchanged, and reduced peak prices by
roughly 5 percent. When we focus on four specific periods of price run-ups, we find that
speculation may have decreased prices by about 1.4 percent on average.
   1
       Kilian (2009) uses a VAR model to distinguish between demand- and supply-side shocks to fundamentals.
   2
    In a more dynamic model, inventories may be drawn down in the presence of speculation on net, if
shocks to the market would have led to increases in inventories in the absence of speculation. Pirrong (2008)
and Kilian and Murphy (forthcoming) make this point.



                                                      3
    In the next section we clarify the meaning of speculation (versus “investment”), and
discuss the ways in which speculation can occur. We note that the simplest and lowest-
cost way to speculate on the price of a commodity is to buy or sell futures contracts. In
Section 3 we lay out a simple analytical framework that connects production, consumption,
inventories, and spot and futures prices. Sections 4 and 5 show how this framework can be
used to distinguish the effects of speculation from the effects of shifts in the fundamental
drivers of supply and demand. In Section 6 we present our empirical results, and show that
there is no evidence that speculation contributed to the observed sharp increases in oil prices.
If anything, speculation slightly reduced oil price volatility.


2     Some Basics.
We begin with two basic issues. First, what is meant by “oil price speculation,” and how
does it differ from a hedging operation or an investment to diversify a portfolio? Second,
how can one speculate on oil prices? The answers to these questions provide a foundation
for an economic analysis of speculation and its effects on production, inventories, and prices.

2.1    What is Meant by “Oil Price Speculation?”

We define oil price speculation as the purchase (or sale) of an oil-related asset with the
expectation that the price of the asset will rise (or fall) to create the opportunity for a capital
gain. A variety of oil-related assets are available as instruments for speculation; oil futures,
shares of oil companies, and oil reserves are examples. Thus a speculator might take a long
position in oil futures because she believes the price is more likely to rise than fall, and hopes
to “beat the market.” (But note that for every long futures position there is an off-setting
short position, held by someone betting that the price is more likely to fall.)
    In principle, speculation differs from an oil-related investment, which we define as the
purchase or sale of an asset such that the expected net present value (NPV) of the transaction
is positive. One example of such an investment is the purchase or sale of oil futures (or other
derivatives) not to “beat the market” but instead to hedge against price fluctuations that,
if large enough, could lead to bankruptcy. A second example is the purchase of oil-related


                                                4
financial assets, such as futures or oil company shares, to diversify a portfolio.3 Still another
example is the accumulation of oil inventories by producers or industrial consumers of oil as
a way to facilitate deliveries and reduce the risk of stock-outs.
       As a practical matter, it is often difficult or impossible to empirically differentiate between
a speculative activity and an investment. For example, mutual funds, hedge funds, and other
institutions often hold futures positions as well as oil company shares, and might do so to
make a “naked” (unhedged) bet on future prices, or instead to diversify or to hedge against
other oil-related risks. Sometimes it is possible to clearly identify a hedging activity, but
more often it is not. So in most cases, what we call an “investment” and what we call
“speculation” are likely to be the same thing, or at best ambiguous. Thus when we examine
the impact of, e.g., purchases of futures contracts, we will not be concerned about whether
the purchase represents an investment or pure speculation.
       Although we will not try to distinguish among motivations for purchases of oil-related
financial assets, we can be clear about what speculation is not: a shift in fundamentals.
This could include a shift in consumption demand (e.g., a short-term shift resulting from
unusually cold weather, or a long-term shift resulting from increased use of oil in China) or
a shift in supply (e.g., because of a strike or hurricane that shuts down some output). A
shift in fundamentals can certainly cause a change in price, and we want to distinguish that
from a price change caused by speculators or investors.
       We must also be clear about what price or prices we are referring to. When speculation
is blamed for pushing oil prices up or down, it is usually the spot price that is being referred
to; i.e., the price for immediate delivery. By contrast, the futures price is the market price
of a futures contract for oil to be delivered at some future point in time. When speculators
(or investors) buy and sell futures contracts, the futures price may change, and we want to
know whether and how much that change can affect the spot price.
   3
    Note that in this example the expected return on the asset would account for systematic risk and thus
would equal the opportunity cost of capital, making the expected NPV of the investment just zero. However,
by helping to diversify the portfolio, purchasing the asset would reduce the portfolio’s risk.

2.2     How to Speculate on Oil Prices.

There are several methods by which an individual or firm could speculate on the price of
oil. As we will see, some methods are more feasible and less costly than others. We will also
explain what each method would do to oil prices, production, and inventories.
   The claim that speculation is to blame for changes in the price of oil is usually made when
the price has been rising, not falling. But of course one could speculate in either direction.
In fact, market equilibrium requires an equal number of “long” bettors (those betting the
price will rise) and “short” bettors. For simplicity (and in keeping with the popular press),
we will focus on the “long” side, i.e., on speculating that oil prices will rise.
   Buy Stocks of Oil Companies. Holding oil company shares is a common way to
speculate (or invest) in oil, even though it is not what most critics have in mind when they
call for a ban on speculation. A speculator or investor can focus on companies that are largely
in exploration and production, companies that hold large reserves, or integrated companies.
This is, of course, what many mutual funds, hedge funds, and individual investors do.
   Suppose speculators become “bullish” and buy oil company stocks. What would this
do to the price of oil? In the short run (less than a year or two), it would have no effect
on oil production or consumption and thus no effect on price. In the longer run, to the
extent that oil companies’ stock prices are higher than they would be otherwise, it would
lower the companies’ cost of capital. This would encourage investment in exploration and
development, and eventually lead to more production and lower prices. But this impact on
prices would take several years, and certainly cannot explain the sharp price changes since
2004.
   Hold Physical Oil in situ. An owner of in-ground oil reserves can speculate on higher
prices by keeping the oil in the ground rather than producing it. Clearly this is something
oil companies can do, but not hedge funds or individuals. How easily an oil company can
speculate this way depends on whether the reserves are undeveloped or developed.
   Undeveloped reserves have been discovered and are owned by the oil company, but the oil
cannot be produced until large sunk cost investments in development are made. Normally,
development (construction of production wells, offshore platforms, etc.) takes at least a


                                                6
year or two. Thus an oil company that wants to “bet” on higher prices could simply delay
development. There could be (and usually are) other reasons for delaying development, e.g.,
the reserve’s option value.4 Although it is unlikely oil companies would do this, in principle
it is a feasible way to “bet” on higher prices.
    What would happen to oil markets if companies actually did this? Suppose that around
2004 or 2005, oil companies “bet” on prices rising by withholding development of undeveloped
reserves. This would indeed imply lower production levels and higher prices—but only after
at least one or two years had passed, given the time to develop a reserve. How would we
identify this kind of activity? Normally rising oil prices increase the return from development,
and lead to rising rig rental rates and rig utilization. If rig rates and utilization were instead
falling, this would provide some evidence that companies were holding back on development.
We examine this possibility later in the paper.
    Developed reserves have the production wells, pipelines, platforms, and other infrastruc-
ture needed to produce oil. However, once a reserve is developed and production begins, the
rate of production cannot be easily varied. Production usually follows a decline path largely
determined by the internal pressure and other physical characteristics of the reserve, the size
of the wells, etc. Reducing or temporarily stopping production from a fully developed reserve
can reduce the total quantity of oil that can potentially be produced, and thus is usually not
an economical option. Nonetheless, we will examine whether production has fallen below
trend during periods of suspected speculation.
    Hold Physical Oil Above Ground. Producers and consumers of oil normally hold
inventories, for a number of reasons. Producers hold them to facilitate production and
delivery scheduling and avoid stockouts, and industrial consumers hold them for the same
reasons. In principle, however, inventories could also be held to speculate: if you think the
price will rise sharply, you could buy oil and store it in tanks.
    This form of speculation generally not feasible for hedge funds, mutual funds, or indi-
   4
     An undeveloped reserve gives the owner an option to develop the reserve, the exercise price for which is
the cost of development. If there is considerable uncertainty over future oil prices, the option value will be
high, so that there is an incentive to keep the option open by delaying development. Paddock et al. (1988)
were among the first to calculate the option value of an undeveloped reserve. See Dixit and Pindyck (1994)
for a discussion of “real options,” including a treatment of the option to develop an oil reserve.



                                                      7
vidual investors. In principle oil companies could speculate this way if sufficient storage
capacity is available. Were oil companies (or industrial consumers) accumulating “excess”
inventories during periods of suspected speculation? Here, “excess” means that barring a
speculative motive, the marginal unit of inventory is worth less than would normally be the
case. We show how to test for this possibility using futures price data.
    Hold Oil Futures. This is the easiest, lowest cost, and most common way to speculate
on oil prices. One would hold a long (short) futures position to speculate on prices going up
(down). (Note every long position must be matched by a short position.) Holding futures
involves very low transaction costs, even for an individual investor. This is an important
means of investment for hedge funds, some ETFs, mutual funds, and also individuals. It is
also the most common explanation for how oil price speculation takes place, and is usually
the focus of those who criticize the activities of speculators (and investors).
    If more people want to go long than short at the current futures price, the futures price
will rise. What would that do to the spot price, which is the price we care about? In principle
it could push the spot price up, but only under certain conditions. Since the use of futures
contracts is the most important means of speculation, we need to look at it in detail.
    Hold Other Oil Derivatives. A futures contract is itself a derivative, but other deriva-
tives could be used to speculate, e.g., call or put options on futures prices. Buying or selling
such derivatives is common for hedge funds, and is easy and relatively low-cost. There are
also more complex derivatives sometimes held by hedge funds; their impact on oil prices is
closely related to the impact of futures contracts, so we will ignore the considerable variety
of derivatives and focus below on futures.


3     Analytical Framework.
For any storable commodity subject to stochastic fluctuations in production and/or con-
sumption, producers, consumers, and possibly third parties will hold inventories. Producers
hold them to facilitate production and delivery scheduling and avoid stock-outs. If marginal
production costs are increasing with output and demand is fluctuating, producers can reduce
their costs over time by selling out of inventory during high-demand periods, and replen-


                                               8
ishing inventories during low-demand periods. Industrial consumers also hold inventories,
to reduce adjustment costs, facilitate production (i.e., when the commodity is a production
input), and avoid stock-outs.
       Thus there are two interrelated markets for a commodity: the cash market for immediate,
or “spot,” purchase and sale, and the storage market for inventories. Although the price of
storage is not directly observed, it can be determined from the spread between futures and
spot prices. As with any good or service sold in a competitive market, the price of storage
is equal to the marginal value of storage, i.e., the flow of benefits to inventory holders from
a marginal unit of inventory, and is termed the marginal convenience yield. In what follows,
we present a framework that describes the cash market, the market for storage, and the
futures-spot spread.5 We will then use this framework to show how speculative activity
in the futures market—as well as fundamental shifts in supply or demand—can affect spot
prices, inventories, and convenience yield.

3.1        The Cash Market.

In the cash market, purchases and sales for immediate delivery occur at a price that we will
refer to as the “spot price.”6 Because inventory holdings can change, the spot price does not
equate production (which might include imports) and consumption (which might include
exports). Instead, the spot price determines “net demand,” i.e., the difference between
production and consumption. To see this, note that demand in the cash market is a function
of the spot price, other variables such as the weather and aggregate income, and random
shocks reflecting unpredictable changes in tastes and technologies. Because of these shocks
and the fact that some of the variables affecting demand (such as the weather) are partly
unpredictable, demand will fluctuate unpredictably. We therefore write demand in the cash
market as Q = Q(P ; z1 , 1 ), where P is the spot price, z1 is a vector of demand-shifting

   5
       This framework is presented in more detail in Pindyck (2001).
   6
     The spot price is a price for immediate delivery at a specific location of a specific grade of oil, where the
location and grade are usually specified in a corresponding futures contract. In contrast, the “cash price”
refers to an average transaction price, usually averaged over a week or a month, and that might include
discounts or premiums resulting from relationships between buyers and sellers. We will ignore this difference
for now, and use “spot price” and “cash price” interchangeably.



                                                        9
variables, and 1 is a random shock.
   Supply in the cash market is also a function of the spot price, a set of (partly unpre-
dictable) variables affecting the cost of production (e.g, wage rates and capital costs), and
random shocks reflecting unpredictable changes in operating efficiency, strikes, etc. Thus
supply also shifts unpredictably, and can be written as X = X(P ; z2 , 2 ), where z2 is a
vector of supply-shifting variables, and 2 is a random shock.
   Letting Nt denote the inventory level, the change in inventories is just:

                             ∆Nt = X(Pt ; z2t , 2t ) − Q(Pt ; z1t , 1t ) .              (1)

We will refer to ∆Nt as net demand, i.e., the demand for production in excess of consumption.
Thus eqn. (1) says that the cash market is in equilibrium when net demand equals net supply.
We can rewrite eqn. (1) in terms of the following inverse net demand function:

                                     Pt = f (∆Nt ; z1t , z2t , t ) .                     (2)

Market clearing in the cash market is therefore a relationship between the spot price and
the change in inventories.
   Because ∂X/∂P > 0 and ∂Q/∂P < 0, f (∆Nt ; z1t , z2t , t ) is upward sloping in ∆N .
This is illustrated by the left panel of Figure 3, where f1 (∆N ) is the inverse net demand
function for some initial set of values for z1 and z2 , and f2 (∆N ) is the inverse net demand
function following an increase in the demand for the commodity (i.e., an increase in z1 ), or
a decrease in supply (i.e., a decrease in z2 ). Note that this upward shift in the inverse net
demand function represents a structural—as opposed to speculative—change in the market.
For crude oil, it might occur because of an increase in Chinese demand, or a strike or similar
disruption that reduces supply. In Figure 3, we assume that this upward shift is permanent.

3.2    The Market for Storage.

At any instant of time, the supply of storage is simply the total quantity of inventories held
by producers, consumers, or third parties, i.e., Nt . In equilibrium, this quantity must equal
the quantity demanded, which is a function of price. The price of storage is the implicit
“payment” for the privilege of holding a unit of inventory. As with any good or service sold

                                                   10
in a competitive market, if the price lies on the demand curve, it is equal to the marginal
value of the good or service, i.e., the utility from consuming a marginal unit. In this case,
the marginal value is the value of the flow of services accruing from holding the marginal
unit of inventory, and is referred to as marginal convenience yield. We denote the price of
storage (marginal convenience yield) by ψt , and write the demand for storage as N (ψ).
       The storage market is illustrated by the right-hand panel of Figure 3, where N1 is the
supply of storage and ψ1 is the corresponding price (convenience yield). Note that the
marginal value of storage is small when the total stock of inventories is large, because in
that case an extra unit of inventory will be of little value, but it rises sharply when the total
stock becomes small. Thus N 0 (ψ) < 0 and N 00 (ψ) > 0.
       In addition to the price ψ, the demand for storage will depend on other variables. For
example, it will depend on expected future rates of consumption or production; if a seasonal
increase in demand is expected, the demand for storage will increase because producers will
want greater inventories to avoid sharp increases in production cost and to make timely
deliveries. The demand for storage also depends on the spot price of the commodity (one
would pay more to store a higher-priced good than a lower-priced one); and on the volatility
of price (greater volatility increases the demand for storage by making scheduling and stock-
out avoidance more costly).7 Letting z3 denote these demand-shifting variables and including
a random shock, we can write the inverse demand function as:

                                            ψ = g(N ; z3 , 3 ) .                                         (3)

       Suppose oil supply and demand become more volatile, e.g., because of increased volatility
of GDP or weather conditions. Then the demand for storage curve on the right-hand side
of Figure 3 will shift upwards, so that if that supply of storage remains fixed at N1 , the
price (convenience yield) ψ will increase. The demand for storage curve could also shift for
reasons related to speculation, as we explain later.

    Pindyck (2004) estimates the impact of changes in volatility on inventories and price for crude oil,
heating oil, and gasoline. In related work, Alquist and Kilian (2010) developed a theoretical model that links
volatility (and uncertainty over future supply shortfalls) to spot prices, futures prices, and inventories.

3.3       Spot Price, Futures Price, and Convenience Yield.

Because speculative activity most commonly occurs via the futures market, it is important
to understand how the futures price can affect the spot price. A futures contract is an
agreement to deliver a specified quantity of a commodity at a specified future date, at a
price (the futures price) to be paid at the time of delivery. Futures contracts are usually
traded on organized exchanges, and as a result tend to be more liquid than forward contracts,
which are also agreements to deliver a specified quantity of a commodity at a specified future
date, at a price (the forward price). A futures contract differs from a forward contract only
in that the futures contract is “marked to market,” which means there is a settlement and
corresponding transfer of funds at the end of each trading day.
       It is not necessary to take delivery on a futures (or forward) contract; in fact, the vast
majority of contracts are “closed out” or “rolled over” before the delivery date, so the
commodity does not change hands. The reason is that these contracts are usually held for
hedging, investment, or speculation, so there would be no reason to take delivery.
       Once we know the spot price at time t and the futures price for delivery at time t + T ,
we can determine the convenience yield. Let ψt,T denote the (capitalized) flow of marginal
convenience yield from holding a unit of inventory over the period t to t + T . To avoid
arbitrage, ψt,T must satisfy:

                                     ψt,T = (1 + rT )Pt − Ft,T + kT ,                                        (4)

where Pt is the spot price at time t, Ft,T is the futures price for delivery at t + T , rT is the
risk-free T -period interest rate, and kT is the T -period per-unit cost of physical storage.8
       We will be interested in how changes in the futures price affect the spot price, so it is
useful to rewrite eqn. (4) with the spot price on the left-hand side:
                                               1
                                     Pt =          [Ft,T + ψt,T − kT ] .                                     (5)
                                            1 + rT
   8
     To see why eqn. (4) must hold, note that the (stochastic) return from holding a unit of the commodity
from t to t + T is ψt,T + (Pt+T − Pt ) − kT , i.e., the convenience yield (like a dividend) plus the capital gain
minus the physical storage cost. If one also shorts a futures contract at time t, which would yield a return
Ft,T FT,T = Ft,T Pt+T , one would receive a total return over the period of ψt,T + Ft,T − Pt − kT . The futures
contract requres no outlay and this total return is non-stochastic, so it must equal the risk-free rate times
the cash outlay for the commodity, i.e., rT Pt , from which eqn. (4) follows.

                                                       12
Thus an increase in Ft,T will lead to an increase in Pt —unless there is a equivalent decrease
in ψt,T and/or increase in kT . The drop in ψt,T could occur if Nt increases. But what if
Nt increases to the point that there is almost no more storage capacity? Then kT would
increase sharply, again limiting the impact of the higher futures price on the spot price.
   As we will see, an increase in the futures price can lead to an increase in the spot price
of a commodity, but any impact will be limited by activity in the market for storage. In
addition, we can look to the storage market (i.e., the behavior of inventories and convenience
yield) to determine whether changes in the spot price are due more to structural shifts in
demand and supply, or instead to speculative activity in the futures market.

3.4    Example: Permanent versus Seasonal Shifts in Demand.

The interaction of the cash and storage markets can be seen in Figures 3 and 4, which
illustrate the impact of an upward shift in demand. In Figure 3, the shift in demand is
expected to be—and is—permanent, e.g., a permanent increase in oil Chinese oil demand.
The net demand curve shifts up and the spot price increases from P1 to P2 . The demand
for storage curve remains fixed, and assuming the shift in the net demand curve occurs
slowly, there would be no reason for producers or consumers of oil to change their inventory
holdings, so the total inventory level remains fixed at N1 .
   Figure 4 illustrates an anticipated shift in demand that is expected to be—and is—
temporary. For example, this could be a seasonal increase in the demand for oil. Because
the increase is anticipated, inventories are accumulated ahead of time (so that N increases
from N1 to N2 ), and the spot price increases (from P1 to P2 ) before there is any shift in the
net demand curve. When the net demand curve does shift up, inventories are drawn back
down, as producers and consumers anticipate that net demand will shift down again. Thus
the spot price stays at or near P2 , rather than rising to P3 , the level that would have been
reached had there been no changes in inventories. Finally, the net demand curve shifts back
down and the spot price returns to P1 .
   Note that the spot price changes illustrated in Figures 3 and 4 and the inventory changes
in Figure 4 are the result of structural shifts in the cash market for oil, as opposed to
speculation. In the next section we examine the impact of speculative activity.

                                              13
4         The Impact of Speculation.
We focus mostly on futures contracts as the instrument of speculation. They are easily used,
and they receive the most attention from those claiming that price changes are caused by
speculators. However, we will also consider what happens if producers and/or consumers of
the commodity accumulate inventories for speculative purposes.

4.1        Speculation via the Futures Market.

Suppose speculators buy futures, driving up the futures price Ft,T . What will this do to
the spot price, inventories, and convenience yield? We will assume that demand and supply
are moderately price elastic, so that the net demand curve slopes up, but not sharply, as
illustrated in Figure 5. Although speculators have pushed up the futures price, there is no
shift in net demand f (∆N ) because there has been no change in the fundamentals driving
demand and supply. Nor will there be any shift in the demand for storage.9
        From eqn. (5) we know that equilibrium in the spot and futures markets requires a
reduction in ψ(N ) and/or an increase in the spot price. Given that Ft,T is now high relative
to Pt , the payoff from holding inventories is large, so inventories will increase. Thus ∆N > 0,
and as shown in Figure 5, the spot price increases from P1 to P2 . Eventually inventories
reach N2 and convenience yield falls from ψ1 to ψ2 . At that point, with no further inventory
buildup, ∆N falls to zero and the spot price must fall to its original level, P1 . This can be
consistent with a higher futures price because ψ2 < ψ1 , so the futures price can remain high
even though the spot price falls to where it started.
        As the futures contracts reach expiration, the futures price must approach the spot price
(and at expiration must equal the spot price). If speculators remain optimistic about prices,
they might “roll over” their contracts, i.e., sell the near-term futures and buy longer-term
futures. In that case inventories will remain at N2 and the convenience yield will remain
at ψ2 , keeping the spot price at P1 . But it is likely that speculative buying of futures will
    9
    Sockin and Xiong (2013) show that theoretically an increase in the futures price could signal (correctly
or incorrectly) an increase in global economic activity, which could cause an increase in demand for the
commodity, shifting f (∆N ) upwards. We are not aware of evidence that this effect is empirically important,
so we ignore it here.



                                                    14
eventually diminish, so that the futures price falls, reducing the expected payoff from holding
inventories. Inventories are then sold off, pushing the spot price down (to P3 in Figure 5).
Eventually inventories fall back to N1 and convenience yield increases to ψ1 , at which point
∆N approaches zero, and the spot price returns to its original level, P1 .
   How does this speculative scenario differ from what we would observe with the funda-
mental shifts illustrated in Figures 3 and 4? In Figure 3 there is an increase in the spot price,
but no change in inventories or convenience yield. In Figure 4 there is a temporary increase
in the spot price and the inventory level, but those changes follow seasonal patterns. Thus
if we deseasonalized the data we would observe no change in either the price or inventories.
The situation in Figure 5 is quite different. First, the increase in the spot price requires a
large increase in inventories, and the spot price would fall back to its original level once the
inventory buildup stopped. Second, as speculative buying of futures slowed or reversed, the
spot price would fall below its original level, as inventories fall back to N1 . Third, there
would be no seasonal pattern in either price or inventories.
   Note that if demand and supply are very price-inelastic, the impact of speculative buying
of futures on the spot price can be larger. In this case the net demand curve f (∆N ) will be
much steeper, so a small ∆N will be sufficient to cause the spot price to rise considerably.
Then inventories will increase only slowly and the higher spot price can be sustained longer.
But even if speculation is sufficient to keep inventories at the higher level, once inventories
stop growing the price will have to return to its original level.

4.2    Correct and Incorrect Predictions of Shocks to Fundamentals.

Speculation is often based on beliefs about price changes, rather than a blind gamble. Those
beliefs may or may not turn out to be correct. Suppose speculators buy futures because they
believe there will be a change in fundamentals, namely a supply or demand shock that will
cause an increase in price. How would this affect the spot price and inventories?
   Figure 6 illustrates what happens when speculators correctly anticipate an upward shift
in the the net demand curve. Speculators buy futures before the shift occurs, pushing up
the futures price. This leads to an increase in inventories (from N1 to N2 ) and an increase in
the spot price (from P1 to P3 ). Later the net demand curve shifts up, speculators sell their

                                               15
futures, the futures price falls relative to the (now higher) spot price, so inventories decline
back to their original level, and the price declines. Eventually the inventory sell-off stops
and the spot price settles at its new equilibrium level (P2 in the diagram).
   Figure 7 illustrates what happens when speculators incorrectly expect a shift in net
demand. Once again they buy futures and inventories increase as the price increases (from
P1 to P2 ). But the inventory build-up eventually stops as the price falls to its original level.
Inventories are then sold off, pushing the price down (to P3 < P1 ). Finally the inventory
sell-off ends as both inventories and the spot price return to their original levels.

4.3    Speculative Inventory Holdings.

In principle, oil companies (and some oil consumers) could speculate by accumulating above-
ground inventories. This would cause an upward shift in the demand for storage curve
because there would be a speculative benefit from holding inventories in addition to the
usual benefits of stock-out avoidance, etc.
   Suppose oil companies (or individuals with very large bathtubs) accumulate inventories
as a speculative bet on rising prices. As Figure 8 shows, the demand for storage curves shifts
upward. Assuming no change in holdings of futures contracts, as inventories increase (from
N1 to N2 ), eqns. (2) and (4) imply that the spot price will increase (from P1 to P2 ) because
∆Nt > 0, and therefore the convenience yield must increase (to ψ2 ). In the figure, inventories
peak at N3 , and as ∆Nt drops to zero, the spot price returns to P1 and the convenience yield
returns to ψ1 .
   If the high inventory level N3 is maintained, there will be no further changes in Pt or ψt .
If, on the other hand, this speculative episode ends with companies selling off part of their
inventories, Pt and ψt will fall (to P3 and ψ3 in Figure 8) as inventories decline. Eventually
the inventory sell-off ends as Nt returns to N1 , and both price and convenience yield return
to their original levels. Depending on when they bought and sold, some speculators may
have made or lost money. But on average speculators will have lost, because they will have
incurred additional costs of physical storage.

4.4    The Limitations of Speculative Effects for Oil.

During the last decade we have seen very large movements in the spot price of oil. For
example, from 2007 to 2008, the spot price of WTI crude more than doubled, from about
$60 per barrel to about $130. Could this have been the result of speculation? In other words,
could this price change have occurred with no shift in the net demand curve, as in Figure 5?
One way to answer this question—using data only on the cash market—is by calculating the
change in inventories that would have had to occur as a result.
   To do this, we write an equation for net demand and calibrate it to data for 2007, applying
alternative estimates of supply and demand elasticities. We will assume that supply and
demand are isoelastic, and that supply includes imports. Then supply is given by X = kS P ηS
and demand is Q = kD P ηD . We can express the change in inventories as:

                                   ∆Nt = kS PtηS − kD PtηD .                                (6)

We use one month as our time unit, and calibrate to a total U.S. average monthly consump-
tion of 540 million barrels and price of $60. For the elasticities of supply (including imports)
and demand, we use ηS = 0.2 and ηD = −0.2, numbers in line with econometric estimates
from the literature. For the period in question, the constants kS and kD are then kS =
238.1 and kD = 1224.7. With these constants and elasticities, and with a price of $60, the
quantities demanded and supplied match U.S. data for 2007.
   Now, what would it take to reach a price of $130 with no shifts in the demand or supply
curves? At a price of $130, the quantity supplied would rise to 630.3 million barrels per month
(mb/m), and the quantity demanded would fall to 426.1 mb/m. This means inventories
would have to increase at a rate of 168 million barrels per month. To put this in perspective,
the total stock of commercial inventories in the U.S., i.e., excluding the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve (SPR), was about 286 million barrels in 2007, and the SPR held around 700 million
barrels. A rate of inventory buildup of 168 mb/m would fill the entire SPR in just over four
months, and would double total commercial inventories in less than two months. A rate
of inventory buildup this large is almost inconceivable, and certainly bears no resemblance
to the data. (Over the entire calendar year 2007, commercial inventories fell by 28 million
barrels, and rose by 55 mb over calendar year 2008.)

                                              17
      Even with less elastic supply and demand, attributing the price increase to something
other than a shift in fundamentals is implausible. For example, if ηS = 0.1 and ηD = −0.1,
the constants kS and kD become kS = 358.6 and kD = 813.2. Then an increase in price
to $130 with no shift in supply or demand would imply an inventory buildup of 84 million
barrels per month, which would double commercial inventories in 3.4 months.


5       Evaluating the Impact of Speculation.
In this section, we lay out a simple and transparent method for decomposing changes in
prices into a component coming from changes in market fundamentals and a component
resulting from speculative activity. We do this in two ways. The first uses the relationship
between supply and demand elasticities, changes in inventories, and prices. The second relies
on the relationship between convenience yields, changes in inventories, and prices.

5.1       Speculative Changes in Spot Prices.

To begin, we focus on the cash market, and maintain two simplifying assumptions: (i) the
supply of oil includes imports, and domestic production and imports are indistinguishable;
and (ii) the supply and demand functions are isoelastic, so that eqn. (6) holds.10 Furthermore,
we assume that market fundamentals are incorporated in the supply and demand parameters
kS and kD , so that a shift in supply or demand would imply a change in one or both of these
parameters, rather than in the elasticities ηS and ηD .
      Dividing both sides of eqn. (6) by Qt :
                                   ∆Nt   Xt     kS ηS −ηD
                                       =    −1=   P       −1 .                               (7)
                                    Qt   Qt     kD t
Now rearrange and take logs of both sides:
                                                                                 !
                                                                  ∆Nt
                        (ηS − ηD ) log Pt = log kD − log kS + log     +1             .       (8)
                                                                   Qt
If demand and supply are stable over the period the price is changing, i.e., there is no change
in fundamentals, then kS and kD are constant, so taking first differences yields:
                                                                         !
                                                          ∆Nt
                               (ηS − ηD )∆ log Pt = ∆ log     +1             .               (9)
                                                           Qt
 10
      We are also assuming that demand includes exports, which in any case are negligible.

                                                     18
Since ∆Nt = Xt − Qt , eqn. (9) can be written equivalently as:

                             (ηS − ηD )∆ log Pt = ∆ log(Xt /Qt ) .                      (10)

   This equation explains a price change ∆Pt resulting from speculation or investment, as
opposed to a change in fundamentals. It says that the percentage change in price must equal
the percentage change in the production-to-sales ratio divided by the sum of the absolute
values of the elasticities. Again, we are assuming that the parameters kS and kD incorporate
fundamentals. Thus a shift in the demand curve resulting from an increase in Chinese oil
consumption, for example, would imply an increase in kD , but no change in the elasticity
ηD . We use eqns. (9) and (10) to test for speculation in the following three ways.
   Price Behavior. Beginning with a set of plausible values for the sum of the supply and
demand elasticities, ηS − ηD , we can decompose a price change over any period of time into
fundamental and speculative components: ∆ log(PT ) = ∆ log(PS )+∆ log(PF ). Consider any
three-month period, for example. Summing the monthly inventory changes over the three
months and dividing by the initial consumption Q0 , eqn. (9) gives the price change that can
be attributed to speculation/investment. Subtracting that from the total price change gives
the portion that is due to a shift in fundamentals. A comparison of the two components
provides a picture of the relative importance of speculation as a driver of price.
   Inventory Behavior. We again begin with a set of plausible values for the sum of the
supply and demand elasticities, ηS − ηD . Now suppose the price change over some period
(say three months) is entirely due to speculation. Rearranging eqn. (9), this would imply:
                                                   !        ηS −ηD
                            ∆Nt           ∆N0           Pt
                                +1=           +1                       .                (11)
                             Qt            Q0           P0

If speculation was a substantial cause of the price changes, this inventory change should be
close to the actual inventory change.
   Elasticities. Finally, given the data for price and inventory changes, we can use eqn. (9)
to determine the sum of the elasticities that would be required to reconcile actual price and
inventory changes with pure speculation:

                                 log(∆Nt /Qt + 1) − log(∆N0 /Q0 + 1)
                     ηS − ηD =                                       .                  (12)
                                           log Pt − log P0

                                              19
5.2    Speculative Inventory Holdings and Convenience Yield.

The tests described above are all based on equilibrium in the cash market. They rely on the
link between price changes and inventory changes that must hold if there are no shifts in
supply or demand that are due to fundamentals, i.e., no changes in kS and kD . Speculation
via inventory accumulation, however, will manifest itself in the market for storage.
   To see this, write the (inverse) demand for storage curve as:

                                                           −1/ηN
                               ψ(Nt ) = Pt g(Nt ) = kN Pt Nt       .                         (13)

where ηN > 0 is the price elasticity of demand for storage. This is a standard specification for
the demand for storage, and has been estimated in the literature for a variety of commodities.
As discussed below, we estimated this equation using our data for crude oil and found that
ηN ≈ 1, consistent with other econometric studies. Note that the marginal value of storage
is proportional to the price, Pt , of the commodity being stored.
   The parameter kN captures other factors that might affect the demand for storage. Those
factors might reflect fundamentals; for example, an increase in market volatility or an in-
creased threat of war in the Persian Gulf would cause an increase in kN . But a change in
kN might also (or instead) reflect speculation. Earlier we considered the possibility that oil
producers decide to accumulate inventories as a means of speculating on price increases. As
illustrated in Figure 8, this would cause a shift in the demand for storage curve because
there would now be a speculative benefit from holding inventories in addition to the usual
benefit. Thus speculative inventory accumulation would be reflected by an increase in kN .
   Taking logs and first differences of eqn. (13) gives:

                      ∆ log ψt = ∆ log Pt − (1/ηN )∆ log Nt + ∆ log kN .                     (14)

Absent any substantial change in volatility or the threat of war (which we will assume to be
the case), the last term in eqn. (14) would reflect a shift in the demand for storage attributable
to speculation. As explained earlier, marginal convenience yield can be measured directly
from the spread between spot and futures prices. Thus, as with price behavior in the cash
market, we can use eqn. (14) to compare the behavior of the actual convenience yield with
what it would be in the absence of speculation.

                                               20
    To do this comparison, we use eqn. (14), with ∆ log kN = 0, to compute a counterfactual
series for ψt , i.e., values of ψt that would we would observe if there were no speculation-
induced changes in Pt , Nt , and in the demand for storage curve. We compare this to the
actual series for ψt to assess the possibility of speculation-driven inventory accumulation.


6     Were Oil Prices Driven by Speculation?
We now turn to the data to test whether changes in oil prices after 2000 can be attributed,
even in part, to speculation. As explained earlier, although speculation is most easily done
using futures contracts, in principle oil companies could speculate on rising prices by accu-
mulating above-ground inventories, by stopping or slowing down the development of unde-
veloped reserves (which would result in a drop in the rental and utilization rates of drilling
rigs), or by slowing down the production from developed reserves. We examine these last two
possibilities first, and then turn to the use of futures contracts as the vehicle for speculation,
and to the use of inventory accumulation.
    Our data come from the Energy Information Administration (EIA). We collected monthly
data on U.S. production, commercial stocks, imports, and exports. We construct consump-
tion as the change U.S. production plus net imports minus changes in commercial stocks.
The EIA also reports monthly averages for WTI spot and futures prices. (We use the WTI
price although the results change little if we instead use Brent crude prices.) Our sample
runs from January 1998 to June 2012.
    One might argue that there is a world market for oil, so we should use world, rather than
U.S. data on production, consumption and inventories. Our use of U.S. data is justified as
follows. First, speculation is often blamed on people trading U.S. futures. For those futures,
delivery (which rarely occurs) must be in WTI crude as specified in the contract, so Saudi
or Nigerian crude is not relevant. Of course Saudi or Nigerian crude is a substitute for WTI
(though not a perfect one), so in principle WTI inventories could be “traded” for Saudi
inventories, but as a practical matter this would be costly and takes time.
    Second, even for a “bath tub” style world market, unless the three elasticities (demand,
supply, and demand for storage) are very different across regions, we can look at the behavior


                                               21
of inventories and prices in any one region (in our case the U.S.) to analyze speculation. In
this sense, the U.S. serves as a microcosm of the global market. Since our analysis relies only
on “plausible” elasticity values (e.g., ηS − ηD ≈ 0.2 or 0.4), regional differences are unlikely
to matter much. Third, the quality of U.S. inventory data far exceeds the quality of global
data, so the use of global inventory data will likely inject noise into the analysis.11
       Finally, the U.S. market is indeed connected to and constrained by the world market,
but only to a degree. For example, because of pipeline constraints in the Midwest, the price
of Brent crude has recently been at least $20 per barrel higher than the price of WTI. If
the U.S. price started to rise sharply, more oil (Saudi, Brent, etc.) would start to flow into
the U.S., but this would take time. Thus if speculators push up the futures price, U.S.
inventories would increase, as would the U.S. spot price. By the time U.S. inventories stop
increasing, the spot price must return to its original level. Could Saudi and other producers
arbitrage by selling oil into the U.S. while U.S. inventories are increasing and the U.S. spot
price is high? Possibly, but it would be time-consuming, costly, and thus unlikely.

6.1       Speculation by Oil Companies.

Might oil companies have contributed to the sharp price increases by delaying the develop-
ment of undeveloped reserves? If this were the case, we would expect to see a drop in the
utilization of drilling rigs in advance of the observed price increases. Figure 9 shows average
rig utilization rates from 2000 onwards in the Gulf of Mexico, along with the WTI spot
price.12 Clearly these data are inconsistent with the view that development delays drove
price increases. Rig utilization rates were roughly level during 2004–2007, increased in early
2008 as the price increased, and then dropped shortly after the steep plunge in the price.
       Might oil companies have contributed to price increases by reducing production from
developed reserves? We address this possibility by looking at the behavior of production.
Figure 10 plots U.S. crude production along with the WTI price. We also include “predicted”
production based on production prior to 2007. The smooth downward sloping curve is a
  11
   We also note that Kilian and Lee (2011) use the same empirical model as Kilian and Murphy (forth-
coming), but applied to global supply, demand, and inventory data and find similar results.
  12
    We purchased these data from RigZone. The data report utilization of jackups, semi-subs, and drill-ships
in the Gulf of Mexico.

quadratic trend line fit to the production series over 1999 through the end of 2006, and then
extrapolated forward through 2012. Observe that this downward trend ended by 2007, well
before the 2008 price spike. Production leveled out during 2006 to 2008.13

6.2       Speculation via the Futures Market.

As discussed above, we can calculate counterfactual prices that would have occurred in
the absence of speculation by decomposing observed prices changes into a component at-
tributable to speculative activity, resulting from either changes in inventories or convenience
yields, and a component due to changes in market fundamentals. Using eqn. (9), along with
numbers for supply and demand elasticities, we can also calculate the inventory changes
that would be required if the observe price changes are the result of speculation. And given
observed price and inventory changes, eqn. (9) also yields the sum of supply and demand
elasticities required for speculation to have led to the change in price. Finally, we can use
eqn. (14) to calculate counterfactual convenience yields.
       We examine price and inventory changes for non-overlapping three-month and 12-month
intervals. Each price and inventory change is calculated on a moving month-to-month basis.
For example, for three-month intervals, we compare the average price for April, May, and
June 2005 to the average price for January, February, and March 2005. We then compare
the average price for May, June, and July 2005 to February, March, and April 2005, and
so on. Thus we have a different set of price and inventory changes for each month in our
sample. We use intervals of varying length because we are interested in whether speculation
may have short-term effects that dissipate over longer periods.14
       For any given time interval, we calculate the consumption-weighted spot price, average
consumption, average stock levels, and the change in inventories over the interval. When
our analysis focuses on X-month intervals, the differences in eqns. (9) and (14) are defined
as X-month differences. We calculate these X-month differences for every month in our
  13
    The downward spike in 2005 was the result of Hurricane Katrina (both a supply and demand shock).
We are unable to find any weather-related cause of the drop in production in February 2009; however, this
drop corresponds to an 11-percent drop in consumption.
  14
    We have also done the analysis using monthly intervals and obtained similar results, but the counterfac-
tual prices are much more volatile.


                                                    23
sample. We are interested in speculative activity beyond the normal response to seasonal
patterns in the demand for oil. Therefore, we de-seasonalize inventories by first regressing
changes in inventories on a full set of month dummies and take the residuals as our measure
of inventory changes. (We observe no seasonality in the convenience yield.) Thus we measure
speculative activity in terms of how changes in inventories over any X-month interval differ
from their average changes during the same interval across the entire sample.
   Generating counterfactual prices using eqn. (9) requires estimates of supply and demand
elasticities. These elasticities will obviously vary depending on the amount in time over
which supply and demand can adjust to price changes. Studies by Dahl (1993), Cooper
(2003), and Hughes et al. (2008) suggest that the short-run demand elasticity is roughly
−0.1, although, Kilian and Murphy (forthcoming) estimate a short-run elasticity of roughly
−0.25. Dahl (1993) and Cooper (2003) find that the long-run demand elasticity is in the
range of −0.2 to −0.3. The literature on supply elasticities is more sparse. Dahl and Duggan
(1996) summarize the literature on supply elasticities and find that many estimates, for both
short- and long-run elasticities, are noisily estimated and often the wrong sign. Hogan (1989)
estimates a short-run elasticity of 0.09 and a long-run elasticity of 0.58. It is easy to see
how short-run supply elasticities could be very small. Note, however, that what matters for
generating counterfactual prices is the sum of the elasticities.
   We show results based on ηS − ηD = 0.2, consistent with a supply and demand elasticity
of 0.1 and −0.1 respectively, for the three-month intervals. For the 12-month intervals we
use ηS − ηD = 0.4. We use these same elasticity assumptions to construct the inventory
changes required for speculation to have led to the observed price changes.
   To calculate a counterfactual series for the convenience yield using eqn. (14), we need a
times series for the actual convenience yield, and an estimate of the price elasticity of the
demand for storage, ηN . Using eqn. (4), the components of the convenience yield are the
risk-free rate of interest, the spot and futures prices, and the cost of storage (i.e., the cost
of storing a barrel of oil over the length of the futures contract). We use the 3-month T-bill
rate for the risk-free rate and the price of the three-month futures contract to get a three-
month gross convenience yield. There is little data on the cost of storage; a rough estimate is
$1.50 per barrel per month, but the cost can rise when inventory levels are large and storage

                                              24
facilities fill up. We begin using a monthly storage cost of $1.50 per barrel. However, in
5 of the 162 months in our sample futures prices were much larger than spot prices, so a
constant storage cost of $1.50 would imply a negative net convenience yield, violating the
arbitrage condition. For example, in December 2008, the gross monthly convenience yield is
−$6.08. These large negative values may be a consequence of the EIA’s aggregation of the
futures and spot prices up to a monthly level, or may reflect changes in the cost of storage.
To take logs, we truncate the three-month net convenience yield below at $1.50, noting that
these observations occurred during the rapid drop in oil prices following 2008 and, therefore,
should not affect our discussion of whether speculation led to price increases.
       A reasonable value for the price elasticity of demand for storage, ηN , is 1.0.15 However,
we estimate this elasticity and also test our assumption that changes in the convenience yield
are proportional to changes in prices. We estimate eqn. (14) for both the three-month and
12-month intervals over our sample (1999 to 2012) assuming an AR(2) process for the error
term. Table 1 reports the results. Both the three- and 12-month data are consistent with
our assumption that changes in convenience yields are directly proportional to changes in
spot prices; we cannot reject a coefficient of 1 at any conventional level (p-values of 0.18 and
0.64, respectively). In addition, we cannot reject a coefficient of −1 for the change in the
log of stocks (p-values of 0.78 and 0.61, respectively).16

6.3        Results: Prices, Inventories, and Elasticities.

Price Changes. We first calculate the spot prices that would have prevailed had no specu-
lative (or investment) activity occurred, i.e., counterfactual prices that would have changed
only in response to changes in fundamentals. Figure 11 plots actual and counterfactual
prices using changes in inventories over a three-month interval. Note that the counterfactual
prices are very close to the actual prices, and the correlation is 0.96. The average spot price
over this period was $55.37 per barrel, and the average counterfactual spot price is $55.34.
The peak counterfactual price is 7 percent higher than the actual price, $144.90 compared
  15
       Pindyck (1994) estimated the storage price elasticity to be about 1.1 for copper and 1.2 for heating oil.
  16
    It is clear, however, that the confidence intervals around the change in the log of stocks are quite wide.
This is likely due to the small amount of variation in stocks.



                                                        25
to $130.85, and the volatility of the counterfactual prices is essentially the same, with the
standard deviation in the counterfactual prices being $29.04, while the standard deviation
of actual prices $28.79. These results show that (i) speculation can account for very little of
the observed price changes; (ii) speculation did not cause an increase in price volatility; and
(iii) price spikes would have been slightly higher absent speculation.
   Repeating this for 12-month intervals, the resulting counterfactual prices are even closer
to the actual prices. The correlation between the two price series is 0.9997. The average
spot and counterfactual prices over this period were both $53.06, with a standard deviation
of $27.05. The peak counterfactual price is slightly lower, $107.50 compared to $107.85. The
reason for this high correlation is the average change in inventories across 12-month intervals
is only 1.01 million barrels (compared to an average commercial stock of oil of 319 million
barrels), implying counterfactual prices over a 12-month period will mirror actual prices.
   Suppose one believed that supply and demand are extremely inelastic. Figure 12 shows
actual and counterfactual prices, again for three-month intervals, but with ηS = 0.05 and
ηD = −0.05. The counterfactual prices are still quite close to the actual prices.
   Inventory Changes. Next, we use eqn. (11) to calculate the inventory changes that
would be needed if the observed changes in actual prices were due to speculation rather
than changes in fundamentals. Figure 13 plots the actual and counterfactual inventory
changes for the three-month intervals. The most striking result is that these two series are
negatively correlated; the correlation is −0.54. Also, the actual inventory changes are much
larger in magnitude than would have had to occur if price changes were completely due to
speculation, as opposed to shifts in fundamentals. The average change in actual inventories
over the sample is 0.98 million barrels, compared to an implied mean change of 6.16. As with
price behavior, the observed changes in inventories are inconsistent with speculation. For
the 12-month intervals, the two series are again negatively correlated (−0.23). The implied
changes in inventories swamp the actual changes. The mean implied inventory change is
nearly 600 million barrels compared to an actual mean of 1.62 million barrels.
   Sum of Elasticities. Finally, we use eqn. (12) to calculate the sum of elasticities (i.e.,
ηS − ηD ) required to rationalize the observed changes in inventories and prices as due purely
to speculation. The three-month interval results are shown in Figure 14, truncated at +/−

                                              26
0.4 for visual ease. Observe first that the sum of the elasticities fluctuates wildly, with no
consistent pattern. In fact, nearly half of the time, the sum is negative—i.e., it has the wrong
sign. Also, note that the sum of the elasticities is on average very close to zero (0.04 for our
sample). Quarterly elasticities of supply and demand this small are simply implausible.
       We repeated this for 12-month intervals. Given the longer time intervals, we would expect
implied elasticities to be larger compared to the three-month interval results. In fact, the
mean implied sum of elasticities is an order of magnitude smaller (0.003).
       These results for prices, inventory changes, and the required sum of elasticities are com-
pletely inconsistent with the notion that speculation has been a major driver of oil prices.

6.4       Results: Changes in Convenience Yield.

We now turn to the possibility that speculators drove up oil prices by accumulating above-
ground inventories, with the hope of selling them at a higher price. Recall that this would
imply a change in kN in eqn. (13). Thus by holding kN fixed, we can generate a counterfactual
series for convenience yield (for which there is no speculation) and compare it to the actual
series (for which there might have been speculation).
       As discussed above, a one-time increase in the speculative demand for above-ground
inventories will shift the demand for storage curve, ψ(N ) upwards, so that both inventories
and the convenience yield increase. Thus if speculative inventory accumulation was at work,
we would observe counterfactual convenience yields that are below the actual convenience
yields. Figure 15 shows the actual and counterfactual convenience yields (the latter implied
by eqn. (13)) for three-month intervals.17
       These results are inconsistent with speculative inventory accumulation. In fact, the aver-
age fundamentals-only convenience yield is slight larger than the actual for both the three-
month and 12-month intervals. For three-month intervals, the counterfactual convenience
yield is on average about 5 percent higher than the actual, and is 19 percent higher when
the exercise is repeated for 12-month intervals. Furthermore, the volatility in the counterfac-
  17
      Note that the actual and counterfactual series differ more than do the actual and counterfactual prices
shown in Figure 11. This is partly due to our assumption that any change in kN is due to speculation,
i.e., we ignore any fundamentals-based shifts in kN , e.g., the likely reduction in kN due to the recession in
2009–2010.


                                                     27
tual convenience yields, measured by its standard deviation, exceeds the actual convenience
yield by 16 and 46 percent for the three- and 12-month periods, respectively. These results
suggest that if anything, speculation tended to decrease the demand for storage and reduce
the volatility of convenience yields.

6.5       Focusing on Specific Periods.

Next, we focus on specific time periods during which prices increased sharply and there
was intensive public concern over speculation. Figure 16 plots WTI spot prices and Google
search intensity for the term “oil speculation.”18 Because search may occur with some lag,
we begin the “epochs” at the beginning of the price run-up and end at the maximum price.
       We analyze four epochs, for which the beginning and end points are shown in Figure 16
by a solid and dotted lines respectively. Note that the last two epochs are subsets of the
second one. The epochs are:

   1. January 2007 to July 2008

   2. February 2009 to April 2011

   3. February 2009 to April 2010

   4. September 2010 to April 2011

       We chose these epochs because they encompass periods of sustained prices increases
as well as heavy Google search activity. We split the second interval into two sub-epochs
because of the leveling off of prices in the middle of the interval.
       We examine the behavior of price, inventories, and convenience yield using the same
methods as before: (a) We generate a counterfactual final price for the epoch, i.e., the price
that would prevail absent speculation; (b) we calculate the required inventory changes for
speculation to have caused the observed price increase; (c) we calculate the sum of supply
and demand elasticities required for the observed changes in inventories to have caused the
price increase; and (d) we calculate the no-speculation change in the convenience yield and

  18
    Google Insights data allow one to track the intensity of search for a particular term. Within the time
period specified, the Insights data report the relative intensity of search for that term. So, the week with
maximum search intensity is scaled at 100, and all other weeks are a percentage of the maximum week.
Figure 16 plots the weekly average within a particular month.

                                                    28
compare it to the actual. We use our long-run supply and demand elasticity assumptions for
the first three periods (0.2 and −0.2), since they exceed a year in length. To be conservative
we use our short-run elasticities (0.1 and −0.1) for the final period, which is seven months
long. The results are shown in Table 2.
    We begin with prices. Observe that for all four epochs, the counterfactual prices that
remove speculative activity are extremely close to the actual ending prices. In three of the
four epochs the fundamentals-only price is higher than the actual price. This is consistent
with the previous sets of results which show that speculation had almost no impact on prices,
and if anything, dampened price spikes.
    The next panel of Table 2 shows the build up in inventories required for speculation
to have caused the observed price increase. For all four epochs, huge inventory increases
would have been required had price increases been drive by speculation, whereas the actual
inventory changes were very small. In the first epoch, the required increase in inventories is
nearly as large as the level of commercial inventories present at the end of the epoch, whereas
actual inventories fell slightly. The required inventory build-ups in the other three epochs
are also unrealistically large. The implied elasticities consistent with speculation-induced
price increases are likewise unreasonable. For the first three epochs, the sum of elasticities
would have to be negative. In the fourth, the sum is close to zero.
    Finally, we calculate the fundamentals-only changes in convenience yield. Had there
been speculative inventory accumulation, the observed convenience yield would be larger
than that justified by fundamentals. Instead, for the first three epochs, the actual increase
in the convenience yield was smaller (and for the fourth epoch only slightly larger) than
what is justified by fundamentals. Again, these results are inconsistent with the notion that
speculation drove up spot prices through the storage market.


7     Conclusions.
We have shown how a simple model of equilibrium in the cash and storage markets for a
commodity can be used to assess the role of speculation as a driver of price changes. With
reasonable assumptions about elasticities of supply and demand, the model can be used


                                              29
to determine whether speculation is consistent with the data on production, consumption,
inventory changes, and spot and futures prices. Given its simplicity and transparency, we
believe that our approach yields results that are quite convincing. We have focused on the
price of crude oil because sharp increases in oil prices have often been blamed on speculators,
but our approach can be applied equally well to other commodities.
   We found that although we cannot rule out that speculation had any effect on oil prices,
we can indeed rule out speculation as an explanation for the sharp changes in prices since
2004. Unless one believes that the price elasticities of both oil supply and demand are close
to zero, the behavior of inventories and futures-spot spreads are simply inconsistent with the
view that speculation has been a significant driver of spot prices. If anything, speculation
had a slight stabilizing effect on prices.
   The simplicity of our approach to speculation is a benefit, but also implies limitations.
For example, we assume that demand and supply in the cash market are isoelastic functions
of price, and that the elasticities do not change over time. We also assume that imports can
be combined with domestic supply and respond to price changes in the same way. Finally,
we assume that apart from shifts in the multiplicative parameter kN , the demand for storage
is stable. We believe these assumptions are all reasonable and similar in nature to functional
form assumptions that are required in related econometric studies.
   Finally, as we explained at the outset, it is difficult or impossible to distinguish “spec-
ulation” from an “investment.” The latter might involve buying or selling futures, not to
“beat the market,” but instead to hedge against large price fluctuations. Mutual funds, hedge
funds, and other institutions often hold futures positions, but it is usually impossible to know
whether they are doing so to make a “naked” (unhedged) bet on future prices, or instead
to diversify or hedge against other commodity-related risks. Thus when we examined the
impact of increased purchases of futures contracts, we were not concerned with whether this
represented an investment or pure speculation, and our use of the word “speculation” should
always be interpreted as including investment activities—but not a shift in fundamentals.
