       FEAR OF FLYING? ECONOMIC ANALYSES OF AIRLINE SAFETY



                             ABSTRACT

     The safety of the commercial airline industry has attracted

considerable public attention and debate since economic

deregulation of the industry in 1978. These concerns have
energized economic research on three aspects of airline safety.
First, has the level of airline safety declined since

deregulation? Research on this topic investigates whether

heightened public concerns about air safety derive from objective

increases in accident risks. Second. what accounts for

differences in safety performance across carriers? This

literature analyzes heterogeneity in carriers' safety records as
a means of learning about factors that influence safety

performance. Third, how do markets respond to airline accidents?

This work explores the effectiveness of market incentives in

constraining the safety provision of firms. This paper describes
our progress in answering each of these queries.

        The safety of the coninerciaL airline industry has been of

Long-standing interest to policy-makers and the general public.

This issue attracted particuLar attention in the wake of airLine

deregulation, amid growing concerns that the historical

superiority of U.S. jet carriers' safety records may have been

inextricabLy linked to economic regulation of the industry by the

CiviL Aeronautics Board. After all, economists argued that the

suppression of price coepetition led airLines to focus on service

conpetition, and pubLic perceptions of service quaLity suggest

sitstantiaL reductions in at Least some dimensions. Perhaps Less

observable dimensions of product quality, such as safety, have

experienced equivalent or greater declines. If this were the

case, traditionaL measures of welfare gains from deregulation

could be greatly exaggerated.

        These worries have energized economic research on a broad

range of issues relating to airline safety. Three questions have

attracted the most attention from economists. First, has airline

safety declined since deregulation? Research on this topic

investigates whether heightened pubLic concerns about air safety

derive from objective increases in accident risks. Second, what

accotrts for differences in safety performance across carriers?

This literature analyzes heterogeneity in carriers' safety records

as a means of Learning about factors that influence safety

performance. It extends the before-and-after deregulation

research by examining through what Links, if any, we might expect

economic regulation to affect aggregate safety. Third, how do

markets respond to airline accidents? This work explores the

effectiveness of market incentives in constraining the safety

provision of firms. If consuners and insurance conpanies penalize
airlines with worse safety records, carriers may be disinclined to

reduce safety investment, even if regulatory changes wouLd permit

them to do so.     I describe below our progress in answering these

queries.




1. Has airLine safety decLined since derequLatign?

           Aggregate statistics on U.S. airline safety provide

reassurance for travellers concerned that deregulation increased

the risks of air travel. VirtuaLLy all measures of accident or

fatality risk suggest that the Long-term trend toward increased

airline safety has continued since economic dereguLation of the

airline industry in 1978. This is illustrated in figure 1, which

plots the raster of aircraft accidents per miLLion departures for

Large U.S. scheduled air carriers over the period 1955_1990.1

Both totaL and fataL accidents per miLlion departures declined

substantiaLly, aLthough there is considerable variation in

accident rates from year to year.

           There is littLe evidence that improvements in airline

safety have slowed appreciably since dereguLation. Observed

accident rates since 1978 conform closely to those predicted by a

trend estimated over the 1255-1977 data, as illustrated in figure

2. More formalLy, regression analysis of the Log of accident

rates on a time trend indicates that the coefficients on either a

deregulation dumvy variabLe or a variabLe measuring time since




     1 Referred to as "Part 121" carriers, these are carriers that
operate aircraft with capacity in excess of 60 seats. these carriers
currently operate primarily jet aircraft fleets.

                                    2
deregulation are insignificantly different from zero.2 Figure 2

does, however, suggest some scope for caution. Accident rates

over the Last four years (1987-1990) Lie sLightLy above trend.

There is not enough data to determine whether this reflects normal

variation in observed accident rates over short time horizons or

en elevation of the true underlying risk, nor is it obvious that

effects that do not materialize until ten years after deregulation

should be attributed to regulatory changes rather than to some

other cause. NevertheLess, these data may suggest continued

scrutiny of aggregate safety performance over the next few years.

        Passenger fatality rates aLso exhibit continued

lirprovement after deregulation. For exairpLe, Barnett and Higgins

(1989) calculate that fatality risks for passengers on U.S.

domestic jet airLine flights declined from an average of 1 in 2.5

million fLights over 1971-78 to 1 in 7.4 million flights over

1979-86. They argue, however, that the decLine in risk wouLd have

been even greater, but for the entry of new jet carriers post-

1978. As evidence, they separate the U.S. carriers into

"established carriers" (trunk and local service airLines existing

as of 1978) and new entrants (a group of 19 "Jet children" of

deregulation, most now out of business). For 1979-86, fatality

risk for passengers on established carriers averaged 1 per 1L8

million flights. In contrast, the group of entrants Barnett and

Higgins anelyze had an aggregate fatality risk of 1 per 870,000




    2 Rose   (1989) presents results for 1955-1986 data; my updates
based on the 1955-1990 data yield simiLarLy insignificant resuLts.
This conclusion is reinforced by an analysis of the time fixed
effects (1958-1986) from the model of airLine specific accident
counts in Rose (1990).


                                 3
fJ.ightsl this does not inpty that the planes of the entrant

carriers were continually dropping out of the sky, however only

3 of the 19 cerriers had Ã§jy domestic passenger fataLities during

the 7 year period, and these had just one fatal accident each.

The high risk arises from the fact that the entrants carried

relatively few passengers. The robustness of this conclusion and

the safety records of entrants wilL be discussed further when we

anaLyze differences in safety performance across carriers.

        Analyses of the causes of airline accident rates can shed

additional light on the effects of dereguLation. If deregulation

induced carriers to cut maintenance activities, for exanple, one

might expect to observe more accidents due to equipment failure.

Accidents due to p1 Lot error should increase if airlines

conpromised safety by hiring Less experienced pilots, reducing

training, or working pilots harder. If increased congestion,

combined with the reductions in air traffic control (Alt) staff

after the 1981 controLlers strike, degraded the air traffic

control system, accidents resulting from ATC errors or

interference by other aircraft should become more comon.

         To test whether deregulation has had these effects, Oster

and 2cm (1989) analyze National Transportation Safety Board

(NTSB) Accident Briefs for scheduled domestic passenger service

accidents over the 1971 through 1985 period. For each accident,

they select as the "primary cause" the event or action that

 initiated the sequence of events culminating in the accident.3



       Because their criterion differs from that used by the )1188,
 their distribution of accidents by cause differs from the NTSB
distribution. Broadly similar conclusions are reached by Morrison
arid Winston (1988), who analyze the distribution of fatal accidents

                                  4
These causes are then grouped into categories that might be

sensitive to deregulation-induced changes, such                as Pilot Error,

Equipment     Failure,   Air Traffic Control Error, and Other Aircraft

(General Aviation), and       categories     that are tnlikely to be

Influenced by deregulation, including Weather, Seatbelt Not

Fastened, and    Other.     Between the regulated (1970-78) and

deregulated     (1979-85) periods,     total   accidents per      million
departures for trunk and       local   service carriers declined by 54%.

Accident rates due to equippent failure, pilot error, ATC error,

and   other   aircraft declined by this amowit          or   more, topped by a

71% reduction in accidents initiated by equipment                failures.   This

suggests a relative decrease in accidents due to causes under a

carrier's control after deregulation.

          Further   evidence on the changes in maintenance practices
and their effects on safety since deregulation is provided by

Kennet's (1990) study of jet engine maintenance histories. ICennet

analyzes cooplete aircraft engine           histories   for 42 Pratt and

Whitney jet engines, operated by 7 different airlines. He finds

that the length of time between maintenance shop visits has

increased since deregulation, but that deregulation has had no

effect on the probability of an engine shutdown. This may reflect

a drive toward more efficient maintenance policies and practices

in the wake of deregulation. The result that engine shutdown

probabilities have been unaffected suggests that these maintenance

changes have not coapromised air safety, consistent with Oster and

Zorn's report of substantial relative declines in accidents




using HTSB causes.

Indirect effects of dereguLation on travellers' safety

           There are a nuther of indirect    channels through which

dereguLation may have influenced safety. First, the shift from

jet airline to comm.iter airLine service in many small       conmrities
may have increased risks for passengers on these routes. Second,

increased    reliance on hub-and-spoke networks may have increased

the average nuther of stops or plane changes passengers mist make.
Since accident risks are roughly proportional to the nuter of

take-offs, this wouLd tend to increase passengers' risks per        flip
(origin-destination).      Third, the introduction of price

conpetition and     service   irprovements may   induce travellers to

substitute air travel for auto travel.. Since the risk of a

highway accident substantially exceeds that for air travel over

even moderate distances, this substitution would enhance

travellers' safety.

           Substitution of comuter service: By eliminating explicit

cross-subsidization and easing entry and exit restrictions,

airLine deregulation may have encouraged established jet carriers

to abandon uneconomic service to small cooninities. While         most of
these coanrities retain air service, it now typically is provided

by coirniter carriers. Because comuter airlines have higher

accident rates than jet airlines, risks to traveLlers in these

comminities nay have increased. For exanÃ§le, over 1979-1985,

passenger fatalities were .38 per million passengers enplaned on

trunk   airlines,   but 1.27 per miLlion passengers enplaned on

comnuter    airlines-- more than   three times greater for cooniters

(Oster and Zorn, 1989).


                                      6
        These siopte cciiparisons may substantiaLly overstate the

change in risk, however (Oster and Zorn, 1989). First1 the

Largest conmiter airLines are nuch safer than the smalLer

cainiters, and these are the ones that typicaLLy have replaced jet

carriers. The top 20 connuters, for instance, had passenger

fataLities of .67 per mit Lion enplanements, roughLy half the risk

for coirniters overall.4 Second, service substantially Inproved on

the routes where coemuters replaced jets1 with fewer intermediate

stops and more weekLy departures.     In a   sanple of 60 city-pair
markets where conm.iters replaced jets between 1978 and 1986, the

average nuSer of intermediate stops fell by half (from .59 to

.30; see Oster and Zorn, 1989). Re-scaling the fataLity risk to

reflect total risk per passenger trip on these routes yields a

risk of .60 per million trips for jet carriers (.38 fataLities per

million enptaneinents times 1.59 average take-offs) coirpared to a

risk of .87 for the Large conniters (.67 fatalities per million

enplanements times 1.30 average take-offs). White the comiuter

risks are higher, the differences are Less stark than irrplied by

the initiaL conparison.

        Finally, the average weekLy departures in these 60 markets

more than doubLed after coniuters took over service (from 2.88 to

6.29). The increased frequency of service appears to be

associated with increased ridership, at Least part of which

reflects a switch from cars to planes for some travellers. Oster




       there have been no studies that Look at conniter safety under
codesharing arrangements with major carriers(see Borenstein, 1991,
for a discussion of codesharing). Given the increased scrutiny that
codesharing inposes upon the conimiters, it is Likely that their
safety record is even better than inptied by size atone.

                                  7
and Zorn (1989) estimate the auto fatality rates in these markets

to Lie between 1.9 and 2.3 per          miLlion   passenger trips. Since

this is substantialLy greater than the risk for the Larger

conn.iter airlines, the modal switch enhances overaLL safety for

these travellers.

           Increases in the average ntater of stops per trip: The

second potentiaL       indirect effect of deregulation,      possible

increases in the nuther        of   stops or pLane changes   passengers   mist
make en route to their finaL destination, has not been weLL-
docunented.    While       the development of hub-and-spoke networks may
substitute one-stop or one-change service for nonstop service in

outLying markets, it is likely to increase nonstop service

availability for passengers traveLLing to and from the hub. The

net iripact on averege stops carwiot be predicted            priori.

           Some evidence on this effect is provided by Borenstein

(1991). He finds an increase in the nuther of passenger trips

that involve a change of pLane, from 27.3% of trips in 1978 to

32.8% in 1990.        If   all remaining passengers flew nonstop, the

average nuther of flights per trip wouLd have increased by 4.3%

over this period (from 1.273 to 1.328). While this increases air

traveL risks, the overall inpact is not substantial. The average

totaL (fatal and nonfatal) accident rate per miLLion            flights
declined   by 54% between the 10 years prior to dereguLation and the

10 years after deregulation. Adjisting            for a 4% increase in

average flights per trip reduces the effective decLine to 52%.

           In fact,    direct (no    change of plane) service includes both

nonstop and one- (or rm4ti-) stop flights. Because there have

been no studies of the change in the average nuther of stops for


                                         8
these passengers, we cannot determine           the overall change in
average departures      per   trip.     Based on the results for the change

of plane statistics, however, failure to account for this seess

irulikely   to alter the basic        conclusion.

            Shifting traffic from highways to air: The Lower average

fares   and the widespread     adoption of discount fares and
sophisticated price discrimination schemes that resulted from

deregulation substantially increased air travel. Between 1975 and

1985, domestic passenger enplanements for the largest U.S.

csrriers grew at a rate of 6.6% per year and domestic revenue

passenger-miles (RPM5) grew at 7.5%           per year     Some of    this
increase    represents new travel, that is, trips that otherwise

would not have taken place. Some of the increase represents a

shift from other modes of travel, such as automobile, rail, or

bus.

            It is difficult to determine the precise extent to which

travellers have shifted from automobile travel to air travel as a

result of airLine deregulation. Using annual aggregate data on

passenger car miles travelled and a dumiy variable for airline

deregulation, McKenzie and Warner (1988) estimate a decline of

nearly 4%    in   passenger car miles as a result of airline

deregulation, or an average reduction of 43             billion car   miles

arnially during the 1979-85 period. They conclude that this

reÃ³jction in auto miles corresponds to roughly 1700 fewer auto

fatalities per year. If the average auto occtancy rate for

intercity traffic is 2.0, a shift of 43             billion car   miles to air

travel would isply an increase of 86 billion passenger miles for

airlines. The nirter of air fatalities associated with this


                                          9
amount of air travel averages about 41. A shift of this magnitude

tram highway to air would have an enormous                 net savings   in Livest

more than 1650 per        year.     Is this a credible estimate?

            Airline RPM5 increased by roughly 70 biLlion between 1975

and 1980, or 140 bilLion between 1975 and 1985. If the estimated

shift   in highway traveL is correct1 the bulk of the increase in

air RPIIs   comes from dispLaced auto trips. This seems irplausibLy

Large. IinforttnateLy, we do not have better estimates of the true

magnitude of the modaL          shift.     Even   if the effect is only one-
fifth as Large as McKenzie and Warner estimate, however, more than

300 Lives would be saved each year by the shift to air travel--

more than the total U.S. airline passenger fatalities in any of

the Last 10 years.




a.   What accounts for differences in accident rates across

carriers?

            Against the backdrop of substantial declines in aggregate

accident rates over time Lie wide variations in accident rates

across individual carriers within any time period. Figures 3 and

4 illustrate this in histograms of total accident rates per

million departures for a saaLe of major airlines over the 1971-75

and 1981-85 periods, respectively.5 The wide variation in

individual accident rates is not              entirely surprisinr        given the

discrete and      infrequent      nature of accidents, one        additional



       These plots are based on data for a saxiple of 35 large
airlines, as reported in Rose (1990). The 1981-85 pLot omits World
Airlines, which had two accidents and an accident rate of more than
51 per million departures. The next highest accident rate was 12.5
per million departures.

                                             10
accident In a five year period   can    generate an enormous   increase

in a typical airline's accident rate per     million departures.
This raises the question: do these statistics refLect expected

random   fluctuations arorid a coanon mean    accident rate or more

systematic   differences in behavior and sUbsequent safety
performance across airlines?
          Economists have concentrated their efforts to model
differences   in carriers' safety records In    three areas: the
impact of airLines' financial    condition on their safety

performance, variations in safety performance between entrants and

established carriers, and the determinants of higher accident

rates for conuuter carriers relative to jet airlines.

Financial inpacts on airline safety

          The potentiaL impact of financial pressures on airlines'

safety performance has provoked a Long-standing debate in policy

circles and attracted particular attention since deregulation.

The arginent that competition has reduced profit     margins arid
forced carriers to "cut corners" on safety has been one        of the key
weapons in the arsenal of re-regulation advocates. A variety of

economic models can generate predictions consistent with a

financial link to safety, including     models of reputation    formation

titer aspitnetric information, liquidity    constraints on investment
behavior,   and firm decision-making near bankruptcy. None of these

models implies that such a link coast exist, however, Leaving the

resolution of this debate to empirical     tests.
          Early studies, typically based on short time series       for
small cross sections of carriers (or industry aggregate time

series regressions), detected no significant relationship between


                                   11
financial variables such as profitability and airline accident

rates. For exanple, Golbe (1986), who Looked at cross-sections of

11 domestic trtnks over the 1963-66 and 1967-70 periods, found an

insignificant positive relation between profitability and accident

rates. These studies share a coainen shortcoming, however: the

infrequent nature of airline accidents combined with their small

sanEte sizes may Limit the power of their statistical tests.

           Analyses of more extensive data sets and alternative

safety measures find evidence that Lower profit margins are

associated with worse safety performance, at Least for some groups

of carriers. Rose (1990) expLored the determinants of airline

safety performance for a panel of 35 part 121 u.s. carriers over

1957-1956. In the fulL sanÃ§le, higher operating profits were

associated with Lower accident rates in the foLlowing year. A 5

percentage point increase in the operating margin (e.g. from 5% to

10%) ispties about a 5% reduction in the total accident rate and

more than a 15% reduction in the fatal accident rate, other things

equaL. This result for total accidents is replicated by Evans

(1989) in a study of accident rates for nearly 100 carriers over

1970-57.

           These average effects may themselves mask inportant

differences across carriers in the sensitivity of safety

performance to profitability changes. Rose's data suggest that

profitability effects may be strongest for the smaller and mid-

size carriers in the sarple, and may not be inportant for the very

largest carriers studied. This pattern is particularly clear in

the anaLysis of airline incidents, in which higher profits are

associated with Lower reported incidents for smaLL and mid-size


                                   12
carriers, but higher incident rates for the very Largest carriers.

A 5 percentage point increase in the operating margin iirÃ§Lies

about a 20% reduction    in reported incidents for the smallest
carriers in   the sanple and a 10% - 12% reduction for mid-size

carriers.

          The strength of the profitabiLity-safety Link for the

small and mid-size carriers may indicate greater flexibility in

these finns' safety investment choices. A nuiter of factors could

make the safety investment Levels of Large finns Less variable:

pthlic infonnation about underlying safety Levels may be better

for the largest airLines (reducing information asyniaetries), large

airlines may have better access to capitaL markets or "deeper

pockets" for internal financing, and FAA regulators may more

closeLy scrutinize these carriers. This heterogeneity also may

help to explain why the earlier studies, which tended to focus

only en the very Largest (trunk) carriers, failed to detect a link

between profitability and safety performance.

          A significant remaining gap in our analysis of    financial
infLuences, on   safety Is an understanding of the profitability
effects   for the very srnaL lest air carriers in the industry:

corniter carriers. While recent studies include a im.ich broader

range of carriers than had previousLy, been studied, they continue

to be Limited to "jet" (Part 121) carriers due to the Lack of

reliable financial data for convmJter (Part 135) carriers.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that conn.iters nay be quite sensitive

to financial pressures, arid the   argunents raised above for the
smaller   jet' carriers would seem to apply even more strongly to

connuters. Decisive conclusions about this seent of the


                                   13
industry paist await further data and study, however.

New entrant safety performance and the rote of experience

          A major concern after deregulation was the safety

performance of new entrants into the airline industry. Barnett

and Higgins' (1989) conclusion that entrant carriers were

sttstantially more risky than established carriers in terms of

passenger fatalities heightens this concern. The elTpirical

evidence on this issue is somewhat mixed, however. The relative

riskiness of entrants appears sensitive to the measures of safety

performance ectployed in the study, and also may depend on the

definition of entrant carriers and identities of the firms

incLuded in the saspLe.

          The   most thoroughly studied measure of safety performance
for new   entrants is total accidents per million aircraft

departures. VirtualLy all analyses using this measure of safety

indicate that entrants do not perform significantly worse than

established carriers (e.g., Kanafani and Keeler, 1989; oster and

Zorn, 1989; and Evans, 1989). Kanafani arid Keeler (1989), for

exanple, find that identifying a carrier as an entrant does not

add significant explanatory power to a regression model of total

accident rates over 1982-85, perhaps in part because of the

enormous variability in accident rates across the 25 entrants in

their sariple. Evans (1989) argues that entrants appear to have

lower accident rates    than established carriers, other things
equal.    His analysis of 105 carriers over 1971-198? suggests that

post-deregulation entrants have accident rates that are roughly




                                    14
half those of established carriers1 other things equal.6 This

result is not sensitive to whether the entrants are defined as

coeptetely new airlines or include carriers that previously

provided intrastate or charter service. Evans argues that this

result uay reflect more Intense regulatory scrutiny of airlines

newly certified in interstate service.

         The general conclusion that entrant safety performance

does not significantly differ from that of established carriers

holds across a wide variety of safety measures, aster and Zorn

(1989) find no significant differences between trunks and "other

jet carriers" for five of six aggregate safety measures over 1979-

85, including passenger fatalities and passenger injuries per

million enplanements, and total accidents, serious injury

accidents, and minor accidents per million aircraft departures.

Their group of Ilothersil corresponds to the broadest definition of

entrants used in the literature. Kanafani and KeeLer (1989)

report no Significant difference in FAA inspection ratings for new

entrants under the National Air Transportation Inspection program

and some evidence that new entrants have lower near mid air

collision reporting rates than do established carriers (though the

latter may reflect differences in reporting incidence rather than

differences in occurrence rates).

        The dominant exceptions to this sanguine view of new



     6 The relative accident rate for entrants in Evans's study
should be calculated as expftlEW - DEREG), where NEW is a d',nny
variable for new entrants (estimated at about -1.3) and DEREG is a
dinny variable for established carriers post-1978 (estimated at about
-.50). This calculation yields the value .44, inplying that entrant
accident rates are 44% of established carrier accident rates, other
things equal. Mote that this is not the calcuLation apparently
reported by Evans.

                                  15
entrants are based on analyses of fatal accident rates. In

addition to the Barnett and Higgins (1989) analysis discussed

earlier, aster and Zorn (1989) report that entrants (their "other

Jet carriers") had a substantially higher aggregate rate of fatal

accidents per million departures over 1979-85 C.90 v. .22 for

trunk and Local service carriers). As noted earlier, this poor

aggregate performance masks substantial heterogeneity across

carriers, with most entrants massed at zero fatalities and a few

extreme outliers pulling up the aggregate fatality rate.

        UnfortunateLy, there have been no carrier specific

analyses of fatal accident rates to discern the sensitivity of the

conclusions to this heterogeneity or to the definition of entrant

airlines. For exanple, World Airlines, which had two accidents

and a fatal accident rate of 51 per million departures over 1981-

85, is incLuded as an entrant in studies of entrant fatality risk.

While the airline was new to scheduled interstate service, it had

been operating charter service prior to deregulation. Should

World be grouped either with People Express, which entered airline

service de novo after deregulation, or with Pacific Southwest

Airlines, which had provided California intrastate service since

1948? In most studies, "entrants" are defined to include all of

these types of carriers.

        To understand which firmo can be meaningfully grouped

together, we rm'st first understand the possible underlying causes

of the entrant results. This is difficult to do with either

aggregate analyses or siaple dtnny variable regressions of carrier

differences.   Unfortunately, few studies have atteeÃ§ted to move

beyond these approaches. oster and Zorn (1989) report that


                                 16
antrants as a group have a higher total accident rate attributable

to pilot error (.60 per million departures, coaÃ§ared to .16 for

trisiks). This might be consistent with entrants' pilots being on

average less experienced or less well-trained, either overall or

relative to their new positions. Rose (1990) provides evidence of

some general     learning-by-doing effects on safety performance.              For

total accident rates, airline operating experience has at most a
weak negative effect, which vanishes in specifications that

control for a carrier's average accident rate. For both fatal

accidents and total incidents, however, experience exerts a

strong, statistically significant negative effect: more

experienced airlines have fewer fatal              accidents and   fewer

incidents, other things equaL Although these estimates are not

based solely on entrant performance, the results are broadly

consistent with studies that find no significant entrant effect

for total accident rates, but worse entrant performance on fatal

accidents.       Additional investigation is required to develop a

better   tmderstanding of other sources of the apparent differences
in safety performance between entrants and               established   carriers.
Cocmuter carriers
          Coovm.iter airlines, as a group, have substantially higher

accident and fatality rates than do jet carriers. The

irplications of this observation depend critically upon the source

of these differences. For exapple, if coen.iter airlines invest

Less in safety, other things equal, then more rigorous FAA

regulation of their safety practices would tend to inprove their




                                           17
safety records.7 Such regulation wilL have LittLe effect if the

disparities arise from inherent differences in equipment

reliability (e.g., smaller, propeller aircraft are more prone to

failure, even when optimalLy equipped and maintained) or airport

facilities (e.g., coan.iters are more likely to serve airports that

Lack advanced navigational aids or offer more hazardous operating

conditions).   SimiLarLy, if most of the performance differences

are attributable to route rather than carrier conditions, then

substituting one type of carrier for another on a given route is

unlikely to have nuch inÃ§act on safety.

         Discerning the relative inÃ§ortance of carrier and route

conditions on conn.iter safety records would be difficult titer any

circunstances. This task is further iaÃ§eded by the dearth of

reliable, detailed firm Level data for this segment of the

industry. Nevertheless, there is suggestive evidence that carrier

investment has a substantial iripact on safety performance in this

sector. First, cocmtiters that were part of the Allegheny (USAir)

corn.iter system had an overaLl safety record that matched the jet

carrier safety record over the 197080 period, despite

substantially higher accident rates for the conn.jter industry as a

whole (Meyer and Oster, 1987). This is unlikeLy to be soLely

attributable to differences in the routes and equipment of these

firms.

         Second, in 19Th   the   FAA substantiaLLy tightened cocnJter

safety reguLations, increasing pilot qualification, crew training,

and maintenance requirements (particularly for larger coeniter

                                     18
aircraft), and     specifying   for the first time   minittun equipnent

lists     for conm.iter flights. This appears to have had a     dramatic

iuipect   on aggregate conruter safety. The connter passenger
fatality rate per million       enpLanements decLined by more than half
between 1970-78 and 1979-85, with the bulk of the decline

occurring in    accidents caused by equippent failure, pilot error,
and weather     (the latter presunably influenced by both enhanced
pilot certification arC      training requirements and equipnent      rules

governing instrunent flight rule operations; see Oster and Zorn,
1989). Since coinnuter regulations remain less stringent than

those for jet carriers, additional iiiprovements in safety are

likely to be possible-- although whether these wouLd be welfare

enhancing remains unknown.




3. How do markets respond to airline accidents?

            For air travellers, safety is an ilrportant aspect of

product quality. Unlike other characteristics of product quality,

such   as schedule convenience, crowding, and on-board service,
consuners have difficulty observing        air carrier safety leveLs when

they   make their travel decisions. As in       other markets where

consuners    camot observe or evaluate product characteristics,
there is reason to suspect that the market may stÃ§ply less safety
than consuners would demand if fully infonned. Concern with
potential    market   failure has led to a coaplex web of goverrnent
regutaticns    that specify miniim.is safety input and   performance
standards for air carriers.                     Airlines' and aircraft

manufacturers' reputations may      provide   an alternative (or

ccaplementary) mechanism for insuring adequate safety provision.


                                      19
If these are effective checks on behavior, we should observe

market penalties for firms       that   deviate from their established

reputations. This notion has given rise to a substantial

economics literature that evaluates market responses to air

carrier accidents.

           We can analyze market responses to airline accidents from

two perspectives. First, does the market penalize aircraft types

invoLved in an accident: what is the effect of an accident on the

profits   of   the aircraft's   manufacturer, the profits of airlines
that   operate a substantial nuther of that aircraft type, and the
traffic patterns of passengers who previously flew on that
aircraft    type? Questions of this sort will be most appropriate

when flaws in     the   aircraft itself are suspected to have

contributed to a particuLar accident. Second, does the market

penalize airlines that are involved in accidents: how does an

accident affect an airLine's profits and traffic flows, and the

profits and traffic flows of its coapetitors? These questions

will be most appropriate when an airline's actions or inaction are

suspected      to have contributed to the accident.
           in this literature, profit effects typically are measured
using an event study methodology, which measures the change in the

equity    share price of a firm following an accident. This yields

an estimate of the expected change in the present discounted value

of future profits resulting from the accident. Traffic responses

have been analyzed both by examining changes in "before and after"

market shares and by measuring the deviation from predicted demand

using econometric models of airline demand functions. The saaples

are restricted to fatal accidents, and most studies exclude cargo


                                        20
and crew only (re-positioning) flights. These criteria select the

worse end mare highly pttlicized     accidents   for analysis.

Aircraft reagflior,

          Studies   of aircraft reputation effects have focused on     two

DC-1O   crashes: the American Airlines Chicago crash on May 25,
1979, which is   the worst domestic U.S. airLine accident (273

fatalities), and the    United Airlines Sioux City c!ash on JuLy 19,
1989 (Barnett and LoFaso, 1983; ChaLk, 1986; Karets, 1989;

Barnett, Menighetti, and Prete, 1990). Both of these accidents

raised concerns about potential DC-10 manufacturing or design

probleme. One study (ChaLk, 1987) aLso examines accident effects

on aircraft manufacturers' profits across a broader saripte of

"suspect" crashes.8 What do these anaLyses reveal?

          The 1979 DC-iD crash provides some evidence of a market

penalty for aircraft manufacturers. McDonnell Douglas, the

manufacturer of the DC-10, lost roughLy 10 percent of its equity

market vaLue, or approximately $100 mit lion, in the first four

days after the accident.9 The firm's shares declined by an

additional 10   perÃ³ent when the FM announced its unprecedented
decertification of the DC-lO, an action that grounded the         entire
DC-iD fleet indefinitely. These market value declines are

sttstantially   larger than any   direct   costs inposed by the



      8
         Chance and Ferris (1987) find no effect on the manufacturer
for a saiiple of 46 accidents over the 1962-1985 period. Their sairpLe
is   not, however, stratified by Likely cause of the accident.

        The accident occurred after the market close on Friday, May
25, of Memorial Day weekend. The share price response therefore is
measured from the Friday close to the Tuesday cLoae. See ChaLk
(1986).

                                    21
accident, and wouLd be consistent with Lower expected sates of

McDonnell Douglas aircraft as a result of the accident.1Â°

          These deaL ines   are not representative of responses to

other   accidents,   however. In contrast to the 1979 experience,

McDonneLl   DougLas appears to have been uraffected by the 1989

Sioux City accident. Despite earLy reports that the design of the

DC-la hydrauLic system was a major factor in the crash, returns on
McDonnell DougLas stock were comensurate with market returns over

the days following the accident.11 Chalk's (1987) evidence on

manufacturer Losses for a sauple of 19 accidents to which aircraft

failures contributed suggests modest profit Losses, but these

estimates may be strongLy affected by the inclusion of the 1979

DC-iD crash in the sarple. Chalk finds an average share price

decLine of roughLy 4% over the five business days following an

accident, corresponding to an average Loss of $21 miLLion in

market value. His data indicate no statistically significant

share price effects for accidents involving Boeing or Lockheed

aircraft, however, and the estimated average McDonnell DougLas




        10 As new information suggested that icrproper maintenance
practices were the Likely cause of the accident, at Least part of the
initial share price declines were reversed. The exact estimates of
the net effect on McDonnell Douglas appear highly dependent on the
time period over which stock returns are evaluated. Chalk (1986)
reports statisticaLLy significant net declines of 14 to 22 percent
through various dates in July 1979.     KareLs' (1989) attenpts to
reproduce these results yieLded estimates of +1 through -21 percent
net returns, all statisticaLLy insignificant.

        The accident occurred after the market cLosed on July 19;
July 20 therefore is the first post-crash return day. McDonnell
Douglas shares Lost nearly 7% on July 19, probably due to its
announcement on that day of unexpectedly large second quarter losses.
On July 20, McDonnell Douglas shares decLined 0.9%, cospared to a
0.7% for the market as a whole. McDonnell Douglas share prices rose
over the next week.

                                     22
decline is likely to be quite skewed by the massive declines

associated with the 1979 crash.

        Profit decLines for aircraft manufacturers do not appear

to result from passenger avoidance of aircraft involved in fataL

accidents. Barnett and Lofaso's (1983) study of DC-ID market

shares 6 months before and 6 months alter the 1979 crash revealed

no systematic changes in traveLLers' behavior on a sasrÃ§Le of 18

routes.'2 En a study of travel agency ticketing data, Barnett,

l4enighetti, and Prete (199G) find evidence of very short-term DC-

10 avoidance lot towing the 1989 Sioux City crash. In their sampLe

of 14 routes, I in 3 passengers who booked traveL within the first

2 weeks after the crash avoided choosing DC-iD fLights, relative

to pre-crash behavior. This behavior quickLy dissipated, however,

with booking shares returning to within 10% of pre-crash Levels by

8 weeks after the crash.13 P1oreover, despite the deveLopment of

sophisticated pricing and inventory management systems by 1989,

airLines did not appear to tower prices on DC-iD fLights in

response to initial traffic declines.

        Finally, there is some evidence that the 1979 DC-10 crash

adversely affected airlines that owned substantiaL nunbers of

these aircraft1 aLthough there have been no general studies of

this effect. Karets (1989) finds share price declines for both




     12 WhiLe Barnett and Lofaso control for sie airLine route
characteristics, they do not have data on average fares.      It is
possible that airlines with DC-lU service towered fares to retain
market shares. The study of the 1989 DC-lU crash suggests that this
expLanation is unlikely to account for their result.

     13 The study did not examine booking patterns beyond 8 weeks
post-crash.

                                  23
American Airlines (the operator invoLved in the crash) and a

portfoLio of other airLines operating DC-lOs in the aftermath of

the 1979 accident. The first response to the crash was a 2%

decline in share values, aLthough this could not be statisticaLLy

distinguished from zero. The decertification arrouncement Led to

a 5.3% decline for American and a 2.9% decline for the other DC-1O

airLines. A portfolio of non-DC-1O airLines was unaffected.

          How should we interpret these studies? It seems premature

to cite these as confirmation of a "reputation effect," at Least

in the   sense that "market forces can conpel producers to invest in
safety, even if consijeers   are ignorant of all the   technicaL

details of the product" (ChaLk, 1986))' The strongest evidence

of market responses is associated with the 1979 American Airlines

DC-1O crash; evidence of market responses to other accidents is

weak to non-existent. In 1979, however, the market may have been

responding more to specific FAA interventions than to general

reputation effects.     FAA airworthiness directives can require

airlines and manufacturers to invest substantiaL amounts in

inspections and repairs, repLacements, or re-designs of aircraft

ccmponents. The FAA's 1979 decision to revoke the DC-iD's

certificate grounded the existing fLeet of DC-lOs indefinitely

(inducing direct losses for DC-iD operators) and raised the

possibility that McDorvieLL DougLas would be required to make

extensive modifications as a prerequisite to setting any




     14 One should rementer that while air passengers may not be
weLL informed about technical characteristics, theyare only indirect
consuners of aircraft services. The direct customers of aircraft
manufacturers are airlines, which tend to be highLy knowledgeable and
sophisticated buyers.

                                   24
additionaL aircraft   (and re-certifying the existing fleet). While

market   reputation effects and direct FAA interventions   both may

induce manufacturers to invest in aircraft safety, the policy

inpLications of these two mechanisas are quite different. The

existing eirpiricaL evidence does not decisiveLy indicate which

mechanism is more ilTÃ§ortant.

Airline reoutation

          A nuther of studies have investigated markat responses to

accidents at the airline level: does an accident reduce the

airline's expected profitabiLity? Two of the more interesting and

careful of these anaLyses are Borenstein and Zirmnerman's (1988)

study, which couples an investigation of profit effects with

traffic responses. and Mitchell and Maloney's (1989) study, which

pairs an examination of profit effects for different classes of

accidents with a study of insurance premia changes.        Both find

evidence of modest profitability decLines in response to fataL

accidents.

          Borenstein and Zinnerman anaLyze responses to 74 fataL

accidents over 1962-85. For the 62 accidents that occurred while

passengers were on board the aircraft, they find an average

decline in equity value of roughLy 1.3% on the first trading day

following the accident, and 1.5% over the first two days following

the accident. This translates into an average $12 million Loss in

1990 dollars.15 MitcheLl and Maloney divide their saaLe of 56

accidents over 1964-87 into 34 "piLot error" crashes and 22

"carrier not at fault" crashes. For the pilot error sanÃ§le, they



          All dollar values reported in this section have been
escaLated to 1990 doLLars using the 17!.

                                  25
find a one day decline of roughly 1.6% and a two-thy decline of

roughly 2.3%.ubo   This   corresponds to an average Loss in equity

value of $22 to $31 million in 1990 dollars.            Because airlines

typicalLy carry quite coeplete hull (aircraft) and Liability

insurance, most of the equity decline appears to arise from

prospective Losses, rather than actual cash outlays resulting from

the   current accident. Two possible sources of prospective Losses

are increased insurance premia and reduced demand due to

reputation effects. Mitchell and MaLoney estimate that the

additional liabiLity insurance cost over a five year period

following an at-fault accident is roughly 90 percent of the one

year premiin pre-crash. The total present discounted value of

insurance increases average about $10 miLLion in 1990 dollars.'7

This accounts for one-third to one-half of their estimated decline

in equity value.

          Borenstein and Zirmierman   investigate   the inact of

accidents on demand for an airLine's services. They find

virtuatly no effect of an accident on demand during the reguLated

period of their saripLe (1960-77). After deregulation, there may

be a short-term demand response to an accident. In their sarrÃ§le




     16 The point estimate declines for the carrier not at fault
sasple are about half as Large and are quite irecisely estimated.
This may suggest, as Mitchell and MaLoney conclude, that the market
does not penalize airlines for accidents not caused by pilot error.
From a different perspective, however, a pooling test across the two
sauples would not reject the hypothesis that both sets of results are
drawn from the same distribution.

           Their results for huLL insurance increases are quite
sensitive to the specification of the model. An estimate of hull.
insurance increases is included in the total doLLar value of
insurance increases, howaver.

                                      26
of 13 accidents over 1978-85, estimates of the total loss in

demand    over   a four-month period average 10% to 15% of one-month's

traffic volune, although these estimates are at best of marginal

statistical significance. Consistent with the irplications of the

DC-b traffic response studies, this decline is quite short-Lived:

most of    the effect appears to be experienced   in   the first two
months following a crash.
           It is difficult to interpret these   resuLts. The demand

changes during the deregulation era, white relatively       small and
short-term, isply large revenue losses. For the sanple of 13

accidents, the average iuiplied revenue toss is over $100 million

in 1990 dollars.18 This suggests considerable market penalties

for airlines involved in fatal accidents. The strength of this

conclusion is, however, limited by a nuter of factors. First,

these results are based on a relatively small sanple and are

estimated very inpreciseLy. Second, the estimated revenue tosses

substantially exceed the estimated declines in equity value, and

the difference is unlikely to be accounted for by cost reductions

associated with serving fewer passengers in the very short-term.

Third, revenue tosses appear to be uncorrelated with the change in

equity value in this sample. Finally, there is reLatively little

evidence    that accidents have a significant effect on the demand or
profits of an airline's competitors. Over the entire deregulation
period, Borenstein and Zimmerman's point estimate of the demand

change    for other airlines following an accident is negative, but
very smalL and imprecisely      estimated. The 8 largest accidents



     18The trcertainty around this estimate is, however, enormous.

                                     27
(IOU or more fatalities) may have induced a small (1%) one-month

increase in demand for other airlines, but the stock price of

these airlines was unaffected. This suggests that most passengers

who would have flown an airline recently involved in an accident

instead choose not to fLy, which may npt be entirely plausible.

Further investigation, using the additional years of post-

deregulation data now available, appears necessary to address

these concerns and resolve the question of demand effects.

        WhUe the Literature suggests the possibility of some

market penalties for airlines that experience passenger

fataLities, these methodologies may be inherently incapable of

providing definitive tests of the strength of eircraft or airline

reputation effects.   AirLine accidents, while newsworthy, may not

be very informative, The expected (or optimaL) level of airline

safety is unlikeLy to involve zero accident risk. Given this, the

occurrence of an accident may not cause consuiiers to revise their

safety expectations for a firm. If an accident does not lead

constrers to revise their priors about an aircraft's or airline's

safety, consuners should not penalize the firm invoLved in the

accident. Minimal consuner responses to an accident therefore may

be consistent with both highly efficient reputation mechanisms

(e.g., where firms that deviate from expected safety levels would

be severeLy punished and therefore are deterred from ever

"cheating") and ineffective reputation mechanisms (e.g.1 where

consi.rers are unaware of the aircraft type used on particular

flights1 have difficulty assessing safety records and so are slow

to update their priors in response to accidents, or are slow to

respond to differences in perceived accident risks across aircraft


                                 28
or airLines). The existing analyses do not enabLe us to

distinguish these two extremes.




ConcLusion

           Economists have Learned a substantial amount about airline

safety1 even though many questions remain unanswered.     In fact,

one might wonder about the motivation I or devoting so riuch energy

to studying such a Low risk activity. Airline safety anaLyses

appear to have garnered a disproportionate share of major journal

pages in recent years, relative to more economically significant

risks. White our professional fascination may be inspired in part

by the amount of time we spend in the air, we are not aLone in

this interest. Airline accidents attract far more public

attention than most other sources of fatality risk, incLuding such

popular concerns as cancer, homicide, and AIDS. A recent analysis

of New York Times front page coverage, reproduced in table 1,

revealed   that "The Times had more page-one stories about the

dangers of flying than about any of ... five other [prominent]
threats   to Life, and on a per-death basis, it had orders of

magnitude more" (Barnett, 1990). This nationaL preoccupation with

airline safety may provide the uLtimate explanation for the high

safety standards maintained by U.S. carriers and the i,muense

irrprovements in air safety over time.
