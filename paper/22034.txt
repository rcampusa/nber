                                         ABSTRACT

Exposure to liquidity risk makes banks vulnerable to runs from both depositors and from
wholesale, short-term investors. This paper shows empirically that banks are also vulnerable to
run-like behavior from borrowers who delay their loan repayments (default). Firms in Italy
defaulted more against banks with high levels of past losses. We control for borrower
fundamentals with firm-quarter fixed effects; thus, identification comes from a firm's choice to
default against one bank versus another, depending upon their health. This `selective' default
increases where legal enforcement is weak. Poor enforcement thus can create a systematic loan
risk by encouraging borrowers to default en masse once the continuation value of their bank
relationships comes into doubt.

              Exposure to liquidity risk makes banks vulnerable to runs from both depositors
          and from wholesale, short-term investors. This paper shows empirically that banks are
          also vulnerable to run-like behavior from borrowers who delay their loan repayments
          (default). Firms in Italy defaulted more against banks with high levels of past losses. We
          control for borrower fundamentals with rm-quarter xed eects; thus, identication
          comes from a rm's choice to default against one bank versus another, depending upon
          their health. This `selective' default increases where legal enforcement is weak. Poor
          enforcement thus can create a systematic loan risk by encouraging borrowers to default
          en masse once the continuation value of their bank relationships comes into doubt.

cash solely because they expect others to do the same. In the aftermath of the nancial and


sovereign debt crises, these old-style depositor runs have been the exception rather than the

        2
rule.       But even in these modern crises, we have seen panic-motivated instances of drying up


of wholesale, short-term debt markets, and increases in collateral demands in asset-backed

                                           3
commercial paper and repo markets.             These episodes, often called `runs on the shadow


banking system in the US', create similar pressures on banks as traditional depositor runs,


making it hard for them to fund new loans and raising the likelihood that re sales of old


ones can cause insolvency. Similar liquidity pressures from the asset-side of banking emerged


following the collapse of Lehman, as rms drew down credit lines at banks perceived to be

                                                       4
more likely to restrict access to future liquidity.


    Both the traditional literature as well as recent studies of nancial crises emphasize


liquidity as the key risk that makes banks uniquely vulnerable. This framework rationalizes


a host of government interventions such as deposit insurance schemes and lenders of last


resort, as well as necessary but potentially distortive regulations on bank risk taking, capital


structure and liquidity exposure (e.g. Basel I, II and III).


    In this paper, we show that banks face a second source of vulnerability, one stemming


from borrowers rather than from demanders of liquidity. Using data from Italy leading up


to and following the Euro crisis, we provide evidence that bank instability can stem from


credit risk. The link between credit risk and bank stability is well known: history tells us


that waves of bank failures are often traceable to borrower losses and declines in the value

              5
of loans.         However, we highlight a new channel through which credit risk enhances bank


fragility. We show that borrowers selectively default against banks already weakened by past


bad loans; borrowers thus seem to default because they observe other borrowers doing so.

   2 Exceptions include the withdrawals of deposits from Northern Rock at the beginning of the nancial
crisis, and the more recent withdrawals of deposits from Greek banks during the negotiations with their
creditors.

   5 The principles for appropriate management of credit risk are also a long-lasting topic of debate for
regulators (e.g Basel I, II, III).




                                                   2
Our results emphasize the importance of legal enforcement in mitigating this problem, as


the magnitude of these `borrower runs' increases in areas of Italy where legal disputes take

                   6
longer to resolve.


    Our data allow us to capture a rm's decision to delay repayments of term loans as well


as draw-downs of lines of credit in excess of the maximum borrowing limit at the level of


the bank-borrower. Obviously, there can be multiple causes for a delay in loan repayments,


ranging from rm nancial distress to strategic considerations by rms about how such


behavior may aect their ongoing or future relationship with lenders. With regard to the


latter, a rm will be trading o the short-term gain of keeping control of nancial resources


(i.e.   by not paying now), against the potential future loss of impairing their relationship


with the current lender(s) or with potential future lender(s). The balance of this tradeo


may depend on the nancial health of the lender, on the bargaining power of the borrower,


and on the institutional environment that aects the ex post ability to recover collateral or


otherwise force repayment through the judicial process. Everything else equal, one would


expect a rm to be more likely to delay re-payment to weaker banks because the expected


value of the continuation of the relationship is smaller. Firms with greater bargaining power


- which we proxy by rm size - also ought to be more willing to default when lenders are


weak, either because lenders will be reluctant to cut o a large customer or because large


rms have better ability to switch lenders. Finally, rms will be more willing to delay loan


repayment the harder it is for lenders to recover their interests through the courts.


    Our evidence supports these predictions. We exploit a unique data set, the Italian Credit


Register, that contains detailed information on all bank loans above 30,000 Euros given to


rms. The data include information on repayment delays and the degree of impairment of


loans, including those that fall short of being formally classied as bad by the bank. The


solvency of Italian rms and the quality of loans has been strongly aected by the double

   6 In fact, reform of the Italian legal system has been a focus of recent eorts to help stimulate better
economic performance.   The Wall Street Journal reports that, The snail's pace of Italy's courts throws
sand into the wheels of the economy in myriad ways. Banks struggle to resolve bad loans because bringing
deadbeat debtors to court takes by far the longest in Europe. [Zempano, 2014]

dip recession following the global nancial crisis of 2007-08 and the sovereign debt crisis of

           7
2010-11.


    We match these data to individual balance sheets of banks reported to the Bank of


Italy, which is in charge of nancial supervision, as well as with borrower balance-sheet


data collected by the Balance Sheet Register (these data have been provided by lenders for


information-sharing purposes since 1983). The data can also be matched to measures of local


judicial (in)eciency in recovering the collateralized assets estimated by an index based on

                                      8
Italian Ministry of Justice data.         While civil law and procedures are formally the same


across the national territory in Italy, the real-world eectiveness of the court system varies


widely, depending upon local jurisdictional court proceedings (Carmignani and Giacomelli,


2009; Giacomelli and Menon, 2013). We exploit this regional and sub-regional variation to


test for the importance of legal enforcement on default behavior.


    As in other studies, we exploit the fact that many Italian rms borrow from multiple


banks. This feature allows us to introduce rm-specic, time-varying eects to fully absorb


rm-level fundamentals that may determine the decision to delay loan repayment.                        Our


identication thus comes solely from variation in bank characteristics, characteristics of the


bank-rm relationship, and, importantly, on the eciency of the court system.                    In other


words, we test how the     same rm       behaves with respect to    dierent banks, depending upon
the strength of the bank's balance sheet, the local judicial environment, and the nature of


the past bank-rm relationship.


    The results suggest that bank balance sheet strength - particularly past bad loans -


play an important role in determining the probability of a delay in loan repayment.                     In


our basic specication, the stock of past bad loans increases the probability of borrower


default. The result implies that, on average, banks with weaker balance sheets due to past


(and non-collectable) bad loans experience more future defaults (in the form of temporary

delays in repayment, many of which ultimately become permanently impaired).           That is,


we observe borrowers running on weak banks. The results hold when we allow the eect to


dier according to rm size: in this case the (absolute) value of the coecient increases in


rm size, suggesting that larger rms, presumably the ones with greater bargaining power,


tend to be those most likely to delay payment.


   When we allow the degree of local judicial eciency to interact with bank health (its


direct eect is absorbed by the xed eects), we nd that the impact of bad loans becomes


signicantly larger where the courts are less ecient.    This makes sense because a lower


probability of recovery of principal interest through weak courts reduces the cost to borrowers


of delaying repayments. In fact, we nd    no eect   of past bad loans on current default in


provinces where legal enforcement is strong. Thus, our results suggest that `borrower runs'


only occur when two conditions hold simultaneously: rst, the lender itself is weakened from


past losses and thus less able to commit to extending future credit; second, the lender's


ability to enforce contracts ex post is also weak due to poor legal enforcement. In our last


set of tests, we stratify rms by risk to test whether or not the behavior we document truly


reects strategic default. Are distressed borrowers merely selecting which banks to pay by


allocating a xed but limited cash-ow budget across lenders?       Or, are borrowers paying


less than they otherwise would because lenders are weak? In fact, we show that even the


safest rms exhibit this behavior. Even rms that could pay - those with high credit quality


- sometimes choose not to pay because of the conuence of weak banks and weak legal


enforcement.


   Our result suggests a strong policy implication:     improving banks' ex post ability to


enforce contracts in court removes the possibility of a potential bad equilibrium in which


the aggregate level of default is higher than would otherwise occur due to rms defaulting


strategically. The result supports recent eorts on legal reform, which have been driven by


the scale of bad loans in Italy.   In December of 2015, for example, bad loans summed to


about   Â¿200 billion, a large gure that represents approximately 11.0% of the total amount

                                              5
of loans given (18% including other troubled loans not written o ).         Unlike other recent


banking problems, where losses were concentrated in real estate or sovereign debt exposure,


close to 80% of these bad debts came from bank lending to non-nancial businesses, which is


the focus of our tests. Concern over declines in credit quality has prompted recent reforms


aimed at streamlining insolvency proceedings and speeding the process by which lenders can


repossess collateral on defaulted loans. According to our paper, legal reforms to improve the


eciency of the courts, and in particular to speed up the judicial or extrajudicial recovery


of collateral, oer the potential of substantial benets for Italy's banks (and, by extension,


the economy itself ), without any moral hazard downside.


    The structure of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we will review briey the theoretical


and empirical literature on borrower runs and discuss our contribution. In Section 3 we will


describe the data we use in our empirical analysis and outline the growing importance for


the Italian banking system of delayed loan repayment and bad loans generally.            Section


4 contains a description of our identication strategy, econometric methods and empirical


results. Section 5 concludes.




2      Literature Review
How does our contribution relate to the previous literature? Theoretical contributions sug-


gest that borrower runs are possible. Using a global games framework, Bond and Rai [2009]

                                                                         9
prove the existence of multiple equilibria in loan repayment behavior.       The crucial tradeo


for borrowers is represented by the present benet of default vs. the expected loss of future


access to credit conditional on default. The expected value of future access to credit depends


upon the likelihood that other borrowers will repay their loans, as this aects banks' lending


ability.   This externality can lead to outcomes in which a borrower defaults because she


expects others to do so. Carrasco and Salgado [2014] model borrower runs in the context

    9 On global games see, for instance, Morris and Shin [2001].




                                                      6

of a costly state verication model.            Equilibria with partial or complete default emerge


in this case as the result of banks' limited resources in auditing borrowers, resulting in a


reduction in the incentive for them to repay when defaults are expected to be high across


many borrowers.


   In both these theoretical frameworks, bank nancial health mitigates the probability of


a borrower run.       But there is no empirical evidence to our knowledge that a borrower's


decision to pay or not pay depends on the health or solvency of its bank, or on the default


behavior of other borrowers.        Our empirical work focuses primarily on indicators of bank


health such as capitalization, asset composition, past bad loans, stability of funding, size,


and protability.      Obviously the probability of default will depend critically on borrower


fundamentals. To isolate the eect of bank fundamentals, we study rms that borrow from


more than one lender, and we control for rm specic and time varying factors that aect a


rm's repayment capacity (either actual or expected).


   Beyond bank health, theory suggests that the occurrence of a borrower run will depend


upon the institutional environment in which contracting takes place. In particular, the ability


of creditors to recover the money lent will mitigate the incentive to delay repayment. Hence,


we study the eects of eciency of the local courts as a determinant of the decision to delay

             11
repayment.        Since La Porta et al. [1997] and La Porta et al. [1998], nancial economists have


emphasized the importance of legal contract enforcement in shaping nancial relationships.


Many of the empirical studies emphasize how measures of enforcement aect ex ante contract


terms such as ownership of debt and equity, the use of collateral and covenants in debt


contracts, and the availability and price of credit (see Roberts and Su [2009] for a survey


of the empirical literature).      Djankov et al. [2003] show that civil-law countries like Italy


tend to have greater legal formalism and experience longer delays in resolving commercial


disputes (collecting on bad checks or evicting non-paying tenants) compared to common

  10 See Gale and Hellwig [1985] and Townsend [1979].
  11 In a costly state verication model, for instance, court eciency will be reected in and captured by the
monitoring/auditing cost parameter.




                                                      7
law countries.    Jappelli et al. [2005] study Italy, as we do, and show that credit is more


available and at lower prices in regions with better enforcement in court. A number of other


studies use changes in bankruptcy laws, mechanisms, or regulations as exogenous shocks to


enforcement costs to trace out the eects on credit supply. For example, Scott and Smith


[1986] nd that increased debtor protection following the 1978 bankruptcy reform in the


US, and hence weaker enforcement, was followed by an increase in interest rates on loans to


small borrowers. Fedaseyeu [2015] exploits changes in state regulation of debt collectors -


an important enforcement mechanism outside bankruptcy - and nds that credit supply to


high-risk borrowers increases with less restrictive regulation of the debt collection business.


Gropp et al. [1997] show that reductions in enforcement from state-level variation in the


amount that individuals can shield in bankruptcy from their creditors via the homestead


exemption both constrains credit supply and increases credit demand.


    A number of recent studies have found that credit supply by distressed banks was con-


strained in Italy during both the 2007-2008 global nancial crisis as well as the more recent


Euro crisis (e.g.    Albertazzi and Marchetti, 2010;Bolton et al., 2013; and Bofondi et al.,


2013). In addition, bank distress stemming from exposure to risky sovereign debt reduced


credit supply and helped propagate the Euro crisis from distressed to non-distressed coun-

                                                                                            12
tries across the Euro system (e.g. Popov and van Horen [2013], Marco [2015]).                    Our study


helps rationalize this behavior, as we show that past distress raises the risk of future rm's


default (even holding constant borrower fundamentals); hence, it makes sense that distressed


banks would raise the price and restrict access to credit when extending new loans.


    As far as we know there is no empirical evidence of borrower runs motivated by concern


about bank loan losses or insolvency. Ivashina and Scharfstein [2010] do provide evidence that


US rms drew more on their credit lines with banks that had a relationship with Lehman, but


the mechanism they emphasize stems not from borrower unwillingness to re-pay their debt


(our mechanism), but instead from borrower concern that liquidity would not be available

  12 On the real consequences of credit supply shocks in Italy see Cingano et al. [2013] and Balduzzi et al.
[2014].




                                                     8
in the future for the lending bank, leading to increased drawdowns on existing credit lines.


Similarly, Ippolito et al. [2015] show that Italian rms with multiple credit lines drew more


from banks that had higher pre-crisis exposure to the interbank market and thereby were


more liquidity constrained. Their paper emphasizes the traditional source of bank instability:


liquidity risk.    Trautmann and Vlahu [2013] provides experimental evidence that solvent


borrowers may be more likely to default strategically when their bank's expected strength


is low and when their own expected repayment capacity is low. Survey-based evidence of


strategic behavior by US households in mortgage markets has been provided in Guiso et al.


[2013a]. They nd that the propensity to default by households, even if solvent, is aected


by both pecuniary and non-pecuniary factors such as views of fairness and morality. It is


also related to the exposure to other people who have strategically defaulted.


    We share with Ippolito et al. [2015] the focus on Italian rms and the use of the Italian


Credit Register. Our emphasis, however, is on a dierent form of runs, one that stems from


the credit-risk side of the business - delayed loan repayment - and that is motivated by


concern about a bank's viability and ability to extend credit itself in the medium term, as


opposed to having short term funding issues. Moreover, our contribution provides evidence


on the key role of the courts as a determinant of the likelihood of borrower runs, in addition


to rm size and the nature of the previous bank-rm relationship. The ineciency of the


court system in Italy is a very important policy issue aecting Italy's economic performance

                         13
in many dimensions.

  13 The complex regulatory system, the relative ineciency of public procedures and government action,
the slowness of the justice system [...] all hinder the reallocation of productive resources to the most ecient
rms, which is one of the main mechanisms of productivity growth. [...]The large stock of non-performing
loans also reects the very long and variable duration of insolvency and credit recovery procedures, due
in turn to the country's cumbersome civil justice system. These widespread ineciencies depress potential
buyers' valuations of impaired assets and discourage their sale on the market (Ignazio Visco, Governor's
Concluding Remarks, Bank of Italy, 2015a).

3      Data Description
To estimate our model we need information about the (ex post) performance of bank loans


extended to non-nancial corporations, the nancial health of their lenders (banks), the


eciency of the judicial system, and characteristics of borrowers as well as the type of


lending relationship they have with their banks. Our dataset thus combines four sources of


information existing in Italy: (i) the Balance Sheet Register; (ii) the Credit Register; (iii)


measures on the functioning of the judicial system estimated from data provided by the


Ministry of Justice; and, (iv) the Bank of Italy's Supervisory Reports.


     The Balance Sheet Register provides our sample of non-nancial rms.                It consists of


around 32,000 industrial rms, 99% of which are unlisted. The Register accounts for more


than 70% of industrial sector value added over the scal years 2008-13. The Balance Sheet


Register is a proprietary database set up and managed by Cerved SPA, using data deposited

                                                                                   14
by rms at the local Chambers of Commerce, as required by Italian law.                  Data from the


Balance Sheet Register have been used extensively since 1983 by both lenders to assess rm


soundness as well as by scholars to investigate various research questions.


     The Credit Register, an archive maintained by the Bank of Italy, provides lender-borrower


level data on characteristics of loans extended by banks operating in Italy. The data include


information on loan type (credit lines, term loans), size, maturity, the pledging of real collat-


eral, personal guarantees, accounts receivable, and ex post performance. Loans are reported


when tranches exceed Euro 30,000 by the entire population of credit institutions. Hence we


capture all but the very smallest rms borrowing from banks.


     We use data from the Ministry of Justice to build a measure of enforcement for creditors


based on the length of legal proceedings across Italy. Specically, we use court-level data on


the mean time to resolve matters regarding the execution of property. Following Carmignani


and Giacomelli [2009] and Giacomelli and Menon [2013], we apply the formula adopted


by the Italian Ministry of Justice and the Italian National Institute of Statistics (Istat) to

calculate the court-level indicators on the length of proceedings in 2007. The length of court


proceedings is an inverse measure of eciency (or a measure of ineciency). We apply the


following formula to the ow data disseminated by the Ministry of Justice:



                                                    Pt + Pt+1
                                             Dt =
                                                     Et + Ft

where   Dt   is time to resolve matters regarding the execution property in years,            Pt   are pending


cases at the beginning of 2007,       Ft   are new cases led during 2007 and         Et   are cases ending


with a judicial decisions or withdrawn by the parties during 2007. We are careful to measure


judicial eciency before the onset of the banking losses that began in the wake of the Euro


crisis (and before the beginning of our sample in 2008). Measured this way, we avoid reverse


causality whereby a high level of distressed loans, by clogging up the courts, leads to an


increase in the measure of judicial ineciency.


    In assigning each loan contract to a judicial jurisdiction, we use the judicial court located


where the bank owning the branch has its legal residence.                  This choice is motivated by


the fact that, in loan contracts, banks usually indicate the judicial court where the bank


has its legal residence as the one that will be in charge in case of legal disputes with the


borrowing rm. Ex post enforcement, however, requires several steps. First, lenders need an


injunction from the court typically located in the province of its head oce. Having gotten


an injunction, to take possession of collateral the lender then must adjudicate before the


court in the location of the collateral, which is likely, but not certain, to coincide with the


rm's location. The latter, in turn, may or may not coincide with the legal location of the


bank. Thus, legal enforcement in two provinces may matter. Since the process always begins


in the bank's province, we report most of our models using legal enforcement measured in


the province of lender's head oce. The time to get an injunction or to recover the collateral

                                                                                              15
are highly correlated and conclusions are, therefore, insensitive to this choice.                  We present

  15 The correlation between the variable on the length of the rst part of the judicial process (Processi di
Cognizione Ordinaria) and that for the proceedings of property executions is close to 0.7.




                                                     11
results using the latter measure, but we also report a robustness test in which we remove


any ambiguity about legal eciency by including only observations in which the lender and


borrower reside in the same province.


    Finally, we obtain bank balance sheet data from the Supervisory Reports collected by the


Bank of Italy, which is in charge of banking supervision in Italy. We use aggregate data for


banks belonging to banking groups or holdings, and individual data for stand-alone banks,


as we want to avoid measurement errors in our bank quality indicators due to infra-group

                              16
reallocations of resources.




3.1 Some facts on loan quality, bank quality and judicial eciency
        in Italy
The formal classication of problematic loans adopted by Italian banks is ample and includes


four categories: (i) Past due/overdrawn more than 90 days, (ii) substandard loans, (iii)


restructured exposures and (iv) bad loans. Past due/overdrawn by more than 90 days


are exposures (other than those classied as bad loans, substandard or restructured) whose


repayments have been delayed by the borrowers for more than 90 days on a continuous ba-


sis. Substandard loans are exposures to counterparties which face temporary diculties


expected to be overcome within a reasonable period of time. Specically, this class includes


two subsets of problematic loans: the rst one includes loans which are objectively sub-


standard, such as loans or credit lines which are past due or overdrawn; the second group


includes loans classied by the lender as substandard according to a judgmental basis only,


meaning without any formal loan repayment delays to the bank in question or overdrawing


on existing credit lines. This judgment could also depend upon a delay in payments to                other
lenders. Restructured loans are exposures in which lenders, as a result of the deterioration


of the borrower's nancial situation, agree to change the original conditions, giving rise to

  16 Data on branches of foreign banks operating in Italy have been discarded from the dataset, as aggregate
data are not available for holdings which are headquartered outside Italy.




                                                    12
a loss for the creditor.       Finally, the bad loans category includes exposures to insolvent


counterparties (even if not legally ascertained), regardless of any loss estimate made by the

                                                                         17
bank and irrespective of any possible collateral or guarantee.


    Table 1a shows the relative importance of these four categories and how they have evolved


over time during our sample. Loans were broadly performing well before the 2007-09 nancial


crisis: the share of performing loans exceeds 98% in 2006-2008. The quality of lending began


to worsen in 2009 (96% performing), and then fell in each year through 2014, i.e. after the


2007-09 nancial crisis and especially after the sovereign debt crisis, which was accompanied

                                                                              18
by a worsening of the real performance of the Italian economy.


    In Table 1b we report the transition matrix (looking ahead one year) for all the borrowers

                                                                                    19
in Italy based on data on loan quality published by the Bank of Italy.                   These data indicate


that in the rst part of the sampled period around half of loans past due or overdrawn


become performing again. However, after the sovereign debt crisis many of them eventually


end up in the bad-loan category. For example, as of 2009, 51% of late or overdrawn loans


were performing one year later. In contrast, this probability falls to just 27% by the end of


2013. During the latter years, the typical scenario for a loan would be to move rst from the

  17 As of September 2014, non-performing exposures are classied according to denitions established by
the European Banking Authority.      The new denitions, to be used for harmonized supervisory nancial
reporting across Europe, are basically in line with those that were in force in Italy before the break and that
were used by banks to classify the quality of the loans we analyze in this paper.
  18 The large volume of bad loans also reects constraints and rigidities that oblige Italian banks to keep
impaired assets on their books much longer than banks in other main countries. Among others, the unfa-
vorable tax treatment of write os as well as the length of bankruptcy procedures limit the incentives for
banks to sell problematic loans and restrain the development of a large secondary market for these assets.
On this accounts, in May 2015, the Italian Government has taken measures to make loan losses immediately
tax deductible.   Incentives for developing the market in non-performing loans could also come from:        (i)
legislative measures adopted by the Government in 2015 and 2016 to shorten credit recovery times and align
them with international best practices; (ii) the state guarantee scheme oered at market conditions for senior
tranches of securitized bad debts (following an agreement reached with the European Commission); (iii) the
investments of Atlante, a private fund that can operate on the riskiest securitization tranches.
  19 Table 1b reports a transition matrix, which is based on the data published in the Bank of Italy's
Annual report. Data refer to the universe of banks and nancial intermediaries operating in Italy and to
the population of non-nancial companies recorded in the Register (see Bank of Italy [2015b],Table A6.15,
page 56, Banche e societÃ  nanziarie: matrici di transizione tra classi di anomalia nel rimborso dei prestiti).
Transitions are obtained by comparing the classication of a single borrower, at the beginning and at the end
of the observation periods, across the loan quality classes as they are dened in the methodological appendix
to the table (see page 197).




                                                      13
late category to the substandard category (probability > 40%) and then to transition from


substandard to the bad loans category (probability around 25%). As the transition matrix


shows, once a loan goes bad, it stays bad (bad loans is eectively an absorbing state).


   The key outcome variable of this study is intended to measure a borrower's decision to


delay repayment to its bank. As such, we construct     late payment   as an indicator that equals


one if the rm has a loan with a bank classied as `past due/overdrawn', or `objective (past


due/overdrawn) substandard', and equal to zero if the loan is `performing'.         We focus on


the initial phase of the process of the loan quality deterioration because we want to avoid


measurement errors when we capture the rm's decision to default: in particular we want to


capture, as much as possible, a rm's   decision   to delay its payments. Therefore, we discard


the judgmental component of substandard loans, which are based on the subjective choice


of the lender, and restructured loans, which depend upon a bargaining between the bank


and the rm. We also discard in our dependent variable those loans classied as bad loans,


which reect a bank's nal determination that the loan will not be repaid.


   Table 1a and Figure 1 show the development of        late payment   - our dependent variable


- over time. The share of loans in default increases almost monotonically, starting in 2009.


A similar development - even if the share of default is slightly lower - is observed when we


exclude credit lines from the ratio and consider the aggregate, which includes term loans


only.


   The empirical model, spelled out in the next section explicitly, links borrower default to


measures of bank characteristics, including a measure of bank losses associated with changes


in the value of the sovereign bonds. See the Data Appendix for a description of the variables


and their data sources.


   Table 2 reports basic summary statistics on the characteristics of banks during our sample


(2008-2013).   Most variables are available at quarterly frequency.       The prot variable is


reported, however, only at a bi-annual frequency, so we present results with and without this


variable. Our key measure of bank health - bad loans / total assets - varies substantially,




                                              14
reecting both changes across time (as in Figure 1), as well as substantial variation in the


cross section. We also capture liquidity-risk exposure of banks in two ways, one from each


side of the balance sheet.    Italian lenders rely strongly on stable sources of funding, i.e.


deposits from residents and bank bonds held by households, which account for around 60%


of their balance sheets.    Stable funding also varies dramatically across the sample, with


some banks having around 90% stable funds and others relying mainly on other sources of


funds, such as,   inter alia, short-term wholesale funds.   For asset liquidity, we again observe


substantial variation, with the share of assets in bonds and cash varying from 5% to almost


half of the balance sheet. We also control for lender size. As in most countries, most of the


695 banks employed in this study are small, with a median asset size of 430 million Euro,


but the largest banks have over 200 billion Euro in total assets.


   Table 3 reports statistics on the borrowers.     The median rm has about 50 employees


and 14 million Euros in assets. Leverage varies from around 2% to around 60% of assets,


with a median of about 30%. Firm age averages 25 years. Overall, our sample is dominated


by privately held, small and medium-sized rms.        That said, our main results discussed


below absorb with a quarter-rm dummy the direct eects of constant and time-varying


rm characteristics to focus on bank eects on default.


   As far as the eciency of the judiciary in protecting creditors, Table 4 shows that the


estimated average duration of the property execution proceedings was more than three years,


equal to 1,189 days in Italy in 2007. However, signicant disparities are observable across


Italy, with the duration ranging from under one year for the Court of Crema to close seven


years for that of Cosenza. Figure 2 shows a marked contrast between the areas of the northern


and the southern parts of Italy, with the latter characterized by a signicant higher length of


the judicial proceedings. That said, heterogeneity exists across court jurisdictions operating


within these two broad areas. For example, the estimated length of the proceedings in the


Judicial Courts of Ragusa and Brindisi - both localized in the South - are equal to 3,336 and


1,137 days, respectively.

4     Econometric Methods and Results
We estimate a linear probability model that links borrower payment delays to a set of bank


eects, rm-time eects and measures of bank characteristics, as follows:



                                              K
                                              X
                                   yi,b,t =         Î±k xb,tâˆ’1 + Î¸i,t + Î´b + Îµi,b,t
                                              k=1


where   i   denotes rm,   b   denotes bank and         t   denotes time (quarterly or bi-annual frequency).


The outcome      yi,b,t (late payment )   equals an indicator variable set to 1 if the rm has a loan


repayment delay or overdrawn with the bank in the quarter and 0 if loans granted by the


bank to the rm are performing in the quarter.                     Explanatory variables (xb,tâˆ’1 ) are time-


varying bank characteristics from the end of the previous period.                       We include the log of


bank assets to capture bank size (            lntot )   and consider capitalization (       cap ),   the amount of


stable sources of funding (       stable ),   liquid assets (     liquidity )   and ROE (prots )     as bank-level


covariates; to capture the strength of the (lending) relationship between the bank and the


rm, we use the share of loans from bank                b   to rm   i (bkshare ).
    Our main variable of interest is the ratio of past bad loans to total assets (                     badloans ), a
measure of bank health that captures the extent to which a bank has already experienced


high levels of borrower default. We allow the eects of bad loans to vary according to the


judicial eciency of the local courts (measured by the log of the average length of property


execution proceedings (        ineaw )), as well as by rm size (captured by indicators for small,
medium-small, medium-large, and large rms by assets); we interact bad loans (as well as


other bank co-variates) with each of these variables in some of our specications. In our last


set of tests, we report interactive models based on rm credit quality.


    To absorb unobserved heterogeneity at the bank level, we control for bank xed eects


(Î´b ). These eects capture time invariant components of managerial quality, the quality of


governance, market structure, and so on. Moreover, our main variable of interest varies at


the bank level over time, so we cluster standard errors at the bank level.                           The rm-time



                                                             16
eects (Î¸i,t ) control non-parametrically for all characteristic of borrowers that might lead to


default across all lenders, such as lack of investment opportunities or business fundamentals


related to risk, poor cash ow or low prot realizations, as well as other hard-to-measure


time-varying attributes that might be correlated with default. By absorbing these eects, we


focus on a rm's decision as to which of its banks to pay and which not to pay. Identication


comes only from rms which pay some of their banks but not others (in a given quarter).


Any borrower paying all of its banks on time, or failing to pay all of its banks, is taken out


by the rm-time eect. Thus, we can interpret the          Î±k   coecients as measures of `selective'


default - the extent to which a rm chooses to default, in the sense of not repaying the loan


plus interest when it is due, with respect to one bank vs. another.


   Our study rests on the assumption that borrowers pay attention to the quality of their


banks' balance sheets, as it might inuence lenders' ability to extend credit in the future. This


is a very plausible assumption because bank balance sheet information is easily available and


widely disseminated, including the information on loan quality. Moreover, as the problem of


bad loans on banks balance sheet mounted, the national and international press have been

                                                                                 20
focusing on credit quality as the main factor determining bank fragility.




4.1 Baseline result: Accumulated bad loans encourage rms to de-
          lay repayment (default)
Table 5 reports our baseline specication with no interactive eects. As said, our sample


covers the period 2008Q4-2013Q4; bi-annual data are used in regressions which include


prots.   These regressions focus strictly on the total eect of bank variables on rm's choice


to delay loan repayment (i.e. to default). Columns (1)-(7) report the results for each bank


characteristic one by one, and columns (8) and (9) report the multivariate models. Models


with bank prots (columns (7) and (9)) have somewhat fewer than half of the observations


because this variable is reported bi-annually, rather than quarterly.

 20 See, for instance, Pavesi [2015] or Legorano [2013].



                                                     17
   We nd strong evidence that bank weakness leads rms to increase their willingness


to default.   Firms with more than one bank selectively default against the weaker one(s).


Specically, default is more likely at banks with high levels of past bad loans. These eects


are large, both statistically and economically. For example, an increase in bad loans from


the 25th to the 75th percentile (a change of about 0.05 - see Table 2) is associated with


an increase in default of 0.5 percentage points (=     0.05 Ã— 0.114;   see column (8)), which is


large relative to the average default probability of about 3% (recall Table 1a). The eect is


robust, entering the regressions with a similar magnitude irrespective of the specication or


the sample (the sample drops by more than half when we include bank prot). The result


suggests that extending credit can create bank instability, apart from the standard channel


based on liquidity exposure: borrowers' tendency to default increases as they observe others


doing so. This externality suggests the possibility of a bad equilibrium in which `borrower


runs' lead to bank distress and failure.


   We also nd some evidence, although less statistically robust, that banks with greater


losses from sovereign exposure face higher levels of default (columns (6) and (8)). In addi-


tion, rms are more likely to default as their share of borrowing from a bank increases; this


eect may be rationalized by interpreting   delay as a form of exibility called for by distressed
borrowers to relationship lenders or it might simply reect the idea that rms facing nan-


cial constraints have more to gain (at least in the short term) by defaulting against banks


to whom they owe more. Another possible explanation is that rms with large loans are,


paradoxically, in a stronger bargaining position vis-Ã -vis the bank, because they are aware


of the possible reluctance of banks to formally classify large loans as bad.


   We nd no evidence that bank size or bank prots aect default behavior. We also nd


no evidence that bank liquidity stress - either from a low share of assets in liquid investments


or heavy reliance on wholesale fund (low stable funds) - aects default. This last non-result


contrasts sharply with that of Ippolito et al. [2015], who show that rm drawdowns on


credit lines increase at banks facing funding pressures around the Lehman bankruptcy. The




                                               18
dierence in results is likely to reect the dierent periods investigated by the two papers.


Specically, we do not focus on the immediate aftermath of the Lehman bankruptcy, but


consider a longer period which is characterized by massive injection of liquidity by the


European Central Bank that strongly alleviated liquidity shortages and funding problems of


European banks.




4.1.1 Results by rm size and bank share

Table 6 extends the baseline model by allowing the marginal eect of bank characteristics


to vary by borrower size. We accomplish this by sorting borrowers into four equal-sized bins


based on total assets and allowing the slope coecients to dier for each group (the direct


eect of the rm size-bin indicators, like all other rm characteristics, gets absorbed by the


rm-time eects). These results accomplish two goals. First, they show that the main result


- increased delayed-payment default at banks exposed to past bad loans - is robust across


the rm-size distribution in most specications. Second, the magnitude of this eect grows


with rm size, and these dierences are statistically signicant at conventional levels in the


specication including bank prots (see F-statistics in Table 6 that tests the equality of the


bad loan coecient across size classes). Thus, rms with greater bargaining power due to


a better ability to switch lenders - large rms - seem more apt to take advantage by not


paying their banks weakened by past bad loans.


   Like Table 6, Table 7 extends the baseline model, this time by allowing the marginal


eect of bank characteristics to vary with the rm's share of borrowing from the bank. Here,


we test whether an increase in the importance of the bank to the rm - a plausible measure


of the strength of the bank relationship - aects the rm's willingness to default selectively.


We nd no such evidence. The share of total borrowing from a given bank does not interact


signicantly with any measure of bank characteristic, including past bad loans.




                                              19
4.2 Judicial eciency and selective default
Table 8 reports the baseline model augmented with interactions of the bank characteristics


with our measure of enforcement - the natural log of the average durations for property


execution proceedings (      ineaw )    - which varies widely across judicial courts (recall Figure

      21
2).


      These results show that bank weakness aects rm-level default choices most in areas


with weak enforcement (columns (5), (8) and (9)). The positive interaction between bank


health (bad loans) and weak enforcement also demonstrates that the default behavior reects


borrower rather than lender decisions.           One alternative explanation for the main eect in


Table 5 might be that weak lenders invoke their contractual rights to force early repayment


more aggressively than less-distressed lenders. This would generate greater defaults at more


distressed lenders, even for the same borrower. But this behavior would be more attractive


for lenders operating where their ex post bargaining power, due to ecient court proceedings,


is strong. We nd, instead, that the behavior happens most where                  borrower's      bargaining


power is strong (in addition, we do not use default events in which loan's terms have been


restructured; these cases would reect negotiation between borrower and lender).


      To understand magnitudes, Figure 3 plots the marginal eect of bad loans on default


likelihood as a function of the level of enforcement, from the 5th to the 95th percentile of


its distribution. The marginal eect of bad loans clearly increases in the length of time for


property execution in court.         At the mean, the marginal eect of bad loans is about 0.09


(=    âˆ’1.301 + 0.196 Ã— ln (1189);     see column (8)), close to what we nd in the non-interactive


regressions of Table 7. The eect implies that a one standard deviation increase in bad loans


would increase defaults by about 0.5 percentage points. In contrast, where enforcement is


poor - one standard deviation lower than average (e.g. Cosenza) - the eect roughly doubles.


In courts with good enforcement (e.g. Crema), in contrast, the eect of past bad loans on

  21 The main eect of   ineaw   is absorbed by the bank xed eect since   ineaw   is time-invariant and the
jurisdiction is assigned on the basis of the legal residence of the bank.




                                                      20
defaults is small and not statistically signicant (standard error bands surround zero). This


variation emphasizes the importance of legal enforcement, as we only see evidence of rms


selectively defaulting against weak banks where their ex post ability to enforce is weak. Thus,


where enforcement is weak borrowers pay mainly to preserve access to future credit, much


as the incentive of sovereign governments to repay debt resides primarily in their concern


about borrowing in future years [Shleifer, 2003].


   Table 9 re-introduces the rm-size interaction eects, again by estimating slope coef-


cients separately across size bins.   Since the model now has both a direct eect and an


interactive eect, we estimate a pair of coecients on each bank characteristic in each of the


four rm-size bins (i.e., eight coecients for each bank characteristic). These models suggest


the following: 1) banks with more bad loans face a greater level of default, conrming the


previous result; 2) this result is substantially stronger in regions with poor legal enforcement,


again conrming Table 8; and, 3) this result is robust across borrower size categories. That


said, the evidence in Table 6 - that the tendency to default selectively increases with borrower


size - appears less compelling. We do nd a stronger eect of bank exposure to bad loans


on default for the largest vs. the second-to-largest group of rms, but the coecient bands


for the parameters of these two groups are overlapping and if we test the joint hypothesis


across all four size bins, we fail to reject the null that the two pairs of coecients are equal.




4.3 Strategic v. Selective Default
We have consistently used the term `selective' default to describe our results.       We do so


because our identication strategy exploits only variation from rms that select to default


against one or more of its lenders while continuing to pay others. One issue that this approach


does not address is whether some of these selective defaults are really strategic.      That is,


do some borrowers pay less than they otherwise would because one or more of their lenders


is distressed? Or, do borrowers (many of whom are themselves distressed) pay as much as


they can, regardless of bank health, but actively select which bank to pay and which not



                                               21
to pay? Selective but not strategic behavior, while interesting, would imply that the overall


amount of total default would not be aected by bank weakness. In fact, one might even


argue that selective default could be helpful by weeding out weak banks faster than might


otherwise occur. Quantifying the amount of strategic behavior is dicult in our setting, but


one approach we can oer is to estimate our model separately by borrower credit worthiness.


    Table 10 reports such tests, with a structure parallel to that of Table 9.                     Rather than


sorting by size, here we sort by borrower risk. In particular, we separate rms into three risk

                                                                           22
bins based on the z-score, which summarizes credit quality.                     Firms with z-scores less than


or equal to three are dened as safe, those with scores between four and six as vulnerable,


and those with scores equal to and above seven as risky.                    The results suggest, rst, that


the eect of bank distress on default is robust across all three rm types; in each case


we see that the bad loans ratio aects default most in areas with weak legal enforcement.


Magnitudes increase across the three risk bins, but this make sense because the mean level of


default rises with the z-score and thus leads to larger coecients. In each bin, the marginal


eect of badloans on default is close to zero in areas with high levels of judicial eciency


and then increases, becoming positive and signicant, as judicial eciency worsens. This is


illustrated graphically in Figure 4, which reports the marginal eect of badloans on default


for each rm type across the distribution of judicial eciency (                ineaw ).   Even for the safest


category of rms, we nd evidence that default increases with bank distress in areas of poor


legal enforcement. As shown in Figure 5, the marginal eect of badloans on default becomes


positive and statistically signicant for most of the distribution of legal ineciency above


its average. This suggests that truly strategic default sometimes occurs. Defaults are higher


when lenders are weak (due to high bad loans) and legal enforcement is poor, even for the


lowest risk borrowers. Low risk borrowers have the capacity to pay but sometimes choose not


to pay, indicating the presence of strategic default and therefore less overall debt repayment

  22 The   score   variable measures the probability of a rm defaulting on the basis of an adaptation to Italy of
Altman [1968]'s approach, developed by Cerved SPA and regularly used by Italian banks to assess a rm's
riskiness. The Score index ranges from one for rms least likely to default to nine for rms most likely to
default.

due to bank weakness and poor enforcement.




4.4 Borrowing Costs and and Legal Eciency
Our results help explain why credit supply has been shown to respond so strongly to the


strength of legal enforcement. Not only does weak enforcement reduce ex post returns when


loans default idiosyncratically, our results suggest also that losses can be contagious and lead


to default probabilities that increase across a lender's entire loan portfolio. Crucially, weak


enforcement exacerbates this risk of borrower contagion. Thus, weak enforcement increases


a bank's systematic loan risk by raising the chance that borrowers default en masse once


the likelihood of bank survival becomes suciently in doubt. If this risk is understood by


banks ex ante, then credit supply should be adversely aected in parts of Italy where legal


eciency is poor. This may lead to higher borrowing costs and/or to less credit availability.


In fact, earlier research focusing on variation across Italian provinces found that indicators


of credit availability are negatively related to judicial ineciency and, in some specications,

                                                                          23
positively related to borrowing costs (see Jappelli et al., 2005)              .We focus here on borrowing


costs and nd evidence that loan interest rates are higher where legal eciency is poor (see


Table 11).    More precisely, we regress the interest rate on measures of rm credit quality


(equal to indicator variables based on the borrower credit score), time xed eects, and


our measure of legal ineciency. We report the model only for observations in which the


bank and the borrower reside in the same province, so there is not ambiguity regarding


measurement of legal eciency.          Since we are interested in the direct correlation between

  23 More precisely, the average interest rate on short term loans to non nancial companies in a province is
positively associated cross sectionally with the stock of pending trials. In the xed eect specication the
length of civil trials is positively and almost signicantly associated with the interest rate at conventional
signicance level, but the stock of pending trials has a negative, but insignicant eect. The stock of pending
trials has a negative and signicant eect on credit avauilability both cross sectionally and in the xed eect
specication. The predictions of the theoretical model in Jappelli et al. [2005] depend upon the competitive
structure of banks and other details. Longer longer recovery time for posted collateral tends to lead to lower
interest rates under perfect competition in ceredit markets, but not under monopolistic competition. In both
cases, longer recovery times imply less credit availability. Note also that the prediction on   average   interest
rates depends also upon the dierent pool of applicants in provinces/times with dierent collateral recovery
times.




                                                      23
legal ineciency and loan pricing, we must leave out the bank and rm*time (or rm) xed


eects, as these would subsume the coecient of interest. Hence, omitted variables could be


problematic in the regression.


    Given this caveat, we see a very strong positive and statistically signicant eect of legal


ineciency on loan pricing. The eect is similar in models with and without additional rm


control variables such as log of total assets, leverage and age (column 1 vs. 2). The magnitude


suggests that the loan rate increases by 0.40 percentage points comparing loans to borrowers


in legal jurisdictions at the 25th percentile vs.         those at the 75th (and by 80 basis points


going from the 5th to the 95th percentile). The coecient of interest remains signicant after


including macro-regional indicator variables, although the magnitude is somewhat smaller.




4.5 Robustness Tests
Table 12 reports six robustness tests of our main model with legal eciency (i.e. the models


of Table 8).     First, we report the model using term loans only.             Second, we report the


model after discarding all data beyond the rst quarter in which a loan becomes late (or


overdrawn).     Third, we control for four dimensions of loan terms.           Fourth, we reduce our


sample and include only observations in which the bank and the lender reside in the same


court jurisdiction. Fifth, we replace bank xed eects with bank-rm eects. And sixth, we


allow for the eect of accumulated bad loans to dier not only according to the eciency of

                                                                         24
the court, but also based on the macro region a rm resides in.




4.5.1 Term Loans Only

By excluding credit lines from our dataset, we can help ensure that the behavior reects the


borrower's intent not to repay the loan. Credit line data combine variation generated both


by the borrower's delays in re-payment of existing balances, and variation stemming from the


borrower's demand for liquidity. Specically, delayed re-payment on an existing credit line

  24 Since the results when bank prots are included are very similar, we present only the results for the
larger quarterly sample without this control variable.



                                                     24
will mechanically lead to an increase in the drawn balance, just as an active increase by the


borrower in the amount drawn. As long as the drawn balance remains below the maximum


amount of the line, we have no way to determine what motivates the borrower. A second


problem with credit lines is that the bank's choice to cut credit limits could also make default


more likely. Thus, data on credit lines may confound our interpretation. No such problems


exist with respect to term loans, since the balance of the loan is xed throughout the life


of the loan. Thus, this robustness test allows us to sharpen the distinction between bank


vulnerability stemming from liquidity exposure (the traditional concern) and vulnerability


stemming from credit-risk exposure (our focus).


    Column (1) of Table 12 reports these results.      Focusing only on term loans conrms


our main message: borrowers selectively default against weak banks in regions with poor


enforcement. Term loans have no liquidity component, so this result can only reect credit


risk and not liquidity. The coecient magnitudes are somewhat smaller than those observed


when we model overall default, but this reects the lower level of default of term loans vs.


lines.




4.5.2 First Delay

The next set of regressions (column (2)) report the main results with just the rst instance


in which a loan becomes late on a payment (or overdrawn). This test alleviates the concern


that persistence in the error term leads to a bias in estimating the eects of past bad loans


on delayed repayment.    The problem is twofold.     First, once borrowers become late on a


loan, that lateness becomes persistent; late borrowers tend to stay late for many consecu-


tive quarters. Second, loans that are late (or overdrawn) often transition to the bad-loan


account. This pattern is evident in the transition matrix described earlier (recall Table 1b).


Persistence in the error term after loans become late would therefore induce a contempo-


raneous correlation between the error and the level of bad loans for observations after the


rst instance of default. To remove this source of bias, we simply drop all observations after




                                              25
a loan rst enters the state of late payment.            The basic pattern of the regression results


remains similar, with even stronger statistical signicance. The magnitudes fall, but this is


as expected because by dropping all instances of late payments after the rst one, we reduce


the mean level of the dependent variable by more than 50%.




4.5.3 Control for Loan Terms

As we have emphasized, our model fully absorbs all rm-level fundamentals by capturing


rm-quarter xed eects.        However, loan terms - interest rates, collateral, and maturity


- are not captured this way, since these may vary systematically across a rm's banking


relationships. We therefore control for the loan interest rate, the share of loans with maturity


less than one year, the average ratio of collateral in accounts receivable to loan size, and the


average ratio of real-estate collateral to loan size. Each of these variables reects variation


at the rm-lender-quarter level, so coecients remain identied even with the rm-quarter

                                                                                                        25
xed eects. In some cases loan terms are not available, so the sample falls in these models.


   We nd in column (3) that higher interest rates are associated with more default, which


seems sensible given that the rm can save more cash resources by delaying payment on


more expensive loans. We nd that shorter maturity loans are more likely to default. And


we nd some evidence that collateral mitigates default risk (at least for accounts receivable;


real estate collateral does not enter the model robustly). But what is most salient for us:


adding these variables does little to our results of interest. In fact, we nd somewhat stronger


results, although this in part may reect dierences in the sample.




4.5.4 Borrower and Lender in Same Court Jurisdiction

Next, we include only instances in which lender and borrower are located in the same court


jurisdiction. This alternative sample, which is much smaller than our main sample, accounts


for possible measurement error in mapping legal enforcement into the data. As noted above,

  25 Specically, data on interest rates on loans are available from the Bank of Italy's Loan Interest Rate
Survey, which collects data from around 200 banks accounting for over 90% of total outstanding loans.




                                                    26
ex post enforcement requires lenders rst to receive an injunction from the court jurisdiction


of its head oce and, to reposess collateral (or other borrower's assets), they also need to


adjudicate in the court located near the collateral. Thus, legal enforcement in both court


jurisdictionss may matter. By focusing on cases in which the two overlap, we can test whether

                                                                            26
potential mis-classication could generate (or bias) our ndings.


    These results (column (4) of Table 12) again support the idea that lender weakness (bad


loans) raises default in areas with weak enforcement. If anything, these results are stronger


than those reported in our main model, meaning that the eect of bad loans on default


exhibits greater sensitivity to legal eciency in this smaller sample.




4.5.5 Controlling for Possible Endogeneity of Borrower-Lender Matching

With the results of column (5), we rule out the possibility that endogenous matching between


rms and banks could explain our results. For example, one concern might be that rms


sometimes choose a lender located in an area with poor legal enforcement with the intention


of defaulting. We do this by simply incorporating a unique xed eect for each bank-rm


pair. These eects will `control' non-parametrically for all aspects driving the rm's choice


of its lender.


    The results provide little evidence that endogenous sorting aects rm default behavior.


We continue to nd that rms default more when their lender is distressed. At the mean


level of legal enforcement, the marginal eect of bad loans on default equals 0.08 (=             âˆ’1.077+
0.163 Ã— ln (1189)),   very close to what we observe in our model with just bank eects (as in


Table 8).

  26 The large drop in the sample occurs because the majority of loans are extended by the largest banks with
branches located across the whole of Italy. So, even though borrowers are usually located near a branch of
their lender, they often are not located near the lender's head oce. Thus, this sample lters out most loans
extended by the largest banks and suggests robustness with respect to lender size as well as legal eciency
measures.




                                                     27
4.5.6 Allowing for Dierences Across Macro Regions

One may wonder whether the dierences in the importance of bank health across court


jurisdictions proxies for more complex dierences between southern and northern regions.


As we have seen, we have meaningful variation across both regions, but judicial eciency is


clearly higher (    ineaw     is lower) on average in the north of Italy. Moreover, many authors


have pointed to cultural dierences across the two areas. These include dierences in social

                                                                       27
capital, trust, and respect for others outside the family.                  Such dierence could plausibly


aect a rm's willingness to default selectively.


     To test whether these alternative sources of variation explain our results, we incorporate


additional regressors interacting the bank characteristics with an indicator set to one for


the southern regions (and major islands). Our focus is on the interaction between                      badloans
and    ineawÃ—badloans        with this regional indicator.        This specication allows the eect of


badloans on default to vary regionally as well as across judicial areas.            The coecients on these


additional variables capture the dierence between the south (and island regions) relative


to the center and north of Italy. Column (6) shows, however, that the regional interactions


are not statistically signicant, either individually or jointly.              For example, the F-test for


the signicance of two additional interactions with               badloans    and   ineawÃ—badloans        has a


p-value of 0.442. So, we conclude that judicial ineciency is the main factor determining


the marginal eect of accumulated bad loans on the decision to delay payments.




5       Conclusions
This paper provides the rst empirical evidence that banks can be vulnerable to run-like


behavior when borrowers choose to delay payment in response to evidence of their bank's


distress from past bad loans. These results are strong, both statistically and economically, at


those Italian banks which operated in areas with weak legal enforcement. Most of the nance

    27 See for instance, Putnam et al. [1994], Guiso et al. [2004], Guiso et al. [2013a] and Guiso et al. [2013b].




                                                        28
and economics literature, as well as the policy and regulatory apparatus, have viewed the


roots of bank vulnerability as stemming from exposure to liquidity risk. Although exposure


to credit risk is a well-known source of bank losses, we nd a   new channel   through which


credit risk might impair bank stability: delay in payments motivated by bank weakness.


We even demonstrate that where enforcement is weak, even the safest borrowers delay loan


repayment to weak banks. Our results help explain why the law and nance literature has


found weak enforcement of creditor rights to be so detrimental to well functioning debt


markets [La Porta et al., 1998].


   Fragility from liquidity exposure has been addressed with mechanisms like deposit insur-


ance, liquidity requirements (called for by the Basel III reform package) and lender of last


resort facilities operated by central banks. It seems likely that better enforcement, such as


improving the speed and certainty with which creditors can take possession of borrower's


net worth would reduce fragility stemming from credit risks and limit, in turn, the use of


those lenders of last resort facilities that might carry costs by encouraging banks to increase


leverage, issue too much short-term debt, and take excessive risk.


   Our paper also contributes to the debate on the role of information, market discipline


and bank stability: while access to timely and reliable information enables investors to assess


risks inherent to nancial assets and to allocate capital eciently, full transparency might


sometimes have detrimental eects if it leads to overreaction by market participants. Our


results suggest that in bad times, dissemination of information on lender fragility might push


borrowers to delay loan repayments against weak banks, making their condition even worse.

An index of bank losses from sovereign bonds holdings (govbshock) - Source: Author's estimates based on
data from Supervisory Reports, Bank of Italy
We follow De Marco (2015) to compute the change in the value sovereign holdings (                   govbshock )   using the change in the yield


(4yield) for each type of bond (based on maturity and country), multiplied by the product of the bond's duration times its


share of the bank's total assets (     govbondshare ).   We limit ourselves to bonds issued by the Italian government because they


represent the vast majority of holdings of sovereign bonds.       Govshock        is denes as


                                                    X
                                   govbshockb,t =        durationm,t Ã— âˆ†yieldm,t Ã— govbondsharem,tâˆ’1 ,
                                                    m

where    m   denotes the original bond maturity. For a zero coupon bond the formula can be written as:


                                                                                2m
                                                         durationm,t =                   .
                                                                            1 + yieldm,t


For a par bond, the formula simplies to

                                                                                                   
                                                                 1                      1
                                           durationm,t =                 1âˆ’                             .
                                                             yieldm,t           (1 + yieldm,t )2m


We apply the rst formula when we know that the sovereign bonds are discount bonds and an average of the two formulae


when we have no such information.

The table presents regressions of   late payment   as a function of a set of bank characteristics. The model allows the eect of bank
variables to vary by borrower size. Borrowers are sorted in four equal-sized bins based on their total assets (1=small; 4=large).
Late payment (0,1)   is equal to 1 if the rm has a loan repayment delay with the bank in the quarter; 0 if loans granted by the
bank to the rm are performing in the quarter. The sample covers the period 2008q4 - 2013q4. The description of variables and
their sources are given in the Data Appendix. Standard errors are clustered at the bank-level. Asterisks denote signicance at
the 1%(***), 5%(**), 10%( *) level, respectively.

     The table presents regressions of late payment as a function of a set of bank characteristics. The model allows the eect of bank variables to vary with strength of the bank
     relationship (bkshare ). Late payment (0,1) is equal to 1 if the rm has a loan repayment delay with the bank in the quarter; 0 if loans granted by the bank to the rm are
     performing in the quarter. The sample covers the period 2008q4 - 2013q4. The description of variables and their sources are given in the Data Appendix. Standard errors are
     clustered at the bank-level. Asterisks denote signicance at the 1%(***), 5%(**), 10%( *) level, respectively.

             Table 9: Late payments, bank quality and judicial eciency, by rm size

The table presents regressions of   late payment   as a function of a set of bank characteristics. The model allows the eect of
bank variables to vary with (the natural log of ) duration for property execution proceedings (    ineaw ) and by borrower size.
Borrowers are sorted in four equal sized-bins based on their total assets (1=smaller; 4=larger).       The Late payment (0,1) is
equal to 1 if the rm has a loan repayment delay with the bank in the quarter; 0 if loans granted by the bank to the rm are
performing in the quarter. The sample covers the period 2008q4 - 2013q4. The description of variables and their sources are
given in the Data Appendix. Standard errors are clustered at the bank-level. Asterisks denote signicance at the 1%(***),
5%(**), 10%( *) level, respectively.

         Table 10: Late payments, bank quality and judicial eciency, by rm riskiness

The table presents regressions of   late payment   as a function of a set of bank characteristics. The model allows the eect of bank
variables to vary with (the natural log of ) duration for property execution proceedings (       ineaw ) and by    borrower riskiness.
Borrowers are sorted in risk bins (safe, vulnerable, risky) based on their z-score. The        Late payment (0,1)   is equal to 1 if the
rm has a loan repayment delay with the bank in the quarter; 0 if loans granted by the bank to the rm are performing in the
quarter. The sample covers the period 2008q4 - 2013q4. The description of variables and their sources are given in the Data
Appendix. Standard errors are clustered at the bank-level. Asterisks denote signicance at the 1%(***), 5%(**), 10%( *) level,
respectively.

                                Table 11: Interest Rates and Judicial Eciency


The table presents regressions of the average interest rate on judicial ineciency, controlling for rm's characteristics. Data on
interest rates are reported only by 200 banks, though they are largely representative of the population. The analysis refers to
loans between banks and rms based in the same judicial court. The original data is collapsed at the rm-quarter level.     ineaw
stands for the (natural log of ) duration for property execution proceedings in 2007.   score   is the Altman synthetic indicator of
rm riskiness, where 1 corresponds to low risk and 9 to high risk. More details on the variables and their sources are given in
the Data Appendix. Standard errors are clustered at the rm-level. Asterisks denote signicance at the 1% (***), 5% (**) and
10% ( *) level, respectively.

                                                     Table 12: Robustness


The table presents regressions of   late payment   as a function of a set of bank characteristics. The model allows the eect of bank
variables to vary with (the natural log of ) duration for property execution proceedings in 2007 (     ineaw ). Late payment (0,1)
is equal to 1 if the rm has a loan repayment delay with the bank in the quarter; 0 if loans granted by the bank to the rm
are performing in the quarter. The sample covers the period 2008q4 - 2013q4. The description of variables and their sources
are given in the Data Appendix. Standard errors are clustered at the bank-level. Asterisks denote signicance at the 1%(***),
5%(**), 10%( *) level, respectively. We do six robustness tests reported in Columns (1)-(6). Column (1): term loans only;
column (2): include only the rst quarter in which a loan becomes late (or overdrawn); column (3): control for four dimensions
of loan terms (loan interest rate, share of loans with maturity less than one year, average ratio of collateral in accounts receivable
to loan size, and average ratio of real-estate collateral to loan size); column (4): include only observations in which the bank
and the lender are located in the same court jurisdiction; column (5): include     bank Ã— f irm   xed eects; column (6): allow the
eects of   badloans   to vary by region.
