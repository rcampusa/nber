                                             ABSTRACT

The assertion that a flexible exchange rate regime would facilitate current account adjustment is often
repeated in policy circles. In this paper, we compile a data set encompassing data for over 170 countries
are included, over the 1971-2005 period, and examine whether the rate of current account reversion
depends upon the de facto degree of exchange rate fixity, as measured by two popular indices. We
find that there is no strong, robust, or monotonic relationship between exchange rate regime flexibility
and the rate of current account reversion, even after accounting for the degree of economic development,
the degree of trade and capital account openness. We also find that the endogenous selection of exchange
rate regimes does not explain the observed lack of correlation.

I. Introduction

       It is often asserted that a more flexible exchange rate regime would promote current

account adjustment. The three quotes at the beginning of the paper come from a group of large

national governments, a prominent academic, and a premier international financial institution,

respectively. Moving to a more flexible exchange rate in order to facilitate current account

adjustment is a frequent policy recommendation made by the IMF and others. Curiously, this is

not a proposition that emerges from formal models in international macroeconomics as codified

in the graduate-level textbooks by Obstfeld and Rogoff (1996) and Vegh (forthcoming). The lack

of a formal model is not a problem for the proposition if it is considered self evident by now.

Indeed, the logic was expounded more than half a century ago by Milton Friedman in his famous

essay, “The case for flexible exchange rates” (Friedman, 1953). However, the Friedman essay

was written during an era of limited financial integration which could be different from today’s

world with substantially more cross-border capital flows. In any case, there is no systematic
                                                 1
statistical evidence that we can find supporting this supposition, for either the recent period of

elevated financial integration, or the earlier period. Until one finds persuasive evidence, the

policy recommendation is only a faith-based initiative – based on something widely assumed to

be true, actively peddled to countries as a truth, but with little solid empirical support.

       Indeed, it is not difficult to find counter-examples. While both Egypt and China have a

relatively rigid exchange rate regime, Egypt has a relatively fast current account convergence but

China does not. On the other hand, while both South Africa and Japan have a flexible exchange

rate regime, South Africa has a relatively fast convergence but Japan does not. While we can

come up with other examples, there is a limit to how much we can learn from individual cases.

       In this paper, we seek to address this deficiency by systematically investigating any

relationship in the data between exchange rate regimes and speed of current account adjustment.

Rather than using officially announced exchange rate regimes, we appeal to de facto regimes in

place. We utilize two well-established and familiar approaches to classifying a country’s

exchange rate regime on a de facto basis, by Levy-Yeyati and Sturzenegger (2003a,b), and by

Reinhart and Rogoff (2004), respectively.

       It is important to note that we focus on the speed of current account convergence toward

the mean. If an “orderly current account adjustment” has other connotations, they would lie

outside the scope of our investigation. Moreover, we are not making the claim that a faster

current account adjustment necessarily represent higher welfare., In general, a free float does not

necessarily lead to efficient levels of exchange rates, as highlighted by Corsetti et al.

(forthcoming). The mapping between welfare and exchange rate regime depends on whether the

financial market is complete and prices are flexible and whether exporters predominantly follow

“local currency pricing” or “producer currency pricing,” among other things. Our goal is more


                                                   2
limited, in that we seek to determine whether more rapid adjustment in a statistical sense occurs

under more flexible regimes. Given the enormous effort by international financial institutions

and some national governments in linking more flexible regimes with faster current account

adjustments, this research question should still have important relevance for economic policy

making.

       To anticipate the results, after experimenting with a large number of statistical

specifications, we find no support in the data for the notion that countries on a more flexible

exchange rate regime robustly exhibit a faster convergence of their current account (as a

percentage of their GDP) to the long run equilibrium, regardless of which de facto exchange rate

regime classification scheme we employ. This is true when we control for trade and financial

openness; and when we separate large and small countries.

       To be sure, the current account balance does have a tendency to revert to its long run

steady state; it does not wander off or stay away from the long run equilibrium forever. This is

clearly reflected in our empirical work. However, the speed of adjustment is not systematically

related to the degree of flexibility of a country’s nominal exchange rate regime.

       This empirical result presents a challenge to the Friedman (1953) hypothesis on the merit

of a flexible regime in promoting faster external adjustment, and a challenge to a key policy

recommendation by international financial institutions in using exchange rate flexibility to

reduce global current account imbalances. To understand why the pattern may be reasonable, the

second part of our analysis examines whether the nature of a country’s nominal exchange rate

regime significantly affects the pace of real exchange rate adjustment. The current account

responds to real exchange rate, not the nominal exchange rate. If the real exchange rate

adjustment does not depend on the nominal exchange rate regime, then the current account


                                                 3
adjustment would not depend on nominal exchange rate regime either. Indeed, we find that the

real exchange rate adjustment is not systematically related to how flexible a country’s nominal

exchange rate regime is. Again, this is true regardless of which de facto exchange rate regime

classification we use. If anything, there is slight, but not very robust evidence that less flexible

nominal exchange rate regimes sometimes exhibit faster real exchange rate adjustment. While

the evidence on real exchange rate adjustment is suggestive, we hope this paper could inspire

additional work in re-thinking the role of a nominal exchange rate regime in an economy’s

external adjustment.

       The literature on current account is too large to be comprehensively summarized here. In

terms of relatively recent theoretical work, Blanchard (2007) points out that one cannot

automatically assume that a current account imbalance needs to be corrected by a policy unless

one has clearly identified the relevant distortions. For recent empirical work on estimating

current account adjustment, an excellent set of papers is collected in Clarida (2007), which in

turn contains references to the earlier literature. As far as we know, the existing literature has not

systematically addressed the question of whether a flexible exchange rate regime speeds up

convergence of the current account. In this sense, this paper fills an important void.

       The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 lays out the empirical

methodology, data, and benchmark results. Section 3 conducts a series of extensions and

robustness checks. Finally, Section 4 concludes.



II. Benchmark Statistical Results

       We start by explaining our econometric specifications and the definitions and sources of

the key variables. We then present and discuss benchmark regressions results.


                                                  4
A. Methodology

       We estimate the rate at which current account balances (expressed as a share of GDP)

revert to their mean values, using variations on this basic autoregression:

        cait = ρ 0 + ρ1cait −1 + vit                                                           (1)

Where cait is the current account to GDP ratio for country i in year t.1 One can determine how

the autoregressive coefficient varies with the exchange rate regime in a variety of ways. The

simplest would be to order the exchange rate regimes by degree of flexibility, and then interact

with the lagged endogenous variable. Since this approach imposes a monotonic relationship

between the degree of exchange rate flexibility and the rate of current account reversion, we do

not focus on this approach in our presentation.2 Rather, we discuss estimates obtained by either

of two methods: (i) stratifying the sample by exchange rate regime and running separate

regressions by regime, or (ii) interacting binary dummy variables for each regime with the

lagged current account, and estimating the differential effects in a single regression.

       For simplicity of exposition, equation (1) assumes a fixed mean value of the current

account. Subsequently, we allow this mean to vary over time. In general, a country’s current

account need not be zero even in the steady state. Kraay et al. (2005) arrive at this result by

treating foreign asset holdings (cumulative current account balance) as a portfolio choice

problem. Ju and Wei (2007) argue that the relative size of frictions to capital flows versus

frictions to goods trade can affect the size of current response to a given shock. As a result, the

average size of current account across countries could partly reflect the relative importance of

frictions to capital flows versus goods trade. Caballero et al. (2009) focus on the implications of

cross-country differences in financial development. They argue that a country with a weak

financial development tend to send savings to a country with a strong financial system. As a


                                                  5
result, the weak-finance country runs a current account surplus while the strong-finance country

runs a deficit. If one models financial frictions differently, Ju and Wei (2010) argue that the

current account patterns become less clear cut. An intensified competition in the marriage market

as triggered by a rise in the ratio of young men to young women could lead to a rise in the

aggregate savings rate and a rise in the current account imbalance (see Du and Wei, 2010, for a

theoretical model and some cross-country evidence, and Wei and Zhang, forthcoming, for

household and regional-level evidence from China.) While the current account would still be

balanced in the steady state, a higher sex ratio could produce a large and positive current account

that persists for many periods. In a finite sample, this may show up as a non-zero mean for the

current account. In order to be general, we do not restrict the mean of the current account to be

zero..

          The first approach relies upon estimating equation (1) for each category of exchange rate

regime. The second approach involves estimating (2):

                                         k                              k
          cait = ρ 0 + ρ1cait −1 + θ 0 j ∑ regime jit + θ1 j (cait −1 × ∑ regime jit ) + vit    (2)
                                        j =0                           j =0



The variable regime is the de facto exchange rate measure.3 (As an extension, we allow for both

country fixed effects and year fixed effects. This does not alter the basic conclusion of the

paper.)

          The first approach imposes the fewest assumptions, but might yield imprecise estimates

due to substantially decreased number of observations for each regression. The second approach

will yield the same point estimates as obtained in the first approach but different estimated

standard errors. The validity of this approach for making inference depends on the condition that

the error term is distributed in a similar fashion across exchange rate regimes.


                                                           6
        It’s important to allow a different constant for each regime, given the Friedman

hypothesis (1953) which argued that flexible exchange rates would be consistent with more rapid

adjustment. In our context, one might think that flexible exchange rate regimes would generate

smaller current account imbalances on average. There is some evidence of this effect in the

aggregate, and for the non-industrial countries (although it is entirely absent for industrial

countries), on an unconditional basis.4

        In all instances, we would like to control for other structural variables that might also

affect the rate of reversion. In the case of equation (2), we augment the equation with level and

interaction effects.

                                        k                              k
          cait = ρ 0 + ρ1cait −1 + θ 0 j ∑ regime jit + θ1 j (cait −1 × ∑ regime jit ) + controlsit + vit   (3)
                                       j =0                           j =0



Where the list of controls includes different measures of economic openness, including trade and

financial openness, described in greater depth below.



B. Data

        The current account and trade openness data are from the World Bank’s World

Development Indicators. The trade openness variable is the standard measure (the sum of

imports and exports divided by GDP). 170 countries are included, over the 1971-2005 period.

The sample encompasses both developed and developing countries (as classified by the IMF).

        The de facto exchange rate regime variables come from two sources: the Levy-Yeyati

and Sturzenegger (2003a,b) and the Reinhart and Rogoff (2004) measures. The Levy-Yeyati and

Sturzenegger index ranges from 1 to 5, with 1 indicating “inconclusive” determination, 2 free

float, 3 dirty float, 4 dirty float/crawling peg, and 5 fix. In this study, we drop 1’s, and subtract 2

off the index, so that the revised index ranges from 0 to 3 (hereafter the LYS index).
                                                            7
        The Reinhart and Rogoff index ranges from 1 to 14, ranging from more to less fixity. We

aggregated the series into 3 categories. The first is fixed (from no legal tender to de facto peg);

the second is intermediate (from pre announced crawling peg to moving band that is narrower

than or equal to ± 2%); the third is floating (managed floating to freely floating).5 These

categories are then reversed so the index (hereafter the RR index) ranges from low values (high

flexibility) to high values (high fixity).

        While it is well understood that a country’s actual exchange rate regime often differs

from its de jure regime, Frankel (2007) notes that the two popular de facto classification schemes

have a correlation of only 0.40, indicating that they have much disagreement over how to

classify a given country in a given year. Given this disagreement, we opt to work with both

classification schemes. Figures 1 and 2 present the histograms for the LYS and RR indices,

respectively. The number of observations on LYS and RR are comparable, at around 4000. There

are some differences in the distribution of regimes, but the same general pattern is replicated.

The fewest observations are in the freest floating category, while the greatest number of

observations is found in the most fixed category.



C. The Basic Results

        We estimate country by country the autoregressive parameter in (1), incorporating shifts

due to different exchange rate regimes. Since some countries are only on the same exchange rate

regime for a short period, a caveat is that some of the autoregressive parameters are estimated

over relatively short samples. In any case, one sees in Figure 3 a slight impression of higher

degrees of persistence as one moves to higher degrees of exchange rate fixity.6 However, a closer

examination indicates that the impression is being driven by the lack of negative coefficients in


                                                  8
the least flexible regimes. The mean of the estimated coefficients are virtually the same across

regimes. This result holds up if a deterministic trend is included in the specifications; the

resulting distributions are displayed in Figure 4. The bottom line: No clear evidence that more

flexible exchange rate regimes are associated with a faster current account adjustment.

       Other ways to formally quantify the effect of each regime is to stratify the data by each

regime and run separate regressions, or alternatively to interact the LYS variable with the

autoregressive parameter in a pooled regression.

       First we present the results obtained by stratifying the sample by exchange rate regime. In

Tables 1A and 1B, the LYS index is used to categorize the regimes. Moving from left to right is

increasing degrees of fixity. In the first four columns of Table 1A, pertaining to the full sample,

the degree of persistence is 0.63 under the most flexible regime, and rises to 0.76 and 0.79 as the

regime gets progressively less flexible. Thus far, these results are in accord with the conventional

wisdom. However, this is not robust or at least non-linear. When one gets to the most fixed

regime, the degree of persistence declines to 0.74. Beyond the point estimates, it is important to

note one cannot reject the hypothesis that any pair of these AR(1) coefficients are the same.

Therefore, there is no statistical evidence that a more flexible exchange rate regime is associated

with a faster current account adjustment.

       There is a high degree of heterogeneity in the sample, given the sample encompasses

both industrial, developing and oil exporting countries. Focusing on the industrial countries, one

finds the greatest degree of persistence (essentially a random walk) in an intermediate regime

category. In any case, the industrial countries have not been the focus of the policy discussions.

Rather it is the non-industrial countries upon which most analysts have concentrated on.




                                                  9
       Moving to Table 1B, one finds that indeed the fastest rate of reversion is in the floating

category. However, once again the relationship is nonlinear. Increasing degrees of fixity lead to

greater persistence, until one gets to the fixed regime. Then the degree of persistence declines.

This pattern is replicated if one focuses on non-oil-exporting non-industrial countries. While this

outcome might be taken as partial vindication of the conventional wisdom, it is of interest that

transition that is most relevant to the current policy debate is that between the fixed and dirty

float/crawling peg. And here the results are counter to what has been argued. For instance,

China’s move from a de facto fixed regime to a dirty float would result – if other countries’

experience is any guide based on our estimation – in slower current account reversion.

       An alternative means of identifying the differences in current account persistence across

regimes is to use interactive dummies, as indicated in equation (2). The only substantive

difference between the two methods involves the second moment; the dummy variable approach

assumes that the same error distribution applies to all regimes. To verify this, note that in Table 2,

the point estimate for the full sample rate of reversion under freely floating is the same using the

two methods. The estimated coefficient on the interaction term (lagcurrent1) is the implied effect

on the reversion coefficient of being in the dirty float versus the free float, in the LYS schema.

Adding 0.132 to 0.630 yields 0.762, which equals the point estimate in column (2) of Table 1A.

The only additional information provided by this dummy variable approach is that it allows for

direct assessment of whether the differences in reversion rates are statistically significant or not.7

       Consider column 1 (all Countries) in Table 2. Using a standard t-test, none of the

coefficients on the interaction terms are statistically significant. In other words, there are no

statistically significant differences in estimated degrees of persistence across exchange rate

regimes. This continues to be true when we look at various subsamples of countries (the set of


                                                  10
industrial countries in Column 2, developing countries in Column 3, and ex-oil developing

countries in Column 4), with the sole exception of the industrial country category. There, the

current account in the managed floating category exhibits more persistence than in either the

floating or other categories (including fixed). This exception is hardly the case in which most

policy discussions have been focused on. These results hold if country fixed effects or time fixed

effects are included in the specifications (not reported to save space).8

       Are our results sensitive to the measure of de facto exchange rate regime? To address this

question, Tables 3A and 3B report the results using the Reinhart and Rogoff classification of

exchange rate regimes (now there are only three different regimes, instead of four), and the

stratification approach (analogous to Table 1A, B). A similar pattern is detected. Focusing on the

non-industrial country results (Table 3B), one finds in columns 1-3 that while the intermediate

regimes exhibit slower reversion than the floating, it is also slower than that exhibited by the

fixed regimes. Excluding the oil exporters does not change the basic pattern. Interestingly, now

the fastest rate of reversion is for the fixed regimes!

       The bottom line of this section is a conspicuous absence of a strong and robust

association in the data between the degree of exchange rate flexibility and the speed of current

account adjustment. This empirical pattern rejects the widely accepted wisdom in the corridors of

international financial institutions and powerful national treasuries that more exchange rate

flexibility brings about a faster speed of current account adjustment.



III. Extensions and Other Robustness Tests

       The conclusion of the last section could arise either because it is true, or because the

empirical relationship is mis-specified. In order to ensure that our results are robust, we


                                                  11
undertake several additional checks, including controlling for other plausible determinants of the

speed of current account adjustment, accounting for nonlinearities and asymmetries, and

investigating the possible endogeneity of exchange rate regimes.



A. Allowing for Trends

       The basic specification outlined in equation (1) incorporates mean reversion. An

alternative is to allow for trends in the current account to GDP ratio. Consistent with the

approach adopted in the literature, we detrend the current account ratio before testing for patterns

across exchange rate regimes. The results, reported in Tables 4A and 4B (for four different

samples), suggest little change in the conclusions one would take from the analysis.

       All the autoregressive coefficients drop relative to the results based on un-detrended data.

And in the full sample (Table 4A), the floating exchange rate regime exhibits the most rapid rate

of reversion. However, in contrast to the data without detrending, this pattern is not true for the

industrial country grouping; there the most rapid rate of reversion comes from the dirty

float/crawling peg regime, although with only a few observations.

       Our focus is on the developing countries, reported in Table 4b. While the most rapid rate

of reversion (toward the HP-defined trend) is for the pure floaters, the slowest rate of reversion is

estimated for the dirty float regime (for both non-industrial and non-industrial ex-oil country

groupings). The fixed regime in fact exhibits the second highest speed of convergence. We

conclude that once again, moving from a fixed regime to a less fixed regime does not necessarily

lead to more rapid adjustment of the current account.



B. Adding Variables: Openness to trade and to capital flows


                                                 12
       Two key missing regressors are trade openness and capital account openness. One might

conjecture that greater trade openness makes it easier for trade account to respond to real

exchange rate changes, and therefore is associated with a faster current account reversion. On the

other hand, greater capital account openness makes an economy more susceptible to financing

shocks, which may result in more frequent current account reversals. Without controlling for the

effects of trade and capital account openness, the true relationship between exchange rate

regimes and current account adjustment may be more difficult to detect.

       There are a number of variables that could be used to proxy for trade and capital account

openness. We appeal to two commonly used and easy to interpret measures. For trade openness,

we use the sum of imports and exports to GDP ratio (OPEN). On the capital account openness

side, we appeal to the Chinn and Ito (2006) financial openness index (KAOPEN). This measure

is the first principal component of four categories of restrictions on external transactions,

including dual foreign exchange rates, restrictions on current account transactions, restrictions on

capital account transactions and finally the surrender of export proceeds. We switch the sign so

that higher values of this index represent greater financial openness.

       Table 5A presents the results from specifications incorporating these variables (in the

context of the LYS index). Notice first in the full sample that the estimated rates of reversion do

differ from those obtained in Table 2. This outcome is to be expected, to the extent that the

openness terms, when interacted with the lagged current account balance, are statistically

significant. What the results indicate is a lack of a clear pattern – for any country grouping –

between degrees of exchange rate fixity and current account persistence. The estimated

autoregressive coefficient (holding at zero trade and financial openness) is never the highest in




                                                 13
the fixed regime. Rather it is often the dirty float/managed peg category that exhibits the greatest

persistence.

       Here are some other notable points. First, in the dummy variable regressions (not shown),

current account balances in the fixed exchange rate regimes exhibit less persistence than the

freely floating regimes. In the full sample and the non-industrial country sample, the difference is

statistically significant. Second, trade openness does not appear to be an important determinant

of current account persistence, but financial openness does. In the dummy variable regressions

(not shown), a country with a more open capital account tends to exhibit a greater persistence in

current account imbalance, and this is true in every country grouping. The effect is statistically

significant for every grouping save the non-industrial ex-oil group, and is most pronounced for

the industrial country group. Similar results are obtained using the Reinhart-Rogoff measure,

although in this case, we also find lower persistence for the non-industrial ex-oil group as well.

       One question is whether treatment of openness as a continuous variable, as in Table 5, is

appropriate. One could alternatively ask if the rates of reversion differ under fixed and flexible

exchange rates when each openness indicator is viewed as dichotomous. Then one could

examine the rate of adjustment under four combinations of high/low trade and financial openness.

In order to examine this issue, we defined high trade and financial openness as instances where

the indicators are higher than the mean values. For the combinations to have an interesting

impact, the coefficients on the resulting dummy variables need to be statistically significant.

       For the non-industrial countries, these dummy variables do not exhibit statistical

significance in many cases (results not reported). For floating rates, countries with high trade

openness display higher reversion, irrespective of financial openness. For fixed-rates countries,

high financial openness is associated with slower reversion, regardless of trade openness. These


                                                 14
results are only slightly different from those reported in Table 5B. Holding constant trade and

financial openness, there is no evidence that a move to a more flexible exchange rate regime

necessarily produces a faster current account convergence.



C. Nonlinearities and Asymmetric Effects

       A number of observers have pointed out that large current account deficits appear to

adjust in a different fashion from small deficits.9 This suggests that there are nonlinearities and

threshold effects in current account adjustment that we need to test for. In addition, Ghosh,

Terrones, and Zettelmeyer (2008) argue that such effects might invalidate our results.

       To address the first issue of nonlinearity, we proceed by estimating for each regime:

        cait = ρ 0 + ρ1cait −1 + ρ 2cait −1 cait −1 + controlsit + vit                 (4)

It would be possible to account for nonlinearities in equation (3) for the pooled sample, but at the

cost of introducing many additional interaction terms (e.g., regime by current account size).

Hence, we rely upon separate regressions on stratified samples. We allow for the nonlinearity to

enter in a smooth – rather than discrete – fashion.10

       The results of estimating equation (4) are presented in Table 6. They show clear evidence

of nonlinear effects. However, accounting for these effects does not overturn our previous

conclusions. The nonlinear effect is obscured in the full sample encompassing industrial and

non-industrial countries, and shows up only for the fixed exchange rate regime. It is true that in

that instance, larger balances – either large or small – induce faster reversion, at least in a

statistical sense. However, the other coefficients associated with the posited nonlinearity are not

statistically significant. Similarly, inference regarding the strength of the nonlinear effects is

hampered in the industrial country sample by the small number of observations in certain

                                                          15
categories. The only conclusion that can be made is that the rate of reversion under fixed rates

does not appear to be any slower than flexible rates. This is true either controlling for and

holding constant the absolute size of the current account balance, or taking into account the

average size of the absolute current account balance.

       Since the issue of current account adjustment and exchange rate regimes is centered on

non-industrial countries, we direct our attention to Table 6B. Holding constant the average

absolute current account balance, the rates of reversion in the dirty float/crawl regime and the

fixed regime appear about equal. Evaluating the reversion coefficient at the respective means of

the average absolute current account balances, it would appear that reversion in the fixed

category is definitely faster than under dirty float/crawling peg category.11

       A separate but related issue is whether reversion rates differ when a surplus is being run,

as opposed to a deficit. In order to examine this type of asymmetry, we define a dummy variable,

posCA = 1 if CA > 0, and 0 otherwise, and estimate the following equation:

        cait = ρ 0 + ρ1cait −1 + ρ3cait −1 posCAit −1 + controlsit + vit             (5)

The coefficient ρ1 represents the rate of reversion when the current account balance is negative,

whereas the sum of two coefficients ρ1 + ρ 3 represents the rate of reversion when the current

account balance is positive. The estimates are reported in Table 7.

       While there is some evidence of an asymmetry in the full sample, this seems to be an

artifact of pooling. Among industrial countries, there is an indication that the asymmetry exists

only for those on floating rates, and in this case there is no evidence of reversion. The point

estimate is 1.36, suggesting explosive behavior for surplus countries.12 Even when the balance is

negative, the evidence for reversion is weak, since the point estimate is 0.96. In contrast, under

fixed rates, the rate of reversion is 0.67, and no evidence for this type of asymmetry.

                                                        16
       Turning attention to the most important categories, the non-industrial and non-industrial

ex-oil countries, one finds the asymmetry shows up only in the intermediate categories. When

countries are experiencing current account deficits, it’s clearly true that the rate of reversion is

slowest in the dirty float/crawling peg regime. When experiencing a current account surplus,

there is some evidence that the intermediate regimes have the fastest rates of reversion. The

evidence is particularly marked for the non-industrial countries (taking out the oil exporters

weakens the result, so only in the dirty float/crawling peg regime does the rate of reversion look

substantially faster than in the other regimes). One notable result is that the floating regime and

fixed regime rates of reversion are about the same regardless of whether these countries are

running a surplus or deficit.

       We also investigated whether the nonlinear effect shows up after accounting for

asymmetry. While there is some evidence of both effects being present, only in one case are both

effects manifested simultaneously: non-oil non-industrial countries under a fixed exchange rate

regime. Reversion is faster when the current account balances are bigger, and are yet faster when

the current account balance is positive. In no other case do both effects show up. In other words,

sometimes the nonlinear effect is symmetrical, and in other instances, the nonlinear effect only

occurs (at statistically significant levels) when balances are positive or negative.

       An important finding in these set of results allowing for both nonlinearities and

asymmetries is that the slowest rate of reversion in each category of countries is often though not

always the dirty float/crawling peg regime.13 In any case, after allowing for asymmetries and

non-linearity, we still do not find robust evidence that increasing exchange rate flexibility would

deliver a faster current account adjustment.




                                                  17
D. Size

          Country size could affect pattern of current account dynamics: for a large country, the

only way for its current account deficit to shrink, is for the rest of the world to do an opposite

adjustment. This means that the adjustment of a large country’s current account depends on

factors that affect other countries’ adjustment, potentially including other countries’ exchange

rate regimes (Ju and Wei, 2007). A simple way to account for this possibility is to run separate

regressions for large and small economies.

          Table 8 reports results stratified by economic size. We used both the dollar measure and

the PPP measure of GDP to split the samples by average GDP. That is, for each year, we

calculated the average GDP for the entire sample, and placed countries in either the high or low

sub-sample. We then re-estimated the dummy variable specifications to examine whether the

effect of exchange rate regimes differed depending on economic size.

          We report only the results for PPP-defined size (the results using market exchange rates

are similar, but less statistically significant). First note that a simple autoregressive

characterization (no controls) indicates very similar degrees of current account persistence across

large and small countries. However, differences become highlighted when additional controls are

added. With the exchange regime dummy variables are included, the large country current

account balances are much less persistent than those for the smaller countries, even though few

of the regime variables are statistically significant. The big difference comes when the openness

variables are also included. Then for the large countries, all regimes exhibit less persistence than

the free float, although the difference is not significant for the dirty float/crawling peg.

          Another way to break the groups into large and small is to focus on the G-7 countries as

opposed to all others. In this case, the most important features are that, unconditionally, G-7


                                                   18
current account balances are much more persistent than other countries’ (results not reported).

When regime and openness effects are allowed for, it appears that financial openness in

particular induces much greater persistence (especially in the G-7 countries, although the effect

is visible for both sets of countries).

        Turning to the regime results, for the G-7, a dirty float/crawling peg induces much greater

persistence, in both economic and statistical terms. For the non-G-7, a fixed exchange rate

induces much less persistence. This effect is statistically significant. This seems counter to the

general presumption (although it must be allowed that the result obtains only when the openness

variables are included).

E. Inflation

        One could argue that the exchange rate regimes proxy for other, more fundamental,

factors. Given the popularity of nominal anchor argument as a means of reducing inflation, it

makes sense to examine robustness by including inflation in our regressions.

        We augment the basic specifications using dummies for the LYS indicator variable with

CPI inflation measured as the log difference in the CPI (the results are not reported to save

space). It turns out that we retain the basic pattern highlighted in Table 2. In particular, exchange

rate regimes still do not display a statistically significant impact on reversion rates, and to the

extent that they do, more rigid regimes are associated with faster reversion rates after controlling

for inflation. Indeed, the only instances in which the inflation rate variable comes into play are

those involving the industrial countries. There, higher inflation is associated with faster reversion.



F. Endogeneity




                                                  19
       The preceding discussion assumes that one can take the exchange rate regime selection as

exogenous with respect to current account persistence. But we cannot take this assumption for

granted. Hence, we undertake an examination to see whether the conclusions are robust to

possible endogeneity of exchange rate regimes.

       What variables enter into the determination of de facto exchange rate regimes? Levy-

Yeyati and Sturzenegger (2003b) present evidence that the regime selection depends upon initial

foreign exchange reserves, a dummy for islands, economic size, area and average exchange rate

regime in the region.

       Motivated by their results, we use a two-stage procedure to re-estimate the equations for

specifications excluding and including openness variables. In the first stage, we estimate a

multinomial probit model for each indicator variable (regime 0 through regime 3, ranging from

floating to fixed), using as regressors the initial foreign exchange reserve to GDP ratio, GDP in

PPP terms, land area, and a dummy variable for islands. The probit regressions yield

probabilities which we then use in the second stage regressions. Note that the probit regressions

are more successful for the extreme regimes than for the intermediate regimes.

       The second stage regression results are reported in Table 9. In the regressions excluding

openness variables, they indicate that, except for the industrial countries, there is no evidence

that differing exchange rate regimes are associated with statistically significantly differing rates

of current account reversion. And in this case, the implied rates of adjustment for the

intermediate regimes do not make a lot of sense. In any case, there is little evidence that there is

a difference in the adjustment rates between the fully floating and fully fixed regimes.

       A Hausman test for the exogeneity of the regime variables rejects in almost all cases

involving non-industrial countries. Hence, treating the regime indicator variables as endogenous


                                                 20
is appropriate. The Sargan test statistic for overidentifying restrictions fails to reject in all

instances. In a pure statistical sense, these instruments are uncorrelated with the error term in the

main regression.

        We also attempted to back out binary indicator variables based on the predicted

probabilities from the multinomial probit regressions. However, because the model has a difficult

time predicting the intermediate regimes, the estimated dirty float and dirty float/crawling peg

variables are collinear, and hence we are unable to obtain independent effects from each of these

regimes. We find that the rate of adjustment in the fully fixed regime is not statistically different

from that of the fully flexible regime; hence, once again we fail to discern a strong association

between exchange rate rigidity in nominal terms and current account adjustment.




IV. Exchange Rate Regimes and Persistence of the Real Exchange Rate

        Why doesn’t a more flexible exchange rate regime generate a faster convergence of the

current account? This section aims to investigate this question. Our hypothesis is that the current

account responds to real exchange rate, not nominal exchange rate. If the real exchange rate

adjustment does not depend very much on the nominal exchange rate regime, then the current

account adjustment would not depend very much on nominal exchange rate regime either. We

now examine whether the nature of a country’s nominal exchange rate regime significantly

affects the adjustment process of its real exchange rate.

        In order to accomplish this aim, we repeat a similar process in the previous section,

except that we replace the current account with real effective exchange rates - CPI-deflated

trade-weighted indices14 - as calculated by the IMF.


                                                   21
       We estimate the basic specification, then augment with dummy variables for the regime,

and then incorporate the openness measures. In Table 10, one finds that the results indicate little

evidence that the nature of the exchange rate regime matters. In column 1, a simple AR(1)

specification indicates a 20% rate of real exchange rate reversion for the entire sample of

countries; adding in regime interaction terms yields an essentially unchanged rate of reversion

(22%), and no hint that any of the interaction terms with exchange rate regimes are anywhere

near statistical significance (column 2). This conclusion is not altered at all by the inclusion of

two openness measures. The rate of reversion is still the same (21%).

       As an aside, it is interesting that we find that real exchange rates are mean reverting. This

result is in line with other panel studies of real exchange rates (e.g., Murray and Papell, 2005). In

addition, greater trade openness is associated with faster reversion of the real exchange rate. This

finding does not fit in with Cheung and Lai (2000), Cheung et al. (2001), and Cashin and

McDermott (2006), but is in accord with the panel study of Alba and Papell (2007). (Trade

openness is also associated with a stronger real exchange rate on average).

       These results appear to be driven by the developing countries; they do not appear in the

industrial country category (columns 4-6). It is notable that for the developing countries the

estimated rate of real exchange rate persistence is not altered noticeably when one includes

indicators for exchange rate regimes, and measures of economic openness.

       It turns out that the results – at least pertaining to the exchange rate regime – do depend

upon whether one accounts for time fixed effects or not.15 In Table 11, the specifications are

augmented with time fixed effects. More fixed exchange rate regimes are not generally

associated with slower reversion. That is, going from a floating rate to a dirty float/crawling peg




                                                 22
does not result in a slower rate of reversion. However, we do find that – except for the industrial

country sample – the fixed regime induces substantially slower real exchange rate reversion.16

        To put this into perspective, for the non-industrial ex-oil countries, the rate of reversion

under flexible rates is 0.37. Under fixed exchange rates, the rate of reversion is 0.18. The half-

life of a deviation in the former case is 1.5 years, while in the latter it is 3.5 years. However, this

result is somewhat sensitive to the choice of specifications and country samples. For example,

without the two openness measures (as in Columns 2, 5, and 8), there is no statistical difference

between fixed and flexible exchange rate regimes.

        To summarize, there is no strong and robust evidence of a monotonic relationship from

more flexibility in an exchange rate regime to a faster speed in the convergence of real exchange

rates toward the long run equilibrium. This pattern is consistent with a lack of a strong and robust

relationship between exchange rate regimes and adjustment speed of current accounts.



V. Conclusion

        The notion that more flexibility in an exchange rate regime implies speedier adjustment

in current account is very plausible ex ante. The only problem is that it does not hold in the data.

In this paper, we examine the connection between the two for over 170 economies during 1971-

2005. We make use of two leading classification schemes of de facto exchange rate regimes. The

key finding is an utter absence of any robust association between the de facto nominal exchange

rate regime and the speed of current account adjustment.

        We further explore the reasons behind the disconnect. What matters for current account

adjustment is real, not nominal, exchange rate. Yet, there is no strong monotonic relationship

between flexibility of a nominal exchange regime and the speed of convergence in real exchange


                                                  23
rates. This finding again is independent of which de facto exchange rate regime classification

scheme we use.

       Accounting for the most obvious explanations – such as the omission of important

determinants of current account reversion – fails to overturn these findings. The endogeneity of

the exchange rate regimes also does not seem to explain the lack of a relationship between

exchange rate regimes and rates of current account adjustment.

       We therefore conclude that there is no robust and systematic association between a

country’s nominal exchange rate regime and the speed of current account adjustment. If public

policies can work on the level of real exchange rate directly, they may have some hope of

altering the pattern of current account imbalances. However, changing nominal exchange rate

regimes does not reliably alter the pace of real exchange rate reversion.

       We regard our empirical results as a challenge to the well-known Friedman (1953)

hypothesis in favor of a flexible exchange rate regime. This is true even in cases where the

degree of financial openness is low, as it was during the time when Friedman first forwarded his

argument. Hence, our results pose a challenge to an increasingly assertive policy

recommendation by international financial institutions on the virtue of a flexible regime in

promoting current account adjustment. We hope future work will be inspired by the evidence in

the paper to re-think the role of a nominal exchange rate regime in an economy’s external

adjustment.

1
    We check for higher order autoregressive terms, and find that an AR(1) is sufficient for the annual

data. The sole exception is for the category of non-industrial countries (and non-industrial ex.-oil

exporters) under a fixed exchange rate regime. In that case the 2nd lag is typically statistically

significant. However, the pattern of persistence, as measured by the sum of the autoregressive

coefficients, is unchanged relative to the baseline specification.
2
    We did estimate regressions of this form, and did not obtain any significant results. Subsequent

results indicate a lack of the requisite monotonicity which explains why this approach does not yield

significant estimates.
3
    We have also employed the de jure index based upon the IMF’s Annual Report on Exchange

Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions instead of the de facto measures. The results indicate no

systematic relationship.
4
    A panel regression of the absolute value of current account balances on regime dummies indicates a

significant positive effect for the fixed exchange rate dummy in the full, and non-industrial country

samples. Industrial countries exhibit no pattern, either allowing for fixed effects or not.
5
    This means we have omitted the “freely falling” regime observations, following Graciela Kaminsky’s

observation that such episodes are fundamentally distinct from freely floating.
6
    The samples have been truncated below at -1.5 and above at 2, to eliminate imprecisely estimated

coefficients.
7
    It has been pointed out that the response of current account reversion to exchange rate regime might

differ if the regimes change every year or couple of years. Hence, we have checked to see if the results

remain unchanged if we drop all observations where the regime has changed over the past three years.

We then find that for LDC samples, CA persistence does rise with exchange rate fixity, but that this

                                                      4
finding is not robust to inclusion of openness variables. Once these variables are included, there is no

evidence that greater exchange rate fixity leads to greater exchange rate persistence.
8
    If country fixed effects are included, then the estimated rates of reversion for all regimes and country

groupings rise – that is persistence is less marked once each current account is allowed to revert to a

country-specific mean.
9
    See for instance Milesi-Ferretti and Razin (1997, 1998) and Edwards (2004).
10
     Ghosh et al. (2008) finds that large surpluses, defined as surpluses above the 75 percentile, are more

persistent in fixed and intermediate regimes, while large deficits exhibit less persistence in

intermediate regimes. We cannot replicate these exact results, using our measures of de facto exchange

rates and our sample of countries. We also find that the results vary substantially by country grouping.

The industrial country grouping, in particular, exhibits different patterns from the non-industrial

country grouping.

     Here, we incorporate the nonlinear effects only when the relevant coefficient is statistically

significant.

     There are too few observations in the dirty float and dirty float/crawling peg categories to make

inferences.

     While Ghosh et al. (2008) pool over all countries in a given regression, we break down by groupings

in our finest detail. Our specification is in principle more general and more flexible. In addition, our

samples are also larger.

     See Chinn (2006) for a discussion of effective exchange rates.

     Mark and Sul (2008) have argued that the standard practice of using time fixed effects overstates the

rate of convergence when there is serial correlation in the common factor. To the extent that their

argument is valid in our sample, it would tend to reduce the discrepancy between the reversion rates

estimated for each exchange rate regime.

     Cashin and McDermott (2004) obtain similar results using the Reinhart-Rogoff classifications.
