       This   is a first report from a larger study of inventive activity

of U.S. firms and some of its consequences. It reports on the relationship

between patents applied for and R&D expenditures based on data for 121 large

corporations covering the 1968—1975 period. The main conclusion is that

there is a statistically significant relationship between a firm's R&D

expenditures and the number of patents it applied for and receives. This

relationship is very strong in the cross—sectional dimension (squared partial

correlations of .8 or higher). It is weaker in the within—firm time—series

dimension (partial r2's of .2 to .3). Attempts to fit an unconstrained dis-

tributed lag relationship yields only significant coefficients for the first

and last terms in the lag structure, indicating both a quick response of

patenting to changes in R&D and a small but persistent effect of past R&D,

the truncation of this long lag being reflected in a significant coefficient

for R&D lagged five years. In spite of these difficulties, patent counts do

measure something systematic and hence are worthy of further study.

I. Introduction

       This paper is the first report from a more extensive study of

knowledge producing activities in American industry initiated by the

National Bureau of Economic Research. Perhaps the most serious task

facing empirical work in the area of "technological change" and "inven-

tion and innovation" is the construction and interpretation of measures

(indices) of advances in knowledge) If one defines K as the level of

economically valuable technological knowledge, and K =      dK/dt   as the net

accretion to it per unit of time, then the first task of our research pro-

gram is to evaluate the usefulness of several indicators of I, focusing

particularly on patents and the value of the firm, variables which have

yet to .receive   the attention that we think might be warranted in this
           2
context.




LFor a thoughtful discussion of this point see Kuznets (1962).

  Most of the previous work on patents is eithe quite ancient and/or in-
conclusive. Professional opinion has not really progressed much past the
disagreement about the utility of patent statistics reflected in the dis—
cussions between Kuznets, Sanders and Schmookler [Nelson (1962)]. The most
recent review of the literature and independent contribution is to be found
in Taylor and Silberstone (1978). The papers that come closest to the topics
treated here are Scherer (1965) and Comanor and Scherer (1969).

       The basic structure of our project is illustrated succinctly by

the path analysis diagram in Figure 1. In that diagram I is a central

unobservable which together with the observable X's and the disturbances,

the v's, determines the magnitude of several interrelated indicators of

invention and innovation, the Vs. The latter include the stock market

value of the firm, the productivity of traditional factors of production,

and investment expenditures on traditional capital goods. It is an inves-

tigation of the lower half of this diagram which we report on in this paper.

We see there that K is produced by a knowledge production function, K.P.F.,

which translates past research expenditures, R, and a disturbances-term

u, into inventions. The disturbance term reflects the combined effect of other

non—formal R&D       inputs and the inherent randomness in the production

of inventions. Patents, P. are an imperfect indicator of the number of

new inventions with v representing the noise in the .relationship between

P and K .      It is clear from the figure that the patent equation, the
equation connecting patents to past research expenditures, combines the

properties of both the K.P.F. and of the indicator function relating to P

and K. Without additional indicators of f( one cannot separate the two

types of effects. For example, both u and v enter the relationship

between R and P but only u affects the Vs. In the context of a

larger model, one could separate out the effects of u from v      by cal-

culating the effect of the residual in the patent equation on the Z's, but

this cannot be done from the patent equation alone.

       We have made several simplifications in drawing and discussing this

diagram. For example, the relationship between K and K should be

defined explicitly to allow for the possibility of decay in the private

value of knowledge. K may be determined by the absolute level of K as
                                     —4—




well as by past investments in research resources. If, as is likely,

the uTs aie correlated over time then one would expect any realization of

u      to feedback into the demand for research resources. Moreover, conditions

(economic, technological and legal) should be specified under

which the benefits from applying for a patent outweigh

the costs of the patenting process, adding thereby more structure to the

relationship between P and           Figure 1 does, however, provide an

overview of our project and is sufficiently precise for the discussion of

the two issue on which this paper will concentrate:

1) the t!qualitytt of patent counts as an indicator of knowledge increments

and;

2) The time—shape of the lag between research expenditures and patentable

results.




3Such a theory, we think, would be based on the underlying notion of a
research project whose success depends stochastically both on the amount
of resources devoted to it andon the amount of time that such resources
have been deployed. With each technical success there is associated an
expectation of the ultimate economic value of a patent to the inventor or
his employer. If this expectation exceeds a certain minimum, the cost of
patenting, a patent will be applied for. That is, the number of patents
applied for is a count of the number of successful projects (inventions)
with the economic value of a patent exceeding a minimal threshold level.
If the distribution of the expected value of patenting successful projects
remains stable, and if the level of current and past R&D expenditures
shifts the probability that projects will be technically successful, an
increase in the number of patents can be taJcn as an indicator oY an up-
ward shift in the distribution of K .     Whether the relationship is
proportional will depend on the shape of the assumed distributions and
the nature of the underlying shifts in them. What we are dealing with
here is at best a very crude reduced form type equation whose theoretical
underpinnings remain still to be worked out. But one has to start some—
place.
                                     —5—




       The recent computerization of the U. S. Patent Office's data base

has made it possible for the first time to follow the patenting behavior

of a large cross—section of firms over a significant time interval. This

makes patent counts an easily accessible, perhaps the most easily acces—

sible, indicator of the number of inventions made by a firm. Moreover,

patents are a quantitative and rather direct indicator of invention; an

indicator which is not contaminated by many of the X's which also

affect the Z's .     There are, however, several problems with the patent

measure, the major ones being the fact that not all new innovations are

patented and that patents differ in their economic impact. These consider—

ations have led to doubts about the "quality" of patent counts as an

indicator of knowledge increments (see the literature cited in footnote 2).

We attempt to respond to such concerns by first presenting a more precise

description of the patent equation in section II of this paper and then

reporting in section III on one particular measure of the "quality" of

patent statistics.

       There is another advantage of patent counts over other indicators

of knowledge production. Patents are applied for at an intermediate stage

in the process of transforming research input into benefits from knowledge

output. They can be used, therefore, to separate the lags that occur in

that process into two parts; one which produces patents from current and

past research investments, and another which takes patents, with the pos-

sible addition of more research expenditures, into benefits. Such a break—

down should allow us to estimate more precisely the overall lag structure,

a structure which has confounded and confused previous empirical work in
                                      -6-




this area.4 Section IV presents our first—round estimats of the distributed

lag between research expenditures and patentable results.

      The data used in this study are at the firm level and are based

on a merger of the information provided in the Compustat file (based on

the 10—K firm   reports   to the SEC) and patent data tabulated by the Office

of Technology Assessments and Forecasts of the U.S. Patent Office. These

data and the particular sample chosen are described in greater detail in

Appendix A. Most of the work reported on here is based on the patenting

behavior of 121 firms during the 1968—75 period.




4See, for example, how two different assumptions about the lag structure
lead to very different calculations of the private rate of return to research
expenditures from the NSF—Griliches data; Z. Griliches (1980) vs. A. Pakes
and M.A. Schankerman (1978).

Section II: The Model


         We report, in Appendix B, a preliminary investigation into the

functional form of the relationship between patents and past R&D expendi—

tures. That analysis supports a rather simple patent equation: the

logarithm of patents (p) as a function of a time trend (t), current and

five lagged values of the logarithm of research expenditures (r) and a

set of firm specific dummy variables. In this section we provide an

interpretation of this patent equation in terms of a simple model re-

lating past r to the logarithm of current knowledge increments (k), and

      to p.

         Consider first the transformation function from r to k      ,   or    the

K.P.F. Assuming it to be of the Cobb—Douglas form but allowing for firm

constants and a time trend, we have:



                                       5
               k.     =   a.1 + bt +
                                       T0 T 1,t—T + u.i,t
                                          0 r.                           (1)
                i,t



where         is an independent and identically distributed disturbance which

js not correlated with r and represents randomness in the K.P.F.




The              represent firm—specific differences in the productivity
         a1
of      research effort caused by either variance in technological

opportunities or differences in managerial ability.         Such

differences will, in general, be transmitted to differences in research
                                            —8—




expenditures, firms with more productive research departments investiug

more in research.                   Thus, the a. have two roles in the subsequent

analysis. First, they cause differences in k and this should be con-

sidered in an analysis of the determinants of the variance in p. Second,

their correlation with the                  must be accounted for in any attempt to
                                       tT
estimate the 0          or else the coefficient estimates will be a combination
                   T
of   the effect of the r
                                t—T
                                      on k (the 0 ) and the effect of a. on r.
                                                     T                       1
To be more explicit about the latter point we simply project the a1 on

all in—sample research expenditures. Since the a.                 are constant over

time they can only be correlated with the means of the research variables.

We can write, therefore,




                                5
                       a. =
                        1       T0 r.

                                           +u.1•                                  (2)




where

                            T                               T—l
        ri•O   =    T1 t=l r.it         ,   r.i•—1   =   T1t=O it—i
                                                                r.    ,   etc.,


and     u. is by construction uncorrelated with all in—sample research
       15
variables.

5In econometric terminology the model we are working with is a variant of
the partial transmission model of Mundlak and Hoch (1965). The unobservable
portion of the K.P.F. which is transmitted to the research demand equation
is assumed to remain constant over time. This assumption, plus the nature
of the panel, will allow us to use single equation estimation techniques to
estimate parameters of the patent production function. A more precise dis-
cussion of the econometric techniques underlying the estimation procedures
to be used in this paper is to be found in Muridlak (1978) and Pakes (1978,
chapter 3)

           Patents are our indicator of knowledge increments. If one allows

for a time trend in the relationship between p and k that relationship

is written as:



                                                   *
                          p.
                           i,t
                               =dt+ 13k. +v                                                    (3)

             *
where       v    is uncorrelated with k and t by construction.

           (3) should be interpreted as a reduced form from the appropriate

patenting model. In that reduced form                  13    is the elasticity of patents

with respect to knowledge increments and d is a measure of the trend in

factors determining the propensity to patent.                            ,   on the other hand,

is that part of the (detrended) variance in patents which cannot be accounted

for by (detrended) movements in knowledge increments; that is, variance in

           is "noise" in the patent measure. To facilitat interpretation we

will make two assumptions on v.
                              1,t
                                              .    First,      we let v•
                                                                             i,t
                                                                                    be composed of

a firm—specific component, v. ,          which reflects differences among firms

in their average propensity to patent, and a second, independent and iden-

tically distributed disturbance, v ,                        reflecting   the variations (around

a trend) in the propensity to patent of a given firm over time. Thus,
 *                                       *
       =   v + v•
 i,t        1    it   .   Second, since v.
                                         1,t       is uncorrelated with k
                                                                                       i,t   (by

choice of 13) we shall assume also that its determinants V. and v
                                                                                   1         i,t

   The first assumption allows us to provide standard errors for our esti-
mates of the regression coefficients. The second is a rather strong
assumption. We are assuming that randomness in the K.P.F., above or below
average success in converting research expenditures into knowledge incre-
ments, does not influence the patenting decision, that the two sources of
randomness are distinct and independent. We need this assumption to make

       The first point to note from (4) is that though one cannot esti-

mate the elasticities of knowledge increments with respect to research

resources, the 0T     one can investigate the form of the distributed lag

connecting k and r ,      since w/Ew =           .   The sum of the estimate

                                     TO T
with respect to knowledge increments (s).    These two parameters can

be identified separately only in a larger model wzich includes additional indica—

toisof the benefits from knowledge producing activities (see the Introduction).

       Recall that the various variance components which combine to form the

disturbance term in (5) are mutually uncorrelated. It follows that

Var (n1 +       =     the variance of the total disturbance in the patent

equation is greater than Var(v.+v.), the variance of the noise in patents

as an indicator of l. It also implies that, temporarily ignoring the time

trend in the patent indicator equation (assuming d =   0),.   the ratio of   cy2

to the total variance in the logarithm-of patents (l—R2)

provides an upper bound for the noise to total variance ratio in the patent

measures. The upper bound will be called u.T. and its complement, the relavant

   measure, is a measure of the quality of patents as an indicator of knowledge
increments. If, instead of assuming d = 0, we assume b= 0, that is, the entire

trend effect is due to differences in the average propensity to patent over

time, tlen one can derive an analogous measure of A1.T. for detrended patents

by filtering out time from both the patent and R&D variables.        In practice, the

two measures of u.T. were always almost identical.            In the next

section, we also present the comparable information on the noise to total

variance ratio in the between firm variance in patents (i.e., in the

variance of P    —   P   ),   labelled    A,and in the within firm variance in

patents (the variance in P. — P. )              X   .   The latter two statistics
                         it    i•

provide some indication of the usefulness of patent counts as an indicator

of knowledge increments for studies of invention and innovation that focus

either on cross—sectional differences in the production of knowledge

between firms, or on the within firm fluctuations over time.

lower bounds to the systematic to total variance ratios, cy2                ,         ,   and

some relevant sample moments for each of the seven industries in our data

(rows 0 through 6), all firms in our sample (row 7) and firms in the in-

dustries defined by rows 1 through 6 (Thw 8). The latter sample concentrates

on firms in research—intensive industries.

       Starting with the measures of l_ATh.T in the separate industries,

it is clear, even from our simplistic model, that much of the patent variance

is systematic, providing a good indicator of the underlying variance in k.

For the seven industries in our sample, about 85% of the variance in                      p is
associated with variance in r and, in some industries, notably scientific

instruments and office computing and accounting machinery, the lower bound

of the systematic to total variance in patents is closr to .95.

       These estimates hide, however, some relevant information. Moving to

column (2) it is clear that we are far less certain of whether within any

given firm changes over time in p reflect systematic changes in knowledge

production by that firm. In the within firm calculations it mattered

whether or not we first filtered out time trends from p and r. There-

fore, the bracketed numbers beside column (2) refer to systematic to total

variance ratios in detrended patents. Averaging over the seven industries

we find that the lower bound (l—A") is only around 20 to 25%, though

it does reach 50% in office, computing and accounting machinery. Without

the larger model alluded to in the introduction one cannot really tell

whether the smaller systematic to total variance ratios in the "within"

data reflect true randomness in the knowledge production function, small

differences in research expenditures over time within a given firm having

very sporadic effects on the production of inventions in particular years,

or whether they arise because firms decide to patent different proportions

of their inventions in different years.

       Two more points should be noted about the results for the separate

industries. Column 6 shows that over 90% of the total variance in p is

between firm variance. As a result 1 — X
                                           u.B.   .

Second, though a2 does not vary too much between the sample industries,

    varies a lot, being much larger in the less homogeneous industries

(rows 0, 1, and 3). This is likely to reflect greater differences in the

average propensities to patent in those industries.

       Looking at the samples which aggregate the various industries

(rows 7 and 8) we find that the 1 _u.W. actually drease after pooling

different industry samples. This implies that, at least in our sample, the

elasticity of patents with respect to knowledge increments (3) and th

response of     to current and past r (0) do not vary much between the

industries aggregated; a result which will be confirmed in the next section.

Section IV: Coefficient Estimates


       Table 2 presents the estimates of the WT and the coefficient of

the trend term based on data from all of the 121 firms and estimates based

on two sub—samples: firms in research—intensive industries and other

manufacturing" firms. Row 10 of that table presents the estimates value

of the F statistic for the null hypothesis that these coefficients do

not differ between the industries aggregated.   The tests statistics

indicate that, after we allow for a separate trend and intercept for the

drug industry (row 9), our sample cannot really pickup any additional

interindustry differences in coefficients.

       Turning to the coefficient of the trend term, that coefficient was

negative, and significantly so, for all industries except for the drug in-

dustry. There are two alternative explanations of this result and they

cannot be separated out without the larger model alluded to in the intro-

duction. First, the negative trend is consistent with impressionistic

evidence on the declining propensity to patent in U.S. manufacturing. The drug

industry is indeed an exception since, during the period concerned, there oc-

curred both a relaxation in the patent office's acceptance procedures re-

garding patents on natural substances and significant changes in regulatory




7The possible exception here is the drug industry. When that industry
was dropped from the first two samples the observed values of the F -
test dropped significantly to 1.37 and 1.67 respectively. Still the
estimated coefficients for the drug industry were not very     different
from those of the other industries in the sample, except for the trend
coefficient.

conditions facing that industry.        The same result, however, could have

been caused by a secular decline in the private productivity of research

resources, a hypothesis which is consistent with the observed negative

growth rate of employment of R&D scientists and engineers during the

period considered.9

         The individual coefficients are not estimate& very precisely. The
                  *
sum of the lags, w ,     is   estimated with a fair amount of precision and

equals     about .60 with a standard error of 0.08. If one ignores the

fact that some of the estimated lag coefficients are negative and computes

a "mean lag," it equals about 1.6 years for the all firm sample. Unless

substantial R&D is done on projects after patents are applied for, this

should approximately equal the mean R&D project gestation lag, the lag

between project inception and project completion. The scattered empirical

evidence on gestation lags indicates that this is indeed the case.1°

         Still, the estimated form of the lag is rather disturbing. There

are large, significant, positive coefficients in the first and last years,

and very little effect of interim R&D on patent applications. Though the

current year's coefficient could indicate th presence of simultaneous

10ources of project level data are L. Wagner (1968) and J. Rapoport (1971).
This evidence is summarized in terms of mean gestation lags in A. Pakes
and M.A. Schankerman (1978). The average of the mean gestation lags pre-
sented in the latter paper was 1.34 years.

equations bias, that is not really a necessary implication of the results.

The R&D project, level data cited above do point to a gestation lag which is

highly skewed with large early year coefficients and any minor misspecifica—

tion in the model could push all this effect into the coefficient of
                                                                       r0. The

coefficient estimate which is perhaps more disturbing is that of the last year
since it could be indicating the presence of a "truncation" problem in our

distributed lag estimates. That is, the coefficient of the fifth year

could be proxying for a series of small effects of the more basic research

done six years ago or earlier. There estimates of the form of the lag

should       be treated with caution, both because of the possible trunca-

tion problem and because they are not really consistent with our prior

beliefs about the form of this lag structure.

Section V: Conclusions and Extensions


      Our first look at the patent equation suggests the following con-

clusions. First, the data were quite clear on the form of that equation;

loglog          with (correlated) firm effects and a time trend being

preferred over alternatives. Second, our major positive finding is

given by the iu.B. estimates presented in Table 1. They show that

patents are a good indicator of between firm differences in advances of

knowledge. Since the between firm component dominates the total variance

in patents a similar comment applies also to the total variance. If this

result changes at all in the more sophisticated models we are beginning to

estimate, it is only likely to improve. Use of a longer series of past

R&D expenditures cannot but increase the fit of the patent equation, and

adding another indicator of benefits will separate out the effect of ran—

dourness in the K.P.F., the u, from the effect of noise in the patent
                 *
measure, the v       ,   allowing   us to narrow the bound further.

         The rest of our results are not as heartening. While a part of the

within firm variance in patents is related to

the variance in R&D expenditures, a significant portion, about 75 percent, is

not. At this stage we cannot tell whether the fault lies in the patent

measure (the variance in v*),            in randomness in the K.P.F. (   the variance

in u), or in simple errors of measurement in both p and r. Most of the
                                                                              -
coefficients, except for trend, were not estimates very precisely.

This is a result of two factors,           First, only the within firm

variance in p and r can be used to estimate W               and this variance is a
                                      —21—




 small part of the total variance in these variables (see Table 1). The

 second factor leading to imprecise estimates is the small sample size

 (maximum T =   8, N = 121).   We can and will increase our sample signifi-.

 candy in the future by not insisting that firms had to have reported R&D

expenditures before 1972 (see Appendix A). Including such firms will

force us, however, to use only a few lagged terms of r or assume a

specific functional form for the distributed lag between patents and R&D

expenditures, even though we have yet to acquire much information on the

shape of this distribution. Because our estimates indicate that even

with 5 lagged R&D terms we still may have a truncation problem, we have

been developing a technique for estimating distributed lags In panel data

when the time series on the independent variable is short.     We are also

investigating the impact of other sources of bias in the estimated coeffi-

cients, in particular the effect of measurement errors In the R&D variables.

Finally, once an appropriate specification for the patent equation has been

determined, we will combine it with the other equations in our model in the

hope of providing a fuller understanding of the process of invention and

innovation in American industry.

       In short, a great deal of work remains to be done, but we have made

a start. It is already clear that something systematic and related to know-

ledge producing activities is being measured by patents and that they are,

therefore, very much worthy of further study.

Appendix A: Data Sources, Sample and Variable Definitions, and Sample
            Characteristics


       The data base used in this preliminary round is neither complete

nor representative. We have tried to get together from published sources

as large a sample of firms as possible, covering the 1963—77 period.    The main

selection variable is R&D. Until recently (1972 and later) most firms

did not report their R&D expenditures publicly,      The firms that

did report R&D expenditures, reported company financed R&D expenditures,

and those numbers are recorded on the Standard and PoorTs Computstat tape,

which served as a major source of our data.1      An earlier study by Nadiri

and Bitros (1980) had used the Coinpustat tape and a mail survey to fill in

some of the gaps on this tape to construct time series of R&D for 114 firms

for the period 1963—72. Starting with a later edition of the tape we found

146 firms with no more than 3 years of R&D data missing during the 1963—75

period. Combining it with the Nadiri sample yielded an unduplicated total

of 172 firms. Fifteen firms were eliminated from this total either because

they were foreign, had undergone large mergers, or had other unreconcible

jumps in their data. This left us with a tta1 of 157 firms which constitute

the sample on which we are currently working.2       For the purposes of this

contracts most often include clauses b.ich put the output of government
funded projects in the public domain.

     is possible to construct a much larger sample is one is willing to
restrict oneself to post 1972 data. We are currently engaged in develop-
ing such a 1972—78 sample, with an expected N of about 900.
                                   —23—




paper, the sample was further restricted to firms that had data (did not

undergo any major reorganization) throughout the whole period (N = 144)

and had an R&D program of more than minimal size (R&D > $0.5 million) in

any one year, (N =   121).   What we have done, then, basically, is to expand

the Nadiri sample slightly, update it to 1977, and add patent data to it.3

       The patent data were supplied to us by the Office of Technology

Assessment and Forecasts of the U.S. Patent Office. They are based on a

tape of all patents granted during the years 1969—78. These data are then

reclassified by year of application rather than by year of grant. One of

our tasks was to be sure that we had all the subsidiaries and names used

by a particular corportation. For this purpose we scrutinized the alpha-

betical index of patenting organization provided by OTAF and checked it

against the list of a firm's subsidiaries given in the Dictionary of

Affiliations and a list of past mergers given in Mergers and Acquisitions.

Where a firm had acquired another one during this period, we added in the

patents of the acquired organization (and its R&D expenditures, when known).

In a few cases, where the mergers were large and occurred towards the end of

the period, we left the two firms uninerged and instead declared the recent

(post—merger) years as missing.

       Because the patent data are based on patents granted during 1969—78,

patents by year applied for cannot really be used before 1968. While only

less thatr.l percent of all patents granted is granted within the year of

application, about 10 percent are granted in the following year. Thus,

only about 89 percent of the patents applied for in 1967 would appear among



3Some of the missing years have been interpolated by us. Also, the defini-
tion of expenditures reported as R&D by different firms may change over time.
Where such changes were obvious or stated in the 10—K forms, we tried to adjust
for it. Where we could not and the discrepanies were large, we eliminated the
firm from our sample.
                                 —24—




the patents counted by us. Similarily, one cannot probably use the

patent data by year of application after 1975, since it takes about four

years after the application before more than 96 percent of the patents applied

for in that year that will be eventually granted are actually granted.4 Thus,

at best, we have about 8—9 years of usable patent data. In most of the

analyses we used the 8 years 1968—75. Eight years and 121 firms give us an

effective sample size of 968.

       Table Al gives means and standard deviations for a few of the major

variables in the various samples and industries represented In this study.

The industrial classification was chosen to approximate

the    industrial breakdown used by the NSF in their reports. It is clear

from this table that these firms are rather large, that the exclusion of

firms with R&D budgets of less than half a million dollars makes them even

larger, that the size distribution of the firms is quite skewed (standard

deviations are on the order of the means or larger), and that the industrial

distribution is quite uneven. The firms represented in the sample are those

who reported their R&D expenditures publicly in the 1960! s with drug and

chemical firms over—represented. In spite of the presence of relatively

large firms in this sample, there is still a relatively large number of low

patenting firms. Table A2 gives a distribution of firms by their level of

patenting.




4These estimates are based on an unpublished tabulation of patents granted
by date applied for for the period 1965—77 made available to us by OTAF.

       The R&D expeilditures have been deflated by an R&D "deflator" index

constructed along the lines suggested by Jaffe in NSF (1972). It is simply a

weighted average of the index of hourly labor compensation and the implicit

deflator in the non—financial corporations sector, with .49 and .51 as

relative weights.                                              -



       The main problem with our sample is its peculiar nature. It is based

on those companies that reported R&D expenditures in the mid—60's. Since

it is selected on the "independent" variable in this study, one need not

anticipate much of a selectivity bias in equations where patents or the

market value of the firm are the dependent variables. Moreover, since most

of our analysis will be "within" firms, any fixed selectivity adjustment

would be incorporated in the constant term and would not affect our infer-

ences. We do intend, however, to explore the selectivity issue later on,

once we have completed the construction of a larger sample based on 1972—79

data. Since data are available for most firms as of 1976, one can find

out the characteristics of the firms that did not report R&D earlier and

Appendix B: The Form of the Patent Equation


       Because there was little prior empirical or theoretical research

on the R&D to patents relation we began our analysis with an investiga-

tion of the functional form of the equation that might connect these two

variables in our data.

       Functional form questions were examined allowing the parameters of

all estimated equations to differ in each of our seven industries and

between firms with large and small R&D departments within each industry.1

That is, fourteen sets of parameters were estimated. The independent vari-

ables included in the estimating equations were a set of time dummies, the

current and five consecutive lagged values of both the logarithm of R&D

expenditures and R&D expenditures per Se, and a set of firm—specific dummy

variables (constants). To simplify matters we assumed that the appropriate

form of the dependent variable was either log (P) = p   ,   or P itself.
Hence log—log, semi—log, and linear functions each with firm and time effects,

were all special cases of the model with whichwe started.

      A variant of the Box and Cox (1962) procedure was used to choose the

form of the dependent variable. It indicated that the logarithm of patents

was clearly preferred over the absolute number of patents by the data for

each separate grouping, and for the sample as a whole. We then asked the


"Small firms were defined, quite arbitrarily as firms whose R&D expenditures
over the sample period (from 1963 to 1975) fell below half a million dollars
in at least one year. The size breakdown had the effect of separating out
the recently born science—based firms from the others in the sample and
allowed for the possibility that the characteristics of the K.P.F. differed
in the firms with smaller, less established, research departments.

question of whether the parameters of the relationship between p and the

independent variables within each industry differed between firms with large

and small R&D departments.   The test statistic was significant at any

reasonable level of significance indicating that the form of the relation-

ship between patents and research expenditures was different for firms with

small R&D departments. The 26 firms in the small group were dropped from

all the subsequent computations reported in this paper. Next, we wanted to

know whether the model could be simplified by assuming either that the co-

efficients of current and all lagged values of R&D, or that the coefficients

of the logarithmic forms of these variables, were all zero. The F36' 734

statistic for the joint significance of the R&D variables in their natural

form was a rather small 1.18 whereas that test statistic for the logarithmic

form of the R&D variables was a highly significant 3.30. We, therefore,

accepted the former and rejected the latter hypothesis and went on to test

another simplification; whether or not the seven time dummies could be

approximated by a linear time trend. The observed value of the F30' 770

deviate for this hypothesis was .95, which isbelow the expected value of

that test statistic given that the time dumnes were in fact representing

a simple trend. Two other hypotheses were tested but both were clearly re-

jected by the data. The first was that the distribution of the firm—specific

constants was degenerate,    that there were no "firm effects." After re-

jecting this hypothesis we went on to test whether it was reasonable to

assume that the firm effects were uncorrelated with research expenditures.

It was not. Thus the form of the equation we settled on was rather simple:

 the logarithm of patents as a function of a time trend, current and five
                                      —31—




    consecutive lagged values of the logarithm of R&D expenditures, and

    (correlated) firm—specific constant terms.2




    21here is one issue which we have not dealt with here because it is not
    very important in our sample. For observations where P = 0 log (P) is
    undefined. This exposes an underlying truncation problem in our model.
    That problem, however, is of minor importance for our sample since only
    8 percent of the observations are at P = 0 and this is less than the
    percentage of observations at P = 1 (14%) indicating that the truncation
    problem is not large. It is even smaller for the larger R&D firm sample
    (N = 121) where the zero patents percentage is only 3. As a result we
    treated the whole problem as one of finding a point on the logarithmic scale
    for P = 0, and this was accomplished by adding a dummy variable to the in—
•   dependent variables for observations where P = 0. The estimated coeff i—
    dents of this dummy variable are stable across models implying roughly
    the value of 0.1 to 0.7 for the P = 0 observations. It does raise the
    issue, though, whether our functional form (log—log) is appropriate for
    low patenting level observations. We intend to investigate more explicitly
    probabilistic models of the patenting process in subsequent work.
