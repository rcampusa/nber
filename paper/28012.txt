Nursing Home Quality, COVID-19 Deaths, and Excess Mortality
Christopher J. Cronin and William N. Evans
NBER Working Paper No. 28012

JEL No. I1,I18

                                         ABSTRACT

The COVID-19 pandemic in the US has been particularly devastating for nursing home residents.
A key question is how have some nursing homes been able to effectively protect their residents,
while others have not? Using data on the universe of US nursing homes, we examine whether
establishment quality is predictive of COVID-19 mortality. Higher-quality nursing homes, as
measured by inspection ratings, have substantially lower COVID-19 mortality. Quality does not
predict the ability to prevent any COVID-19 resident or staff cases, but higher-quality
establishments prevent the spread of resident infections conditional on having one. Preventing
COVID-19 cases and deaths may come at some cost, as high-quality homes have substantially
higher non-COVID deaths, a result consistent with high excess non-COVID mortality among the
elderly since March. The positive correlation between establishment quality and non-COVID
mortality is driven entirely by nursing homes located in counties with below-median COVID-19
case rates. As a result, high-quality homes in these counties have significantly more total deaths
than their low-quality counterparts. The concentration of excess death in low-risk areas suggests
that future suffering could be avoided with more nuanced guidelines, such as those recently
suggested by CMS that outline a role for in-person visits in lower-risk areas.

I.       Introduction

         The COVID-19 pandemic in the US has been particularly devastating for residents of

nursing homes. As of September 14th, 2020, there have been a total of 192,221 COVID-related

deaths in the US. We estimate that 39 percent of these deaths are among nursing home residents.

The death rate for non-nursing home residents is about 37 per 100,000.1 The death rate for nursing

home residents is more than 150 times that number at roughly 5,600 per 100,000. The death rate in

nursing homes is even orders of magnitude larger than the death rate for those 65 and over outside

of nursing homes, which we calculate to be about 208 per 100,000. In at least three states,

Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Jersey, more than 8 percent of the nursing home population

at the beginning of the year has died as a result of the pandemic.

         These horrific figures likely understate the true number of nursing home deaths associated

with the pandemic. Quickly after the pandemic hit the US, most nursing homes banned all visitors,

disrupting the daily routines of many residents.2 An abundance of qualitative evidence from nursing

home staff, administrators, and resident family members suggests that the lack of in-person contact

with loved ones and other residents is not only generating feelings of loneliness, isolation, and

despair, but may also expedite death (Aronson, 2020; Paulin, 2020; Graham, 2020). Population-wide

trends in mortality support this claim. Figure 1 uses provisional data from the Centers for Disease

Control (CDC) to show average weekly total deaths for the population 65 and older in 2018-2019,

compared to 2020, where the latter are decomposed into total and non-COVID deaths. The figure

highlights that in addition to COVID-19 deaths, there has been a dramatic increase in non-COVID

deaths among seniors. While all seniors do not live in nursing homes, many of the most fragile do,


1We outline the data used in these calculations in the next section.
2On March 13th, 2020, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid recommended that nursing homes to restrict visitors and
non-essential personnel (CMS, 2020a). The Kaiser Family Foundation notes that early in the pandemic, 27 states banned
visitors and 22 states recommended that nursing homes ban visitors (Tolbert et al., 2020). Two states provided no
guidance.

                                                         1
suggesting that many of these excess deaths may very well occur in nursing homes. For example,

excess mortality for Alzheimer’s is particularly high. While only 12.5 percent of Alzheimer patients

live in nursing homes (Lepore et al., 2017), just under half of nursing home residents have

Alzheimer’s (CDC, 2020a). In 2018, 50.6 percent of all deaths listing Alzheimer’s as an underlying

cause occurred in nursing homes.3 In Figure 2, we report the CDC’s estimate of excess Alzheimer’s

deaths estimate based on provisional data through September 26th. They estimate almost 30,000

excess deaths during the pandemic with an Alzheimer’s diagnosis, but only 23 percent have a

corresponding positive COVID-19 diagnosis, leaving 77 percent of these deaths as not directly

related to the disease but to other aspects of the pandemic.

           COVID-19 deaths among nursing home patients is heavily influenced by infection and

transmission rates in the surrounding community, which varies substantially by region. For example,

non-nursing home COVID-19 deaths rates vary from a low of 4 per 100,000 in Vermont to a high

of 143 per 100,000 in New York. Yet, community risk alone cannot explain the vast variation in

nursing home death rates. Even in the three states mentioned above with the highest death rate, 23

percent of nursing homes with over 100 beds had not experienced a single COVID-19 mortality by

the beginning of September. A key research question is then how have some nursing homes been

able to effectively protect their residents, while others have not?

           In this work, we focus on one particular dimension of the problem: nursing home quality.

Starting in 2008, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) began providing a “five-star” rating

of nursing home quality based on three elements: health inspections, staff-to-resident ratios, and

quality metrics such as rates of falls and bedsores, with the first element having the greatest weight in

an “overall” rating. We merge this quality data with data on COVID-19 cases and mortality that is

reported weekly by nursing homes to CMS starting the week ending May 24th. In count-data models

                                                          2
that control for local risk factors and nursing home characteristics, we find that the inspection rating

is highly predictive of mortality, with five-star homes having 24 percent fewer resident COVID-19

deaths by September 13th than one-star homes. The inspection rating is more correlated with

COVID-19 deaths than the overall rating, the latter of which researchers used in earlier work (i.e.,

using data from early March) to argue that high-quality homes were unable to prevent cases (Abrams

et al., 2020). In addition to having less predictive power, we provide evidence that the overall quality

metric is more correlated with deaths after mid-May than those occurring before, rationalizing these

disparate findings by suggesting that the virulence of the disease caught all nursing homes by

surprise, but that the best homes adjusted with time.

          We identify several mechanisms through which quality nursing homes lowered mortality.

First, we show that the chance of having any COVID-19 cases among residents or staff is not

explained by nursing home quality, meaning even high-quality homes were unable to prevent

COVID-19 from entering their facility. That said, in models that condition on having at least one

confirmed case, we show that higher-quality nursing homes more successfully prevent the spread of

the disease among residents. Unfortunately, we do not have detailed data on the policies and

procedures that enabled these establishments to prevent the spread of the disease. We do show that

quality homes experience fewer outages in personal protective equipment (PPE) and fewer staff

shortages, which may help with patient monitoring and isolation. Furthermore, we show that

conditional on quality, homes avoiding PPE outages and staff shortages have fewer COVID-19

deaths.

          A likely scenario is that higher-quality establishments did a better job at isolating residents

both from outside risks from visitors and other residents. This may have come at a cost. When we

change the outcome in the count-data model from COVID-19 deaths to non-COVID deaths, we

find that higher-quality nursing homes have much higher non-COVID mortality and that aggregate



                                                      3
mortality is not generally impacted by nursing home quality. Moreover, when we conduct this

analysis separately for nursing homes in high- and low-risk counties, as measured by cumulative

cases per capita, we find that (i) quality is not consistently associated with non-COVID deaths in

high-risk counties, (ii) high-quality homes have significantly and substantially more non-COVID

deaths than low-quality homes in low-risk counties, and (iii) in low-risk counties, aggregate mortality

is increasing in nursing home quality.

        One possible explanation is that there is incomplete reporting of COVID-19 or strategic use

of defining COVID-19 deaths by nursing homes to mitigate the damage to their reputation from the

CMS reports. To lessen concerns that our results are driven by these problems, we estimate an

additional model for nursing homes located in counties with zero COVID-19 deaths, meaning risk

of infection within a nursing home is very low. There are roughly 700 nursing homes in this sample

by mid-September and there can be little strategic use of redefining deaths in areas that have no

COVID-19 mortality. In these counties, we find that non-COVID deaths are increasing with

nursing home quality and the highest-quality establishments have 35 percent more non-COVID

deaths than the lowest quality ones.4

        Given the number of COVID-19 related deaths and an early understanding that the elderly

die at higher rates, there is surprisingly little research on deaths in nursing homes. As a result, this

paper contributes to the literature on the health effects of COVID-19 along several dimensions. A

number of papers have examined the general relationship between CMS five-star ratings and

COVID-19 cases and/or deaths in nursing homes but much of this work was either in a single state

(Bui et al., 2020; Harrington et al., 2020; He et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020a) or occurred very early in the

pandemic (Abrams et al., 2020). Some studies have used various versions of the CMS data used in



4We also show that, conditional on nursing home quality, staff shortages and PPE outages do not predict non-COVID
deaths. One would expect a positive relationship if non-COVID deaths were truly misreported COVID deaths.


                                                        4
this study. Gorges and Konetzka (2020) show that county incidence rates are the strongest

predictor of resident mortality and staff levels have modest impacts on the spread of the disease. Li

et al. (2020b) document much higher COVID-19 death rates in homes with greater minority

patients. Chen et al. (2020) show that contractors that service multiple nursing homes in a local area

helped spread the disease. The data from the CDC showing large excess death rates for the elderly

and especially Alzheimer’s patients has helped put this issue into the public discussion, yet there is

little research other than efforts to document the extent of the problem and almost no research on

the factors that lead to excess mortality.

        While much of the previous work studies determinates of outbreaks, only a few studies such

as Liu et al. (2020b) and Gorges and Konetzka (2020) consider mortality in a nationwide sample as

we do. Moreover, we identify that this relationship is most likely explained by high-quality homes

reducing the spread of the virus once it enters the homes and it is not due to a home’s ability to

prevent the entry of the disease. Importantly, our paper is the first to establish a positive link

between nursing home quality and non-COVID-19 mortality. This relationship is so pronounced in

areas with low COVID-19 risk, that high-quality nursing homes are found to have significantly

higher total mortality than low-quality homes in these areas. This is not surprising. The initial CMS

directives about nursing home operations during COVID-19 recommended prohibiting visitors

regardless of the underlying risk. As some nursing homes face little COVID-19 risk, they assumed

many of the negative of the costs of isolation without much benefit. CMS has recently begun to

recognize that that these restrictions have taken a toll on residents. In a memo released September

17th outlining revised procedures for nursing homes during the pandemic, CMS notes that “…we

recognize that physical separation from family and other loved ones has taken a physical and

emotional toll on residents. Residents may feel socially isolated, leading to increased risk for

depression, anxiety, and other expressions of distress. Residents living with cognitive impairment or



                                                    5
other disabilities may find visitor restrictions and other ongoing changes related to COVID-19

confusing or upsetting” (CMS, 2020b). In this memo, CMS outlines policies for outdoor visitation

and relaxed policies for indoor visitation in lower-risk settings such as counties with low positivity

rates in the general population. The goal of reducing COVID-19 risks is laudable but as economists

are want to point out, all policies have costs and we have just begun to recognize the costs of these

restrictions. Our results suggest that efforts to control the spread of the virus may have come at

some cost. A more general discussion about reducing COVID-19 risks without disrupting the lives

of vulnerable seniors is in order.



II.     Data

II.A.   Data Sources and Reporting Accuracy

        There are two primary sources of information about COVID-19 case and mortality

incidence at the nursing home level. The first is a weekly data set released by the Centers for

Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) that has COVID-19 surveillance information by nursing home. On

May 8th, 2020, CMS released a final ruling that required nursing homes to report confirmed and

suspected COVID-19 cases of residents and staff to both the residents and their representatives.

The ruling also required that nursing homes report weekly totals of surveillance items to the Centers

for Disease Control (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network, starting with the week ending May

24th, 2020. Reporting was mandatory with $1,000 fines issued after four-weeks of non-reporting.

Fines increased by $500 per week of non-reporting (CMS, 2020c).

        The first weekly file was released by CMS in early June and updates are released on

Thursdays, 11 days after the end of the reporting period, which is a Monday to Sunday period. The

initial release of this data set was in a word, messy. There were obvious key-punch errors and

variables were frequently reported in the wrong columns. Subsequent releases of the data corrected



                                                   6
many of these recording errors and the most recent releases of the data are now relatively free from

these obvious errors, although some naturally exist. Reporting has always been high. In the first

release of the data, 14,548 nursing homes reported data and 96 percent passed a quality assurance

check. This number increased to 15,214 for the week ending September 13th, and 98 percent passed

a quality assurance check. Based on the size of the CMS five-star data set, this represents about 98

percent of all nursing homes.

        The CMS nursing home data reports weekly and cumulative values for confirmed COVID-

19 cases for residents and staff, suspected cases for these two groups, COVID-19 deaths (which

includes suspected and confirmed), plus all deaths among residents. All these variables are reported

weekly and cumulatively since January 1st, 2020. Deaths are for residents regardless of the location,

so if a nursing home resident is moved to a hospital and dies there, the death is counted as a nursing

home resident death. The survey asks nursing homes if they have shortages of key staff including

nursing staff, clinical staff, and aids, and whether they have adequate supplies of specific personal

protective equipment (PPE) such as N95 masks, surgical masks, gowns, etc. Beginning the week

ending August 16th, the survey also asks a series of questions about COVID-19 testing procedures.

        A second source of data are state COVID-19 dashboards. Each state has a frequently-

updated web page that provides detailed information about the progression of the pandemic in their

state. The data provided varies across states, with some reporting information on nursing homes

and others not. Once CMS began releasing their data, some states dropped their nursing home

reports. We checked all state COVID-19 dashboards starting at noon on Monday, September 14th

and found 33 that reported data on nursing home mortality. In many cases, the states report only

nursing home deaths (e.g., AZ, MI, ME), some report these totals combined with assisted living

centers (e.g., NJ, IL, IN, VA, MN, WA), and some report these two groups separately (e.g., CA, NY,

FL, MA, PA, RI, TX). We categorize these data as nursing home deaths, regardless of whether they



                                                   7
include assisted living. In general, assisted living deaths are a minority of deaths. In two hard-hit

states, NY and PA, assisted living deaths represent only 2 and 10 percent of total fatality deaths in

congregate settings.

        COVID-19 nursing home mortality from these two sources is reported in Table 1. We

report data as of September 13th from both sources. In the top third of the table, we report data

from the 33 states that report nursing home COVID-19 mortality on their dashboard. In the first

column, we report all COVID-19 deaths as reported on state webpages, in the second, what states

are reporting on dashboards, and in the third, death counts in the CMS data. The states reporting

nursing home data on web pages report 68,180 COVID-19 nursing homes deaths, which is 39

percent of all COVID-19 deaths. The number of deaths as reported by CMS is 33 percent lower

than what states are reporting. The differences in reporting a driven primarily by a lack of reported

deaths in high-count states. In Figure 3, we plot data for the 33 states reporting in both sources,

with death counts from state web pages on the x axis and counts from CMS on the y axis. Most

states lie along the 45-degree line with the undercount in the CMS data greatest for the 6 states with

the highest counts of deaths: NY, NJ, MA, PA, FL and IL. These six states account for 72 percent

of the undercount.

        The undercount appears to be driven by differences in what nursing homes are reporting to

the two entities rather than response rates, as the response rate is rather high for the CMS data. One

explanation for this undercount in the CMS data is that at the time of the first report (May 24th),

CMS allowed nursing homes the choice to report cases and deaths from the prior week or

cumulative cases and deaths since January 1st. Thereafter, homes report weekly counts and a

cumulative count is calculated by CMS; thus, if a home fails to report the cumulative count since

January 1st on May 24th, the cumulative count that CMS calculates in future weeks is incorrect. It is

clear from the abundance of cases and deaths reported in the first week, particularly from nursing



                                                   8
homes located in areas hit hard by the virus, that most nursing homes chose to report cumulative

figures; however, some surely did not.

       To demonstrate this point, we matched nursing homes that reported to both the May 24th

and September 13th CMS surveys to nursing homes listed on the state of New York dashboard,

where May 25th and September 14th reports of COVID-19 deaths among residents are reported. We

matched 372 nursing homes which represents 93.2 percent of deaths in the New York data at the

earlier date and 94.4 percent of deaths in the CMS data for the week ending September 13th. In

Figure 4, we report a scatter plot of cumulative counts as of September 13th for nursing homes with

10 or more deaths in the New York data. We restrict the sample to these nursing homes as this

makes the data easier to see. This is 192 nursing homes. Circles of larger size represent multiple

establishments reporting the same pair of numbers. There is a pronounced undercount in the data

with 64 percent below the 45-degree line, 34 percent above the line and only 2 percent on the line.

The total deaths reported on state dashboards in this limited sample are 50 percent larger than the

CMS counts, which is consistent with the notion outlined above that many nursing homes were

reporting weekly counts for the first CMS survey.

       We address this potential source of measurement error later in our robustness analysis,

where we re-estimate our main model using cases and deaths since May 24th. The change in deaths

from these two dates appears to be more accurately reported across the two samples. In Figure 4,

we report the scatter plot of the difference in counts between September 13th and May 24th for the

match sample for New York reported in Figure 4. Here, the points are more evenly spaced around

the 45-degree line with 21 percent below, 34 percent above, and 45 percent on the line. This last

number is driven by the fact that 32 percent of these establishments report no more deaths between

May 24th and September 13th in both data sets. The average difference in “new” deaths in this

sample is 17 percent higher in the CMS data, possibly reflecting the fact that the New York



                                                    9
dashboard only reports nursing home resident deaths from COVID-19 that occur within the nursing

home and not in hospitals; the CMS data contains both.

         In the last third of Table 1, we report aggregate data for the nation. We assume that the

degree of undercount is the same in the 18 states not reporting on their state web pages as in the 27

states that are not the 6 largest death count states from Figure 3 and estimate total nursing home

deaths in the nation to be 73,949. The numbers in this row suggest that COVID-19 nursing home

deaths are between 29 and 39 percent of aggregate mortality. Given the systematic undercount of

deaths in the CMS data, we believe the actual fraction of COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes is

closer to the larger rather than the smaller number.

         The staggering consequences of the pandemic for nursing home residents can be seen when

we calculate COVID-19 death rates for nursing home residents and compare to the general

population. The death rate (per 100,000 people) for non-nursing home residents is roughly 37.

Dividing the imputed numbers by the nursing home residents alive at the beginning of the year,5 the

death rate for nursing home residents is about 5,600, or about 150 times then rate for the general

population. We calculate that the COVID-19 death rate for people 65 and over living outside of

nursing homes is 208,6 meaning this nursing home death rate is about 27 times this number.7




5 The CMS data indicates there are 1.1 million nursing home residents as of September 13th and there were about
200,000 deaths for all causes in nursing homes since the beginning of the year. Adding these two numbers together
gives us roughly 1.3 million nursing home residents at the beginning of the year.
6 Census estimates a US population of 328.2 million in 2019 including 54 million people 65 and older (US Census

Bureau, 2020). One estimate suggests 15.5 percent of the nursing home population is under 65 (Howley, 2019), leaving
1.1 million 65 and over in nursing homes and 52.9 million people aged 65 or over outside of nursing homes. The CDC
estimates that by September 19th, the deaths of the elderly outside of nursing homes totaled 110,163, leaving a death rate
for the out of nursing home population at 208.
7 The non-nursing home death rate for people 65 and over is likely overstated as the CDC reports place of death (e.g.,

hospital, at home, nursing home) so the counts for people outside nursing homes in places like hospitals, emergency
rooms and hospice facilities would include some nursing home residents as well.


                                                           10
II.B.   Heterogeneity Across Nursing Homes in COVID-19 Mortality

        There is tremendous variation across states in the severity with which the pandemic struck

nursing homes. In Figure 6, we graph deaths of nursing home residents from COVID-19 (deaths

per 100,000) by state using the CMS data as of September 13th. By using CMS data, we are

potentially under-reporting deaths by 33 percent, most notably in states with the highest death rate

but these at least give a ranking using the same sample for all states. We define the denominator as

occupied beds at that time plus the total number of deaths that have occurred up to that point in the

year. This population number is roughly the number of people in a nursing home on January 1st,

2020. The crisis is heavily concentrated in a small handful of states. In ten states, more than five

percent of the nursing home population has died, while in 3 states, more than 8 percent are dead.

The top 15 states represent 35 percent of the nursing home population but half of all COVID-19

nursing home deaths.

        The risk nursing home residents face from the disease is strongly correlated to the

underlying risk in their state. In Figure 7, we graph the non-nursing home COVID-19 death rate at

the state level versus the same value for nursing home residents. In this graph we use the CMS

estimates of nursing home deaths and define non-nursing home COVID-19 deaths as all COVID

deaths minus the nursing home numbers. The correlation coefficient between the two series is 0.78.

The outlying observation in the bottom right section of the figure represents New York, which we

showed above underreports deaths in the CMS data. If New York is removed from this analysis, the

correlation coefficient increases to 0.87.

        Despite the strong correlation between underlying risk and nursing home deaths, many

nursing homes successfully avoid high death rates, even in the hardest hit areas. In Figure 8, we

show the COVID-19 death rate distribution for nursing homes that have more than 100 beds and

are located in counties in the top 10th percentile for total COVID-19 deaths. The top panel shows



                                                  11
that by May 24th, just under 60 percent of nursing homes in these areas observe fewer that two

COVID-19 death per 100 beds. By September 13th, this figure is still in excess of 30 percent.

Moreover, a disproportionately small share of nursing homes account for the majority of COVID-

19 deaths. As of September 13th, the top 5 (1) percent of nursing homes, which is just 754 (151)

homes or 8.2 (2.3) percent of the nation’s beds, accounts for 40 (14) percent of all COVID-19

deaths in nursing homes.


II.C.    Analysis Sample

         The goal of this project is to explore whether observed nursing home characteristics can

explain low COVID-19 death rates in high-risk areas. In particular, we test whether high-quality

nursing homes, as measured by the CMS five-star ratings, did a better job of preventing deaths from

COVID-19. Our initial sample contains 15,115 nursing homes reporting data to CMS on September

13th. We lose a few observations from incomplete data. Summary statistics for these data are shown

in Table 2.8

         Several variables require explanation. Data on nursing home characteristics comes from

“Long-term Care: Facts on Care in the US”, which is provided by a research center at Brown

University.9 Sample statistics are reported for observations with non-missing data. The acuity index

ranges from zero to 23 in the data and is a measure of the amount of care needed by the average

nursing home residents (higher values suggest more care). For the three variables – share of




8 Both COVID-19 and non-COVID deaths counts are implausibly large in some homes. We make the following
corrections: First, we identify 186 counties where the sum of nursing home COVID-19 deaths reported in CMS exceeds
the CDC’s count of total COVID-19 deaths for the county. For the 16 counties where the former exceeds the latter by
more than 10 deaths, we use web sources to identify the nursing home with erroneous reporting and corrected the data
(this is almost always limited to one home in the county). For the remaining 170 counties, we reduced deaths at each
nursing home by a common factor to ensure total COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes exactly equals total COVID-19
deaths in the county. Furthermore, a total of 147 (6) nursing homes had non-COVID (COVID-19) deaths that exceed
three quarters of the total beds in the home. We re-coded deaths in these homes to equal three quarters of the total beds.

residents using Medicaid, acuity index, and for-profit status – the data contains values for all or none

of them.

         Nursing home star ratings come from data.medicare.gov. There are three separate ratings –

inspection, quality measures (QM), and staffing – which are aggregated by CMS into an overall

rating. All three ratings, as well as the overall rating, measure quality in integer “star” values, where

5-star is the best possible rating and 1-star is the worst. The inspection rating is based on results

from the home’s three most recent state health inspections in a three-year period, with more weight

given to the most recent inspections, as well as investigations stemming from formal complaints.

The QM rating is based on a home’s self-reported ability to manage and prevent certain negative

health outcomes (e.g., bedsores, ED visits, chronic pain, major injuries resulting from falls, urinary

tract infections, etc.). The staff rating is a function of the reported number of registered nurses and

total staffing hours relative to the number of residents.

         As the inspection rating is the only measure calculated from data that is not self-reported, it

is viewed as the most objective and, thus, is given greater weight in the calculation of the overall star

rating (Williams et al. 2010).10 Numerous authors have shown that the inspection rating is the most

predictive of better health outcomes and resident/family satisfaction among the four. For example,

Fuller et al. (2019) show that the overall rating is not associated with lower emergency department

visits or hospital admissions. Neuman et al. (2014) study the ratings separately and show that only

the inspection rating is statistically associated with a lower likelihood of hospital readmission and

death. Çalikoglu et al. (2011) show that family satisfaction is positively correlated with the inspection

and staff rating, but not the QM rating. Perraillon et al. (2017) suggest that the QM and staff ratings,

which are calculated from information reported by nursing homes, are easily manipulated. As a

result, although we will report results for all four measures initially, we will focus more heavily on

the inspection results.

         All case and death measures should be interpreted as cumulative, since January 1st, 2020.

Resident and staff case variables measure confirmed cases reported to CMS. Nursing homes report

both total deaths (from any cause) and COVID-19 deaths each week, which allows us to calculate

deaths not from COVID-19.11 Note that case (and death) rates are calculated as (cases/total

beds)*100. County-level COVID-19 cases and death totals comes from the same source used by the

CDC (USAFacts, 2020).

         In Table 3, we present nursing home characteristics and relevant COVID-19 summary

statistics for nursing homes with different inspection star ratings. Compared to residents at lower-

quality homes, high-quality home residents are younger and are more likely to be white and female.

The homes also have fewer beds, are less likely to be for-profit, and have a smaller share of

Medicaid residents. Regarding COVID-19, high-quality homes have lower resident case rates, but

higher staff case rates. Moreover, these homes have notably smaller COVID-19 death rates, but

higher non-COVID death rates. On average, higher-quality homes have experienced fewer staff

shortages and PPE outages than lower-quality homes since May 24th. High-quality homes also seem

to conduct more COVID-19 tests.




11Homes are to report all deaths regardless of location, e.g., in the home or in a hospital (CMS, 2020c). The module
instructions (CDC, 2020b) define a COVID-19 death as “a resident with suspected or a positive COVID-19 test result
who died in the facility or another location as a result of COVID-19 related complications.” The instructions state the
following regarding the reporting of marginal COVID-19 deaths: (i) suspected deaths are those that are being managed
for COVID-19 symptoms, but do not have a positive test, and these symptoms play a role in their death; (ii) someone
without a positive test or symptoms who dies from complications associated with COVID-19 and later has COVID-19
diagnosed in autopsy, should be coded (retrospectively) as a COVID-19 death; (iii) someone previously diagnosed or
suspected to be COVID-19 positive, who dies after recovery should not be counted as a COVID-19 death.

III.     Statistical Model and Results

         We estimate the effect of nursing home quality on the total number of nursing home deaths

due to COVID-19 using a negative binomial model. That is, we write the probability of nursing

home 𝑖 having COVID-19 deaths 𝑌𝑖 as

                                             Γ(𝑌𝑖 + 𝛾𝑖 )     𝜃 𝑌𝑖     1 𝛾𝑖
                               Pr(𝑌𝑖 ) =                  (      ) (     )                                        (1)
                                           Γ(𝑌𝑖 + 1)Γ(𝛾𝑖 ) 1 + 𝜃     1+𝜃

where Γ(⋅) is a gamma function and 𝛾𝑖 and 𝜃 are the shape and scale parameters, respectively, of a

gamma distribution. We allow 𝛾𝑖 to vary with nursing home and county characteristics, 𝑋𝑖 , such that

ln(𝛾𝑖 ) = 𝑋𝑖 𝛽. The parameters (𝜃, 𝛽) are estimated via maximum likelihood. All models include

state fixed effects and standard errors are clustered at the state level.

         We are primarily interested in the impact that nursing home quality has on COVID-19

deaths; however, we also control for the following: (logged) total number of beds; percent female,

under 65 years old, black, Hispanic, and on Medicaid; whether the homes is for profit; acuity index;12

(logged) county population; and county COVID-19 cases per 1,000 residents.13



III.A. COVID-19 Mortality Results

         As discussed above, nursing home quality is measured using 3 ratings (home inspection,

QM, and staff), as well as an aggregate (overall) rating, each of which is measured on a 1-5 scale – 5

indicating highest quality. We estimate equation (1) four times, once for each quality metric.

Parameter estimates are presented in Table 4. In the top third of the table, we report results as of

September 13th and in the middle third, we report results as of May 24th.



12Nursing home characteristics are missing for some homes; thus, we include missing variable indicators as well.
13County-level COVID-19 cases are included as a measure of the intensity of the virus locally. As death occurs on
average 18.5 days after symptom onset (Zhou et al. 2020) and the incubation period is 4-5 days on average (CDC, 2020c)
we measure cases 23 days prior to death. All models are robust to controlling for the non-nursing home death rate, as
measured on September 13th, rather than the case rate.


                                                         15
         Our results show that higher-quality nursing homes have experienced fewer deaths from

COVID-19; however, this relationship is highly dependent on the quality metric used. The QM

rating, which is determined using data that is self-reported by nursing homes, has no impact on

COVID-19 deaths at either point in time. The staff rating, which is also determined via self-reported

data, yields mixed results. Relative to 1-star homes, 2-star homes have significantly more COVID-19

deaths, while 5-star homes have significant fewer; this last result grew considerably as the pandemic

aged. The inspection rating is strongly associated with lower death counts with a high degree of

statistical precision. For example, nursing homes with a 5-star inspection rating have a COVID-19

death rate that is 24.2 percent lower than those with a 1-star inspection rating as of September 13th.

As the overall rating is an agglomeration of the three sub-categories, it is not surprising that it is

negatively associated with COVID-19 deaths, but less-so than the inspection rating.14

         We discuss above that the CMS data likely under counts the true number of COVID-19

deaths in nursing homes, as homes were given the choice on May 24th to report deaths from the

prior week or cumulative deaths since January 1st. To show that our results are not somehow driven

by this measurement error, we change the dependent variable to deaths since May 24th, which should

be measured accurately in the CMS data. These results are presented in the final third of Table 4.

Again, these results are similar to our main findings, though nearly all quality effects are notably

larger. For example, we estimate that homes with a 5-star inspection rating have had 34 percent

fewer COVID-19 deaths since May 24th than observationally similar 1-star homes. Using cumulative

deaths, this difference was 24 percent.

         Overall, estimated quality effects as of May 24th are very similar to the results for mid-

September for the overall, inspection, and QM ratings. The impact of the staff rating became much


14 Across the four specifications, we find that homes with more beds, larger black populations, and located in larger
cities with higher case rates have more COVID-19 deaths, while homes with younger populations have fewer deaths. We
also find that for-profit homes have significantly more deaths. These results are available upon request.


                                                         16
stronger over time, especially for 5-star establishments. Finally, home quality is most predictive of

COVID-19 deaths since May 24th. These results contrast with the work of Abrams et al. (2020), who

found no relationship between a nursing home’s overall star rating and the probability of any

COVID-19 case (as well as outbreak size) as measured on May 11th. The difference is at least partly

explained by the authors’ use of the overall star rating, which we find to be less predictive than the

inspection rating. Moreover, as we find home quality to be most predictive of deaths after May 24th,

it is possible that high-quality homes were simply caught off guard by the unpredicted and

unprecedented nature of the virus but adjusted with time.

         In Table 5 we show that our main findings are robust to a number of alternative empirical

specifications, including (i) using a Poisson model with clustered standard errors, as suggested by

Cameron and Trivedi (2005) (row 2); (ii) dropping the six states shown in Figure 4 to display the

most measurement error in the CMS data (i.e., NY, NJ, MA, PA, FL, IL) (row 3 and 10); and (iii)

using linear models with ln(deaths+1) or the inverse hyperbolic sine of COVID-19 deaths as the

dependent variable, both estimated with and without county fixed effects (rows 4-7).



III.B.   Mechanisms

         How did high-quality nursing homes managed to prevent COVID-19 deaths? CMS first

offered nursing homes and assisted living facilities guidelines for preventing and managing COVID-

19 cases on March 13th. Since then, these guidelines have been updated and expanded repeatedly as

the public health community has learned more about the virus. The CDC’s advice is expansive but is

linked by several common themes: First, keep COVID-19 out by limiting visitors and encouraging

staff to stay home when ill. Second, clean hands, surfaces, and equipment thoroughly and repeatedly.

Third, staff should closely monitor residents for signs of the virus, test symptomatic individuals and




                                                  17
close contacts, and isolate those who are symptomatic. Fourth, staff should use personal protective

equipment (PPE) at all times (CDC, 2020d).

          These recommendations guide our exploration of the potential mechanisms that enabled

higher-quality nursing homes to prevent COVID-19 deaths. First, we examine whether higher-

quality nursing homes were better able to prevent COVID-19 from entering the home at all. In

Table 6 we report results from linear probability models that regress an indicator of whether a home

has a single COVID-19 case among its staff (column 1) or among its residents (column 3) on the

home’s 5-star inspection rating and the same set of covariates from our earlier analysis. These results

show that higher-quality nursing homes, despite lowering the death rate, were not able to prevent

COVID-19 from entering the home.15 Second, we test whether higher-quality nursing homes were

able to prevent the spread of the virus, conditional on having at least one case. In columns 2 (4) of

Table 5, we report estimates from a linear regression of log staff (resident) cases on inspection rating

and covariates, only for homes with at least one staff (resident) case. The results show that while

high-quality nursing homes were not effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19 among their

staff, these homes were effective at preventing the virus’ spread among their residents – e.g.,

conditional on having at least one case, all else equal, 5-star homes saw roughly 23 percent fewer

cases than 1-star homes. As of September 13th, among homes with at least one case, the average

home has 20.5 cases per 100 beds, meaning this difference amounts to about 4.7 cases per 100

beds.16



15 4-star homes are statistically less likely to have a resident case than 1-star homes (p-value=0.02); however, the effect
size (0.018) is small relative to share of homes experiencing any resident cases (0.626). Moreover, the effect is not
statistically different from zero when county fixed effects are included.
16 We explored one additional mechanism – that higher-quality nursing homes provided better care conditional on

infections, leading to a lower death rate. To do so, we returned to Equation 1, but controlled (separately) for whether
any staff or residents were COVID positive, as well as the total number of staff and resident cases. If high-quality
facilities only prevent death by reducing cases, then we would expect quality to have no impact on death counts in this
model. Estimates can be found in Table 5, row 8. Conditional on cases, higher-quality facilities have fewer deaths, but
the effect sizes are modest and are only marginally significant.


                                                             18
        If high-quality nursing homes prevented deaths not by keeping COVID-19 out of the

nursing home entirely, but by preventing its spread within the home, the next obvious question is:

how? We test several plausible theories. First, both identifying and isolating residents with COVID-

19 symptoms requires a capable staff that is of an adequate size; thus, we first test whether high-

quality nursing homes have had fewer staffing shortages during the pandemic, which may explain

their ability to prevent COVID-19 cases among their residents. In Panel A of Table 7, we present

results from three linear probability models that regress indicators for self-reported staffing

shortages (nurses, aides, and clinical staff) at any point between May 24th and September 13th on 5-

star inspection rating and other controls. Row 1 shows that, all else equal, 5-star facilities were 7.8

percentage points less likely to have a nursing shortage over this time period than a 1-star facility.

The gap is 8.4 percentage points for aides (row 2) and 2.5 percentage points for clinical staff (row 3)

and both results are statistically significant. These estimates range from 13 to 19 percent of the

sample mean for the outcomes.

        Nursing homes may also prevent the spread of COVID-19 by following the CDC

recommendation that all nursing home staff use PPE and wash their hands frequently. While these

behaviors cannot be observed in our data, we are able to measure shortages in PPE (n95 masks,

surgical masks, eye protection, gowns, gloves) and hand sanitizer; thus, we test whether higher-

quality facilities were less likely to have experienced such shortages between May 24th and September

13th. We again use linear probability models and control for the same set of potential confounders.

Results are presented in Panel B of Table 7. For all five forms of PPE and hand sanitizer, we find

that the likelihood of a shortage is falling monotonically in nursing home quality. These results for

five-star homes relative to one-star homes are large relative to the sample mean, ranging from 18

percent for PPE masks, about 35 percent for surgical masks, eye protection and gown outages, and

greater than 50 percent for glove and hand sanitizer outages.



                                                   19
         Finally, we test whether higher-quality homes simply do a better job of testing residents for

the virus. In particular, the CMS data allows us to generate four measures of testing intensity and

speed. First, nursing homes report for the week ending September 13th that receiving test results

takes “less than a day”, “between one and two days”, “three-to-seven days”, or “more than seven

days.” Second, nursing homes report whether they tested any asymptomatic residents during the

week ending September 13th in response to a new positive case.17 Third, homes report whether they

have ever tested asymptomatic staff or residents when there is no knowledge of exposure. Finally,

homes report whether they have their own testing machine.

         In Panel C of Table 7, we present estimates of the effect of nursing home quality on these

testing measures. Results are mixed. Higher-quality homes receive test results faster than 1-star

homes (row 1) but these effects are not precisely estimated. Higher-quality homes are not statistically

more likely to test asymptomatic residents following a new case (row 2) but they are more likely to

test staff after a new case. Somewhat in contrast to the prior finding, higher-quality homes are

statistically more likely to have ever tested non-exposed residents but are no more likely to test non-

exposed staff. Finally, 2-4 star homes are between 1.8 and 2.3 percentage points more likely than 1-

star homes have their own testing machine, but these effects are only of marginal statistical

significance.

         Overall, higher-quality nursing homes prevent COVID-19 deaths, not by preventing the

disease from entering the home, but by preventing its spread. Moreover, the methods by which they

prevent the spread are consistent with CDC guidelines. High-quality homes have significantly fewer

staff shortages and PPE outages. We also provide some evidence that higher-quality facilities get test




17Note that nursing homes can only report such testing if a new positive case arises; thus, we condition our analysis on
facilities with a new positive case, as higher-quality facilities have already been shown to have fewer positive cases.


                                                           20
results quicker, potentially because they have their own testing machines, and are more likely to test

non-exposed asymptomatic residents, though these relationships are less precisely estimated.

       Finally, in an effort to understand exactly how much of the inverse relationship between

COVID-19 deaths and nursing home quality is explained by higher-quality nursing homes avoiding

staff and PPE shortages, we return to our baseline model, but add controls for shortages. In

particular, among the nine staff and PPE measures, we calculate for each nursing home the number

of shortages experienced between May 24th and September 13th (e.g., if a home experienced a

nursing shortage and an n95 mask shortage over this period, we would measure their total as 2). The

original results from Table 4 are presented in the first column 1 of Table 8 and the results adding the

counts of shortages as a control are reported in the second column. First, note that for each

additional shortage reported, the nursing home’s COVID-19 death rate increases by 3.3 percent.

Second, compared to the original model without these controls, the estimated quality effects are 6-

12 percent smaller, suggesting that in addition to avoiding staff and PPE shortages, high-quality

nursing homes are taking other precautions to prevent the spread of the virus. We discuss the last

two columns of Table 8 below.



III.C. Isolation and Non-Covid Deaths

       In addition to PPE use, adequate staffing, and robust testing, an early prevention method

used by virtually all nursing homes was to refuse all outside visitors. On March 13th, CMS issued

memorandum QSO-20-14-NH recommending that all facilities nationwide “should restrict visitation

of all visitors and non-essential health care personnel, except for certain compassionate care

situations, such as an end-of-life situation” (CMS 2020a). The memorandum also advised cancelling

“communal dining and all group activities, such as internal and external group activities.” On May

18th, CMS issued memorandum QSO-20-30-NH, that provided a three-phase reopening plan for



                                                  21
nursing homes (CMS, 2020d). The plan did not allow for outside visitors until a nursing home

entered phase three, which (loosely) requires (i) that COVID-19 cases in the outside community

have declined for 14 consecutive days, (ii) no new cases within the nursing home for 28 days, (iii) no

staff or PPE shortages, and (iv) homes have the capacity and supplies to test residents and staff

weekly. In light of the continued spread of the virus and the strict reopening criteria, many nursing

homes were still closed to visitors months later.

         An unfortunate downside of these guidelines is that residents have experienced extreme

isolation. In the introduction, we used data on excess deaths among the over 65 population and

among individuals with Alzheimer’s to argue that this isolation may be deadly. Thus, we now aim to

test whether high-quality nursing homes, in their efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19, also

managed the non-COVID risks created by isolation.

         In particular, we estimate equation (1) above, but with non-COVID deaths as our dependent

variable. In Table 9 (column 1 panel A), we again present results from column 2 of Panel A from

Table 4 demonstrating that the nursing home inspection rating is negatively associated with

COVID-19 deaths. In Panel B, we show that homes with a higher inspection rating experienced

significantly more non-COVID deaths. In other words, high-quality homes, who presumably did the

best job of following CDC guidelines, were successful in their efforts to prevent COVID-19 deaths,

but in doing so, saw significantly more non-COVID deaths than low-quality homes. These effects

are monotonic in nursing home quality and are large. Five-star homes saw 8.9 percent more non-

COVID deaths than one-star homes. As non-COVID deaths out-number COVID deaths three to

one, it is no surprise that in Panel C, where we use total deaths as the outcome, we show that the

impact of inspection ratings on total deaths is small and positive but statistically insignificant.18


18A full set of results is available upon request. Note, these estimates suggest that a 5-star home saw 23.3 percent fewer
COVID-19 deaths than a 1-star home. As the mean number of COVID-19 deaths in this sample is 3.96, this amounts to
0.92 COVID-19 deaths prevented. The same 5-star home saw 10.7 percent more non-COVID deaths than a 1-star


                                                           22
         In Columns 2 and 3 of Table 9, we repeat our analysis, but divide the sample by the number

of COVID-19 cases per 1,000 residents in the county where the nursing home is located. Column 2

contains results for nursing homes in counties with a COVID-19 case rate that is greater than the

sample median – i.e., high-risk counties – while column 3 has results for low-risk counties. Panel A

show that high-quality nursing homes in both sets of counties managed to lower the number of

COVID-19 deaths. Five-star homes in high-risk counties had 25.6 percent lower deaths while the

same number in low-risk counties is 16 percent. The results differ considerably when we consider

non-COVID mortality. We find no statistically significant impact of quality on non-COVID

mortality in the high-risk counties but a large positive and statistically precise impact in low-risk

counties.19 In part C of the table, we show that the total death rate is not associated with nursing

home quality in high-risk counties but aggregate mortality increases in low-risk counties by a

substantial margin. The coefficients in column 3 of Panel C are increasing monotonically and 3- to

5- star ratings are all statistically significant.

         There is some concern that our results can be explained by higher-quality nursing homes

intentionally misreporting COVID-19 deaths as non-COVID deaths in an effort to protect their

reputation. This concern is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the quality / non-COVID mortality

gradient is strongest in low-risk areas – i.e., where nursing home residents are least likely to have

died as a result of COVID-19. We further address this concern by examining the relationship

between nursing home quality and total nursing home deaths in the very lowest-risk counties;

namely, those that have yet to record a single COVID-19 death. Were quality not positively

associated with total deaths in these counties (where the likelihood of COVID-19 death is very low,



home. The mean number of non-COVID deaths is 11.09, meaning 5-star homes had 1.2 additional non-COVID deaths
on average. This explains why the parameter estimates in Panel C are positive.
19 It is possible that isolation would have also significantly increased mortality in high risk areas were it not for harvesting

– i.e., the most fragile patients, who are the most susceptible to death by loneliness, are also the most likely to die upon
contracting COVID-19.


                                                              23
meaning misreporting is of little concern), we may be concerned that our earlier findings are

impacted by misreporting.

        Our results using non-COVID deaths reported September 13th, in counties with no COVID-

19 deaths as of September 13th, are reported in Column 1 of Table 10. We find that among the 698

homes in these counties, 5-star homes have 35.4 percent fewer deaths than 1-star homes; this

difference is statistically significant. We do not find consistently positive effects for 2-4 star homes;

however, this is at least partly explained by the fact that so few counties have yet to experience a

COVID-19 death six months into the pandemic. To relax this power constraint, we repeat this

analysis for cumulative deaths as of August 16th, July 19th, and June 21st, each time limiting the

sample to nursing homes located in counties with zero COVID-19 deaths as of that date. Results

can be found in columns 2-4 of Table 10. For all three dates, 2-5 star homes consistently have more

deaths than 1 star homes and the difference between 5-star and 1-star homes is always large and

statistically significant. Moreover, in late June, where the sample size is the largest, non-COVID

deaths are increasing monotonically in nursing home quality.

        Non-COVID deaths may be measured with error for the same reason as COVID-19 deaths.

Thus, in Table 11, we show that the results from Table 9 are robust to (i) dropping the 6 states with

the most substantial measurement error, i.e., NY, NJ, PA, MA, IL, FL (column 2) and (ii) measuring

non-COVID deaths since May 24th (column 3).

        Finally, if it were the case that non-COVID deaths were truly misreported COVID-19

deaths, we would expect homes experiencing more staff and PPE shortages to also have more non-

COVID deaths. Similar to analysis above, we re-estimate our non-COVID death model, controlling

for the number of staff and PPE shortages experienced between May 24th and September 13th.

Results are presented in Column 4 of Table 8. Here, we find that shortages have no impact on non-




                                                    24
COVID deaths (a precisely estimated zero) and the impact of quality on non-COVID deaths is

unaffected by the inclusion of this variable.


IV.     Conclusion

        Over the past six months, high-quality nursing homes have successfully prevented the spread

of COVID-19 and deaths caused by COVID-19. We show that high-quality facilities are more likely

to follow several CDC recommended guidelines – namely, avoiding staff shortages, maintaining

adequate PPE, and regularly testing staff and residents – and that, even conditional on pre-pandemic

facility quality, homes following these guidelines experienced fewer COVID-19 deaths. That said, we

also provide evidence that high-quality nursing homes have witnessed significantly more non-

COVID deaths. Our hypothesis is that the latter represent deaths of loneliness – i.e., that in

following CDC guidelines, these homes exposed their residents to severe isolation in an attempt to

prevent infection, subsequently leading to premature death by other causes. Furthermore, we show

that the relationship between home quality and non-COVID deaths is driven almost entirely by

homes located in counties where the risk of infection is low.

        These results are sobering. Despite efforts by nursing staff and administrators to protect

seniors during the pandemic, the very best nursing homes have experienced no fewer total deaths

than the worst ones. In low-risk areas the picture is even more bleak, as the best homes have

witnessed the most death. This latter result suggests a need for more nuanced guidelines.

Specifically, were isolation guidelines more closely aligned with infection rates at the local level,

nursing homes facing little COVID-19 risk may avoid exposing their residents to extreme isolation.

A September 17th memo suggest that CMS has recently reached a similar conclusion. Citing resident

distress from isolation, the memo outlines new policies that allow for outdoor visitation and relaxed

policies for indoor visitation in lower-risk settings such as counties with low positivity rates in the

general population.

Standard errors allow for arbitrary correlation across observations within a state. Other controls in
the models include logged total beds; percent of residents that are female, under 65, black, Hispanic,
on Medicaid (along with corresponding indicators for missing variables); for-profit status; acuity index;
county-level COVID-19 cases per 1,000 residents (measured 23 days prior to death); logged county
population; and a full set of state fixed effects.
