             Financial Intermediation in the United States



                               ABSTRACT


       The principal rationales that give rise to financial intermediation
are benefits of size and specialization, the diversification of specific
asset risks, and the pooling of even broader classes of risk. Each is a
significant factor in accounting for the U.S. economy's reliance on intermediation.
In addition, since World War II a further important factor has been the
economy's continual shift away from government debt toward the debt of
private nonfinancial entities including individuals and businesses. Nonfinancial
investors (primarily individuals) have exhibited a strong preference for
holding the debt of these nonfinancial borrowers via financial intermediaries
rather than directly.
       As the U.S. economy's reliance on financial intermediaries overall has
increased during the post—war period, some specific kinds of intermediary
institutions have grown more rapidly than others. Commercial banks have about
held their  own in relative terms, while steadily shifting their basic
business back toward lending activities and away from securities investments.
NDnbank deposit intermediaries have grown in relation to overall economic
and financial activity, as the growth of savings and loan associations has
more than offset the (relative) decline of mutual savings banks. Among
private nondeposit intermediaries, life insurance companies have declined
in relative terms while both public and private sector pension funds have
shown exceptionally rapid growth. Finally, the federal government's participation
in the financial intermediation process in the United States has also
increased rapidly during these years, in part as a result of the pressures
created bj the economy's shift to private instead of government debt.

                 FINANCIAI INTERMEDIATION IN THE UNITED STATES*

         The intermediating function provided by specialized institutions

has always been a hallmark of well developed financial markets. In the

modern economy almost everyone participates in the financial markets, and

few economic events take place without their financial counterpart. The

basic role of the financial markets is to enable millions of businesses

and individuals to carry out, more easily and more     efficiently, the inter-
actions that their activities in the nonfinancial economy entail. Although

in   principle businesses and   individuals could carry   out their financial
dealings   directly, without the advantages of intermediary services,

in most cases doing so would be inconsistent with the underlying reason

for having and using financial markets in the first place. Intermediation

renders financial transactions more efficient, and therefore increases

the use that both businesses and individuals make of financial markets.

In addition, in some instances financial intermediaries enable market

participants to achieve objectives that would be unattainable in their

absence.

         This important role played by financial intermediation is typically

not   static. Throughout their history financial markets have undergone
a shift — away from direct transactions between nonfinancial borrowers and
lenders,   toward the intervention of financial intermediaries. In     the

United States the development of the commercial banking system and of the
life insurance industry in earlier years, and more recently the great
expansion of nonbank deposit institutions and both private and public
                                       —2—




sector pension funds, have been important features of the development of
the U.S. financial system. In addition, the roles played even by specific
intermediary institutions change over time. The shifting requirements

of the nonfinancial economy, the evolution of new communications and

information processing technologies, changes in government regulations,

and even independent financial innovations, all play a part in this dynamic

process.

       The goal of this chapter is to examine the structure of financial

intermediation in the United States, both as it exists today and as it has

evolved in the years since World War 11.1 The primary focus is on the

role played by intermediation in general, and by specific kinds of inter-

mediaries in particular, in fulfilling the financial markets' basic purpose

of serving the needs of the nonfinancial economy.

       Section 1 notes explicitly several of the main rationales underlying

the use of financial intermediation. Section 2 relates these considerations

to the observed portfolio behavior of participants in the U.S. financial

markets other than financial intermediaries, including especially the

household sector. Section 3 quantifies the role of financial intermediaries,

at the aggregate level, in the United States. Section 4 details the

respective roles of several specific kinds of intermediaries, including

commercial   banks, nonbank deposit institutions, life insurance companies
and pension funds, and federally sponsored intermediaries. Section 5

briefly summarizes the chapter's principal points.
                                           —3—




1. Rationales for Financial Intermediation

          Three basic rationales typically motivate the reliance on financial

intermediaries in the modern economy: benefits of size and specialization,

when there are economies of scale in gathering information or in processing

transactions; diversification of specific asset risks, when asset holders

are risk averse; and pooling of liquidity or other risks, when asset

holders   themselves face uncertain contingencies.
          1.1. Benefits of Size and     Specialization.   Many economic activities
exhibit   economies of scale, at least up to a point1 and what      takes place
in   the financial markets is no exception. At the simplest level, the data

processing equipment needed to process many financial transactions efficiently

is expensive. Acquiring it to meet the sole needs of any financial market

participants but a few of the largest businesses would be out of the

question. The obvious solution is sharing effected by reliance on specialized

institutions.

        i   analogous   argument applies to the human capital represented by
the specific knowledge required either to operate sophisticated equipment
or to perform the purely human aspects of financial transactions. The kinds
of human capital involved in the services provided by financial intermediaries
go well beyond mere transactions processing, however. The existence of
assets bearing uncertain returns, due to either market or specific risk,

creates a need for information-related activities; Holders of such assets

must first discover the attendant risks, and then monitor them on an ongoing

basis. These information costs are especially large in the case of

negotiated   loans   like   home mortgages, consumer credit, and   bank   loans
to   businesses, although some kinds of securities investments have similar

characteristics. Once again, the obvious solution is for most asset holders
                                       —4—




to delegate   these information gathering and monitoring costs to specialized

third parties.

         In some cases economies of scale are sufficiently great that assets

simply become indivisible beyond set limits.     Many kinds of investments

available in today's financial markets have minimum transaction sizes.

Real estate assets are a common example, as are participations in newly

created business enterprises. In principle, of course, an investor could

directly obtain a smaller unit size at some price, but in practice no one

does so. In such cases the more straightforward, and economically more

sensible, approach to such indivisibilities is to hold the relevant assets

through intermediaries.

         1.2. Diversification of Specific Asset Risks. Investors who are

risk averse care not just about the most likely return associated with their

asset holdings but also about the uncertainty associated with that return.

For a given level of uncertainty, of course, investors presumably prefer

a higher expected return to a lower one. Conversely, for a given expected

return, risk averse investors prefer less uncertainty to more.

         When different assets bear specific risks that are not perfectly

correlated — as is the case, for example, among equity investments in

different companies — investors can reduce the level of uncertainty

associated with the return to their overall portfolios by holding a diverse

mix of assets rather than only one. By doing   so   they can take advantage

of the   imperfect correlation among the individual asset returns, in effect
exploiting the "law of large numbers" as some assets end up delivering
higher than expected returns and others lower, to achieve a total portfolio
return more likely to fall within any stated range above or below the
associated expected return.
                                     —5—




       Such diversification is, in essence, the motivation behind mutual

funds. A risk averse investor is better off, in the sense of facing less

uncertainty for a given expected return, holding a diversified portfolio

of equities rather than just one stock. The same argument holds for

mortgages, consumer and business loans, and a wide variety of other assets.

Pther than betting on whether any single borrower will default, a risk averse

investor is in each case better off holding a portfolio of many such loans.

       Because of indivisibilities and economies of scale in asset holding,

however, this kind of diversification is not feasible for most individuals

or for most nonfinancial businesses acting on their own. Few investors

have sufficient capital even to acquire well diversified equity portfolios

consisting of round lots of each security. Fewer still have sufficient

capital to acquire and service portfolios of mortgages or other loans.

The obvious solution is to achieve the required diversification through

intermediation. Financial intermediaries in effect transform assets,

therefore, holding assets subject to specific risk while issuing against

them claims in which these specific risks are largely diversified away.

       1.3 Risk Pooling. Risks associated with their portfolios of

financial assets are hardly the only kind of risks that individuals and

businesses face in today's environment. At the individual level, people

can lose their jobs, suffer expensive illnesses, have automobile accidents,

or see their houses burned or burgled. Businesses face many of the same

contingencies, as well as more directly business—connected risks like weak

market demand, delivery failures, or lawsuits.

       The pooling of such risks via explicit insurance arrangements is

a long-standing practice, and both life and casualty insurance have been

familiar examples of financial intermediation for centuries. By insuring
                                       —6—




against a specific contingency, an individual or business in effect accepts

a cost equal to the average incidence of that contingency within the

insured population. Although it is possible to imagine such insurance

taking place in abstraction from any financial intermediation per se, in

practice almost all insurance arrangements guarantee performance through

the holding of financial reserves. Moreover, certain forms of life

insurance have traditionally combined saving and risk pooling features.

       Risk spreading via financial intermediation goes well beyond

insurance arrangements, however. Banks and other deposit intermediaries

in effect pool the liquidity needs of many individual and business depositors.

Just as risk pooling makes sense in an insurance context because it is

highly improbable that all houses will burn or all automobiles will crash

in any year, deposit intermediation is advantageous because not all

depositors are likely to want to withdraw their funds on the same day,

or even in the same week or month. Deposit intermediaries in effect

exploit the imperfect correlation among depositors' uncertain liquidity

requirements to achieve yet.a further kind of asset transformation, holding

portfolios that may consist mostly of highly illiquid assets while issuing

against them claims which each depositor can rightly regard as fully

liquid. Even some nondeposit intermediaries, like open—ended mutual funds,

perform an analogous transformation.

       Because of these three basic economic effects achieved by the

intermediation process —exploitation of economies of scale, diversification

of specific asset risks, and risk pooling — the development of intermediation

in general and of specific intermediary institutions has typically paralleled,

and has often spurred, the evolution of modern financial markets.

2. The Portfolio Behavior    of   Nonfinancial Investors
       The function of the financial markets in any economy is to provide
for the needs of participants in the nonfinancial economy. On one side,
individuals and businesses come to these markets to find financial resources,
seeking   to issue claims of various forms in exchange for those resources.

At the same time, others come with resources to deploy, seeking to acquire

in exchange for them some kind of claim on resources in the future. The

unwillingness of some individuals and businesses to hold directly the

claims that others issue creates the need for intermediation.

       2.1. Households. In the United States individuals are        the   principal

nonfinancial holders of assets that represent direct claims on other

nonfinancial participants in the economy. Figure 1 shows that U.S.

households have shifted the composition of their financial asset portfolios

in important ways during the post-war period.2 Households' aggregate

holdings of deposit—type liabilities of financial intermediaries have

grown continually from the early l950s to the early l980s, not only

absolutely but in relation to overall nonfinancial economic activity (and

personal income). Households' claims on insurance and pension reserves

have also grown on balance during the post—war years, although here the

growth has been less steady because of the effect of equity price changes

on the valuation of these reserves. By contrast, households' direct

holdings of nonintermediated debt have declined in relative terms almost

continually since World War II, and their direct holdings of equity claims

on business corporations have varied mostly with equity price fluctuations,

exhibiting little overall relative trend.3 Since the total size of

households' financial asset portfolios in relation to gross national product

has also shown no overall trend —      first declining   during the immediate

post-war    years, then rising sharply in the 1950s, remaining steady through

the 1960s, declining in the l970s, and then rising again in the early

1980s — these patterns of growth and decline in comparison to gross

national product also correspond, for the post—war period as a whole, to

growth or decline in shares of households.' aggregate portfolio.

         Households' increasing preference for claims on intermediaries

has appeared even more pronounced from the perspective of their accumulation

of financial assets. Table 1 provides an indication of U.S. households'

portfolio preferences during the post World War II period by presenting

data, both in dollars and as percentage shares of households' total net

acquisition of financial assets, showing the average volume of net

acquisition of various specific asset categories. In order to abstract

from year—to—year variations, yet still capture significant changes over

time, the table presents these data in the form of averages for successive

five-year periods (and the three-year average for 1981-83)..

        The two features of households' investment behavior that stand

out most sharply here are the dominance of deposits and of life insurance
and   pension   reserves throughout the post—war period, and the change that took
place at the end of the 1950s     in households' net investment in corporate

equities.    Except for the first   few post—war years, U.S.   households have
consistently    invested nearly two-fifths or more of their financial saving in

deposits and currency. In more recent years, except for the late l960s,

the fraction going into monetary instruments has been well in excess of

one-half. The devotion of approximately one-third of financial saving

to   life insurance and   pension forms has been a steady feature of household

behavior    ever since World War II.

than   they   sold in every year during 1946-57, so that the tripling in value

of their direct equity holdings over this period represented the combined

result of capital gains and      positive   net purchases, in every   year   since

1958 they have sold more direct equity shares than they have purchased.

Capital   gains   have therefore accounted for more than all of the increase

in total value of their direct equity holdings during this period. Moreover,

allowing for the shift from direct ownership of equities to indirect

ownership via mutual funds does not alter this picture of individuals'

investment behavior. Households in the aggregate were net purchasers of

mutual fund shares during the rise of that industry in the l960s, and have

been again during 1980-83, but in neither period were mutual fund purchases

sufficient to offset the liquidation of their direct equity holdings.

During the 1970s households were net sellers of both direct equity

holdings and mutual fund shares. Hence the conclusion stands that equity

price movements have accounted for more than all of any increase in the

value of individuals' equity holdings for the past quarter century.

Because equity prices have fluctuated widely but shown little net gain

since the mid 1960s, even in nominal terms, the aggregate equity portfolio

of individuals in the United States has shown no trend movement in nominal

value and has declined in relative value during the last decade and more.

        This shift of individuals' investment flows away from equities

during the second half of the post—war period probably reflects several

considerations in addition to the economies-of—scale and diversification

motives noted above    as   general advantages of intermediation. No doubt

changing birth rates, age distributions, and income levels have all played

some role. The increasing government provision of health, education and

income security benefits has also altered the objectives associated with
                                    —10—




saving for many people. The growing importance of workers' claims on

future pension benefits, including job-specific pensions in both the

private and public sectors and also Social Security, has especially

changed many people's need to accumulate assets directly to finance their

retirement.4 Perceptions of the relative returns and risks associated

with different assets, including both debt and equity securities, have

also changed markedly during the post-war period. After the official

unpegging of bond prices in 1951, fixed—income securities became subject

to market risk in addition to inflation risk, and since the l970s both

inflation risk and market risk have increased dramatically. During most

of the l950s and 1960s renewed confidence in economic stability and

prosperity lessened fears of any collapse of equity values comparable to

that of 1929-33, and in addition many people regarded equities as a "hedge"

against price inflation.5 Following the rapid acceleration of inflation

and the poor performance of both equity prices and the U.S. economy during

the 1970s, however, prevailing opinion became progressively more skeptical

both of the economy's long—run growth prospects and of the usefulness of

equities as an inflation hedge.6

       Apart from equities, holdings of direct claims against other

nonfinancial participants in the economy has always constituted a relatively

small fraction of U.S. households' aggregate portfolios. As Table 1 shows,

net acquisitions of such debt have accounted for less than one—fourth of

households' financial saving throughout the post-war period. Against this

background of households' aversion to holding direct claims in either debt or

equity form, the need for financial intermediation is readily apparent.

       2.2. Other Nonfinancial Investors. Although individuals are the

dominant nonfinancial holders of direct claims on other nonfinancial
                                         —11—




participants in the U.S.    economy,   businesses also advance a substantial

amount   of   direct credit, both to individuals in the form of installment

and   other consumer credit, and to each    other in the form of trade credit

and   commercial paper. Even with the ready availability     of business credit

cards    and charge accounts, however, commercial banks and finance companies
have increasingly dominated the consumer credit field. The share of
outstanding    consumer credit owed to nonfinancial businesses (including

corporations    and others) has fallen   from just over one—third in the early

1950s   to just under one-sixth   since the 1970s. In addition, business

lending   via purchases of nonfinancial commercial paper has remained
relatively small, so that    trade credit —typically equal to 15-18%     of the
gross national product, and mostly borrowed and lent within the corporate
sector — remains the primary vehicle for businesses' holdings of direct
claims   on nonfinancial obligors.
         Foreign investors have held a small but growing share of direct
claims on nonfinancial participants in the U.S. economy throughout the
post-war period.7 The growth of foreign holdings was especially rapid
during the l970s, as the persistent U.S. balance of payments deficit
transferred assets abroad, especially to member countries of the international
oil cartel. This rapid growth     proceded from a small base, however, so      that
foreign holdings still represented less than 5% of all direct claims
against U.S. nonfinancial obligors as of yearend 1983. Nevertheless, the
concentration of foreign (especially foreign official)investments.-in
specific instruments has made foreign holdings of somewhat greater
importance    in several U.S. markets. The yearend 1983    share of federal

government    securities held abroad, for example, was approximately one—tenth.
         In sum, neither individuals nor other nonfinancial entities
                                        —12—




participating in the U.S. financial markets, including businesses and

foreign   investors, have shown much willingness to hold direct claims

on U.S. individuals and   businesses.    Instead, they have largely left that

task to financial intermediaries.
                                          —13—




3.    The    Dominance of Financial Intermediation
            Figures 2   and 3 indicate the extent to which the increasing

preference      for claims on financial intermediaries by individuals (and, to
a lesser extent, by other nonfinancial investors)       has shifted to

intermediaries      the task of meeting the needs that nonfinancial participants
in   the economy have brought to the U.S. financial markets. As of 1983

individuals in the aggregate remained the largest single class of holders

of all direct claims on nonfinancial borrowers and share issuers — but

only by virture of their continuing domination of the ownership of

corporate equities, as the contrast between Figures 2 and 3 shows. On an

overall basis, however, the household share either including or excluding

equities has declined, as has the share held by all other nonfinancial

investors. As the share of direct claims on nonfinancial entities held

by all nonfinancial investors has declined, the share held by financial

intermediaries has correspondingly risen. Intermediaries' holdings first

accounted     for the majority of all direct claims outstanding in the U.S.
financial     markets (including equities) in 1969, and they have remained

the majority ever since.

        Table 2 presents flow data indicating the even stronger post-war

dominance     of intermediaries in meeting the new funds required each year by
nonfinancial participants in the U.S. economy. The table shows data both in
dollars and as percentage shares of all net funds extended to all nonfinancial
sectors.      As in Table 1, the data are in the form of five—year averages

(and the three-year aveae. for l98l-83)          lso as in Table 1 these data

exclude equity capital gains, which constituted most of the increase in

households' equity holdings. until the late l960s, and      more than   all of the

increase since then.

        Apart from accumulating    capital   gains on equities, individuals

and   other   private domestic nonfinancial investors have played only a

small and (except for the early 1980s) shrinking role in meeting directly

the needs that nonfinancial entities have brought to the U.S. financial

markets.8 Similarly, the role of the federal government has been consistently

small in this context, and that of foreign investors has grown but remains

small nonetheless. In part because of the growing fraction of nonfinancial

sectors' needs that have come in the form of debt issued by private borrowers

rather than government borrowers (at least until the l980s) , as well as

for other reasons related to financial innovation, nonfinancial investors

have instead accumulated claims on intermediaries and have left to them

the task of directly allocating the economy's financial resources. As

Table 2 also shows, banks, savings institutions and nondeposit intermediaries

have all been significant participants in this process.

4. The Role of Specific Intermediaries

          The advance of intermediation in the U.S. financial markets since

World    War II has hardly been uniform. The specialization of financial
intermediaries has inevitably led to some playing more important roles
than others, and some experiencing more rapid growth than others, as the
needs and objectives of both borrowers and lenders have          changed, and   as
government      interventions have (intentionally or otherwise) favored first

one    kind   of institution and then another.

          4.1. Commercial Banks. The         commercial banking system has long
stood   at the center of attention devoted to financial markets. Even today,
                                                                                         10
despite several decades of increasing importance of nonbank intermediaries

many kinds of discussions ranging from textbook descriptions of the economy

to professional evaluations of monetary policy often proceed as if commercial

banks were the only intermediaries in the U.S. financial markets. This
emphasis on the commercial banking system is understandable in part, in
view of the special role that banks play in the          monetary policy process

by virtue of their relationship to the Federal Reserve System. In addition,

in the past commercial banks were more dominant in financial market activity

than   they are today.         Earlier in this century banks' assets and   liabilities
dwarfed   those of other intermediaries, and before passage        of the Glass-

Steagall      Act in 1933     commercial banks also dominated the securities

business .       Until   as   recently as the early l970s, commercial banks in
the   United States enjoyed a monopoly on the right to issue checkable

deposits.

          Since World War II the U.S. commercial banking system has
approximately held its own in relation to the scale of nonfinancial economic
activity, but it has not participated in the economy's overall post-war
                                      —16—




expansion   of intermediation. The approximate stability of the banking
system's relative size is apparent in Figure 3, and also in the more
detailed data on commercial banks' assets and liabilities in relation to
gross national product presented in the upper half of Table 3. The total
size of the banking system in relation to gross national product has shown
essentially no trend during the post-war period. As Figure 4 shows,
there has been little post-war trend in the "income veolcity" of bank
credit,   which consists of most commercial bank earning assets. This

relative stability stands in marked contrast to the pre-war years when,

over   nearly a century, the size of the banking system continually grew
in   relation to gross national product.12

        Within the stability of the overall totals, however, the post-war

years have also seen substantial shifts in composition on both sides of

the banking system's balance sheet, as is clear from the percentage share

data presented in the lower half of Table 3. among bank assets, the most

significant development during this period has been the post-war (really

post—depression) recovery of bank loan portfolios, and hence the general

resumption of banks' traditional role as "inside" intermediaries. In

1929 loans constituted 73% of bank credit. During the depression and then

the war years, however, the fall—off in private debt issuing activity

meant that, for all practical purposes, there was little or no loan business

to be had. By contrast, the federal government was then issuing debt in

record volume, and banks   participated in financing it.   By 1935 banks'

securities investments exceeded their loan portfolios, and in 1945 investments

constituted 79% of bank credit. Commercial banks simply were no longer

very commercial. The years since 1946 have largely consisted of a reversal

of the 1930—45 pattern, with bank loans exceeding securities investments

in 1957 for the first time      in   more than two decades, and standing again

at 73% of total bank credit as of yearend l983

          In rebuilding their loan portfolios and de-emphasizing their invest-

nnts, banks have both altered the mix of their lending business and changed

the character of their securities holdings. Although banks remain a

principal source of business credit, and commercial and industrial loans

are   still the largest single category of bank lending, these loans no

longer dominate bank loan portfolios as they once did. Instead,          mortgage
credit    and other consumer loans now comprise more th.an one-third of the total.
Especially during the second half of the post-war period, the widespread
use   of bank-issued credit cards has been a major factor in banks' development

of their consumer lending business. Moreover, among business loans per

Se, the larger banks have increasingly become a major element in the

intermediate-term credit market through the use of explicitly longer

maturity loans (in son cases up to        ten years) and revolving credits of
an implicitly ongoing nature. Total bank          investments have grown slowly

since    World War II, but because of tax    incentives   banks have so concentrated
their    investments on state and local government issues that, for a few

years in the early l970s, they held more of these securities than of
                           13
federal government debt.

         Among bank liabilities, the two most significant changes that have

occurred during   the post—war period have been the continual decline of
demand balances and increase of time and saving        deposits, relative to
either   total bank liabilities or gross national product, and the "liability

management revolution" that has greatly increased the larger banks'

reliance on "bought funds." As Figure 4 shows, the income velocity of the

narrow Ml money stock, consisting of currency plus checkable deposits,
                                        —18—




has about tripled over the post—war years as a result of a combination of

influences including economies of scale in the public's holding of cash

balances, the secular rise in nominal interest rates, and the increasingly

widespread use of credit cards and charge accounts.14 This persistent trend

increase in Ml velocity stands in sharp contrast to either the absence of

any trend during 1910-30 or the steeply declining trend during 1930-45.

Onlythe strong growth of time and savings deposits, including the new

negotiable certificates of deposit that first came into existence in 1961,

has accounted for the absence of much post-war trend in the income velocity

of the broader M2 and M3. "Total net credit," consisting of the outstanding

debt of all U.S. obligors other than financial intermediaries, has also

shown no velocity trend.

         Large banks' growing use of such liabilities as certificates of

deposit, federal funds, Eurodollar borrowings, commercial paper issues,

repurchase   agreements and so on — instruments that in son cases represent
the development of new financial markets since World War II — has not
only changed banks' balance sheets but also facilitated a major change in
the feasible aggressiveness    of bank lending practices. The enormous post—war

expansion   of bank loan portfolios, which banks have achieved in part through
the   competitive   use of such devices as loan commitxents and medium—term
credits, would probably have been impossible if banks had simply continued
to follow the classic practice of treating their deposits (and other
liabilities) as determined by outside forces.

         Finally, it is useful to point out explicitly that because of changes

in commercial bank organization, especially during the 1960s, the representa-

tion of banks as having merely held their own during the post—war increase

in the U.S. economy's reliance on financial intermediation relative to
                                      —19—




economic activity risks understating by a wide margin the growing overall

presence   of commercial banks in the financial system. After falling by
more than one-half between 1920 and 1935, the number of american commercial
banks has remained roughly steady   at about 14,000. The number of bank

branches, however, has risen from some 4,000 to over 39,000 during the

post—war years, with most of this growth occurring since 1960. Moreover,

especially since the 1970 Imendments to the Bank Holding Company Act and

the 1980 Depository Institution Deregulation and Monetary Control Act,

banks have increasingly entered activities other than their traditional

loan and deposit business. Most recently, these extensions of activity

have included indirect participation in the securities brokerage business.

Although their direct participation in financial intermediation has not

kept pace with the rising post-war trend, commercial banks have increasingly

enhanced their importance as more nearly full-service financial institutions.

       4.2. Nonbank Deposit Institutions. As       is clear from Figure 3, one
group of intermediaries that has accounted for much of the post World War II
increase in U.S. financial intermediation has been the nonbank deposit
institutions   including savings and loan   associations, mutual savings banks,
and credit unions. The public's strong demand for consumer—type time and
savings deposits has enabled these institutions to grow rapidly, not just

absolutely but in relation to economic activity, during most of the post—war

period. Their growth has been great enough to offset the relative stagnation

of the commercial banking system, so that the income velocities of the

M2 and M3 money stocks have shown a modest downward trend. When extrapolated

backward, this trend appears to have been a continuation of the downward

trend associated with corresponding aggregates during the pre—war era

when nonbank deposit institutions were not of major impottance.
                                              —20—




         Table 4   presents data for the individual deposit (or share) volume

and combined    asset holdings of the three major groups of nonbank deposit

institutions, first in relation to gross national product and               then   as a

share of the total assets of the three groups of institutions together.

The   post-war expansion of the savings and loan industry stands out clearly
here. Between the early post—war years and the l970s outstanding savings
and loan shares more than quadrupled as a percentage of gross national
product.     By 1983   the amount of these shares was well over twice the amount
of   mutual savings bank deposits and credit union           shares   combined, and was

almost equal to the amount         of   consumer-type time and   savings   deposits held

at commercial banks. In comparison with mutual savings banks,                the primary
factor   underlying the more rapid growth of savings and loan associations

has probably been mere geography; mutual savings banks             are   overwhelmingly

concentrated in a few states, especially New York and             Massachusetts, which
have   experienced slower than average economic growth since World War II.

In comparison with commercial banks, the primary factor at work has probably

been   the   effect of government regulation, in that savings and           loan   associations

did not face deposit interest rate ceilings until 1965 and enjoyed a one—

fourth percent differential over commercial banks for many years thereafter.

The growth of credit unions has been even faster than that of savings and

loan associations, but credit unions constitute another example of rapid

growth   from a small base, and they remain by         far the smallest of the three

groups of institutions. Mutual savings banks            are alone among the three groups

in   having failed to do more than grow in pace with economic activity.
Although mutual savings banks were twice as large as savings and loan
associations at the end of World War           II, savings   and loans were equal in
size in 1954    and    larger by   a factor of four by 1983.

         The history of nonbank deposit institutions in the United States

since World War II has been in large part a story of evolving financial

regulation, including restrictions on these intermediaries' liability issuing

as well as their asset holding. Especially because these institutions

operate under legal and regulatory constraints governing the disposition

of their asset portfolios (although some of these constraints were weakened

by the 1980 Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act),

their aggregate contribution to meeting the financial needs of nonfinancial

participants in the economy has followed a fairly predictable pattern.

Savings and loan associations and mutual savings banks both typically

invest the majority of their assets, in mortgages, so that these two

groups together have become the nation's leading provider of mortgage lending.

This dominance has lessened somewhat in recent years, however, especia1ly

with the increasing prominence of the federally sponsored mortgage pools.

   of yearend 1983 savings and loan associations and mutual savings banks

together held more than one-third of all outstanding mortgages, down from

nearly one—half only a few years earlier.      (By comparison, commercial

banks held less than one—fifth of all outstanding mortgages as of 1983.)

Credit unions have instead traditionally invested most of their assets

in consumer installment loans, and as of 1983 they accounted for just over

one—tenth of the outstanding consumer credit.

        4.3. Private Nondeposit Intermediaries. As is also apparent from

Figure 3, a significant part of the post World War II increase in the

U.S. economy's reliance on financial intermediation has stemmed from

neither commercial banks nor nonbank deposit institutions but, instead,

from intermediaries that issue only nondeposit claims. There are many

forms   of   such intermediaries operating in the U.S. markets, but among the
                                          —22—




most    familiar and important are life and casualty insurance companies,

private and public sector pension funds,         independent   consumer finance

companies and the "captive" finance companies of nonfinancial businesses,

equity and money market mutual funds, real estate investment trusts, and

securities brokers and dealers.

         Table   5 presents   data, analogous to that shown above for the nonbank
deposit institutions, for three specific categories of U.S. nondeposit
intermediaries :15     life   insurance companies,   private   pension funds, and
state   and local government pension funds. The reason, for focusing in
particular   on these three kinds of institutions is not only that they

are the largest of the nondeposit intermediaries but also that their

respective post—war experience reflects interesting contrasts. Because

the low interest rates implicitly paid on the savings component of ordinary

life insurance have increasingly pronipted the use of group and other term

insurance policies, life insurance companies' total assets held and

liabilities outstanding grew little relative to gross national product

during the first half of the post-war period, and since then they have mostly

been declining in relative terms. Moreover, the relative decline in these

companies' life insurance business has been even more pronounced, in that

their growth in recent years has consisted disproportionately of pension

monies which they manage for other businesses. As of yearend 1983 pension

reserves constituted more than two—fifths of U.S. life insurance companies'

total liabilities, up from less than one-tenth in the early post-war years.

         By contrast, both private and public sector pensions have experienced

extraordinarily rapid growth throughout these years.16 Tax incentives

at both the individual and corporate levels, business personnel policies

aimed at reducing worker turn—over, features of the collective bargaining

process, and   other   corporate financial objectives have all combined to

favor the mushrooming of private pension liabilities since World War II.

During most of this period, however, businesses had (and many used) broad

latitude to incur pension liabilities without funding them. The 1974

Employee Retirement Income Security Act subsequently specified minimum

standards for the vesting of workers' rights to accumulated pension

benefits and   for   employers' funding   of   vested pension liabilities. Even

so, businesses retain important flexibility in choosing the actuarial

assumptions underlying the calculation of future benefits, the minimum

required amortization of unfunded vested benefits is very slow, and

nonvested benefits require no funding at all. Consequently, many businesses

continue to carry substantial amounts of unfunded liabilities, so that

private pension funds' total assets as shown in Table 5 substantially

understate their liabilities.17 This understatement was especially

great during the l970s when many private pension funds' asset portfolios,

nre than half of which in the aggregate is invested in equities, suffered

an erosion in market value.

       State and     local   government pensions, including both teachers' and

other employees' funds, have experienced similar post—war growth. Public

sector workers have the same tax incentive to use the pension mechanism

to spread income beyond retirement as do private sector workers. Although

public sector employers do not have the same tax incentives as do private

businesses, in many cases the political process has favored the use of

pension compensation over current compensation, especially when there is

no pressure to raise tax or other revenues immediately to fund the

accumulating pension liabilities. Hence public sector pension funds have

been and remain substantially underfunded, so that the asset data shown
                                      —24—




in Table 5 greatly understate their liabilities also.l8 The continued
growth of public sector pensions' assets during the l970s, in contrast
to private pensions, reflects merely the smaller share of assets invested
in   equities by public sector funds' portfolios (about one-third in the

aggregate) rather than any difference in funding practices.

         The asset mix of these insurance and pension intermediaries, and

hence their role in financing economic activity, has undergone

important changes since World War II. Regulatory changes in the 1960s

allowed many life insurance companies to increase the equity portion of

their portfolios, and since the mid 1960s life insurers have largely

withdrawn from direct home mortgage lending. State and local      government
pension funds and   especially private pension funds have even more

dramatically increased the equity share of their investments, Consequently,

these nondeposit intermediaries have increasingly become a major source

of both debt and equity funds for corporate businesses. As a result of

these portfolio changes, together with the rapid growth   of   pensions and

the (relative) stagnation of the commercial banking system, insurance

companies and pension funds couined have increasingly dominated banks

as holders of claims on the U.S. corporate business sector —      despite
banks' post—war emphasis on loans over investments in governnnt securities.

In the early post—war years these nondeposit intermediaries held only

slightly more claims on the corporate sector than did commercial banks,

but by the 1970s they held more than twice as much.

         It is also important to distinguish the claims on business held

by banks, which are overwhelmingly in the form of short- to medium-term

loans, from the corresponding claims held by insurance companies and

pension funds, which consist mostly of long-term debt and equity securities.
                                     —25—




These non-deposit intermediaries have traditionally held more than two-thirds

of all outstanding corporate bonds, and in recent years, they have also

come to hold about one-sixth of all corporate equity. On a flow basis,

these investors have been of even greater importance in providing long—

term debt and equity capital to U.S. business corporations. In addition

to accounting for much or all of the corporate sector's net long-term

bond financing throughout the post-war period, since 1960 they have also

accounted for more than all of its equity financing, absorbing also the

equity holdings liquidated by the household sector. In sum, businesses'

equity and bond financing has become increasingly dominated by these

nondeposit intermediaries. Given their high rates of portfolio turn-over,

especially in comparison with individuals, equity and bond trading has

become even more so.

       4.4. Government Sponsored Intermediaries. another important change

that has come about in the U.S. financial markets since World War II

has been the great increase in the federal government's activities as an

intermediary for (and also a guarantor of) private credit. "Off-budget"

sponsored credit agencies like the Federal Home Loan Bank System and the

Federal Intermediate Credit Bank were in operation before World War II,

but the scale of their lending operations was small then. 2s of 1946, all of

these agencies combined held only about $2 billion of assets, the majority

of which consisted of agricultural loans, and they owed only $2 billion

of liabilities. The focus of these agencies' activity turned more toward

support for homebuilding after the Federal National Mortgage Association

began its lending operations in 1955, but as late as 1960, when their

combined assets had reached $11 billion, their total agricultural credit

outstanding   still exceeded their total housing credit. Only since the
                                          —26—




1960s, as the interaction of deposit interest rate ceilings with rising

nominal interest rates led to the introduction of large—scale support for

housing, did government financial intermediation begin        to   increase rapidly.

         Table 6 presents data,     comparable to that shown above for other

groups   of intermediaries, for     the assets of the federally sponsored credit

agencies   and the even more recent mortgage "poois" like the Government
National Mortgage association and the Federal Home Loan Corporation.
Government sponsored intermediation has grown rapidly, not just absolutely
but in relation to gross national product, and by 1983 these intermediaries

held more than one-fifth of all outstanding home mortgages and more than

two—fifths of all outstanding farm debt. Moreover, the total housing credit

advanced   by these intermediaries, which have grown especially rapidly since
the onset of periodic diintermediation in the mid 1960s, includes not only
direct   purchases of mortgages but also Federal Home Loan Bank advances

to savings and loan associations, so that the effective amount is even

greater. Federally sponsored intermediaries accounted for 45%, 48%,

52% and 100% of the total net extensions of single-family home mortgage

credit in the high-disintermediation years 1969, 1970, 1974 and 1982,
                 19
respectively.

         Federally     sponsored intermediaries conduct their business much

like private intermediaries, acquiring financial assets on either a loan

or purchase basis, and in turn issuing their own liabilities. There are

at   least two important differences,     however. One   is that government
intermediaries        do not operate subject to the profit motive alone. While
they typically pursue a profit objective,, they do so within the limitations imposed
by their charter to support areas of economic       activity designated by

Congress   as public policy priorities.20 The other key difference is that

the liabilities of the         mortgage   pools and   some of   the sponsored credit

agencies are directly guaranteed by the federal government and               accordingly
pay interest geared to that on federal government securities. Hence

government intermediation also provides some degree of subsidy in the form

of access to less expensive (because less risky, by virtue of the guarantee)
            21
credit.

            The federal government's role as a credit guarantor, which is not

limited      to the financial intermediation that it sponsors, is itself an
important        factor that has had great influence on the U.S.        economy's reliance
on financial intermediation. Deposit insurance provided by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance

corporation constitutes the most prevalent form of government sponsored

guarantee provided for a fee, and           it significantly alters the character
of   the liabilities       that private   sector deposit intermediaries can offer.

Other familiar government sponsored agencies providing guarantees for a fee

include the Veterans Administration, the Federal Housing Authority, the

Overseas Investors Protection Corporation, the Security Investors Protection

corporation,       and   most recently the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation.

The   federal governxrnt has also sponsored large-scale loan guarantee
programs for diverse borrowers ranging from college students and small
businesses to the Lockheed and chrysler Corporations and New York City.
In   all,    the government's 1983 outstanding credit and credit          guarantees —

including        direct loans, formally guaranteed loans, and        other loans by
federally        sponsored lenders — totaled $848 billion in comparison to $986

billion of direct federal debt obligations outstanding and               held   outside

the federal government (including the Federal Reserve System).

            This post World War II growth in the U.S. economy's reliance on
                                       —28—




federal   government intermediation, deposit insurance, and other credit
guarantees has probably been to a great extent a counterpart of the
government's   waning role as a direct borrower. Given the substantial

decline (relative to nonfinancial activity) in the federal government's

outstanding    debt, and the corresponding increase in the outstanding debt
of   private nonfinancial borrowers,22 the U.S.   financial markets have
increasingly   attempted to make private obligations more acceptable to the

economy's ultimate wealth holders by converting them into government

obligations via government insurance and credit guarantees. Along with the

increase in private    financial intermediation, the growth of government
credit   guarantees broadly defined —   including   some that are merly implicit

— has     enabled the U.S. financial system to absorb with substantial

success the large post-war shift in the public versus private mix of the

economy's debt.

5. Summary

       Intermediation is a hallmark of all highly developed financial

systems, and the United States is no exception. The U.S. financial markets

are heavily intermediated, and since World War II they have become

progressively more so.

       The principal rationales that give rise to financial intermediation

are benefits of size and specialization,, the diversification of specific

asset risks, and the pooling of even broader classes of risk. Each is a

significant factor in accounting for the U.S. economy's reliance on

intermediation. In addition, since World War II a further important factor

has been the economy's continual shift away from government debt toward

the debt of private nonfinancial entities including individuals and businesses.

Nonfinancial investors (primarily individuals) have exhibited a strong

preference for holding the debt of these nonfinancial borrowers via financial

intermediaries rather than directly.

       As the U.S. economy's reliance on financial intermediaries overall

has increased during the post—war period, some specific kinds of intermediary

institutions have grown more rapidly than others. Commercial banks have

about held their own in relative terms, while steadily shifting their

basic business back toward lending activities and away from securities

investments. Nonbank deposit intermediaries have grown in relation to

overall economic and financial activity, as the growth of savings and

loan associations has more than offset the (relative) decline of mutual

savings banks. Among private nondeposit intermediaries, life insurance

companies have declined in relative terms while both public and private

sector pension funds have shown exceptionally rapid growth. Finally, the

federal government's participation in the financial intermediation process
                                   —30—




in the United States has also increased rapidly during these years, in

part as a result of the pressures created by the economy's shift to private

instead of government debt.

     totaled $4.8 trillion (of which $2.2 trillion was residential real
     estate), in comparison to $8.3 trillion of financial assets. The
     available current—value data on nonfinancial asset holdings are
     understandably weak.

    3.   Moreover, these data overstate households! direct equity holdings in
         that they do not separate holdings via mutual funds, which grew from
         2% of total equity holdings on average during 1946-50 to 6% on average
         during 1976—80.

    4. Feldstein (1974) , for example, derived a large estimate of Social
        Security "wealth" (defined as the present discounted value of expected
         future benefits) and found evidence of a significant impact of Social
         Security on private saving behavior. Although this work and the
         literature that has followed it have emphasized effects ontotal
         saving behavior, there is no reason to expect the composition of asset
         holding to remain invariant.

    5. Some of the best known examples of this thinking were Greenough (1951)
        and Advisory Committee (1969).

    6. Lintner (1975), Modigliani and Cohn (1979) and Feldstein (1979), among
        others, have provided analyses of the failure of equity returns to
        keep pace with inflation.

    7. A distinction documented by Hartman (1978) is that, within the category
        of long-term portfolio (as opposed to direct) investments, foreign
        investors have mostly bought U.S. equities while U.S. investors have
        mostly bought foreign debt securities.

    8. Funds generated internally and retained by corporate businesses also
        represent a form of investment by the holders of equity shares in
        those corporations, of course. Given the large houshold ownership
         of equities, including retained earnings in the data shown in Table 1
         would greatly increase the share of funds "advanced" by nonfinancial
         investors, but would still leave intermediaries as the direct source
         of well over half of the total.
 9. See Friedman (1980, 1982) for a discussion of the post—war increase
     in the role of private debt in the U.S. economy.

10. Gurley and Shaw (1960) first emphasized this phenomenon.

11. Following Glass-Steagall, commercial banks no longer engage on their
     own account in investment banking or broker—dealer activities for publicly
     offered corporate securities, although they do so for public sector
     securities, and in recent years they have been increasingly involved
     in arranging direct placements of corporate securities. In addition,
     the trust departments of commercial banks continue to be the largest
     single factor in private asset management.
12. See the historical account given in Friedman and Schwartz (1963).
13. Banks' holdings of Treasury securities were essentially flat from
     1946 until the swelling of the federal deficit in 1975, so that
     banks' portfolios of municipals have exceeded their portfolios of
     direct U.S. Treasury obligations ever since 1969. Except for
    1974—76 and 1980-83, all of the growth in banks' holdings of federal
    government debt has consisted of federal agency securities.

14. See Goldfeld (1973, 1976) for a review of the post—war evidence on
     money demand behavior.

15. In Table 5, however, the respective size of the three groups is
     indicated by their total assets because of the lack of historical
     data on pension funds' liabilities.

16. See Bodie and Shoven (1983) and Kotlikoff and Smith (1983) for a
     comprehensive survey of the role of pension funds in the U.S. economy.

17. Several of the papers in Bodie and Shoven (1983) investigate the
     nature of this underfunding. Although corporations are now required
     to report (as a footnote to the balance sheet) the difference between
     pension assets and liabilities for vested benefits, there is no easy
     way to discover the liability for nonvested benefits.

18. See again Kotlikoff and Smith (1983).

19. The mortgage market receives, as a net addition to available funds, less
     than all of the credit provided by the sponsored credit agencies and
     mortgage pools if they in turn sell their securities to investors
     who would otherwise have held deposits in thrift institutions; see the
     analysis of this question in Jaf fee and Rosen (1979).

20. It is important not to draw this distinction too firmly, however.
     For example, savings and loan associations have a tax incentive to
     hold at least 82% of their asset portfolios in residential mortagages
     (or other qualified assets). Also, in the presence of deposit interest
     ceilings limiting the pay—out of earnings to holders of deposit shares,
    it has never been clear what role the profit motive plays in portfolio
    decisions of savings and loan associations or mutual savings banks.

    in   federal credit programs.
