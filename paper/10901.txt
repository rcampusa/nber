                                            ABSTRACT

This paper asks the question: Can we see evidence of General Purpose Technologies in patent data?

Using data on three million US patents granted between 1967 and 1999, and their citations received

between 1975 and 2002, we construct a number of measures of GPTs, including generality, number

of citations, and patent class growth, for patents themselves and for the patents that cite the patents.

A selection of the top twenty patents in the tails of the distribution of several of these measures

yields a set of mostly ICT technologies, of which the most important are those underlying

transactions on the internet and object-oriented software. We conclude with a brief discussion of the

problems we encountered in developing our measures and suggestions for future work in this area.

1       Introduction

        In ‘The Computer and the Dynamo,’ Paul David makes a persuasive case for

considering the process by which the electric dynamo spread throughout the economy

during the turn of the last century and the process by which the use of information

technology (specifically, computing technology) is currently being spread throughout

different industries as similar manifestations of the diffusion of ‘General Purpose

Technologies,’ a term introduced into the economics literature by Bresnahan and

Trajtenberg (1995). All these authors, as well as Helpman and Trajtenberg (1998a,b),

emphasize the singular contribution to economic growth made by this type of

technology, because of its ability to transform the means and methods of production in a

wide variety of industries.

        At the same time and using historical data, David (1989, 1990), Rosenberg

(1976), and others have argued that the diffusion of these technologies throughout the

economy may take decades rather than years because of coordination problems and the

need for complementary investments (both tangible and intangible) in using industries.

For this reason it may take some time for the benefits of the technologies to be manifest

in economic growth. On the theoretical side, Bresnahan and Trajtenberg (1995) have

studied the non-optimality of innovation and diffusion when a decentralized market

system is called upon to try to solve the coordination problem between technology-

innovating and technology-using industries. However there has been relatively little

empirical and econometric work that incorporates the insights of these various authors to

analyze specific technologies.

       Our modest goal in this paper is to see what might be learned about the existence

and technological development of General Purpose Technologies (hereafter, GPTs)

through the examination of patent data, including the citations made to other patents.

Such measures would be useful both to help identify GPTs in their early stages of

development and also as proxies for the various rates of technical change called for in a

fully developed growth model such as that in Helpman and Trajtenberg (1998b). In

doing this exploration we are also motivated by the observation that not all technologies,

or indeed, R&D dollars are equal, but that economists too often ignore that fact,

primarily because of data limitations. As has been pointed out by others before us,

patenting measures have the potential to allow more detailed analysis of the ‘direction’

as well as the ‘rate’ of technical change.2

       Although such an exploration might be made using data from a variety of

countries, our focus here is on the use of US patent data, where the citations have a well-

defined meaning and also where they have been computerized since 1977, enabling us to

work with them relatively easily. Given the importance of the United States as a locus of

technical change in the late twentieth century, we do not feel that this limitation to US

patenting activity is a serious drawback for a preliminary investigation of this kind.

       We begin with the definition (description) of GPTs offered by Helpman and

Trajtenberg (1998a):




                                                 3
Hall-Trajtenberg                                                                              October 2004


             1. They are extremely pervasive and used in many sectors of the economy.

                  Historical examples are the steam engine and the electric dynamo (the

                  engine of electrification). Contemporary examples are the semiconductor

                  and perhaps the internet.

             2. Because they are pervasive and therefore important, they are subject to

                  continuous technical advance after they are first introduced, with

                  sustained performance improvements.

             3. Effective use of these technologies requires complementary investment in

                  the using sectors; at the same time, the GPT enhances the productivity of

                  R&D in the downstream sector. It is these points that are emphasized by

                  David.

         Using this definition, the contribution of the effort described here is to define

measures using patents and citations that quantify the insights of David and Trajtenberg

and their co-authors.

         Our study is subject to a variety of limitations, however: first, it is based on

patent data, which provides imperfect coverage of innovative activity, as not all

innovations are patented or patentable.3 Second, it relies heavily on the US Patent Office

classification system for technology, treating each three-digit patent class as roughly

comparable in the ‘size’ of a technology. An examination of the classes suggests that

this is unlikely to be strictly true (for example, the chemistry of inorganic compounds is

a single class, whereas there are multiple optics classes). Making use of the subclasses to

refine the class measures would be a formidable task, because subclasses are spawned

within the three-digit class ‘ad libidum’ and may descend either from the main class or

 Griliches (1990); Pavitt (1988).

 In the United States environment, this statement is increasingly less true, although the converse, that not
all patent subject matter is innovative, may be becoming more true.

from another subclass. Thus some subclasses are more ‘important’ than others, but this

fact has to be uncovered by a tedious search of the text on the USPTO website. Rather

than attempting to construct our own classification system in this way, we chose to look

at measures based on the primary IPC class of the patent.4 Finally, because patent

citation data is only available in computerized form in 1975, and because severe

truncation due to the application-grant lag and the citation lag sets in by around 1995 our

period of study is necessarily fairly short and emphasizes the 1980s and 1990s.

However, truncation in the later years means that we are unable (yet) to fully explore the

implications of changes in information processing technology during the very recent

past.

         Because of time and resource constraints, we have focused the large part of our

analysis on an extremely small subset of the nearly three million patents available to us,

the 780 most highly cited patents that were granted between 1967 and 1999. There is

considerable evidence that the value or importance distribution of patents is highly

skewed, with most patents being unimportant and a few being highly valuable.5 We

expect that one reason for this finding is that true GPT patents are concentrated among

the highly cited patents, so the current endeavour is centred on those patents, which

represent the extreme tail of a very skew distribution.

         In order to understand how patent data might help us identify GPTs and explore

their development and diffusion, it is necessary first to understand something more about

  As a general rule, the USPTO does not classify patents individually into IPC classes, but relies on a map
based on US classes and subclasses to determine them. This is not ideal, but does mean that they
incorporate some subclass information.
5
 For recent evidence on this point, see Harhoff et al (1999) for the results of a survey of patent owners,
and Hall, Jaffe, and Trajtenberg (2000) for results showing that the market value-citation relationship is
highly nonlinear, with firms owning highly cited patents subject to very large premia, as well as a graph
showing the frequency distribution of patent citations.

patent citations. This is the subject of the next section. We then discuss the GPT-related

measures we have constructed from the patent data, and show how our sample of highly-

cited patents differs in various dimensions from the population as a whole.


2          Patent citations6

           A key data item in the patent document is ‘References Cited – US Patent

Documents’ (hereafter we refer to these just as ‘citations’). Patent citations serve an

important legal function, since they delimit the scope of the property rights awarded by

the patent. Thus, if patent B cites patent A, it implies that patent A represents a piece of

previously existing knowledge upon which patent B builds, and over which B cannot

have a claim. The applicant has a legal duty to disclose any knowledge of the ‘prior art,’

but the decision regarding which patents to cite ultimately rests with the patent

examiner, who is supposed to be an expert in the area and hence to be able to identify

relevant prior art that the applicant misses or conceals. The presumption is thus that

citations are informative of links between patented innovations. First, citations made

may constitute a ‘paper trail’ for spillovers, i.e. the fact that patent B cites patent A may

be indicative of knowledge flowing from A to B; second, citations received may be

telling of the ‘importance’ of the cited patent.7 The following quote provides support for

the latter presumption:

                 ‘..the examiner searches the…patent file. His purpose is to identify any

        prior disclosures of technology… which might be similar to the claimed

        invention and limit the scope of patent protection...or which, generally, reveal

    This description of the meaning of patent citations is drawn from Hall, Jaffe, and Trajtenberg (2002).

  See Jaffe, Trajtenberg and Fogarty (2000) for evidence from a survey of inventors on the role of citations
in both senses.

Hall-Trajtenberg                                                                           October 2004


     the state of the technology to which the invention is directed. If such documents

     are found...they are “cited”... if a single document is cited in numerous patents,

     the technology revealed in that document is apparently involved in many

     developmental efforts. Thus, the number of times a patent document is cited

     may be a measure of its technological significance.’ (OTAF, 1976, p. 167)

        The aspect of citations that is important for the present effort is that they provide

a record of the link between the present invention and previous inventions. Thus they

can tell us both the extent to which a particular line of technology is being developed (if

they are made to patents in the same technology area) and whether a particular invention

is used in wide variety of applications (if they are made to patents in different

technology areas). In principle, given that we know which firm owns the relevant

patents, it is possible to ask these question both using the technology field, which is a

classification made by the US Patent Office,8 and using the industry in which the patent

falls, as indicated by the firm to which it is assigned.


3       Measures of GPTs

        The definition of GPTs paraphrased in the introduction suggests that the

following characteristics apply to the patents associated with GPT innovations: 1) they

will have many citations from outside their particular technology area or perhaps from

industries outside the one in which the patented invention was made; 2) they will have

many citations within their technology area, and the citations will indicate a pattern of

cumulative innovation, or trace out a technology trajectory; 3) more speculatively, citing



8
  The USPTO has developed over the years a highly elaborate classification system for the technologies to
which the patented inventions belong, consisting of about 400 main (three-digit) patent classes, and over
120,000 patent subclasses. This system is being updated continuously, reflecting the rapid changes in the
technologies themselves. Trajtenberg, Jaffe, and Hall have developed a higher-level classification, by
which the 400 classes are aggregated into 36 two-digit technological sub-categories, and these in turn are


                                                         7
Hall-Trajtenberg                                                                      October 2004


technologies will be subject to a burst of innovative activity as complementary goods are

developed; and 4) given the length of time it takes for a GPT to pervade the economy,

citation lags for patents in this area may be longer than average. In this section of the

paper we report on the construction of a number of proxies for these characteristics. We

use these proxies to identify patents that are in the extreme tail of the distribution of

patent characteristics, in an effort to identify some candidate GPTs. Nor surprisingly, we

find that looking at a single characteristics may be misleading, so in the later sections of

the paper we use a more multivariate approach to refine the analysis.

        It is well known that the distribution of patent values and patent citations is very

skew with almost half of all patents receiving zero or one cite and less than 0.1 per cent

receiving more than 100 cites (see Hall et al 2005 for evidence on both points).

Observations (1) and (2) above also suggest that GPT patents are likely to be highly

cited. Therefore we began our investigation by focusing on highly cited patents. We

identified these patents by requiring that the number of citations the patent received be

greater than three times the number received by the patent in the 99th percentile of the

distribution. The results of this selection process are shown in Table 1. It yielded 780

patents granted between 1967 and 1999 that were ultimately granted, together with the

name and type of their assignee (owner), the three-digit patent classification, and similar

information on ALL the patents issued between 1975 and 2002 that cited this patent, for

a total of 159,822 citations. Table 1 also makes it clear how skew the citation

distribution is: our sample of 780 patents is about one out of 3700 patents, whereas the

160 thousand citations are one out of 100 citations (there are sixteen million citations in




further aggregated into six main categories: Chemical, Computers and Communications (C&C), Drugs
and Medical (D&M), Electrical and Electronics (E&E), Mechanical, and Others.

all). Thus our patents are 37 times more likely to be cited than predicted by the average

probability.

        Table 1 about here


3.1     Generality

        Observation (1) above suggests the use of a measure that is similar to the

Trajtenberg, Jaffe, and Henderson ‘Generality’ measure, which is defined in the

following way:

                                         Generality ≡ Gi = 1 − ∑ ji sij2
                                                                     n




where sij denotes the percentage of citations received by patent i that belong to patent

class j, out of ni patent classes (note that the sum is the Herfindahl concentration index).

Thus, if a patent is cited by subsequent patents that belong to a wide range of fields the

measure will be high, whereas if most citations are concentrated in a few fields it will be

low (close to zero).9

        Point (2) suggests that even if Generality is relatively high, the absolute number

of citations should also be high, implying that there may still be a large number of

citations in the patent’s own technology class. It also suggests that ‘second-generation’

citations be examined. We implement this using two variables, the average number of

citations to the citing patents, and the average generality of the citing patent.

        In actual measurement, the preceding two predictions interact in ways which

make our task a bit more complex. Like patents, citation counts are a discrete random

variable bounded below by zero. This means that fewer citations in total imply that

fewer classes will be observed to have citations than should be observed were the total



9
 Note that Generality is not defined if a patent receives no citations, and is zero by construction when a
patent receives only one. We have omitted such patents in the tables and graphs shown in this paper. They
comprise about one quarter of all patents in our sample.

                                                         9
Hall-Trajtenberg                                                                             October 2004


number of citations larger. That is, ni is biased downward by the fact that fractional

citations are not observed, and Generality will tend to be lower when there are fewer

citations. This is quite visible in the graph of average Generality over time shown in

Figure 1, where we show two different versions of Generality, one based on US patent

classes, and another based on the International Patent Classification, as assigned to these

patents by the USPTO. Note that the average of either Generality measures begins to

decline fairly steeply in 1993-95, at the same time as our measure of average citations

per patent turns down sharply due to the effects of lag truncation (see Figure 2). In this

case, this is a spurious rather than real decline in Generality, due to the fact that our

patent grant data ends in 2002, and therefore our application-dated data around 1999, so

that patents in the years after about 1994 have had less chance to receive citations.10

         Figures 1 and 2 about here

         Using a simple binomial model of the probability of observing a citation in a

given cell, Hall (2002) shows that an unbiased estimate of the generality of the ith patent

can be computed using the following correction:

                                                          Ni
                                                  G i =        Gi
                                                         Ni − 1

where Ni is the number of citations observed. Note that this measure is not defined when

Ni < 2 and will be fairly noisy when Ni is small. We have used this bias correction for

the first three generality measures described below.

         The US patent classification system has grown over time in ways that make it not

ideal for the purpose we have in mind here. Generality measures essentially assume that




10
  A typical citation lag distribution is shown in Figure 2. This curve was estimated from the observed data
using the methodology of Trajtenberg, Jaffe, and Henderson (1997). See Appendix D of Hall, Jaffe, and
Trajtenberg (2000) for details. From the graph it appears that over half the citations ever made are made in
the first six years since the cited patent’s application date.


                                                         10
Hall-Trajtenberg                                                                October 2004


all categories are equidistant from each other if they are to be compared, but this is not

the case for the US patent class system. Therefore, we explore the use of generality

measures based on five different classification systems:

   1. US patent class (approximately 400 cells).

   2. Hall-Jaffe-Trajtenberg technology subcategories (36 cells).

   3. Main International Patent Class (approximately 1200 cells).

   4. Industry classification based on Silverman’s IPC-SIC concordance (Silverman

       2002) for industry of manufacture, aggregated to the Hall-Vopel (1997) level (37

       cells).

   5. Industry classification based on Silverman’s IPC-SIC concordance for industry

       of use, aggregated to Hall-Vopel level (37 cells).

The rationales for these various choices are the following: First, in addition to using the

US patent classification system (measure 1), we also constructed generality based on the

more equal groupings of technologies constructed by Hall, Jaffe, and Trajtenberg (2002)

from the patent classes (measure 2) and from the International Patent Classification

system main four-digit classes (measure 3), which is more detailed that the US patent

classification system.

       Second, it could be argued that a GPT is not likely to manifest itself as a series of

citations by patents in different technology classes, but rather as citations by firms in

different industries. To consider this possibility, we would like to base a measure on the

shares of citations that come from firms in different industries at the roughly two and

one half-digit level. That is, our fourth measure is a Herfindahl for patent citation

dispersion across industries rather than across technologies. Based on the discussion of

GPT diffusion to using industries in the introduction, an industry-based measure would

seem to be intrinsically preferred for this exercise. There are basically two ways to


                                                 11
Hall-Trajtenberg                                                                              October 2004


construct such a measure: the first uses the industry of ownership of the patents based on

identification of the patent assignees and the second determines the industry for each

patent class/subclass from some type of industry-patent class concordance. The first

approach is difficult to implement in practice, given the number of patents that are

unassigned, and the number of assignees that are not identifiable, either because they are

small firms or because they are foreign firms for which we do not yet have a match to

other data sources.11

         Therefore we used the SIC-technology class concordances of Silverman (2002)

to assign these patents and their citations to industries of manufacture and of use. Then

we collapsed the distribution of citations by SIC codes into a 37-element vector of

industries using the SIC-industry correspondence given in Appendix Table 1, and used

this vector to construct the generality measures 4 and 5. The computation of these

measures was able to make use of all the patents rather than just those held by US

industry.12 One major drawback of using the Silverman concordance ought to be

mentioned, especially in the light of our subsequent findings: it is based on assignments

to industry of manufacture and use made by Canadian patent examiners between 1990

and 1993. This means that it will do a poor job on patents in technologies related to the

growth of the internet and software, because there were unlikely to be many of these in

the Canadian patent system prior to 1994.

for the highly cited patents, Figure 3 the US patent class index and Figure 4 the index



11
  Slightly fewer than half the patents granted between 1967 and 1999 are assigned to US corporations that
we can identify (see Hall et al 2002). However, many of these are in multiple industries so the primary
industry assignment may not be relevant for the particular patent or citation that we are using.
12
  The actual industry classification we use was developed by Hall and Vopel (1997) from an earlier
classification used by Levin and Reiss (1984). It is based on four-digit SICs aggregated up to a level that

based on Silverman’s industry of manufacture map. As the figures show, these indices

range from zero to one and the measure based on the industry of manufacture has a

somewhat different distribution from that based on the US classification system. In

Appendix Table A3, we show the correlation matrix for all 5 generality measures for our

highly cited sample. Although they are generally fairly highly correlated, the industry of

use measure (5) is not very correlated with the US class-based measures (1 and 3), and

the industry of manufacture (4) not very correlated with the US class measure (1).

         Figures 3 and 4 about here

         Table 2 shows the twenty highly cited patents which also have the highest

generality, where generality is measured by each of the five measures. In general, the

most general patents are those in chemicals, especially when we consider the industry of

use. Looking at the industry of manufacture, those in other technologies seem to be the

most general. However, looking by US class, we can see the drawback of this generality

measure: there are a number of chemical classes that are all essentially the same large

class (the series 532-570), whereas in the case of some of the physics-based classes,

there is only a single class. This fact will tend bias the index toward generality in the

chemicals case; however, the fact that the IPC classification produces a similar result is

somewhat reassuring.

         Table 2 about here


3.2      Patenting growth

         Observation (3) suggested that we look at patent classes with rapid growth in

patenting. Using the entire patent database aggregated to patent class, we constructed

three sub-periods (1975-83, 1984-92, and 1993-99) and computed the average growth



is coarse enough to include most, but not all, whole firms in the US manufacturing sector. We augmented
this industry list with ten industries for the non-manufacturing sector. See Appendix Table A1 for details.

                                                         13

within class for each of the periods.13 The results are shown in Table 3. As might be

expected, in all three periods, the patent classes with rapid growth are dominated by the

information and data processing classes (395 and 7xx), with the addition of the new

multicellular biotechnology class 800 in the latter two periods. Highly cited patents are

slightly more common in rapidly growing classes, although only a few of these classes

have significant numbers of highly cited patents and the difference may not be very

significant. It does appear that the patent classes that are growing rapidly include

technologies that have more of the character of what we think of as GPTs, but that

although highly cited patents are two to three times more likely to be found in rapidly

growing classes (as we might expect if citations tend to come from the same class), they

do not seem to be disproportionate in these classes.

            Table 3 about here

            Another way of looking at the growth in patenting following the introduction of a

GPT is to look at the growth of the patent classes that cite such a technology. The

hypothesis is that innovations which build on a GPTlike innovation will themselves

spawn many new innovations. Table 4 shows the patent classes for the top twenty

patents in terms of the growth of their citing patent classes, both for the highly cited

patents and for all patents, excluding those that are highly cited. The message is clear:

using this measure, almost all the patent classes identified are in computing and

communications technology, and most are in data processing technologies more

narrowly defined.

            Table 4 about here




13
     We have omitted patent classes with fewer than 10 patents at the end of each period.

3.3     Citation lags

        Finally, observation (4) suggested that the average citation lag to GPT patents

might be longer. Of course, citations to patent data for a fixed time period such as ours

(1967-1999) are always subject to truncation. For this reason, we look at mean citation

lags that are large relative to the average citation lag for patents applied for in the same

year.

        Table 5 shows that the twenty highly cited patents with long lags (greater than 70

per cent of the average citation lag) are typically in older technologies. It is noteworthy

that there are none in the chemicals or electrical industries and only five in computing

and drugs, most of which are to surgical innovations. The only highly cited computing

patent with long citation lags is a patent on an aspect of computer architecture taken out

by Siemens in 1976; this patent has a mean citation lag of 23 years and is noteworthy

because it is has essentially no citations until after it expired in 1994. It now has over

200. In general, given the fact that long lags by themselves often simply identify older

and slower-moving technologies such as packaging, we will want to use this indicator in

combination with our other indicators when looking for GPTs.

        Table 5 about here


3.4     Summary

        The GPT measures we have identified (the five generality indexes, the generality

of citing patents, within class growth in patenting, growth in citing patent classes, and

the average citation lag) are promising, but clearly give contradictory messages when

taken separately. The goal is to combine them in a reasonable way to give an indication

of the types of evidence GPTs leave in the patent statistics. We explore solutions to this

problem in section 5 of this paper, but first we summarize the relationship between them

and the probability that a patent is highly cited.

4        Highly cited patents

         Table 6 shows that the highly cited patents differ in almost all respects from the

population of all patents, and also from a four per cent sample of patents with at least

one cite that we will use later as a control sample. They take longer to be issued, they

have about twice as many claims, they are more likely to have a US origin, and more

likely to be assigned to a US corporation, more likely to have multiple assignees, and

have higher citation lags on average.14 They also have higher generality, no matter how

generality is measured, and are in patent classes that are growing faster than average.

Although the patents that cite them more likely to be cited themselves, they have only

slightly higher generality than citing patents in general.

         Table 6 about here

         More than half of the highly cited patents are in two of our six main technology

classes: computing hardware and software, and drugs and medical instruments. Of

course, these are indeed the technology classes where we expect to find modern day

GPTs. In Appendix Table A2, we broke this down, in order to identify the important

technologies more precisely. Highly cited patents are more than twice as likely to be

found in computer hardware and software, computer peripherals, surgery and medical

instruments, genetic technologies, miscellaneous drugs, and semiconductors.

         Table 7 shows a series of probit estimations for the probability that a patent with

at least one cite will be highly cited, in order to provide a multivariate summary of the

data in Table 6.15 The table shows the derivative of the probability with respect to the



14
  Unlike the case of generality measures, the mean citation lag is linear in the citation counts and
therefore not a biased estimate, conditional on the total number of citations. It is, however, truncated at the
end of the period, but this truncation affects both highly cited and non-highly cited patents equally.

15
  The sample used is the 780 highly cited patents plus the four per cent random sample of patents with at
least one cite shown in Table 2. The fact that we use a random sample rather than a population affects the

                                                          16

independent variable that are implied by the coefficient estimates. In the case of dummy

variables, it shows the change in probability when the variable changes from zero to one.

Because the probability of being one of the highly cited patents in the sample is very

small (0.77 per cent), the values in the table are small. Taking the grant lag as an

example, the interpretation is that an additional year between application and grant

increases the probability of being highly cited by 0.06 per cent, or from 0.77 per cent to

0.83 per cent at the mean. Being a patent in the drugs and medical category increases the

probability by 2.9 per cent, which is a very large change at the mean probability.

         Table 7 about here

         The table confirms the univariate differences between highly cited and all

patents. In addition, this table shows that variations over time in the probability of high

citation do not greatly affect the coefficients (compare column 4 to column 2). The only

generality measure that enters significantly and positively in this regression is that based

on the US class; the others were all insignificant (IPC, technology subcategory, and

industry of use) or slightly negative (industry of manufacture). Also note that highly

cited patents are far more likely to be cited by patents that are themselves cited by

patents in many technology classes, once we control for the other differences between

highly cited and other patents.


5        Identifying GPT patents

         It is not obvious how to combine these measures to choose a sample of GPT

patents. In this first investigation of the topic, we have chosen simply to look for patents

that are outliers in several of the categories, on the grounds that such patents are likely to




constant term in this probit regression, so we do not report it. The other coefficient estimates will not be
affected by this procedure, although the interpretation of the changes in probability will depend on the
average probability in the sample used.

                                                          17
Hall-Trajtenberg                                                                October 2004


give us an idea of the technologies that have given birth to the most subsequent

inventive activity in the largest number of technological areas. Accordingly, we began

with the 780 highly cites patents and then we chose a set of patents that fell in the top

twenty per cent of these patents according to generality, citing patent generality, and the

subsequent five year growth of the patent’s class. We performed this exercise for each of

the five generality measures in turn.

       Table 8 shows the result: twenty patents out of the 780 were selected, many by

several of the different criteria. Selection by each of the five generality measures is

indicated by the presence of the measure in the table. Of these patents, all but two were

in technologies related to information and communication technology (ICT). The

remaining two are the oldest (applied for in 1970) and cover a process that is useful in

the making of paper, and in sewage and waste treatment, and absorbable sutures for

surgery. All but one of the patents cover US inventions, five from California, three from

New Jersey, and the remainder from a number of other states. The sole exception comes

from a Toronto-based company. All but one of the patents were assigned to corporations

at the time they were taken out; the exception was a patent for a method of compressing

audio and video data for transmission.

       Table 8 about here

       The ICT–related patents cover a range of technologies: integrated circuit

manufacturing, handheld computers, spread spectrum technology, and so forth. What is

noteworthy is the number of patents that relate to internet transactions (e-commerce) and

software development, especially object-oriented programming. Some of the e-

commerce patents greatly precede the actual use of the technology. For example, the

celebrated Freeny patent (US4528643, shown in Figure 5) was applied for in 1983 and

issued in 1985, but has been successfully asserted against such corporations as Microsoft

and Apple almost to the present day.16 The fact that the original use for which this patent

was contemplated is unlikely to have been internet-based e-commerce reminds us to be

cautious in our interpretation of the results in the table: we do not argue that the patents

we identify are necessarily the source of the GPT itself, but we do suggest that by

identifying them via the subsequent growth and generality in their citing patents, we are

observing the symptoms of the diffusion and development of a General Purpose

Technology.

        Figure 5 about here

        Looking at the actual ICT patents in Table 8 (rather than at the classes in which

they have been placed) yields the following summary: seven are related to object-

oriented and windows-based software, four to internet commerce and communication,

three to audio-video applications, two to handheld computing, and 1 each to

telecommunications and semiconductor manufacturing. Thus the specific technologies

identified as being both general and spawning rapid patenting growth are those related to

the effective use of the computer, especially for interacting and transacting over

distance. That is, they are not computing hardware patents per se, but patents on the

technologies that allow a network of computers to operate together effectively, and to

interact with the users of those computers. This seems to us to characterize the GPT of

the 1980s and 1990s, and we would therefore declare our prospecting exercise a

qualified success.17

   Note that the industry of manufacture and industry of use measures do not identify the software and
internet patents as GPTs, for reasons discussed earlier: they have been obtained using a concordance that
did not really admit these as patentable areas.

6      Conclusions

       Many empirical papers close with interpretive cautions and calls for further

research. This paper is no exception, but the caution and the call are stronger than usual.

For reasons of limited time and computing power we have not been able to explore the

validity and use of the measures we have constructed as much as we would like and we

encourage further work in this area. In particular, all of the generality measures suffer

from the fact that they treat technologies that are closely related but not in the same class

in the same way that they treat very distant technologies. This inevitably means that

generality may be overestimated in some cases and underestimated in others. One

suggestion for future research would be to construct a weighted generality measure,

where the weights are inversely related to the overall probability that one class cites

another class.

        A second area of concern has to do with changes in the strategic uses of patents

during the two decades we have studied. These changes are not unrelated to the growth

in importance of ICT technologies but they may also have had an distorting impact on

some of the measure we have used. In particular, as Hall and Ziedonis (2001) have

shown, one reason for rapid growth in semiconductor patenting after the mid-1980s is a

conscious decision on the part of some major firms to build up their patent portfolios in

order to fend off litigation and negotiate cross-licensing agreements. This type of

strategy has spread throughout the industry and the consequences for patenting by firms

such as IBM, Lucent, and Hewlett-Packard has been confirmed by Bessen and Hunt

(2004) and Hall (2005). The implication is that citations to earlier patents in the ICT

sector may be growing rapidly partly because of a strategic shift as well as because the

underlying technology is growing in importance and diffusing throughout the economy.

Sorting this out from our data will require more attention to the time series behaviour of

the indicators, improved generality measures, and more detailed investigation of the

firms involved. In the interim, this paper has demonstrated the potential validity of

patent-based measures of GPTs and we hope it will spur further investigation into the

use of patent data in this way.
