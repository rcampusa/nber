       Regressions of ex post changes in floating exchange rates on appropriate interest

differentials typically imply that the high-interest rate currency tends to appreciate, the "forward

discount puzzle." Using data from the European Monetary System, we find that a largepart of

the forward discount puzzle vanishes for regimes of fixed exchange rates. That is, deviations

from uncovered interest parity appear to vary in a way which is dependent upon the exchange

rate regime. By using the many EMS realignments, we are also able to quantify the "peso

problem.'

I: Introduction

      It is well known that deviations from uncovered interest parity (IJIP) are pervasive

and persistent.1/ In particular, currencies with high interest rates tend to appreciate

relative to those with lower interest rates, contrary to the hypothesis of UTP. Since foreign

exchange markets are among the deepest markets in the world, explaining UIP deviations is

an interesting and important task for international finance researchers.

      In this short paper, we contribute to the literature in two ways. First, we test UIP

for fixed exchange rate currencies. Nearly all of the relevant literature has tested (and

rejected) UIP using data for floating exchange rates. A typical finding is that the slope

coefficient from a regression of the ex post change in the exchange rate on the appropriate

interest differential is usually negative, economically and statistically far below the UIP

value of + 1. We find it easy to produce such results using daily data from the 1980s and

1990s pooled across a number of countries which are floating vis-a-vis the American

dollar. However, when we use fixed exchange rate data from the Exchange Rate

Mechanism (ERM) of the European Monetary System (EMS), we find that UIP fares much

better. Instead of being negative, the slope coefficient is typically around +.6, though still

significantly below its hypothesized value of unity.

      Our second contribution stems from the fact that the ERM has experienced a number

of discrete exchange rate realignments (and other such events) since the EMS began in

1979. Many of these realignments were anticipated by the financial markets. Market

anticipations of an event which does not occur sufficiently frequently in the sample leads to

small-sample bias in UIP regressions. This bias is commonly referred to as the "peso

                                              2
problem". We attempt to quantify this bias by pooling our data across currencies, and

comparing regression results when the realignments are included in the sample to those

when the realignment observations are excluded. While there is no guarantee that the 54

realignments which the ERM experienced in our sample are enough to constitute a large

sample (especially as these events are not independent across country or time), our best

guess is that the peso problem leads to a bias of around -.35, the difference between the

slope coefficient in the UIP regression when the latter is estimated with and without

realignments.
      In section II of the paper, we describe our data set and empirical methodology. Our

empirical results are present and discussed in section III; a brief interpretation concludes.



II: Methodology and Data

      The hypothesis of uncovered interest parity can be expressed as:



             (l+i1) =   (l+i*t)E%(S%÷b)ISt                                       (1)




where: 1L represents the return on a domestic asset at time t of maturity     i" is the return

on a comparable foreign asset; S is the domestic currency price of a unit of foreign

exchange; and E(.) represents the expectations operator conditional upon information

available at t.

      We follow the literature in taking natural logarithms and ignoring small cross terms

by considering only countries with "low' interest rates. Rearranging, we derive:
                                                  3
                     - s)    (j..j*)

        —> S+ S = a         + /3(i..i*) + L                                        (2)



where: s is the natural logarithm of s;       is the forecasting error realized at t+ from a

forecast of the exchange rate made at time t; and a and j3 are regression coefficients.

Since     is a forecasting error, it is assumed to be stationary and orthogonal to all

information available at time t, including interest rates; hence OLS is a consistent estimator

of(3.

        Equation (2) has been used as the workhorse for most of the extant UIP literature.

The null hypothesis of UIP can be expressed as Ho: a=O, (3=1. Researchers have

typically estimated (3 to be significantly negative (3 estimate, and a to be non-trivial.

        In practice, we modify (2) in two slight ways. First, we pool together data from a

number of different countries, an admissible way of increasing the sample under the null

hypothesis. Second, we use data of daily frequency for exchange rate forecasts of usually

three months horizon. The fact that       is greater than unity induces to have a moving

average "overlapping observation" structure. We take account of this by estimating our

covariance matrices with the well-known Newey-West estimator, with an appropriate

number of off-diagonal bands.

        We estimate (2) on two different data sets: one for flexible exchanges, one for fixed

exchange rates. Both data sets consist of daily observations on exchange and interest rates;

the data have been check and corrected for various errors.1/

      Throughout, we use 90-day euro-currency interest rate series, observed at 10:00 am

Swiss time. We convert both interest differentials and exchange rate changes to annualized

percentages.
      Our floating exchange rate data set consists of bilateral dollar rates quoted at noon in

London from 1981 through early October 1994 (the sample period was chosen to match the

EMS data set relatively closely, subject to restrictions of data availability). We include the

following countries, which float more or less cleanly relative to the United States:

Australia; Canada; France; Germany; Japan; Switzerland; and the UK.jj

regressand of equation (2), is plotted (on the ordinate) against the 90-day interest

differential (regressor of (2), on the abscissa).

 jj Canada smooths its exchange rate; the European exchange rates are linked through the
ERM. These reasons may lead one to believe that there should not be enormous
differences between the results from our different data sets. We view the issue as
debatable, and try to let the data speak for themselves.
                                              5

      Our "fixed" exchange rate data set covers all members of the ERM from its inception

in March 1979 through early March l994./ We treat Germany as the anchor of the

ERM, and measure all bilateral rates in DM terms. The other long-term members of the

ERM have been: Belgium-Luxembourg; Denmark; France; Ireland; Italy; and the

Netherlands. Portugal, Spain, and the UK were later entrants; Italy and the UK left the

ERM in mid-September 1992. The exchange rate data are cross-rates derived from dollar

rates, observed at 2:15 Swiss time by the BIS at the official "ecu fix". For this data set,

we have both 90- and 30-day euro-currency interest rates.

      The ERM has experienced a large number of "events" which have affected European

exchange rates ex post. Counting events for different countries individually, there have

been 54 realignments of bilateral DM central parities.2/ Many of these events were

anticipated by the financial markets, with varying degrees of accuracy. Comparing
estimates of /3 when (2) is estimated with and without the realignment observations is a

simple way to estimate the well-known small-sample peso problem bias. When we exclude

observations which include these events, we induce the bias. We hope that inclusion of

these observations should remove the peso problem. However, there is no guarantee that

our 54 realignments are sufficient to constitute a large sample, since they are not

independent events./


  1/ We recognize that the ERM was not, strictly speaking, a perfectly fixed exchange rate
system, since it allowed minor currency fluctuations even for "narrow band" members.
  2/ There have also been three entrances into the ERM, two exits from the system, one
narrowing of a bandwidth, and a number of widenings of bandwidths. In practice, we
ignore the last events, since central DM parity were not changed, and check for the
sensitivity of our results with respect to the others.
 I    Since we either include or exclude all of the realignments from the sample, we are
really providing a maximal estimate of the peso problem bias.

differential. Only observations which do not include an actual ERM realignment are

plotted. Immediately below is an exactly comparable graph which displays only

observations from the periods which do include an ERM realignment. The graphs to the

right are analogues for the 90-day market.

      Since the data in Figure 2 are sometimes crowded closely together, we also include

 "box and whisker" plots for the marginal distributions. These are displayed above (for
                                                 7
interest differentials) and to the right (for exchange rate changes) of the joint distribution

scatterplot. The line in the middle of the box marks the median; the box covers the

interquartile range (i.e., from the 25th percentile to the 75th percentile). The whiskers

extend to upper and lower "adjacent values"; 150% of the interquartile range rolled back to

the nearest data point. Points beyond adjacent values are usually considered to be outliers.

      For both the 30- and 90-day markets, the joint distributions for observations without

realignments resemble shapeless clouds. However, there are stronger indications of a

positive relationship between exchange rate changes and interest differentials for the

observations with realignments, particularly in the 90-day market. We now proceed to

investigate this hunch with more rigorous statistical analysis.



III: Results

      We estimated (2) on our pooled sample of data. Our results are displayed in Table I.

      The first lines present estimates from the data set of floating exchange rates. The

first line estimates (2) for the entire sample; the second adds country-specific intercepts to

the regression specification. Consistent with the findings of the literature, /3 is estimated to

be negative and significantly below its hypothesized value of unity, in both cases. A

negative estimate of 3 is a standard finding in the international finance literature, and

constitutes the "forward discount puzzle'. This finding implies that there is a non-trivial

correlation between ,   the   disturbance in (2), and the interest differential.

      The last lines present estimates from the EMS sample of fixed exchange rate

observations. There are four set of estimates: two each from the 30- and 90-day markets.

For each maturity, there are two sets of estimates. The first is estimated using the entire

data sample; the other excludes all observations which overlap EMS realignments.

        In all cases, /3 is estimated to be positive with the EMS data, and significantly greater

than zero at conventional significance levels. This result stands in sharp contrast to our

estimates derived from floating rates, and is our first chief result. However, the point

estimates of /3 are still significantly below the hypothesized value of unity. Thus, there still

appears to be a non-trivial correlation between e and (ii*), but it varies by exchange rate

regime.

        Our second main result stems from the fact that /3 falls by an economically and

statistically significant amount when realignments are excluded from the sample. Inducing

such sample selection leads /3 to fall by around .35, a rough estimate of the peso problem

bias.
                                               9

      We have checked for the robustness of our two results with respect to a number of

perturbations of our basic methodology. For instance, we checked to see if our results

depend on the inclusion of country- or year-specific intercept "fixed effect" terms. We

have also excluded the later ERM entrants, and, separately, all observations after 1989.

Finally, we have estimated 3 on a country-by-country basis. Our chief results

(significantly positive   estimates for fixed exchange rate data, which fall significantly if

realignment observations are excluded) are essentially robust to such changes.



IV: Conclusion

      It is well known that countries with floating exchange rates and high interest rates

tend to experience appreciations. This deviation from uncovered interest panty, known as

the "forward discount puzzle' does not appear to characterize our fixed exchange rate data

set. In particular, high interest rates are associated with subsequent (though not

proportionate) currency depreciation in the EMS. Using the same data, we have also found

that excluding periods of realignment from a regression Df exchange rate changes on

interest differentials, leads to a change in the slope coefficient of about -.35. We take the

latter to be an estimate of the much discussed "peso problem" bias.

      There remain significant deviations from uncovered interest parity, although these are

much smaller in the EMS regime of fixed exchange rates than in floating rate regimes. We

hope that the contrasting results across exchange rate regimes may enable others to pin

down some of the remaining deviations from UIP, especially given our quantification of the

peso-problem bias. Explanations of the forward discount bias which emphasize

heterogeneous beliefs and trading strategies on foreign exchange markets (either by central
                                            10

banks or by traders who are not fully rational) which are regime-dependent seem

particularly plausible to us.1I
