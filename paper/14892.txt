                                             ABSTRACT

In July of 1826, several prominent Wall Street firms abruptly went bankrupt, amid scandalous revelations
of fraudulent financial practices by their management. Although mostly forgotten today, these events
represented a watershed in the early development of the corporation laws and investor protections
governing Wall Street: in the aftermath of the scandals, New York State enacted an extensive package
of legislation designed to protect the interests of investors. These statutes were some of the the very
first of their kind, and had a lasting influence. This paper analyzes the causes of the failures, and the
evolution of the law in response. The analysis highlights the critical role played by scandal-driven
legislation in the evolution of investor protections and financial regulations.

1        Introduction

When the history of the panic of 2008 is written, its final chapters will likely describe a major

restructuring of our legal and institutional framework for regulating financial firms. Innovations in

lending practices, financial instruments, and investment vehicles that exploited defects in financial

regulations are commonly cited as important causes of the crisis. In response, there have been

calls for a new system of financial regulation, in order to prevent a recurrence of the practices

that led to the crisis.1 This suggests that the evolution of financial regulations is a game of cat

and mouse: regulations are imposed, then firms innovate, and if the innovations result in failures

or scandals the regulations are updated and the cycle begins anew. The Sarbanes-Oxley “Public

Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act of 2002,” implemented in reaction to

the revelations associated with the failures of firms such as Enron and Worldcom, might be seen as

the outcome of an earlier round of the game.

        It is tempting to think of this dynamic between financial innovations and regulatory responses

as unique to our modern financial system, with its breathtaking sophistication and complexity. But

this dynamic is an old one—probably as old as the country itself. In fact it is probably a better

description of the earliest decades of the nineteenth century, which began with relatively little

regulation of any kind, and saw dramatic innovations in the financial practices of corporations.

The United States inherited only a rudimentary corporation law from England, and on crucial

questions—from the rights of stockholders and creditors to financial disclosures and accounting

practice—the law was initially slow to evolve and remained vague, or totally silent, well into the

nineteenth century.2 But in July of 1826, a momentous scandal occurred, which ultimately led the

state of New York to implement an extensive series of changes to its corporation laws to safeguard

the interests of the investors and creditors of Wall Street firms. These statutes were some of the very

first of their kind, and influenced corporation law in other states. The scandals also led to numerous

civil suits, and the decisions in some of these cases became significant precedents, including one

which created the foundation for the shareholder derivative suit.
    1
      At this writing, most research into the causes of the crisis and proposals for regulatory reform are still quite
preliminary. But see, for example, Acharya and Richardson (2009) on “regulatory arbitrage” in the banking sector
and measures that could be adopted to reduce this. Likewise the findings of Benmelech and Dlugoz (2009) highlight
the potential role of ratings-based regulation of financial institutions in some of the practices that contributed to the
crisis.

      See, for example, Dodd (1954: 195-98), Gower (1956), and Williston (1888: 166).

       At the center of the scandal was the sudden failure in July of 1826 of six of the sixty-seven

companies whose shares were traded on the New York Stock Exchange; over the ensuing months,

another twelve NYSE firms would succumb.3 Many of the firms that failed were new financial

companies, whose shares had risen in value dramatically over 1824 and 1825. The founders of these

firms were quite aggressive in their financial practices, and rejected the conservative mode of oper-

ation of many of the older New York City banks. These men borrowed tremendous sums, acquired

firms through what would now be called hostile takeovers, and formed pyramid-like networks of

companies, whose resources they often utilized for their own benefit, rather than the other share-

holders’. In a market downturn that began in late 1825, the value of their assets fell precipitously,

and they resorted to fraudulent transactions among the companies they controlled to try to keep

them afloat. Ultimately the investors and creditors of these firms lost millions.

       Once exposed, the conduct of the managers of these firms shocked the public, and threatened

to erode confidence in the markets, and in the governance of all financial corporations. Newspaper

editorialists wrote of a “most extensive, bold, well-combined, and far reaching system of deception”

among the directors of many companies, and expressed concern that the prosperity of the city

would suffer if measures were not taken to prevent a recurrence of the scandals.4 Populist anger at

what was perceived as widespread “swindling” produced cries for criminal investigations, to punish

the “coldly calculating scoundrels” and clear away “the feculence of Wall Street.”5 The district

attorney of New York City quickly obtained a series of indictments against the directors of many of

the failed companies for conspiracy, and the subsequent trials captivated the attention of the city

for months.

       But these prosecutions were mostly unsuccessful, and the scandals of 1826 confronted the polit-

ical leadership of the State of New York with the realization that the laws and institutions in place

to protect the stockholders of corporations were no match for the practices developed by some of

the more aggressive financial firms. One might term the events of 1826 a corporate governance

crisis, and in response a consensus quickly emerged that “laws must be made that will reach such

cases.”6 In the next legislative session, the state adopted a sweeping package of legislation designed

to improve the governance of corporations by prohibiting the manipulations brought to light in the

scandals, and introduced financial reporting requirements, rules governing the election of directors

and regulations of the acceptable forms for capital contributions, and new legal responsibilities for

directors. In addition, the jurisdiction of some of the state’s courts was changed to make it easier

for aggrieved stockholders and creditors to pursue their claims, and to enable the state to enforce

its laws more effectively. In a reflection of the outrage provoked by the scandals, some of the new

measures imposed on corporate directors were quite onerous, and were later rolled back when it

became clear that they might stifle economic growth.

       This paper analyzes the failures that became the focus of the “conspiracy trials” of 1826, and

the evolution of the law in response. Using newly-collected data on the ownership structures of

New York’s publicly-traded corporations, which were matched to securities price data from NYSE

trading, I document the extent of the collapse in 1826, and analyze determinants of the failures.7 I

then trace out the evolution of the law in response to the scandals, including the statutory reforms

implemented by the state and the case law that emerged from the copious civil litigation initiated

by stockholders, and examine the relationship between these legal changes and the determinants

of the failures.

       The ownership data was collected from the reports filed pursuant to New York State’s capital

tax, which were matched to lists of corporate directors obtained from contemporary newspapers.8

The analysis of these data reveals that the directors of some NYSE firms controlled blocks of

shares in their companies that were large enough to give them a majority of the votes. But more

importantly, some of the shares voted by the directors were actually treasury shares, often purchased

by the company from their own subscriptions. These shares, coupled with the blocks of stock held

through other corporations they controlled, created an incentive problem familiar today: the control

rights of directors often substantially exceeded their true ownership stakes.9 Unaccountable to the

     The securities price data, reported as a percentage of par value, are collected in Sylla, Wilson and Wright (2005)

   8
     The capital tax of 1823-28 required all operating business corporations to submit a list of their stockholders to
the state’s comptroller, so that the revenues could be distributed to the counties where the stockholders resided.
Many of these reports survive in the New York State Archives.
   9
     See, for example, LaPorta et al (1999). The significance of this problem was observed by Berle and Means (1932),
who called it the “separation of ownership from control.”

other shareholders, these directors used their firms’ resources to make investments that benefitted

themselves, or other companies they controlled. In the data, the extent to which the directors’

control rights exceeded their ownership is strongly correlated with firm failure. And many of the

legal reforms implemented in 1827 were intended to prevent directors from creating such ownership

arrangements.

       The banking panics of the nineteenth century have been the focus of considerable scholarship.10

But there has been relatively little research into the events of 1826, which are mostly forgotten

today.11 In part, this is likely due to the fact that these events did not constitute a classic banking

crisis. Like the panic of 1907, which originated among trust companies, the crisis in 1826 began

outside the official banking sector, with insurance corporations.12 Although devastating to the

stock market, the events of 1826 did not destabilize the banking system, possibly because of the

efforts of the Second Bank of the United States to aid New York City’s banks.13 Works of financial

history have therefore generally not analyzed them in much detail.14

       The history and evolution of the law has attracted renewed interest by economists, in part

because of the relationship that has been found between the historical origins and modern perfor-

mance of legal systems across countries.15 Several recent contributions to this literature have begun

to develop a positive theory of the evolution of common law, and have analyzed the relationship

between statute law and judicial lawmaking.16 This paper compliments those works by analyzing

an important episode in the evolution and Americanization of the corporation law that prevails

here.17 As Angell and Ames noted in 1832, “the statute books of many states will show that an

  11
      Three exceptions are Riesman’s (1989) analysis of the politics of the scandals; Wright’s (1997) study of banks
and politics in New York, which provides a detailed account of one of the criminal trials that followed; and Govan’s
(1959) biography of Nicholas Biddle, which mentions some of the failures. A companion paper, Hilt (2009), describes
in detail the operations of the most prominent company that failed, Life and Fire Insurance.
   12
      On the panic of 1907, see Moen and Tallman (1992), and Odell and Weidenmeir (2004).
   13
      Although the Second Bank of the U.S. did act somewhat like a lender of last resort in this context, it did not
generally fulfill the role of a true central bank. See Temin (1969).
   14
      For example, important banking histories, such as Bodenhorn (2003), Hammond (1957) or Van Fenstermaker
(1965), mostly do not discuss these events. Likewise, histories of financial crises, such as Kindelberger (1996) and
Chancellor (2000), and histories of the Second Bank of the U.S., such as Catterall (1903) and Temin (1969), discuss
the panic of 1825 in Britain, which precipitated the crisis in the U.S., but do not discuss the events analyzed in this
paper.
   15
      For an overview of this literature, see La Porta, et al. (2008), and the references cited therein.
   16
      On the evolution of common law, see Gennaioli and Shleifer (2007). On the relationship with statute law, see
Ponzetto and Fernandez (2008), and Glaeser and Shleifer (2003).
   17
      Some British commentators would mock the “infinity of regulations for the prevention of fraud” adopted by
the American states, believing their own system of simply denying limited liability and corporate privileges to most
financial companies to be superior (McCulloch, 1836: 435). For comparative perspectives on the development of

opinion has strongly and extensively prevailed that the common law relative to commercial cor-

porations is not adequate to their proper regulation and government.”18 The events described in

this paper were responsible for some of the statutes noted by Angell and Ames, and led the courts,

through their much slower process, to innovate as well.



2     Historical context: corporation law and securities markets

In contrast to other areas of the law, the United States did not inherit a well-developed set of legal

precedents relating to business corporations from England.19 The growing use of the corporate

form in the American states led to the development of an indigenous corporation law, as courts

took up questions regarding the rights of these organizations and their stockholders and creditors,

and as the states sought to regulate the enterprises they incorporated. But the development of

corporation law was gradual, whereas the proliferation of business corporations was quite rapid.


2.1    Early New York corporation law

In the early decades of the nineteenth century, the states began to incorporate unprecedented

numbers of businesses. By the 1820s, thousands of American businesses corporations had been

created, and a small but growing number of these firms had publicly traded equity shares.20 The

growing use of the corporate form was particularly pronounced in New York, which incorporated

more business than any other state in the years up through 1830. The cumulative total of New York

incorporations over this period is illustrated in figure 1. The state went from having only one bank,

one manufacturing corporation, and no insurance corporations in 1791 to having incorporated more

than 1,000 businesses in 1830, including 150 financial companies.
the corporation generally, see, for example, North, Wallis and Weingast (2009), Gower (1956), and Lamoreaux and
Rosenthal (2005).

  19
     See, for example, Dodd (1954), Gower (1956) and Hurst (1970). Harris (2000: 117-18) notes that many funda-
mental questions relating to the rights of stockholders in corporations were not adjudicated by English courts until
the 1820s. As many have pointed out, a striking illustration of the state of English corporation law at the end of
the eighteenth century is found in Kyd’s Treatise on the Law of Corporations, which is concerned almost exclusively
with charitable and municipal corporations (Kyd 1793). Likewise Blackstone’s Commentaries includes relatively few
details on corporations (Blackstone 1791).
  20
     The total number of business incorporations in the United States for any year after 1800 is not known, but the
data in Davis (1917), Evans, (1948) and Kessler (1948) indicate that well in excess of two thousand businesses were
chartered through 1825 in the large but incomplete group of states covered by those volumes. Rousseau and Sylla
(2005) analyze the early development of American securities markets.

  “Financial firms” includes banks, insurance companies, and a very small number of loan companies. New York granted
  one business charter prior to 1790, to the Bank of North America (1782), but the bank never operated under that charter.




       These businesses quickly began to innovate in their financial practices and organization, and on

many crucial questions relating to the rights of stockholders and creditors, the law was slow to keep

pace. For example, no New York statute or reported case before the 1820s addressed the voting

rights of pledged or “hypothecated” shares, of recently transferred shares, or of treasury shares; the

question of what constitutes a quorum at shareholders or directors meetings; or voting by proxy.

And although the courts recognized that fiduciary law law applied to corporate directors, attempts

by minority shareholders to hold directors accountable for misconduct—what we now know of as

the stockholder derivative suit—had never been pursued successfully.21

       There were few statutes intended to protect stockholders or creditors.
                                                                       StudentIn Version

had been reluctant to intervene in the internal affairs of corporations, and legislation proposed to

define or protect the rights of stockholders was usually rejected.22 In this era of “special charters”
  21
     New York’s Chancellor stated that fiduciary law applied to directors in Attorney General v. Utica Insurance Co.,
2 Johns Ch. 371 (N.Y. 1817). However, as Dodd (1954: 71) notes, “no court of equity between 1800 and 1830 seems
to have had occasion to give relief against corporate directors on the ground that they had violated their fiduciary
duties.”
  22
     For example, a proposal in early 1826 to grant investors holding at least 1% of a corporation’s shares the right


                                                             6
granted to corporations, whatever legally enforceable rights were available to shareholders were

mostly those specified within the charters themselves, which varied widely across firms. There were

no general financial reporting requirements, accounting standards, or statutes regulating capital

contributions or financial practices. The state did, of course, impose some regulations on politically

sensitive industries, such as banking. But an early attempt by the attorney general to enforce a

banking statute by seeking an injunction against a corporation that flouted the law was rejected

by the chancellor, who held that the court of chancery did not have the requisite jurisdiction over

business corporations.23 Thus the few statutes in place could not be enforced with injunctions.24

    Rather than law, traditions and norms probably dictated most of the procedures that were

followed in the governance and operations of business corporations. But the 1820s saw the emer-

gence of a new generation of entrepreneurs whose aggressive financial practices departed from these

norms and traditions. These entrepreneurs’ efforts were aided by a boom in the stock market in

the middle of the decade.


2.2    The stock market boom of 1824-25

After experiencing a traumatic banking crisis in 1819, the early 1820s saw interest rates fall to

historically low levels in the United States.25 A rage for shares in new financial companies swept

over Wall Street in 1824 and 1825. The boom in New York’s securities markets was at least partially

stimulated by events in England, which experienced something of a speculative mania in the shares

of new companies in those years. In total, some 624 English companies were floated in 1824 and
to fully inspect all the books and property of that business, and to make hypothecated stock ineligible to vote, was
rejected in the New York Assembly, 60 to 26, as one legislator remarked that “it was as well to let the Wall-street
folks shave in their own way, without legislative interference.” New York Commercial Advertiser, 15 February 1826.
Hurst (1970) concludes that more legislative “attention was directed to the external than to the internal or close
relations of business corporations” (p. 48).
   23
      More precisely, the court held that it did not have visitorial jurisdiction over business corporations—that is, it
could not inquire into their conduct or act to supervise or control them in order to prevent abuses. Attorney General
v. Utica Insurance Co., 2 Johns. Ch. Rep. 371 (N.Y. 1817). An injunction is an equitable remedy, meaning that it
could only be granted by courts of equity (chancery courts); law courts did not have that power. Over the nineteenth
century, states without chancery courts granted equity jurisdiction to their law courts by statute. See, for example,
Curran (1951).
   24
      The advantage of injunctions is that they can forbid or compel specific acts—in the case of a corporation suspected
of fraud, for example, an injunction could be used to halt their operations. On equity jurisdiction over corporations,
see Pound (1936).
   25
      On the panic of 1819, see Rothbard (1956). Homer and Sylla (1996) document that yields on federal government
debt fell from 5.9% in 1819 to 4.25% in 1824.




                                                           7
1825; at the time, there were 156 joint-stock companies in existence there.26

       During those years, New York’s legislature was overwhelmed with petitions for charters of in-

corporation for financial companies. At the commencement of the 1825 legislative session, 146 such

petitions awaited the Assembly and Senate, which collectively would have created firms with a total

capital of $52 million.27 (At the time, the total capital of all operating corporations with financial

powers was less than $40 million). Although the incorporated banks in the state effectively opposed

most efforts to create new banks, the legislature did grant charters to seven new banks in 1824 and

1825. More dramatic was the number of insurance corporations created. In 1824 and 1825, New

York chartered 30 insurance companies, and another five “lombard” or loan companies. Because

they did grant the legal authority to issue banknotes, bills to incorporate insurance companies

were less politically contentious. But insurance firms did have the power to lend, and aggressive

entrepreneurs who could not obtain bank charters often sought insurance charters so that they

could operate these firms as quasi-banks.28

       Figure 2 presents these new financial incorporations in their historical context. Total annual

incorporations generally rose over time, accelerating in the years of the War of 1812, and briefly

collapsing in the years after the Panic of 1819. The annual number of financial incorporations

increased following the expiration of the charter of the Bank of the United States in 1811, and

then accelerated in the 1820s, in spite of efforts to curtail the rate at which these corporations were

created.29 The years 1824 and 1825 saw an unprecedented surge in financial incorporations. This

was due both to the increase in demand for charters, but also to a political shift in the legislature,

which became somewhat more willing to grant financial charters.30 As a result of the scandals that
  26
      See English (1827: 31). A booming market for Latin American debt securities in London preceded this surge in
the market for shares in English companies; see Dawson (1990). The British speculative mania of 1825 is analyzed
in great detail by Hunt (1936). On the role of the Bank of England, see Neal (1998).
   27
      Shipping and Commercial List, 2 February 1825.
   28
      At the time, there was no government-issued paper money, and the issuance of banknotes was a lucrative practice
by banks. On the politics of bank chartering, see Bodenhorn (2006), Hammond (1957), and Wright (1997). Hilt (2009)
presents the history of the efforts to use insurance charters to circumvent New York’s banking laws.
   29
      Article 7, section 9 of the New York Constitution of 1821 imposed the requirement of a two-thirds majority
for grants of charters. Kent (1826) laments that this measure “failed to mitigate the evil” of the proliferation of
corporations, among which financial corporations were the most controversial. Incorporation in manufacturing was
facilitated by the state’s 1811 general incorporation act for manufacturing companies. On the use of this act, see
Kessler (1940).

      The “People’s Party,” whose backers included many businessmen hoping for corporate charters, won many seats
from the Albany Regency (the dominant faction of the New York Republican Party) in 1824. See Hanyan (1996).
Opponents of the People’s Party claimed that it sent “a body of men unaccustomed to legislation, and filled with
crude and speculative schemes” into office after winning the election of 1824 (New-York Enquirer, 6 November 1826).

followed, 1826 and 1827 saw a collapse in financial incorporations.

       The first half of 1825 saw the peak of the mania, and the subscription books for new financial

companies were opened to overwhelming responses.31 The demand for new issues was so intense

that riots broke out in front of subscription offices, as investors scrambled to add their names.32

Noting the credulous attitudes of investors toward the new companies, Niles’ Register observed,

“it is strange that no sort of madness can break out in England, without affecting us in the United

States. ... Now we have it in stock companies. There will be a smash—equal to that caused by the

blowing up of the banks some time ago.”33 The predicted “smash” did indeed arrive, later that

year.

monetary contraction, and in December, several private banks failed, triggering a general collapse

in English share prices, and ultimately a deep financial crisis.34 With many American merchants

and banks, especially those in New York, maintaining close financial ties to their counterparts in

Britain, the panic there created tighter monetary conditions here in late 1825 and early 1826. A

related mechanism which triggered the crisis in England and New York was a collapse in cotton

prices. A rapid increase in the price of this commodity—America’s largest export—in late 1824

was followed by a collapse in mid-1825, causing financial ruin among many merchants who lent to

finance the cotton trade.35

       There was no generalized banking crisis in the United States, however, at least in part because

the Second Bank of the United States worked assiduously with its New York branch to provide

credit to the banking community there.36 Although some small country banks in upstate New

York, New Jersey, and Connecticut either failed or suspended payment on their notes in late 1825,

in general New York’s banking system withstood the pressures of that year reasonably well.37 The

tighter financial conditions in New York did, however, end the period of “wild and exaggerated

speculation” in New York’s financial markets, which had further repercussions.38

       Figure 3 illustrates the total market value of the equity of New York corporations traded on

the New York Stock Exchange from 1817, the year it was officially organized, through 1830. The

upper panel of the figure shows that total market values increased dramatically from early 1824

up until it reached a peak in mid-1825, rising 60% over this period. This increase in value was

driven almost entirely by the addition of new companies to the market, and the rising value of those
  34
     At the time, the Bank of England did not function as a true central bank, and it effected this contraction out
of concerns over its falling gold reserves, and with little regard for the consequences for the British financial system.
See Neal (1998).
  35
     The price of upland cotton in New York rose from around $0.15/lb. in late 1824 to around $0.25/lb. in mid-1825,
and subsequently collapsed to about $0.15/lb. again by early 1826 (data in Cole, 1938). One of the directors of the
New York branch of the Bank of the United States noted, “many ... are brought to the verge of ruin by the purchase
of bills drawn by Cotton shippers” (Robert Lenox to Nicholas Biddle, 9 November 1825, Nicholas Biddle Papers).
  36
     The correspondence between Nicholas Biddle, President of the SBUS, and Robert Lenox, throughout 1825 reveals
that Biddle monitored financial conditions in New York quite carefully, and in response to the pressure from Britain
shifted resources to the New York branch, and increased the bank’s loans in that city. See, for example, correspondence
with Lenox on 7, 8, and 23 December, 1825 (Nicholas Biddle Papers, Library of Congress Microfilm). Biddle
maintained later that his actions saved the nation from serious losses; see Catterall (1903). The New York American
commended the Bank of the U.S. for its conduct during the crisis (27 October 1826). However, as Temin (1969)
argues, the Second Bank of the U.S. in general did not perform the role of a true central bank, because its efforts to
discipline the note issuance of state banks limited its ability to increase the supply of liquid assets in crises.

The figure then shows a consistent fall in market values that continued through 1829. The lower

part of the figure illustrates the importance of newly-listed companies, and in particular insurance

companies, for both the upward and downward movements in the market. The increase in the

number of insurance companies accounted for about two-thirds of the total increase in traded

stocks from 1824 through 1825. Then over the subsequent years, the number of traded stocks fell

again, and much of this decline was driven by the disappearance of insurance firms.

         Most of the firms that stopped trading were liquidated after suffering heavy losses. In some

cases, particularly for firms with large amounts of liquid liabilities, their failures occurred quite

quickly, and their shares abruptly halted trading. In other cases, firms continued to operate for

some time, and as investors learned of the true condition of their finances, their shares fell in value.

Appendix table A1 (at the end of the paper) lists the New York companies whose shares were

traded on the NYSE at the time, and identifies the firms that failed.



3         The finances and failures of the new firms

Some of the men who founded the new financial companies of the 1820s were wealthy and politically

prominent merchants, but others were stock brokers or speculators, including some of “doubtful

means.”40 Together, they represented a new generation of financiers, and they broke with estab-

lished practices in the financing of their companies.


3.1        Innovations in financial practice

When a new financial company was formed, it was accepted practice for stockholders to borrow

some portion of the value of their subscriptions from the company after the shares were paid in.

These loans were known as “stock notes,” and were relatively common among banks and insurance

companies.41 The men who founded the new financial companies of the 1820s exploited this form of

     New York American, 14 August 1826. Among the wealthy merchants were Henry Eckford and Alfred Pell, who
were taxed at $100,000 or above in 1828, placing them among the sixty wealthiest people in New York City at the
time. (Tax data from Pessen, 1973). Eckford and Pell were leading members of one faction of New York’s Republican
party, and Pell won election to the State Assembly (Hanyan 1996). But neither was ever influential enough to obtain
bank charters.
  41
     Hammond (1957) describes this practice among early banks, and notes that even the federal government’s in-
vestment in the Bank of the United States was lent back in this way (p. 123). See also Bodenhorn (2003), Knodell


                                                        12
lending to acquire and maintain total control over their firms. They would subscribe to a majority

of the shares, and pay for them with loans from other institutions.42 At the first shareholders’

meeting, they would then vote themselves into office as directors. This would give them control

over the firm’s resources, and once in office they would simply lend themselves back the amount

of their investment, and repay the initial loan.43 Critics of these firms would later argue that this

was an era of banking on stock notes, rather than sound capital.44 In some cases, these stock

notes were ultimately cancelled by returning the shares to the company. But the directors typically

then placed the shares in a trust for the company and named themselves or their allies trustees, or

held them in the name of the president of the company. In either case, they continued to vote the

shares.45

    Once they commenced operations, many of the new firms functioned as quasi-banks. Indeed,

some were founded simply to enable merchants who could not obtain a bank charter to enter the

lucrative banking industry. Several of the new insurance corporations made short-term loans by

issuing securities that were similar to banknotes, known at the time as “bonds.”46 Some of the

insurance companies created in 1824 and 1825 issued large amounts of these instruments to finance

loans to speculators, and were unable to redeem them when the stock market collapsed and their

loans became worthless. In this sense, the collapse of some of these firms follows the familiar pattern

of banking crises, where excessive issuance of notes by undercapitalized institutions ultimately lead

to failure.

    But the conduct of the directors of the new financial companies was innovative and perhaps even

unprecedented in other respects. Securities trading on Wall Street had become quite sophisticated,
(2006), and Lamoreaux (1994).
  42
     In the context of a booming market for these securities, the price of the shares would be expected to rise above
the (par) value that was paid for them, so loans of this kind could be readily obtained.
  43
     An example of this practice, as utilized by the directors of the Mohawk Insurance Company at its founding in
1824, is described in detail in Nathan v. Whitlock, 9 Paige 152 (N.Y. 1841). Testimony at the criminal trial of the
directors of the U.S. Lombard Association, as reported in the Evening Post, 22 December 1826, indicated that similar
practices were followed in the founding of that firm.
  44
     Flagg (1868: 4). Allegations of banking on “fictitious capital” were nothing new; Thomas Jefferson had written
that “three fourths” of the capital of the banks was fictitious at the time of the panic of 1819 (Letter to Richard
Rush, 22 June 1819, in Ford (ed.) (1905). The uses to which these financing techniques were put in the 1820s is what
made those years different.
  45
     Voting such shares was later held to be illegal (Ex parte Holmes 5 Cow 426 (NY Sup. Ct. 1826)), but this
practice seems to have been common nonetheless.
  46
     These instruments are best characterized as post notes, and unlike banknotes, which were payable on demand
in specie, they were payable to order at some future date. Hilt (2009) analyzes the use of these instruments, and
presents a description of the transactions by which they were issued. The history of the post note is described in
Redlich (1944).


                                                         13
and these brokers and merchants used the ample credit available in securities markets to purchase

large blocks of stock in firms, often resulting in bitter contests for control.47 Critics of these

men bemoaned what they saw as the takeover of financial firms by speculators: “sundry stock

brokers...backed by their wealthy friends, have long itched to get the ascendancy over our moneyed

institutions; and having selected the company in question, commenced putting the “screws” to

the directors.”48 Once they held a majority of the shares in a corporation, they would vote for

themselves, along with men who could be trusted not to interfere with their plans, as directors.

And once control over a corporation’s resources was obtained, it could then be used as collateral

to borrow in order to finance additional acquisitions.49 Through such transactions, groups of

speculators were able to obtain control, or at least significant influence, in relatively large numbers

of corporations.

       Figure 4 depicts the holdings of four prominent investors, and the companies they controlled.50

With large or majority stakes ensuring that their control would be difficult or impossible to contest,

these men utilized the firms’ resources for their own benefit, and “sacrificed the interest and property

of the [other] stockholders.”51 Consider their acquisition of the stake in City Bank, one of the largest

banks in New York City. In this audacious transaction, they purchased 16,000 (64%) of City Bank’s

shares, using $80,000 of N.Y. Coal’s assets as payment, which amounted to 10% of the par value

of the shares purchased. They borrowed the remaining amount, approximately $760,000, with the

City Bank shares as collateral. The City Bank shares, and the debt for the the balance of the cost

of the purchase, stood on the books of New York Coal. But since they controlled the majority of

the shares of New York Coal, three of them voted themselves directors of City Bank. In late 1825

and early 1826, the price of City Bank stock began to fall, and the shares eventually had to be sold
  47
     Two such cases produced significant litigation, because the incumbent directors used illegal tactics to disqualify
the shares held by the speculators from voting. One such case involved the North River Bank of New York City
(People ex rel. Barker v. Kip, 4 Cow. 382 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1822)), and the other involved Frankin Insurance (People
ex rel. Israel v. Tibbets, 4 Cow. 358 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1825)). On trading in securities markets in the early-nineteenth
century, see Werner and Smith (1991), Banner (1998), and Wright (2002).
  48
     New-York National Advocate, 22 January 1825. The editor of this paper, Mordecai M. Noah, labelled one group
of speculators the “Screw Party,” for putting the screws on directors in this way.
  49
     These transactions resembled the process of acquisitions that would later be used to create “chain banking”
structures in the early twentieth century. See, for example, Bruner and Carr (2007) and Tallman and Moen (1990).
This is also quite similar to the “double gearing” between Japanese banks and insurance companies described by
Hoshi and Kayshap (2004:16), wherein banks raise capital by selling securities to insurance companies, but then use
the capital to buy securities from insurance companies, producing an increase in reported capital for both firms.

to repay the loan. The stockholders of New York Coal lost about $50,000 on the transaction.52

       The controlling investors also moved assets among their various companies to suit their needs, in

exchanges that were often hostile to the interests of the other stockholders of the firms. For example,

beginning in late 1825, when a severe contraction in credit markets began, Jersey Bank’s finances

came under pressure. In an effort to keep this firm afloat, the controlling investors exchanged some

of the assets of their healthier companies for assets of Jersey Bank that were of dubious value.

They exchanged $40,000 worth of the assets of the Steam Saw Mill Association for shares of stock

owned by the Jersey Bank, “for the purpose of sustaining Jersey Bank and its credit.”53 In the

exchange, the shares of stock were valued at par, when their market prices were far below that.

       Other groups of investors formed networks of stakes in corporations similar to the one depicted

in figure 4, including some with larger numbers of firms.54 Critics and political opponents of

     Stock ownership records and contemporary accounts by journalists indicate that Henry Eckford and a few other

1826.

these men feared the power that could be wielded through control of large numbers of financial

institutions, and suspected an attempt to take over the Second Bank of the United States was

planned.55 But the pressures of the collapse in the market in late 1825 and early 1826 ultimately

proved insurmountable for these investors. In some cases, extraordinarily complex transactions

among multiple companies were conducted in order to come to the aid of failing corporations

within these investors’ ownership networks.56 Journalists would later comment on the “endless

shifting of patches, to cover defects and supply deficiencies.”57

       Well before these companies actually failed, rumors of fraud among some financial financial

firms spread on Wall Street. Some investors demanded to have the books of the companies that

were the subject of the rumors exhibited publicly. But the directors of these firms, who included

several wealthy and respected men, simply denounced the rumors as baseless and attacked the

credibility of the men responsible for spreading them.58 The charters of most of these firms did not

obligate the directors to produce financial statements, and no other law required them to do so, so

they simply refused. Some of these directors offered assurances of the strong and improving state

of their companies’ finances, in some cases until days just prior to their failure.59

       The month of July of 1826 saw a sudden rash of failures; Appendix table A2 presents a timeline

of the events of that month. The proximate cause of these collapses was a series of runs on the three

banks at the center of some of the networks of companies, as depositors panicked over revelations

about the financial ties between these banks and other institutions.60 Once these banks stopped

payment, the most vulnerable of the other companies failed in scenes that involved crowds of

     A character in the anonymous satirical play, Wall-Street As It Now Is (1826), describes a plan to get control of
“the nation’s bank, the nation’s mint and then the nation’s treasury.” Nicholas Biddle, president of the Bank of the
United States, made inquiries into the potential threat to control of the bank, although he ultimately concluded “I
do not think that the Bank has anything to apprehend” (14 July 1826, Nicholas Biddle Papers, Library of Congress
Microfilm). See also Govan (1959).

     Hilt (2009) describes a transaction in May 1826 in which the directors of Life and Fire Insurance issued an
enormous bond, which was used to purchase newly-issued shares in Morris Canal Bank, which in turn were used to
purchase a block of stock in Fulton Bank, which was given to the President of Mechanic’s Insurance and ultimately
sold, in order to try to save Life and Fire Insurance.

     For example, the July 11 issue of the New-York Enquirer states that one prominent firm, Life and Fire Insurance,
had “reduced considerably” its indebtedness. This firm failed exactly seven days later. Testimony in some of the
subsequent criminal trials described many public assurances of the soundness of the finances of the companies; see,
for example, Barker (1827).
  60
     The New-York Enquirer, 7 July, 1826, published a detailed description of the transaction that enabled a group of
speculators to control a significant block of stock in the Fulton Bank; on July 8 there was a run on that bank. Then
on July 17 the shareholders of the Tradesmen’s bank obtained an injunction against the management of that firm;
panic quickly ensued among the depositors.

panicked investors and creditors, and some “violent struggles” at the headquarters of the firms.61

In total, these firms had more than $2 million in outstanding “bonds.” Over the following months,

many other companies controlled by these investors failed or were shut down. Some managed to

continue to operate well into 1828 before ultimately going under; in some cases, the extent of the

companies’ losses was concealed from investors for some time.62 Eventually a total of 18 NYSE

companies would fail or be shut down in 1826-29; a number of other companies whose shares were

not traded on the exchange were also touched by these events, but their fates are more difficult to

ascertain.


3.2      Determinants of the failures

As most of the firms were never required to produce regular financial statements, and few of their

accounting ledgers survive, it is impossible to systematically evaluate the practices that led to the

failures, except in the few cases where detailed records survive from criminal trials or shareholder

suits. It is possible, however, to investigate the deeper causes of the failures through an analysis of

the ownership structures of the firms.

       Lists of the stockholders and directors for the year 1826 for 38 of the 67 New York corporations

whose shares were traded on the NYSE were found.63 For the remaining 29 firms, no stockholder

list survives in the New York State Archives.64 It should be noted that the stockholder lists simply

identify the names under which the shares were held, and may not accurately reflect the shares

actually controlled by particular individuals. If investors were able to vote the shares of, say, family

members or close associates, the data tabulated below would understate the extent of their control.

In addition, I have assumed that any shares owned by a partnership, trust or corporation in which

an investor was a partner, trustee or director would be voted by that investor. If these shares were

  62
      This was the case, for example, with the Franklin Bank, which failed in 1828. See Bartow (1831).
   63
      Lists of stockholders were submitted by all New York corporations to the state comptroller pursuant to the state’s
capital tax of 1823-28. These were found in various record groups in the New York State Archives associated with
the comptroller’s office, including A0833, A0829, and A0847. The lists of directors were found by searching New York
City newspapers from the year 1826 including the New York Evening Post, New York Enquirer, New York American,
Journal of Commerce, and the Commercial Advertiser. These were supplemented with lists of directors found in the
minute books of corporations held a the following institutions: Citigroup Archives, New York NY; SUNY Albany
Library, Albany NY; and the New-York Historical Society, New York NY. A very small number of these stockholder
lists are from years close to 1826.
   64
      From the comptroller’s records and publications, it is clear that all of the 67 firms submitted ownership lists to
the state. The State of New York has not been a good custodian of its early records at times, and many important
materials have been lost or destroyed.

not actually voted, then the data would overstate the extent of their control. The ownership data

were then matched to characteristics of the firms, obtained from the charters.

   Table A3 in the Appendix compares the characteristics of the corporations for which an owner-

ship list could be found with those that could not. The two groups of firms failed at about the same

rate, and a similar proportion of each group was chartered in 1824-25. However, the firms where

an ownership list could be found were much more likely to be in the insurance industry and had

smaller capitals—essentially, no list could be found for several of New York’s very large banks. The

analysis that follows will therefore focus on within-industry comparisons and will control for the

size of firms’ capital stock. However, the validity of the inferences made from the sample depends

on the degree to which the included firms are representative of the other firms in their industries,

something which is difficult to assess.

   Summary statistics for the ownership structures and firm characteristics are presented in table

1. The mean number of owners was just under 150, and 84% of the shares were owned by residents

of New York City. This is consistent with a fair measure of financial development; NYSE firms

had clearly attracted the participation of relatively large numbers of individuals by this time. The

mean proportion of shares under the control of the directors was relatively high, about 39%, with

22% held in the directors’ own names, 9% held by other corporations on whose boards the directors

also served, and 8% held in trusts or in the name of the directors on behalf of the firm. The latter

category is particularly important, because shares held in this way were not actually the property

of the directors, and therefore increased their margins of control with no corresponding increase in

their ownership. Moreover, these shares were often transferred to the company from the directors

in order to cancel a loan for the original subscription. These holdings therefore also represented a

reduction in the capital of the firm.

   Table 2 compares the characteristics of the firms that failed to those that did not fail, and

illustrates some dramatic contrasts between the two groups of firms. The directors of the firms

that failed controlled 62% of the shares of their companies, exactly twice the proportion controlled

by the surviving firms. With control of a majority of the votes, the management of the firms

that failed was virtually unaccountable to the other stockholders. Moreover, in each of the sub-

categories of ownership, the directors of the failed companies controlled larger proportions of the

shares compared to the companies that survived. The larger stakes held via other corporations

likely indicates that the failed companies were more likely to have become part of a network of

firms controlled by a group of investors. To the extent that these investors’ ownership in the

corporations holding the shares was not total, these stakes created an increase in the directors

control rights relative to their ownership.65 Finally, the proportion in the shares held in trust was

also dramatically larger among the firms that failed.

    The firms that failed were more likely to have been chartered in 1824 or 1825, and had smaller

capitalizations. This may explain some part of their high ownership concentration; one would expect

that larger firms would have less concentrated ownership, and that share ownership would diffuse

over time. The firms that failed were not, however, any more likely to be insurance corporations

than those that survived.

    These correlations are investigated further in regressions presented in table 3. These regressions

analyze the determinants of a binary indicator of firm failure, and are estimated as linear probability

models. Most of the specifications include industry fixed effects, and thus analyze the variation

within industries.66 All of the results in the table are consistent with the notion that the greater

      A simple model of such ownership stakes and the distinction they create between control rights and cash-flow

      The three included industry categories are insurance, banks and loan companies—small banks forbidden from

the proportion of shares under the control of the directors, the higher the probability of firm failure.

The first two columns present estimates of the effect of the total proportion of shares controlled

by management, with and without industry fixed effects. The estimate in column one indicates

that a one-standard-deviation increase in this variable increased the likelihood of failure by 28%,

an amount similar to the mean failure rate. Columns three and four estimate the effect of the three

categories of managerial ownership separately. All three have positive effects on the probability of

firm failure, but the magnitude of the coefficient on shares held in trust is twice as large as those

of the other two types of shares, and is highly statistically significant. The estimates imply that a

one-standard-deviation increase in shares held in trust was associated with a 30% increase in the

likelihood of failure.

    Taken together, these results imply that the key to understanding the failures that began in

1826 is the ownership structures of the firms. The directors of many of the failed companies

held dictatorial power over the other investors, through the control of large blocks of stock. This

control enabled them to use the resources of their firms for their own purposes, and in ways that

imperiled the solvency of the firms. In the worst cases, they reduced their ownership in their firms

by returning their shares to the companies, while preserving their control over the firms’ operations

by continuing to vote the shares.



4     Impact on the law

The scandals of 1826 had a profound impact on New York’s politics. In his annual message to

the New York Assembly in January 1827, Governor DeWitt Clinton discussed the “late alarming

commercial convulsions,” and concluded that they “inculcate the necessity of avoiding a recur-

rence...by avoiding the causes which produced them.” In addition to admonishing the legislature to

show more “circumspection” when presented with petitions for incorporations with financial priv-

ileges, he argued that “general regulations are indispensably necessary” for financial companies.

Among the measures he proposed were standards for the capital, financial statements, and liabil-

ities of financial institutions, and also regulations for “compelling the attendance and increasing
issuing notes. The final category is utilities. See table A1 in the Appendix for a list of all the companies that were
traded on the NYSE.




                                                         21
the responsibility of directors” in these firms.67 Later that year, the legislature enacted a sweep-

ing package of legislation that followed this broad outline. And indeed, no charters for financial

companies were granted in the 1827 session.

       But outside the state government, the scandals were greeted with outrage, and the public

responded with calls for measures far harsher than mere financial regulations. Opponents of corpo-

rations in general, and of incorporated banks in particular, seized on the scandals in their rhetoric.68

Newspapers printed expressions of distrust in the governance of financial companies, such as this:


         Formerly the directors of a bank knew no other duty than to facilitate the business
         transactions of the city...They were stockholders and the servants of stockholders, and
         they were responsible to them. Now a-days, it would seem the object in getting up a
         bank, is to swindle the public.69

The possibility that these “swindlers” might escape any serious legal consequences, and would be

protected by limited liability, provoked considerable rancor. For some, the very fairness of American

society was called into question. As Niles’ Register wrote,


         If a negro steals a pair of shoes, away he must go to hard labor and solitary confinement—
         but if a gentleman violates his honor and oath, and boldly plunges into the vault of a
         bank or otherwise steals and carries off 50 or 100,000 dollars belonging to widows and
         orphans—he rides in a coach and eats and drinks of the best, and keeps “the best”
         company. There is a great deal in being a rogue of distinction! When will these folks
         be treated as they deserve? and swindling bankers and bank robbers meet the fate of
         their humble, but comparatively innocent imitators, the counterfeiters of bank notes or
         makers of base coin, and the pirates of Cuba?70

There were widespread calls for criminal investigations of the directors of the failed firms.71 And

the public’s outrage likely drove the legislature to enact regulations of a more punitive nature than

they otherwise would have.

      For example, James K. Paulding’s influential pamphlet Letter on the Use and Abuse of Incorporations, Addressed
to the Delegation from the City of New York (1827), published anonymously, describes the “vile deception” of the
city’s financial companies (p. 38). Likewise Thomas Cooper’s (1826) anti-corporate treatise on political economy
cites legislative proposals from New York in 1825 intended to regulate abuses in financial companies. Gouge’s (1835)
well-known treatise advocating for a “hard money” system also discussed these scandals at length. On anti-corporate
agitation in early America, see, for example, Maier (1993).

4.1      Criminal trials

In July of 1826, Hugh Maxwell, the district attorney of New York City, began to examine the pa-

pers of the failed companies, and in August and September he obtained bills of indictment against

a number of their directors. Lacking any better alternative, Maxwell charged the defendants with

conspiracy.72 The common-law concept of conspiracy is extremely vague and expansive, and was

often used in England to suppress political dissent. This made conspiracy charges a particularly

powerful instrument for prosecutors, but these charges also risked at least the appearance of un-

fairness to the defendant in the eyes of some judges.73 Appendix table A3 lists the indictments

obtained by the District Attorney, and summarizes the outcome of the trials.

       Trials were held beginning in September. The District Attorney began the with the most spec-

tacular case, that of Henry Eckford and seven other defendants, who were charged with conspiring

to defraud five different corporations. This trial commenced in September 1826, and continued

through October. The District Attorney’s opening statement to the packed courtroom accused the

defendants of using an extraordinarily complex series of transactions to “divert from their proper

objects the funds of the stockholders, ...[and] to employ those funds for the private uses of those

who managed the concerns.”74 The defendants were represented by twelve attorneys, including

some of the most “eminent lawyers of the age,” who raised numerous objections to the evidence

presented by the prosecution, and to the charges in the indictment.75 The dramatic testimony

and erudite legal argumentation of the twenty-five day trial captivated the city; New York’s most

prominent newspapers all printed daily accounts of the proceedings.76 Newspapers throughout the

United States printed accounts of the trial.77

       The accounts of the affairs of the companies that were presented at the trial included stunning
  72
     The indictments charged that the defendants “did conspire, confederate, and agree...by wrongful and indirect
means, to cheat and defraud” their companies (Indictment files, New York Municipal Archives, New York NY).

conspiracy.

Court of Oyer and Terminer, which functioned as a criminal court with Supreme Court justices presiding.

of the presiding judge that the content of testimony given should not be published until the trials’ completion.
  77
     For example, in October, 1826, articles describing the criminal trials were printed in such papers as the Baltimore
Patriot, Boston Commercial Gazette, Macon Telegraph, Louisiana Advertiser, the Richmond Constitutional Way,
New Hampshire Sentinel, and Vermont Gazette, among many others.

revelations, of profligate lending to finance speculative investments; of companies being kept afloat

through the fraudulent sale of securities; of absentee directors who had never bothered to inquire

about the affairs of their firms, while other directors plundered their assets; of extraordinarily

complex exchanges of securities among large numbers of companies; and of managers who had not

bothered to keep up their firms’ books.78 These defendants were tried three times, and in the end

some of them were found guilty.79 A few of the other indictments were also brought to trial, and

those produced some guilty verdicts as well.

       But one of these verdicts was successfully appealed to the state’s highest court.80 In the end,

the court felt that the indictment was so vague that it violated the principle that “every man is

entitled to a specification of the charge against him.”81 Effectively, the court rejected common-law

precedent for the appropriate standard for a conspiracy charge.82 This overturned the convictions

that had been obtained, and shut down all prosecutions of these cases.


4.2      Regulations of Financial Companies

The process of reforming the law actually began somewhat before the scandals of 1826, as legislators

learned about some of the financial practices of companies on Wall Street. In mid-1825, legislation

was passed “to prevent fraudulent bankruptcies” by prohibiting payments for stock subscriptions

in the form of notes, and making it “the duty” of the supreme court to act quickly when presented

with a complaint about unfair practices in corporate elections.83 This law may have had some

effect on the behavior of corporate directors, but after the crisis in 1826, it was perceived to be

totally inadequate.
  78
     Much of the testimony is reproduced in Barker (1827).
  79
     The first trial ended in a hung jury. This was followed by a second trial, in which the defendants were found
guilty, but the verdict was overturned on appeal, on the basis that some of the jurors were prejudiced against the
defendants by the first trial. Finally, a third trial was held, beginning in June of 1827, in which one of the defendants
was tried separately and found guilty.
  80
     This was the Court for the Trial of Impeachments and Correction of Errors. The members of this court include the
Supreme Court justices, the Chancellor, and the members of the Senate—and since many of the attorneys representing
the defendants in the conspiracy trials were sitting members of the Senate, they were able to vote on the case.
  81
     Lambert v. The People, 9 Cowen 578 (N.Y. Corr. Err. 1827). The indictments contained no “bill of particulars,”
and the prosecutors simply described the transactions of the managers of the firms, without specifically naming the
acts that constituted the conspiracy.
  82
     A dissenting opinion, written by Charles Stebbins, offers an impassioned and detailed (and nearly 50-page)
argument that the indictment was sufficient according to the standards of the common law, and in his conclusion,
he stated “The common law of England is the law of this land...whatever may be our opinions as to what the law
should be, ours is a single duty to administer it...” (p. 82).
  83
     The act also limited corporations’ indebtedness to three times their capital stock, and prohibited dividends from
being paid except out of firms’ profits (New York Laws, 1825, ch. 325).


                                                           24
    In 1827, the legislature approved the Revised Statutes of 1828, which contained major changes

to many areas of the law, and in particular added significant new legislation relative to corporate

governance. The Revised Statutes represented the outcome of an effort to organize and partially

codify the state’s laws, which had begun a few years earlier. But the contents of the final product,

which was the first-ever such partial codification in any common-law jurisdiction, and was enor-

mously influential in other states, contained several provisions that were written in response to the

events of 1826.84

    The Revised Statutes contain a number of regulations of financial companies and their directors

that were designed to protect the interests of the stockholders and creditors these firms.85 Many

of these regulations specifically prohibited the manipulations and exchanges utilized by the brokers

and speculators whose networks of companies had collapsed. For example, the first nine sections

of the title on financial corporations prohibit: exchanges of capital or securities between corpo-

rations; payments of installments on stock subscriptions in the form of securities; purchases of a

corporation’s own stock, except when using profits from operations; acceptance of a corporation’s

own stock as payment for debts; loans to stockholders enabling them to withdraw money paid in;

or loans to directors equivalent to more than one third of the capital stock. They also mandated

that any transfer or assignment of a corporation’s property of $1,000 or more could only be made

according to a resolution of the entire board. The next sections provide for powerful enforcement

mechanisms for these provisions: they stipulate criminal penalties for any violation, and make the

directors personally liable from any losses that result from violations.

    The new statutes also prohibited the holder of hypothecated shares (shares pledged as collateral

for a loan) from voting in corporate elections, and prohibited anyone from voting shares belonging to

the company or held in trust for the company. The statutes also required all financial corporations

to transmit annual financial statements to the comptroller, and included a detailed description of

the content of those statements.

    Other provisions held that every corporate insolvency was to be presumed to be fraudulent,

placing the burden of proof on directors and stockholders to defeat the presumption of fraud. It
  84
     On the process of revising the laws, and the innovations produced in New York’s Revised Statutes, see Cook
(1981), Butler (1889), and Driscoll (1987).
  85
     What follows is a discussion of Part I, Chapter 18, Title 2, Articles 1-3 of the Revised Statutes. For a lucid
summary of the provisions of the Revised Statutes, see Spencer (1830a, 1830b).



                                                        25
made the directors, and then the other stockholders, personally liable for any losses in fraudulent

bankruptcies, with the total liability not to exceed the nominal amount of the shares (thus imposing

double liability). Unsurprisingly, this provision was regarded as draconian, and as one observer

noted, “responsible parties were indisposed to become directors of moneyed incorporations subject

to such a code of laws.”86

       Once the Revised Statutes took effect, in 1828, any financial corporation chartered (or having

its charter renewed) after that date was to be subject to those provisions.87 In 1828 and 1829, a

number of insurance companies were created or had their charters renewed, making them subject

to the Revised Statutes. However, no bank charters were granted or renewed in 1828.

       Many of the existing banks’ charters were set to expire in the years 1829-1833, and the directors

of these firms hoped to avoid becoming subject to the Revised Statutes. Leading bankers recognized

the benefits of somewhat stronger regulation, but regarded the terms of these statutes, in particular

the presumption of fraud in all bankruptcies, as “severities.”88 The cashier of the state’s largest

bank, the Bank of America, argued that all that was necessary was to regulate capital contributions,

and ensure that the entire capital of banks was paid-in and not withdrawn.89 In order to advance

their efforts to exempt their institutions from any punitive regulations, the state’s banks aided

the electoral campaigns of candidates favorable to their interests, and offered to fund popular

infrastructure projects.90

       Ultimately, in 1829 the state enacted a completely new banking law—the safety fund law,

which created a coinsurance system among its member banks, and an administrative office to

oversee and inspect them.91 The safety fund law provided that any bank chartered according to its

provisions would be exempt from the terms of the Revised Statutes that created the presumption
  86
      Cleaveland (1857, p. xli).
  87
      Corporate charters were regarded as contracts, so the state did not have the power to modify their terms, and
the imposition of these new regulations might be seen as the abrogation of the terms of the charters.

offered to purchase $25,000 of the shares of the Long Island Canal Company, and loan the company $45,000 on
generous terms, in exchange for renewal of their charter without restrictions (Assembly Documents, 1827, no. 11).

that insolvencies were fraudulent, and that stipulated personal liability for stockholders in the case

of any fraudulent bankruptcy. In 1830, the state repealed these terms for all firms (not just those

banks created under the safety fund).92 However, the safety fund banks were made subject to all

of the other terms of the Revised Statutes, as were all other subsequent financial incorporations.


4.3    Changes to the Jurisdiction of the Courts

The Revised Statutes also introduced an important change in the jurisdiction of New York’s courts,

which granted stockholders and creditors, and also the state, a powerful means of pursuing claims

against corporations. In response to a petition from the attorney general with credible evidence

that a corporation was conducting transactions or businesses not authorized by its charter, the

court of chancery was given the power to issue an injunction to halt the operations of the firm,

and inspect its books, remove directors, and compel directors who had misappropriated funds to

repay them.93 And for financial companies, the powers granted to the court were even broader. If

stockholders, creditors, or the attorney general petitioned the court with evidence that a financial

firm was acting in violation of any law, or was insolvent, the court of chancery was given the power

halt the firm’s operations by injunction, and to appoint a receiver to seize control of the firm’s

assets, collect all debts due to the firm, and facilitate a “just and fair distribution of the property of

the corporation.”94 The receiver was also empowered to enforce the personal liability of directors

in cases of fraud.

    These provisions were interpreted by the courts as having been enacted “owing to the refusal

of the court [of chancery] to intervene” in prior cases.95 Many of the terms of the provisions were

intended specifically to apply to circumstances like the ones that arose with the financial companies

that failed.
  92
     The repeal was not retroactive; the insurance companies chartered between 1828 and mid-1830 continued to be
subject to those terms, and the safety fund banks chartered prior to mid-1830 were subject to the criminal penalty
provisions. New York Laws, 1830, ch. 71.
  93
     The chancellor was thus given what is called “visitatorial jurisdiction” over corporations, overturning an earlier
New York precedent that it had no such jurisdiction (Attorney General v. Utica Insurance Co., 2 Johns. Ch. Rep.
371 (N.Y. 1817)). Revised Statutes, Part III, Chapter 8, Title 4, Section 31-35. Pound (1936) analyzes this statute

4.4      Shareholder litigation and the derivative suit

For the shareholders and creditors of the companies that failed, the jurisdictional changes to the

court of chancery enacted by the Revised Statutes in 1828 came too late. Those measures were

intended to empower the investors or creditors of a mismanaged corporation (or the attorney

general, acting on their behalf) to use the courts to quickly shut down its operations, and recover

as much as possible from its assets. But many firms had already suffered tremendous losses and

failed by that time. And the provisions of the Revised Statutes that created the presumption of

fraud, and personal liability for directors, did not apply to those firms.

       The stockholders and creditors pursued their claims beginning in 1826, without the benefit

of the Revised Statutes. As might be expected from the failure of so many companies in such

complex circumstances, an enormous amount of litigation was initiated—one judge remarked that

“innumerable cases of frauds upon creditors, and many innocent and unsuspecting stockholders of

incorporated companies” were brought before the courts.96 Most of the litigation occurred within

the chancery courts, which had jurisdiction over bankrupt corporations. The volume of suits put

tremendous strain on the state’s court system, and complaints about delays became common.97

       In some of this litigation, the stockholders of the failed companies asserted the right to sue

the directors for breach of fiduciary trust. The significance of the investors’ legal strategy is that

in the doctrine of fiduciary trust, there is a well-established principle that trustees can be held

personally liable for losses resulting from their negligence or malfeasance. The most prominent

case in which that claim was made, Robinson v. Smith, was initiated by stockholders in the New

York Coal Company, who filed suit against the directors of the firm in August 1826, detailing the

losses that arose from the securities transactions conducted by the directors, including their ill-fated

purchase of a controlling stake in City Bank. The defendants responded that only the company

itself had grounds to file the suit, since it was the company that was alleged to have been harmed.

If the defendants’ argument had prevailed, it would have foreclosed any opportunity for minority

investors to pursue such claims against directors, since the directors held majority control of the

corporation.98
  96
     Nathan v. Whitlock, 9 Paige Ch. 152. A cynical journalist remarked that these cases were “a fine time for the
lawyers!” (Commercial Advertiser, 19 August 1826.)
  97
     The Commercial Advertiser of 29 August 1826 mentions these delays.
  98
     This is, essentially, the rule that developed in English courts. See, for example, Boyle (2002).



                                                       28
       Ruling in 1832, the chancellor conceded that a suit against directors for breach of trust should

be initiated by the company itself, but also recognized that if the corporation were “under the

control of those who must be made the defendants in the suit, the stockholders, who are the real

parties of interest, would be permitted to file a bill in their own names.”99 This established the

principle that minority investors could sue directors for a breach of fiduciary trust. The rule in

Robinson v. Smith became a general principle of American equity jurisprudence, and marked an

important step in the development of what became known as the shareholders’ derivative suit.100


4.5      The impact of the changes to the law

The regulations imposed on financial corporations in New York’s laws in the years following the

scandals of 1826 had a lasting impact, both within New York State, and in other states. Although

a number of changes were introduced into New York’s laws governing financial companies over

the years, as the state’s administrative agencies became more sophisticated, the provisions of the

Revised Statutes governing these firms remained on the books until the 1880s.101 A few other

states emulated New York by introducing similar legislation; New Jersey passed a significant law

“To prevent frauds by incorporated companies”102 in 1829 that was similar to New York’s, and

Massachusetts passed a new banking law 1829 which contained some provisions that resembled

those of New York.103

       The provision of the Revised Statutes that changed the jurisdiction of the court of chancery had

an enduring impact, and is invoked in hundreds of reported New York chancery cases. In particular,

stockholders in banks frequently used the provisions empowering them to seek injunctions to halt

the operations of financial companies, and to appoint a receiver to liquidate their assets, when firms

violated the law or became insolvent.104 These statutes were even invoked by the shareholders of
  99
     Robinson v. Smith, 3 Paige 222 (N.Y. 1832).
 100
     The right to sue asserted in Robinson v. Smith was not “derivative” in nature; later nineteenth-century cases
would hold that stockholders had no such individual right, but rather one that was secondary to the right of the
corporate entity itself to pursue such a claim. See Prunty (1957).
 101
     New York (1909). The entire title regulating financial incorporations was repealed in 1882, and replaced with a
new banking law (New York Laws, 1882, ch. 402).
 102
     Acts of the General Assembly of the State of New Jersey, 1829 (second sitting), p. 58.
 103
     Massachusetts’s banking system was quite different than New York’s, and much of the new law was no doubt
enacted to reform particular features of its own system. However, the 1829 law does contain provisions regulating
capital contributions, limiting loans to stockholders on pledges of their own stock, creating unlimited liability for
directors in the case of mismanagement, and imposing criminal penalties for directors using banks’ capital for their
own purposes. (Massachusetts Acts and Resolves, 1829, Ch. 96, p. 144.)
 104
     Reported examples include, for example, Ferry v. Bank of Central New York, 15 How. Pr. 445 (N.Y. Sup. 1858);

the Erie Railroad.105

    The powers over corporations granted by the Revised Statutes to the state, on the other hand,

were utilized only rarely. The state did occasionally seek injunctions against banks, for example

to enforce the limits imposed on loans to insiders.106 But these laws were written at a time when

there was broad consensus that it was an important responsibility of the state to monitor the

behavior of corporations, and strictly enforce statutes that regulated their financial transactions.

For the most part, the state chose not to exercise those powers in subsequent years. Remarking

on these provisions of the Revised Statutes in 1892, one judge concluded that since stockholders

and creditors were also empowered to defend their interests, the state “left parties to their own

resources.”107 Especially in the second half of the nineteenth century, the legal system became less

friendly to the interests of minority shareholders, and the restraint of corporations generally.108

And as a later commentator put it, “it was felt that corporations should be as free as possible from

state supervision.”109



5     Conclusion

This paper analyzed a series of failures of prominent financial companies, which had been founded

and operated by wealthy and politically influential men. These failures were accompanied by

scandalous revelations of mismanagement, and provoked outrage among the public. Criminal pros-

ecutions soon followed, and the government ultimately enacted a significant package of legislation

to prevent future frauds and protect investors, which was designed to improve the mechanisms of

corporate governance. As familiar as this sounds today, these events took place in 1826, and the

legal changes that resulted were some of the first ever enacted.

    The panic of 1826 was one of many nineteenth century crises, each of which likely had its

own regulatory legacy. The rights enjoyed by stockholders and creditors today, and the laws
