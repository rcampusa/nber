Are Leading Indicators of Financial Crises Useful for Assessing Country Vulnerability? Evidence
from the 2008-09 Global Crisis

JEL No. F3

                                                ABSTRACT

This paper investigates whether leading indicators can help explain the cross-country incidence of
the 2008-09 financial crisis. Rather than looking for indicators with specific relevance to the current
crisis, the selection of variables is driven by an extensive review of more than eighty papers from the
previous literature on early warning indicators. The review suggests that central bank reserves and
past movements in the real exchange rate are the two leading indicators that have proven the most
useful in explaining crisis incidence across different countries and crises in the past. For the 2008-09
crisis, we use six different variables to measure crisis incidence: drops in GDP and industrial production,
currency depreciation, stock market performance, reserve losses, or participation in an IMF program.
We find that the level of reserves in 2007 appears as a consistent and statistically significant leading
indicator of the current crisis, in line with the conclusions of the earlier literature. In addition to reserves,
recent real appreciation is a statistically significant predictor of devaluation and of a measure of exchange
market pressure during the current crisis. That our data on the crisis period include the first quarter of
2009 may explain why we find stronger results than earlier papers such as Obstfeld, Shambaugh and
Taylor (2009, 2010) and Rose and Spiegel (2009a,b).

    1. Introduction

         This paper places itself in the long line of the early warning indicators literature by
attempting to identify variables that may help explain crisis incidence in 2008-09. This literature
has recently achieved renewed relevance. At the height of the crisis in November 2008, the G20
group of nations asked the IMF to conduct new early warning exercises, followed by a call for
the fund “to provide early warning of macroeconomic and financial risks and the actions needed
to address them” in the April 2009 London summit.1 An assessment of whether any variables can
explain 2008-09 crisis incidence is highly relevant to evaluating the usefulness of such future
exercises.
         Aside from generating increased policymaker interest, the 2008-09 crisis is particularly
well suited to undertaking an assessment of the potential usefulness of leading indicators. First,
the very large magnitude of the current crisis makes it a good candidate against which the
predictive power of various variables can be tested. Second, the crisis has been uniquely broad
and relatively synchronized across the global economy. As such, a global sample can be used,
and issues related to the timing of crisis incidence and the modeling of staggered spillover effects
can be largely finessed.2
         The next section of the paper conducts an extensive review of more than eighty papers
from the early warning indicators literature. We ask whether any variables have consistently
proven successful as leading indicators of crisis incidence in the past. This review drives the
selection of variables for the empirical analysis of the 2008-09 crisis.
         The third section of the paper conducts an empirical investigation into which countries
proved most vulnerable during the 2008-09 crisis. We investigate whether any of the economic
or financial variables were able to predict successfully the incidence of the financial crisis. The
focus is on the variables identified in the literature review, rather than indicators specifically
selected for the 2008-09 crisis. A country is considered more “vulnerable” if it experienced
larger output drops, bigger stock market falls, greater currency weakness, larger losses in
reserves, or the need for access to IMF funds. The fourth section of the paper evaluates the
economic significance of the results and draws policy implications from our findings.

 Rose and Speigel (2009b) distinguish between common shocks and the international transmission of shocks
originating from a crisis country. This paper focuses on the former, and does not consider bilateral shocks between a
crisis country and others.

   2.1 The Challenges of the Early Warning Indicators Literature


       The early warning indicators literature is extensive. However, identifying broad lessons
from this empirical work is fraught with difficulties. First, the definitions of a financial crisis and
the severity of incidence vary widely. These differences will be explored in more detail below.
Second, the literature investigates different types of crisis, in different countries and over
different time periods. The results from most of these studies therefore lack generality, and the
lessons learned from one crisis and country may not be relevant for another. Third, and perhaps
most importantly, the empirical work on leading indicators faces a problem of selection bias. The
variables examined as indicators are selected with the benefit of hindsight, albeit usually based
on some underlying economic reasoning. Even if these are identified as statistically significant,
their usefulness can be questionable if they have been identified after the crisis has occurred.
       To overcome the limitations above, the approach taken here is to identify the causes and
symptoms of financial crises, if any, that have been most consistent over time, country and crisis.
We conduct a broad review of the literature, and attempt to categorize systematically the
empirical findings into a ranking of the indicators that have been found to be statistically
significant. Rather than focusing on the specific causes of this crisis, we examine the success of
the indicators identified in the earlier literature in predicting 2008-09 financial crisis incidence.




   2.2 Definitions of “crisis” and “crisis incidence”


       While the variety of independent variables used to explain crisis incidence has been
extensive, the literature has converged on a narrower set of dependent variables used to measure
the intensity and occurrence of crises. This notwithstanding, there is still wide variation in the
way a crisis is defined, as highlighted by both Kaminsky, Lizondo and Reinhart (1996,
henceforth KLR) and Abiad (2002).
       The literature uses both discrete and continuous measures to define a crisis. Discrete
measures are usually in the form of binary variables, which define a crisis as occurring once a



                                                   3
particular threshold value of some economic or financial variable has been breached. Frankel and
Rose (1996) define a “currency crash” as a depreciation of the nominal exchange rate of more
than 25% that is also at least a 10% increase in the rate of nominal depreciation from the
previous year.      Another measure, popularized by Eichengreen, Rose and Wyplosz (1995),
defines an “exchange market crisis” as occurring when their index of speculative pressure moves
at least two standard deviations above its mean. Continuous measures of crisis incidence
overcome the problem of defining particular thresholds by measuring crisis intensity on a
continuous scale.
       The literature has focused on a relatively narrow set of variables that are used in defining
a crisis. The vast majority of studies include some measure of changes in the exchange rate.
These include bilateral nominal exchange rates predominantly against the US dollar (for instance
Edwards 1989; Frankel and Rose 1996; Bruggemann and Linne 1999; Osband and Rijckeghem
2000), real exchange rates (Goldfajn and Valdes 1998; Esquivel and Larrain 1998; Apoteker and
Barthelemy 2000), and changes in the SDR exchange rate (Rose and Spiegel 2009a, 2009b).
Exchange rate changes have often been combined with movements in reserves to create indices
of exchange market pressure that measure crisis intensity regardless of exchange rate regime
(Sachs, Tornell and Velasco 1996a,b; Corsetti, et al, 1998; Fratzcher, 1998; KLR 1998; Berg and
Pattillo 1999; Tornell 1999; Bussiere and Mulder 1999, 2000; Collins 2001; and Frankel and
Wei (2005).) Some also include changes in interest rates, alongside changes in reserves and the
exchange rate, to account comprehensively for central bank defense against speculative attacks
(Eichengreen, Rose and Wyplosz 1995; Herrera and Garcia 1999; Hawkins and Klau 2000;
Krkoska 2001). Less frequently used indicators have included the drop in GDP (Ghosh and
Ghosh 2002) and equity market changes (Grier and Grier 2001). Some authors use regime-
switching approaches that define a crisis endogenously by simultaneously identifying speculative
attacks and the determinants of switching to speculative regimes (Cerra and Saxena 2000;
Martinez Peria 2002).




   2.3 Model Specifications




                                                4
       The different modeling approaches employed in the leading indicators literature can be
broadly grouped into four categories. (See Abiad 2002; Hawkins and Klaw 2000; Collins 2001
for similar categorizations.) The first and most popular category uses linear regression or limited
dependent variable probit/logit techniques. These are used to test the statistical significance of
various indicators in determining the incidence or probability of occurrence of a financial crisis
across a cross-section of countries. Some of the first studies to use these techniques include
Eichengreen, Rose and Wypslosz (1995), Frankel and Rose (1996) and Sachs, Tornell and
Velasco (1996a, b), but they have since been used widely.
       The second category, known as the non-parametric, indicators, or signals approach was
first popularized by KLR (1998) and further developed in studies such as Bruggemann and Linne
(2000) and Edison (2003). The approach consists of selecting a number of variables as leading
indicators of a crisis, and determining threshold values beyond which a crisis signal is considered
to be given. While the statistical significance of the indicators used cannot be determined directly
because the thresholds are determined within-sample, statistical tests can be undertaken to
investigate the out-of-sample performance of these indicators. Tests of the out-of-sample
significance of the KLR and other signal-based models have been undertaken by, among others,
Berg and Patillo (1999), Bussiere and Mulder (1999) and Berg, Borenztein and Patillo (2004),
who have shown these models to be moderately successful in predicting financial crises.
       The third category employs a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the behavior of
various variables around crisis occurrence by splitting countries into a crisis and non-crisis
control group. These techniques were predominantly used in the earlier leading indicators
literature, with Kamin (1988), Edwards (1989), Edwards and Montiel (1989), Edwards and
Santaella (1993) using some of the largest samples. Unlike the more recent literature, these
consist of panel studies where the emphasis is on trying to predict the date at which a crisis
occurs, rather than on the cross-sectional incidence of crisis.
       The fourth, and most recent, category encompasses the use of more innovative techniques
to identify and explain crisis incidence, including the use of binary recursive trees to determine
leading indicator crisis thresholds (Ghosh and Ghosh 2002; Frankel and Wei 2004), artificial
neural networks and genetic algorithms to select the most appropriate indicators (Nag and Mitra
1999; Apoteker and Barthelemy 2001) and Markov switching models (Cerra and Saxena 2001;
Martinez Peria 2002).

   2.4 What We Know from the Literature


       The wide range of estimation techniques notwithstanding, the literature has converged on
a number of independent variables which are most frequently examined as leading indicators of
crisis incidence. A useful starting point for an overview of previous work are the three extensive
reviews conducted by KLR (1998) for studies up to 1997, Hawkins and Klau (2000) for studies
up to 2000 and Abiad (2002) for studies up to 2001. These three reviews survey more than eighty
papers conducted over a period covering crisis episodes from the 1950s up to 2002. Abiad (2002)
does not however provide a systematic ranking of which indicators were found to be statistically
significant across the various studies investigated. Furthermore, neither Abiad (2002) nor
Hawkins and Klau (2000) include all of each other’s studies in their reviews. This section
integrates the findings of all three reviews, and provides a more systematic analysis of the
indicators in the studies cited by Abiad (2002). We also evaluate the results of seven new papers
published since 2002.
       Table 1 below summarizes the number of times a particular indicator was found to be
statistically significant across the reviews and additional studies cited above. The indicator
listing is based on Hawkins and Klau (2000) with some modifications, and the footnotes to the
table indicate which variables have been included in each indicator category. Appendix 1
includes a detailed breakdown of the criteria used to identify significant variables in the papers
cited by Abiad (2002) and the most recent literature.
       Based on the results below, foreign exchange reserves, the real exchange rate, the growth
rate of credit, GDP and the current account are the most frequent statistically significant
indicators in the papers reviewed. Different measures of reserves and of the real exchange rate in
particular stand out as the top two most important leading indicators, being statistically
significant determinants of crisis incidence in more than half of the 83 papers reviewed.
       Such a meta-analysis of the literature is plagued with the usual limitations of a
comparative exercise. First, a common feature of all studies is that some indicators are included

more frequently than others. This is usually due to differences in data availability or because
some variables have a stronger theoretical or intuitive underpinning as crisis indicators. The
small number of statistically significant variables for some indicators does not necessarily mean
that they have been tested and found to be non-significant, but that in some cases they may have
not been investigated as extensively in the literature. Political and legal variables, variables for
financial openness and for the exchange rate regime stand out in this regard. In contrast, the
current account stands out as a variable which, while frequently included as an independent
variable, has not always exhibited statistical significance.
       The second limitation is that the criteria used to determine which indicators are
significant in KLR (1998), Hawkins and Klau (2000) and in the last two columns by us are
different. KLR (1998) include variables that have been found to be significant in at least one of
the tests conducted in each paper, Hawkins and Klau (2000) use varying criteria, and we identify
those variables that are statistically significant in the absolute majority of the different
regressions or other estimation techniques used.
       These limitations notwithstanding, it is encouraging that a broadly similar ranking of
statistical significance is generated across all three reviews considered and the more recent
literature. Both reserves and the real exchange rate are the two most significant indicators across
all the review groupings considered, while credit, GDP and the current account rank highly in
most of the columns of the table. In addition, an aggregation exercise of this type has the benefit
of ensuring robustness of results. Consistency of statistical significance of an indicator across
different periods and using different estimation techniques and crisis definitions makes for a
more reliable indicator for policy making purposes.




   2.5 Recent Research on the 2008-09 Crisis


       Empirical work on the 2008-09 crisis is still in its infancy, in part due to a lack of data
and partly because the crisis had not yet concluded as of 2009. Most of the studies that have been
undertaken have focused on analyzing the crisis in 2008. Obstfeld, Shambaugh and Taylor
(2009, 2010) were among the first to investigate empirically the incidence of the crisis. The
authors measure crisis incidence as the percentage depreciation of local currencies against the



                                                   8
US dollar over 2008, and find that the excess of reserves (as a proportion of M2) over the values
predicted by their model of reserve demand is a statistically significant predictor of currency
depreciation over 2008. These results notwithstanding, the unadjusted level of reserves/M2 is not
found to be a statistically significant predictor of crisis incidence. Furthermore, the overall size
of the sample is limited and their results lack statistical robustness across different country
samples.
        A second and broader empirical contribution to the literature are the papers by Rose and
Spiegel (2009a; 2009b), who model crisis incidence as a combination of 2008 changes in real
GDP, the stock market, country credit ratings and the exchange rate. The authors perform an
extensive investigation into over sixty potential variables that could help explain cross-country
crisis incidence (2009a) as well as country-specific contagion effects (2009b). The authors fail to
identify any consistently statistically significant variables of crisis incidence, with the possible
exception of stock market returns. Though the sample is broader than that used by Obstfeld,
Shamaugh and Taylor (2009), the 2008 calendar year period over which the authors measure
crisis incidence remains somewhat arbitrary. The crisis hit most of the global economy in the
second half of 2008, with global output and financial markets continuing to contract in early
2009.
        A more recent paper by Berkmen et al. (2009) measures crisis incidence differently as the
change in 2009 growth forecasts by professional economists before and after the crisis hit. They
find that countries with more leveraged domestic financial systems and more rapid credit growth
tended to suffer larger downward revisions to their growth outlooks, while exchange-rate
flexibility also helped reduce the impact of the shock. Interestingly, as in Rose and Spiegel
(2009a) and Blanchard et al (2009), the authors find little evidence that international reserves
played a significant role in explaining crisis incidence. These results notwithstanding, their
measure of crisis incidence has its limitations, focusing on revisions to growth forecasts by
professional economists rather than actual growth outturns.            Data on actual economic
performance was not available at the time.




3.1 Predicting the Incidence of the 2008-09 Financial Crisis




                                                 9
        A consistent theme of the most recent literature is that the leading indicators that most
frequently appeared in earlier reviews are not statistically significant indicators of crisis
incidence. This section builds on the recent work on the financial crisis, with three key
innovations. First, crisis incidence is measured using five different variables and over two
different time periods, to help ensure robustness of results. Second, greater attention is given to
the leading indicators that have been identified as useful by the literature prior to 2008, rather
than focusing on variables that may be uniquely chosen for the current crisis. The main aim of
this empirical exercise is to examine the consistency of these indicators in predicting crisis
vulnerability over time, country and crisis. Finally, data encompassing financial market and
economic developments up to the second quarter of 2009 are included in the financial crisis
incidence measures used. Many equity markets and real output indicators continued to decline up
to the first and second quarters of 2009 respectively, suggesting that the crisis continued beyond
the end of 2008. As such a more accurate measurement of crisis incidence requires the inclusion
of this period in the analysis.




3.2 The Dataset


        Our data consists of 50 annual macroeconomic and financial variables for 2007 or earlier
from the World Bank World Development Indicators database. This source is augmented by
monthly real effective and nominal exchange rate data from the IMF International Financial
Statistics database, the Klein-Shambaugh (2006) measure of exchange rate regime as of 2004
and the Chinn-Ito (2007) measure of financial openness updated to 2007. Data availability differs
by country, with the most data points available for the level and growth rate of GDP (122
countries) and the least data available for various measures of short-term debt (67 countries).
High frequency data for foreign exchange rates (156 countries), stock market indices (77
countries), industrial production (58 countries) and GDP (63 countries) up to the second half of
2009 are sourced from Bloomberg and Datastream for the financial and real data respectively.3
The high frequency data are used to define crisis incidence from the second half of 2008

3
 Some industrial production and GDP data have been taken from national statistical sources. For industrial
production, data for China, New Zealand and Ukraine were taken from national statistics. For GDP, the data for
Poland are from national sources.

onwards, as analyzed in more detail below. All the independent variables are dated from 2007 or
earlier, minimizing endogeneity issues.




3.3 Defining the 2008-09 Crisis


         An important element of an analysis of leading indicators is how crisis incidence is
defined. We interpret crisis incidence broadly, defining it both in terms of financial and real
incidence. The key difference from the earlier empirical work is that we consider the crisis to
have continued into 2009, rather than having ended in 2008. Many real output indicators and
asset prices continued to decline after December 2008, while measures of market risk such as the
VIX and sovereign bond spreads remained elevated (see appendix 2 for a graphical illustration).
The crisis measures used are:


         (a) Nominal local currency percentage change versus the US dollar from 15th September
             2008 to 9th March 2009. The starting date is picked as the day of the Lehman Brothers
             bankruptcy. Though asset prices peaked and many measures of financial market risk
             started to rise prior to this date, financial market dislocations became particularly
             synchronized and abrupt after this date (see appendix 2). Identifying the end date is
             less straightforward, with different financial market variables beginning to recover on
             different dates. In this paper, the end date is identified as the bottom in the MSCI
             world equity index. The US dollar (as measured by the Federal Reserve broad trade-
             weighted dollar index) also peaked a few days earlier, perhaps signaling a peak in
             global risk-aversion and flight to quality.4


         (b) Equity market returns in domestic stock market benchmark indices over the same
             period as above, adjusted for the volatility of returns.5 This method is preferred to
             simple percent returns, to account for the differing risk-return characteristics of each

4
  Aït-Sahalia, et al (2010) also date the global phase of the financial crisis as beginning with collapse of Lehman
Brothers on September 14, 2008, and ending March 31, 2009. As additional justification for the end-date, they
point out that the G20 Leaders Summit on Financial Markets and the World Economy, which tackled the crisis, was
held in London on April 1-2, 2009.
5
  Returns are calculated as the annualized percentage daily returns over the period divided by annualized volatility.


                                                         11
           local stock market. All else equal, a more volatile stock market index will produce a
           risk-adjusted return that is closer to zero.


       (c) Percentage change in the level of real GDP from end-June 2008 to end-June 2009.
           Though the NBER declared December 2007 as the start of the US recession, the
           global economy continued growing up to the second quarter of 2008 based on a
           number of high frequency variables such as industrial production and the institute of
           supply management’s global purchasing manager index (PMI). Based on these
           indicators, output began to recover in the second quarter of 2009. It thus seems fitting
           to measure the fall in GDP in the four quarters to Q2 2009. Measuring GDP over four
           quarters also overcomes any seasonality problems.


       (d) Percentage change in industrial production from end-June 2008 to end-June 2009.
           This is used as an alternative measure of real crisis incidence. The composition of
           GDP varies widely across economies, so industrial production may be a more
           consistent measure of the impact of the crisis across economies.


       (e) Recourse to IMF financing from July 2008 to November 2009. This includes all
           countries that requested funds from the IMF under Stand-by Arrangements, the
           Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility and Exogenous Shock Facility (see appendix
           3 for countries included). Countries with an established Flexible Credit Line are not
           included, as no funds have been drawn under this arrangement. The variable is a
           binary crisis indicator, taking the value 1 if a country participated in an IMF program
           and 0 otherwise.


       Though the literature has frequently combined exchange rate moves with losses in
international reserves as a measure of crisis incidence, reserves are not included in the baseline
indicators above. There are two reasons. First, measured reserves go up when central banks draw
credit under IMF programs. The level of reserves is thus affected by the large number of IMF
programs initiated during the current crisis, with many countries showing large jumps in reserves
at the peak of the crisis. Even if the IMF funds are stripped out, the drop in international reserves



                                                  12
is a biased measure of crisis incidence, as their level would have likely been much lower in the
absence of an IMF program. Second, movements in exchange rates cause severe valuation
distortions in reserves. If one chooses to value reserves in US dollars for instance, the data
indicate large drops in reserves for many Eastern European countries. This however reflects not
only a volume loss in reserves, but also a paper loss on their value: the appreciation in the US
dollar during the crisis reduced the dollar value of reserves of European countries due to the
large proportion of euros in their portfolios.
         These two drawbacks notwithstanding, the inclusion of reserves as a measure of crisis
incidence allows one to observe an increase in market pressure that may not otherwise be
captured through exchange rate moves. This is particularly relevant for countries with fixed
exchange rate regimes, where capital flight and crisis incidence are manifest through larger drops
in reserves rather than exchange rate weakness.6 We augment our analysis in Section 3.6 with an
exchange market pressure index that does include reserves and attempts to correct for both of the
problems highlighted above.




3.4 Independent Variables


         The independent variables selected are based on the indicators identified in the literature
review. The explanatory variables all refer to the 2007 calendar year, unless noted otherwise, and
are grouped into the following categories:


    Reserves
Reserves appeared as the most frequent statistically significant variable in the literature. The
measures included in this study are reserves as percentage of GDP, reserves as a percentage of
total external debt, reserves in months of imports, the ratio of M2 to total reserves and short term
debt as percentage of total reserves.


    Real Effective Exchange Rate

6
 The Baltic countries stand out in this regard. Despite a fixed exchange rate to the euro, they suffered from capital
outflows, large reserve losses and severe recessions during the 2008-09 crisis. Poland, on the other hand,
experienced currency weakness but smaller output drops.


                                                          13
The source of these data is the IMF’s real effective exchange rate database. The variables used
are the percentage change in the REER over the last five years, and the percentage deviation of
the REER in December 2007 from its ten year average. A rise in the REER index represents a
stronger local currency.


   Gross Domestic Product
GDP growth in 2007, as well as the average GDP growth rates over 2003-07 (5 year average)
and 1998-2007 (10 year average) are used. We also include the level of GDP per capita
(expressed in 2000 constant US dollars).


   Credit
The variables included are the five and ten year rise in domestic credit as a percentage of GDP.
Sachs, Tornell and Velasco (1996a,b), who were among the first to popularize this measure,
argue that it is a good proxy of banking system vulnerability, as rapid credit expansion is likely
associated with a decline in lending standards. A credit depth of information index as well as the
bank liquid reserves to bank assets ratio are also used, as alternative measures of banking system
vulnerability.


   Current Account
Variables under this category are the current account balance as a percentage of GDP in 2007,
and the average balance in the five and ten years up to 2007. Net national savings as a percentage
of GNI and gross national savings as a percentage of GDP are also included in this category.


   Money Supply
The ten- and five-year growth rates of liquid liabilities (M3) and money and quasi-money (M2)
are used. Alternative leading indicators relating to the money supply such as the money
multiplier and excess M1 balances are not included due to a lack of data availability.


   Exports and Imports
This includes exports, imports and the trade balance as a percentage of GDP.




                                                14
   Inflation
The two variables are the average CPI inflation rate over the last five and ten years.


   Equity Returns
Equity market returns are measured as the five year percentage change in benchmark stock
market indices expressed in local currencies, as well as the five year volatility-adjusted return.
The source of these data is Bloomberg.


   Interest Rate
The real interest rate as well as deposit rates are included.


   Debt Composition
The variables included in this category are the amount of short-term debt as a percentage of
exports and as a percentage of total external debt, public and publicly guaranteed debt service as
a percentage of exports and of GNI, multilateral debt service as a percentage of public and
publicly guaranteed debt service, aid as a percentage of GNI and gross financing via
international capital markets as a percentage of GDP. Earlier research has mostly focused on the
effects of short-term debt, finding a positive relationship with crisis incidence (Frankel and Rose
1996; Kaminsky 1999; among others). The relationship between crisis incidence and public debt
or aid/debt owed to multilaterals has been examined less frequently. Some studies suggest a
positive and negative effect of crisis incidence and public and multilateral debt respectively
(Frankel and Rose 1996; Milesi-Ferretti and Razin 2000).


   Legal/Business Variables
The variables under this category are the strength of legal rights index and business extent of
disclosure index included in the World Development Indicators database.


   Capital Flows
The variables measured are net foreign direct investment inflows, outflows and total FDI flows,
as well as portfolio flows (debt and equity), all expressed as a percentage of GDP. The first two
variables refer to net FDI by foreign companies into the domestic economy and by domestic



                                                  15
companies to foreign markets respectively. Total FDI flows are calculated as the sum of inflows
and outflows. A larger amount of total FDI flows into the economy, considered a more stable
source of balance of payments financing, is expected to have a negative relationship with crisis
incidence. Larger portfolio flows, considered more easily reversible, are expected to be
associated with higher crisis incidence.


   External Debt
External debt is represented by total debt service as a percentage of GNI, and by the net present
value expressed as a percentage of exports and GNI.


   Peg/Financial Openness
The Chinn-Ito (2007) measure of financial openness updated to 2007 and the Klein-Shambaugh
(2007) measure of exchange rate regime as of 2004 are used. The former is transformed into a
binary variable, with a country considered financially closed if the index value belongs to the
bottom 30th percentile. Twenty-three additional countries were included in the latter dataset,
based on the authors’ own calculations.


   Regional/Income Dummy Variables
Dummy variables to account for three different income groups (lower, middle and upper) based
on the World Bank definition were included. Regional dummy variables included South Asia,
Europe and Central Asia, Middle East and North Africa, East Asia and the Pacific, Sub-Saharan
Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean and North America.




3.5 Empirical Analysis


3.5.1   Dependent Variables


        We start the empirical analysis with a quantitative description of the dependent variables
used to define crisis incidence. Appendix 4 presents the top and bottom ten performing countries
on each of the continuous variables used. Some of the usual suspects figure prominently. Many



                                               16
Eastern European countries show up as suffering the most from the crisis. China stands out as a
country that suffered less. Strikingly, it is the only country that appears in the list of best-
performers across all four variables. While some of the differences in country rankings across
indicators reflect different data availability,7 the differences can be mostly attributed to country-
specific economic factors.
        The Baltic countries suffered some of the largest drops in industrial production and GDP,
but the tenacity of their exchange rate pegs to the euro meant that their currencies did not
depreciate versus the dollar in comparison with other emerging market currencies. Similarly,
despite the large drops in Japan’s GDP and industrial production, the Japanese yen was one of
the top performing currencies during the crisis, largely due to the unwinding of the yen carry
trade (as Rose and Spiegel 2009a also point out). The differences in the measurement of crisis
incidence reinforces the need to use multiple definitions of crisis incidence against which the
predictive power of various leading indicators can be tested.
        Continuing the descriptive statistics, Appendix 5 presents correlation coefficients across
the four continuous variables and the binary IMF variable. Unlike the rankings presented above,
the results here offer a more consistent picture. All ten cross-correlations have the expected sign,
and half are statistically significant at the 10% level or less. Unsurprisingly, the highest
correlations are between the changes in GDP and industrial production. Stock market
performance also appears to correlate well with changes in real output. On the other hand, the
change in the exchange rate has the weakest correlation with the other variables, likely reflecting
the presence of exchange rate pegs in the sample of countries examined.




3.5.2   Bivariate Regressions


        We begin the statistical analysis by running bivariate regressions of the crisis incidence
indicators on each independent variable. The bivariate tests are meant to be exploratory, though
it would also be useful for practitioners to have simple rules of thumb phrased in terms of
individual variables. For the exchange rate, equity market, industrial production and GDP


7
 Our sample does not included stock market returns for Ukraine for instance, so Ukraine does not show up in the
bottom-ten list of the equity market indicator.


                                                       17
indicators we use ordinary least squares estimation. For the binary IMF recourse variable, a
maximum likelihood probit model is estimated. The output is a total of 305 regressions, the
results of which are reported in Appendix 6.
        This initial approach offers some moderately encouraging results. Both reserves and the
real effective exchange rate, identified as the two most useful leading indicators in earlier
literature, appear as useful predictors of some measures of 2008-09 crisis incidence. For
international reserves, all five measures have at least two statistically significant coefficients
with consistent signs. More than half of all regressions are statistically significant at the 5%
level or less. All regressions including the real effective exchange rate have the consistent signs
(high past REER appreciation is associated with higher incidence), though they appear as
statistically significant only when regressed against the exchange rate crisis indicator. Credit
growth, the current account/savings rate, inflation, capital flows, the level and profile of external
debt and the money supply also stand out as potentially useful variables, though full analysis is
reserved for the section below.




3.5.3   Bivariate Regressions with Income Level as Control Variable


        Looking across the various variables, the income group dummies as well as GDP per
capita appear highly statistically significant across most crisis indicators. Though rich countries
had a smaller probability of seeking IMF funds, the relationship is negative across all the
continuous indicators, suggesting that richer countries suffered more from the 2008-09 crisis
than poorer ones. This is a departure from historical patterns, but confirms the Rose and Speigel
results (2009a). Based on this and following the aforementioned authors, we use the log of
income per capita as a conditioning variable and re-run the regressions above. The results of
these bivariate regressions are reported in table 2 below.
        The coefficients on reserves remain statistically significant at the 5% level across more
than half of the regressions performed, with reserves expressed relative to external debt, GDP,
or short-term debt standing out as the most consistently significant indicators. (The coefficients
on reserves expressed in months of imports are also statistically significant in two out of the five
crisis measures.) Thus the variable that has shown up most frequently in the preceding literature



                                                 18
(recall Table 1) performs well in predicting vulnerability in 2008-09, contrary to Blanchard et al
(2009), Rose and Spiegel (2009a,b)and others. Past appreciation as measured by the real
effective exchange rate also appears as a significant leading predictor of currency weakness
during the 2008-09 crisis, and has a correct and consistent sign in all other regressions.
        Turning to the next indicators on the list, the rise in credit variables, they have the
anticipated signs across all measures, and at both the five and ten year horizon: higher credit
growth is associated with higher crisis incidence. Only three out of the ten regressions
considered are statistically significant however. The rise in credit is particularly associated with
greater subsequent stock market weakness. An indicator focusing more narrowly on the liquidity
of the banking system, measured as banks’ liquid reserves to bank assets ratio, also has a
consistent and negative sign across all specifications. Though the latter variable does not figure
prominently in the earlier literature, the finding is in line with Berkmen et al (2009), who
conclude that countries with a more leveraged financial system and higher credit growth suffered
more during the crisis.
        Three other indicators from the analysis are worth mentioning. First, higher past GDP
growth is associated with larger output drops during the current crisis, as well as a higher
probability of recourse to the IMF. This appears somewhat counterintuitive, but may be
attributable to a positive link between higher GDP growth rates and asset market bubbles and
credit or commodity export booms.8 Second, all five measures of the current account and
national savings have consistent signs in all specifications. The coefficients are statistically
significant in the majority of the regressions, suggesting that countries with a higher pool of
national savings and less need to borrow from the rest of the world suffered comparatively less
during the current crisis.




8
 From the data available, Macau, China, Latvia, Georgia and Belarus were the top five growth performers over
2003-07, but with the exception of China subsequently suffered large output drops.

  exception of coefficient on IMF recourse variable, which should have opposite sign)




          Third, both the level of external debt and the proportion of short term debt appear useful
leading indicators. The coefficients on short-term debt measured in terms of reserves (classified
here in the reserves category), as a percentage of exports or relative to external debt have
consistent signs across all specifications, with the first two measures also appearing as
statistically significant in at least two of the five crisis incidence measures. The level of external
debt appears particularly useful in explaining output and equity market drops, but not for the
alternative crisis incidence measures.
          Though no other indicators appear as consistently useful leading indicators, it is worth
highlighting the estimation results of the peg and financial openness dummy variables. Countries


                                                                        22
with a floating exchange rate were more likely to see currency weakness and to require access to
IMF funds, though at the same time they suffered smaller GDP and stock market drops, the latter
being in line with the findings of Berkmen et al (2009). Financial openness does not appear to be
a statistically significant indicator of any of the crisis measures, though the signs on the
coefficients are intuitively appealing, suggesting that financially open countries suffered more
from the current crisis.
       In sum, the results above are in line with the findings of the literature review, suggesting
that international reserves were one of the most useful leading indicators of crisis incidence in
2008-09. Real exchange rate overvaluation, the other of the most popular indicators, is also
useful, for predicting currency market crashes, which is the crisis measure on which the majority
of studies in the literature have focused.   High past credit growth was associated with higher
incidence, perhaps via asset bubbles. Finally, the current account/national savings and the level
of external and short-term external debt were also found to help consistently predict crisis
incidence.
       It is worth noting that each crisis incidence indicator is likely to be driven by different
independent variables, though a more complete analysis is beyond the scope of this paper. The
aim here has rather been to show that a limited set of variables –identified in earlier literature –
can predict crisis incidence measured in five different ways.




3.6 Introducing an Exchange Market Pressure Index


       The literature has often used exchange market pressure indices combining changes in
exchange rates and international reserves to measure crisis incidence. Following a similar
methodology to Eichengreen, Rose and Wyplosz (1995), we create an exchange market pressure
index measured as a weighted average of exchange rate and reserve changes. The weights are
determined by the inverse of the relative standard deviation of each series to compensate for the
different volatilities of each series. The changes in the variables are measured from end-August
2008 to end-March 2009, to cover the most severe period of the financial crisis as identified in
Section 3.3. The source of the data is the IMF International Financial Statistics database.




                                                23
As highlighted earlier, the inclusion of reserves in such an index may bias crisis severity
downwards due to the presence of a large number of IMF programs during the current crisis. At
the same time, valuation distortions due to the large exchange rate movements that occurred over
the period are also likely to misstate the true pressure on different countries’ reserve holdings
depending on their composition. We attempt to correct for these biases in two ways. First, for
those countries that received IMF funding during the August-March period, reserves are treated
as if they dropped to zero by the end of the period. In the absence of an IMF program, it is
presumed that these countries would have suffered from a complete depletion of reserves.
Second, to overcome the valuation problem, we make assumptions about their currency
composition. First, we group countries by exchange rate arrangement following the IMF Annual
Report on Exchange Arrangements 2008 categorization (IMF 2008). Currency and reserve
changes in countries with exchange rate anchors to the USD, EUR and a composite basket are
measured in terms of US dollars, euros and SDRs, respectively. Changes in the value of
currencies and reserves for all other countries following alternative arrangements are measured
in terms of US dollars.9
         Table 3 below reports the results of regressions of the exchange pressure index against a
number of leading indicators. The selection of the indicators in the first two regressions is driven
by the findings of the literature review and the empirical results of the previous section. The
second regression combining GDP per capita, reserves, past exchange rate appreciation and a
peg dummy is used as the baseline specification. We experiment with sequentially adding
variables belonging to each of the categories of leading indicators reported in table 2.
         The coefficients on reserves and the real effective exchange rate retain their significance
for the majority of the multivariate specifications considered. The coefficient on reserves relative
to GDP maintains its statistical significance across regressions 1-3 when replaced with reserves




9
  The rationale for this categorization is as follows: those countries pegging to the US dollar or euro are likely to
have the majority of their reserves denominated in these currencies. Therefore, it makes sense to measure exchange
rate and reserve changes in terms of the foreign currency to which the local currency is pegged. The reserve
composition and currency basket weights of most countries following composite anchors are not publicly disclosed.
Currency and reserve changes are measured against the IMF Special Drawing Right (SDR) in this instance. SDR
weights are constructed on the basis of global export and reserve holding patterns, and therefore provide a
reasonable first attempt at proxying the composition of these countries’ reserve holdings and currency basket
weights. In the absence of a relative benchmark for the free-floating currencies, the US dollar is used, following the
majority of the literature.

significance. As in the earlier analysis, reserves and the real effective exchange rate stand out as
two of the most important leading indicators of crisis incidence.

  The number of data points falls significantly when reserves are measured in terms of short-term or external debt,
perhaps explaining the loss in significance in these specifications.

3.7 Robustness Analysis


         This section examines alternative crisis incidence measures to assess the robustness of the
earlier analysis. In addition to the exchange market pressure index analyzed above, we introduce
the following alternative crisis incidence measures: Nominal local currency changes versus the
US dollar are measured from end-June 2008 to the end of June 2009 rather than over the
September 15th – March 9th 2009 period. Equity market returns are measured in terms of
percentage returns over September 15th – March 9th 2009, rather than in terms of risk-adjusted
returns. The recourse to IMF variable is modified to include only access to Standby
Arrangement programs, which are aimed at addressing immediate balance of payment financing
shortfalls.
         We repeat the bivariate analysis of Section 3.5.3 by regressing the exchange market
pressure index and the modified crisis incidence measures on all independent variables while
controlling for GDP per capita. The results are reported in Appendix 7. Comparing the four
modified crisis incidence variables to those used in the earlier analysis, international reserves
again stand out as a useful leading indicator. All measures of reserves with the exception of
reserves relative to M2 remain statistically significant in at least two of the four modified
measures used, as in the main body of the analysis. Past real effective exchange rate appreciation
is still a significant variable in explaining currency weakness, and is also now significant in
determining the probability of recourse to an IMF Standby Arrangement. The coefficients on the
current account/national savings, credit growth, GDP, and total and short-term external debt all
exhibit similar patterns of statistical significance to the main analysis, indicating that the results
are robust to the methodology used to calculate crisis incidence. 11




4    Economic Significance and Policy Implications




11
   The most notable differences are that the current account, national savings and the trade balance now appear as
statistically significant when used as leading indicators of currency market weakness; the financial openness and peg
dummies are significant as a leading indicator of recourse to IMF Standby arrangements


                                                         26
        The econometric analysis above confirmed that the top two indicators identified in the
literature review, the level of international reserves and real exchange rate overvaluation were
also useful leading indicators of the 2008-09 crisis. Reserves appear consistently useful across
the majority of the crisis measures used, while past real exchange rate appreciation play a
significant role in explaining currency weakness as well as the broader measure of exchange
market pressure.
        Turning to the economic interpretation of these results, the estimates from the
multivariate specifications in Table 3 help give a sense of the relative impact of reserves and past
currency appreciation in explaining crisis incidence. A level of reserves equivalent to
approximately 100% of GDP is associated with a one standard deviation fall in crisis intensity as
measured through the exchange market pressure index. This is slightly more than the difference
in 2008-09 crisis intensity experienced between China and India, or half the intensity difference
between China and Russia. Similarly, a 45% appreciation in the real exchange rate over the five
years prior to 2008 was also associated with approximately a one standard deviation move higher
in crisis intensity during the crisis.
        Two key policy implications can be derived from this analysis. First, the level of reserves
stands out as a key leading indicator of crisis incidence as measured through a variety of
variables. To the extent that a low level of reserves are a cause, rather than just an indicator of
country vulnerability to external shocks, this would suggest that the large accumulation of
reserves by many developing countries prior to 2008 may have played an important role in
reducing their vulnerability during the latest crisis. It also comes in contrast with some of the
recent research suggesting that reserves did not play a significant role in shielding countries from
the crisis (Blanchard et al 2009; Rose and Spiegel 2009a). The results here lend credence to the
usefulness of reserve accumulation policies as insurance during periods of crisis.
        Second, this paper strikes a more positive note than other recent papers on the usefulness
of leading indicators in predicting crisis incidence. In spite of the differences in financial crisis
characteristics across time and geography, the literature review identified a number of indicators
that have proven consistently useful in explaining crisis incidence. These findings were
confirmed by the empirical investigation of the 2008-09 crisis. Nevertheless, the implication of
these findings should be treated with caution. First, the variables identified as the most useful
were not consistently significant across all crisis measured used. Second, the ideal early warning



                                                 27
system would not only be able to explain the incidence of crisis, as this – and most other papers -
have attempted to do, but also predict incidence ahead of time. This requires the estimation of
model parameters based on past crises episodes, so that early warning signals can be generated
before the crisis is observed. Berg and Patillo (1999) and Berg, Borensztein and Patillo (2004),
have spearheaded such out-of-sample assessments, and a relevant inquiry into how well existing
early warning systems would have done in predicting the current crisis is an area of promising
research.




5   Conclusion


       This paper conducted an extensive review of the early warning indicators literature, and
found a number of variables to be consistently useful in predicting financial crisis incidence
across time, country and crisis in earlier work. These indicators were subsequently included in an
empirical analysis of the 2008-09 crisis. International reserves and real exchange rate
overvaluation, the top two indicators identified in the review, stood out as useful leading
indicators of the current crisis. Reserves were robust to a number of crisis incidence definitions
as well as the inclusion of additional independent variables in multivariate specifications using
an exchange market pressure index as a measure of crisis incidence. Past exchange rate
overvaluation only proved useful for measures of crisis incidence that defined a crisis in terms of
the currency.
       A number of other variables appear as potentially useful leading indicators during the
current crisis, though their robustness across different crisis incidence measures and
specifications was not as compelling. Lower past credit growth, larger current accounts/saving
rates, lower external and short-term debt were associated with lower crisis incidence.
       There remains fertile ground for further research into the effectiveness of early warning
systems in predicting the 2008-09 crisis and beyond. The findings also highlight the potential
economic significance of reserve levels and exchange rate policy in affecting crisis vulnerability.

Appendix 8 – The Effect of Financial Market Development on Crisis Incidence

       Though not figuring prominently in the earlier literature, variables relating to financial
market development may be particularly relevant given the origins of the current crisis. This
appendix examines the relationship between financial market development and crisis incidence.
We measure levels of financial sector development by domestic credit, M2 and M3 expressed as
a percentage of GDP. Market capitalization as a percentage of GDP is also included as an
indicator of domestic financial market size. A more developed financial system may increase its
resilience to external shocks, therefore suggesting a negative relationship between these variables
and crisis incidence. At the same time, countries with more developed financial markets may
have been more exposed to the current crisis given that it originated among developed-world
financial institutions. The effect of financial market development on 2008-09 crisis incidence at
first sight therefore seems ambiguous.
       The table below reports the results of regressing measures of financial market
development on our five crisis incidence variables. The results show a strong negative
relationship between measures of financial market development and crisis incidence, suggesting
that countries with larger or more developed financial markets suffered less from the crisis. All
three level of credit variables appear to be statistically significant leading indicators of crisis
incidence measured either in terms of GDP drops or recourse to the IMF. The level of broad
money measured in terms of M2 or M3 also appears as a highly statistically significant predictor
of crisis incidence measured either in terms of GDP drops or recourse to the IMF, as well as
exchange rate drops. The measure of equity market capitalization provides similar results.
