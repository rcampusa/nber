                                                 ABSTRACT

Despite the large increases in economic inequality since 1970, American survey respondents exhibit
no increase in support for redistribution, in contrast to the predictions from standard theories of redistributive
preferences. We replicate these results but further demonstrate substantial heterogeneity by demographic
groups. In particular, the two groups who have most moved against income redistribution are the elderly
and African-Americans. We find little evidence that these subgroup trends are explained by relative
economic gains or growing cultural conservatism, two common explanations. We further show that
the elderly trend is uniquely American, at least relative to other developed countries with comparable
survey data. While we are unable to provide definitive evidence on the cause of these two groups'
declining redistributive support, we offer additional correlations which may offer fruitful directions
for future research on the topic. One story consistent with the data on elderly trends is that older Americans
worry that redistribution will come at their expense, in particular via cuts to Medicare. We find that
the elderly have grown increasingly opposed to government provision of health insurance and that
controlling for this tendency explains about 40% of their declining support for redistribution. For blacks,
controlling for their declining support of race-targeted aid explains nearly 45% of their differential
decline in redistributive preferences (raising the question of why support for race-targeted aid has
fallen during a period when black economic catch-up to whites has stalled).

Introduction

Since the 1970s the United States has witnessed two trends whose coexistence calls into
question predictions from standard political economy models (e.g., Meltzer and Richard,
1981). As documented extensively in Piketty and Saez (2003) as well as their annual updates,
the U.S. income distribution has grown substantially more concentrated since the 1970s. As
Figure 1 shows, the share of income accruing to the top one percent more than doubled
between 1978 and 2007.1 The growth of inequality has not been limited to the top “one
percent” but also appears in broader distributional measures (Autor, 2014).
   The workhorse political economy model suggests that an individual’s demand for redis-
tribution is a function of mean income minus own income. As inequality increases, a greater
share of the population has income below the mean and thus demand for redistribution rises.
Yet, in reality, demand for income redistribution in the US has remained flat by some mea-
sures and decreased for others (see, e.g., Kuziemko et al. (2013), and we further document
this fact later in the paper). Beyond the US, citizens of other OECD countries that have
seen rising income inequality have generally not exhibited greater demand for redistribution
(Kenworthy and McCall, 2008).
   Explaining this puzzle has inspired a large literature, ranging from racial politics to belief
in upward mobility.2 Our goal in this paper is not to offer a new explanation. Instead, we offer
new “clues” to the puzzle by delving deeper into the U.S. survey data, as well as comparing
it to trends from other developed countries. Our hope is that future work trying to explain
the evolution of redistributive preferences would try to fit the new stylized facts we establish
in this study.
   In the first part of the paper, we replicate past work showing that trends in the demand
for redistribution among Americans has been largely flat or perhaps slightly negative over
this period. We show that this result is robust across different redistributive questions as
well as different datasets.
   We then document (for the first time to our knowledge) the great heterogeneity in trends
for support for redistribution during this time period. We focus on “immutable” demographic
characteristics, so as to put aside worries about compositional changes. Two groups—the
elderly and African-Americans—have significantly decreased their support for redistribution,
relative to other respondents. While race and age differences are pronounced and robust in

the data, we do not find significant gender differences in trends in redistributive preferences.
   The second part of the paper explores potential explanations for our two heterogeneity
results: the relative decline in redistributive support among the elderly and African Ameri-
cans. We begin with the standard model of economic self-interest: have these groups made
relative gains in income or other measures of economic well-being?
   In fact, we make little progress explaining these subgroup trend divergences with economic
and even broader well-being measures. One exception is that educational gains (perhaps
acting as a proxy for permanent income) can explain roughly 30% of the differential elderly
trend (though it remains negative and statistically significant). Otherwise, household income,
perceived place in the income distribution, perceived social class, self-reported health and
subjective well-being and perceived inter- and intra-generational mobility do little to “explain
away” the relative decline in redistributive support among the elderly and blacks.
   A more psychological model of redistributive preferences emphasizes the role of cognitive
dissonance—if an individual becomes more conservative on social issues (e.g., abortion),
she might also become more economically conservative so as to remain consistent in an
ideological or partisan sense.3 We thus subject our differential trend results to a variety
of partisan and ideological controls, as well as control for views on particular hot-button
issues: religious attendance, abortion, gay rights and gun rights. We find little evidence that
a general rightward movement ideologically or culturally among the elderly or blacks has
dragged redistributive views to the right.
   Having failed to explain our divergent trends with common models of redistributive pref-
erences, we attempt explanations drawn from the particular historical or institutional fea-
tures specific to each of these groups. The U.S. elderly have enjoyed tremendous gains in
life expectancy and years of retirement, which our self-reported health and other wellbeing
measures may not capture. These gains have generally been enjoyed by the elderly across the
OECD. To the extent that these broad trends can explain the decline in the elderly’s sup-
port for redistribution, we should see the same results elsewhere. In fact, in every developed
country where comparable data have been collected, the elderly’s support for redistribution
follows either a parallel trend to the rest of adults, or is differentially increasing. Thus, the
decline we find among the elderly appears exclusively American.
   This international evidence leads us to explore whether there exist aspects of U.S redis-
tributive policy that, relative to other countries, are unique in the treatment of the elderly.
   3 The classic citation on cognitive dissonance is Festinger (1957) but we review the more modern
literature and in particular its connection to partisan identity later in the paper.

                                                2
The most obvious candidate is that in the US, the government guarantees health insur-
ance for only one immutable group: the elderly, whereas this coverage is universal in other
developed countries. As Campbell (2003) has noted, the threat of Medicare cuts politically
energizes U.S. seniors. We find evidence that this view may be driving elderly views on redis-
tribution: seniors have grown increasingly opposed to extending the government guarantee
of health coverage and controlling for this changing view explains nearly 40% of the elderly’s
relative decline in redistributive support.
    Finally, to explain the declining support for redistribution among blacks, we are motivated
by the large literature showing that those who believe economic outcomes are the result of
a fair process are more opposed to redistribution. In surveys, blacks are far less likely than
whites to agree that economic outcomes are fair, not surprising given the legacy of slavery
and segregation. And perhaps as a result blacks are far more likely to support race-based
government aid. We show, however, that over the past several decades blacks have moved
significantly toward the white view on these questions. In particular, controlling for views
on race-based government aid explains nearly half of the decline in black redistributive
preferences. We are thus able to provide a proximate determinant of the decline in black
redistributive preferences, which only raises the question of why blacks’ support for race-
based aid has fallen during a period when their economic catch-up to whites has stalled.
    The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. In Section 1 we replicate past findings on
the flat trend in overall redistributive demand in the US over the past several decades, as well
as establish new facts on heterogeneity by demographic subgroup. In Section 2 we explore
how well standard models do in explaining these divergent subgroup results. In Section 3
we explore hypotheses specific to the elderly and in Section 4 we do the same for blacks. In
Section 5 we offer concluding thoughts and suggests areas for future work.


1    Trends in redistributive demand

While aggregate demand for redistribution has not increased over this period of rising in-
equality, in this section we document substantial heterogeneity in this pattern across sub-
groups. To ensure that our heterogeneous patterns are not driven by data or coding differ-
ences between our paper and previous work, we first demonstrate that we can replicate the
earlier finding of flat aggregate demand using our survey measures.




                                               3
1.1    Aggregate trends in redistributive demand
We have identified four questions on redistribution that have been fielded regularly since the
1970s. Our first and focal question is drawn from our primary dataset the General Social
Survey, a representative survey of American households. The GSS asks, “Some people think
that the government in Washington ought to reduce the income differences between the rich
and the poor, perhaps by raising the taxes of wealthy families or by giving income assistance
to the poor. Others think that the government should not concern itself with reducing this
income difference between the rich and the poor. Here is a card with a scale from 1 to 7.
Think of a score of 1 as meaning that the government ought to reduce the income differences
between rich and poor, and a score of 7 meaning that the government should not concern
itself with reducing income differences. What score between 1 and 7 comes closest to the
way you feel?.” We subtract this variable from eight so that it is increasing in support for
redistribution and refer to it as the “reduce differences” variable. It is our preferred measure
because it specifically mentions differences between the rich and the poor, whereas the other
measures focuses more on the poor.
   Figure 2(a) shows a scatterplot, with best-fit lines, of mean response to the “reduce
differences” question over time.4 We present two best fit lines in this graph and those that
follow. The longer is the fit through all years for which we have data. The shorter line, our
preferred estimate, is the best fit through 2006 (the last time the question is asked in the
pre-Great Recession period).
   We prefer to restrict attention to this shorter period for at least four reasons. First,
inequality did not actually increase during the Great Recession, as shown in Figure 1, by
2012 (the most recent year available) the top one percent had yet to regain the steep losses
to their income share incurred in 2008 and 2009. Second, this period also witnessed the
greatest downturn since the Great Depression, which likely has its own effect on redistributive
demand. Third, as we are interested in trends by race, including the administration of the
first black president might well conflate racial attitudes with view of government and thus
not reflect views about redistribution per se. Finally, we wish to hold the redistributive policy
   4 Throughout  the paper we weight samples using the provided survey weights. In the GSS, to
include those respondents from years in which over-samples were conducted, we use the product
of the wtssall and oversamp variables as our weight. Toward the end of our sample period, the
GSS introduces interviews in Spanish (before that time, respondents who could not complete an
English-language version of the survey were excluded). To keep the sample consistent, we drop
those who the GSS deems would have been unable to have taken the interview if it were not in
Spanish (spanint = 2).

                                               4
landscape fairly constant. Leonhardt (2015) described the Affordable Care Act of 2010 as
“the most aggressive attack that the federal government has launched against inequality
since inequality began rising four decades ago.” To the extent we wish to offer clues to the
puzzle of why demand for redistribution did not increase despite rising inequality, it seems
prudent to exclude these most recent years, in which the economic and policy environment
changed dramatically, inequality did not increase on net and which, coming at the end of
the time-series, will greatly influence trend lines.
   Both fitted lines depicts a slight decrease in demand for redistribution, at least as reflected
by this variable. Measured against the left-hand axis, the drop is about 10% of a point on
the seven-point “reduce differences” scale. Because the seven-point scale has no intuitive
interpretation, we also measure the drop in “partisan units.” That is, we normalize the
measure so that zero represents the view of the average respondent over the sample period,
and an increase of one unit for this variable is equal to moving the distance between the
average Republican’s views and the average Democrat’s view on this question.5 Partisan
units are marked on the right-hand axis. Additionally, the -.0042 [.0033] label on the graph
refers to the slope and standard error of the shorter best fit line in “partisan units”; these
numbers indicate that across the 28 year sample period (1978 to 2006) Americans have moved
(0.0042 · 28) nearly 12% of the Democrat-Republican difference on this question, a movement
that is statistically insignificant. Like previous literature, we cannot reject that the trend is
flat despite the standard model’s prediction of rising support given the increasing inequality
of this time period.
   This absence of increasing demand for redistribution is robust across all of our alternative
measures of redistributive support. The second question we have identified, also from the
GSS, asks, “Some people think that the government in Washington should do everything
possible to improve the standard of living of all poor Americans....Other people think it
is not the government’s responsibility, and that each person should take care of himself.”
Respondents are asked to place themselves on a five point scale along the described con-
tinuum, which we again flip to be increasing in redistributive support. As shown in Figure
2(b), by this measure Americans have seen an even greater decline—more than 0.3 partisan
points—in support for redistribution over both our focal and expanded time periods.
   Our third question is on the role of government. The GSS asks, “Some people think
   5 TheGSS asks individuals to rank themselves 1-7 on a Republican-Democrat scale, with 4 being
“independent.” We calculate the difference in the outcome variable between those answering 1-3
(Republican) and those answering 5-7 (Democrat). We then divide the variable by this difference.


                                                5
that the government in Washington is trying to do too many things that should be left to
individuals and private businesses. Others disagree and think that the government should
do even more to solve our country’s problems.” Respondents indicate their place along this
continuum on a one to five scale. We recognize that this question is less directly related to
redistribution than are the first two, but show the results for the sake of robustness. As shown
in Figure 2(c), during this period of increased inequality, Americans have not increased in
their desire for government intervention.
   Our final measure of redistributive preferences comes from the American National Elec-
tion Studies (ANES), a representative sample of voting-age Americans. ANES asks “Some
people feel that the government in Washington should see to it that every person has a job
and a good standard of living....Others think the government should just let each person
get ahead on his/their own.” Respondents place themselves on a seven-point scale on this
continuum, which we flip so that it is increasing in redistributive support. We plot the result
in Figure 2(d). While the sign of the ANES results differs from that using the various GSS
measures, like our main GSS outcome, it is essentially flat.6 Across the four measures, we are
able to replicate the finding of previous literature of no increase in support for redistribution
over this period of increased inequality. As we noted from the onset, this lack of increased
support is puzzling. In an effort to provide clues for solving this puzzle, in the next section
we demonstrate, we believe for the first time, that these aggregate trends mask substantial
heterogeneity across demographic groups.


1.2     Trends by subgroup
In this section we examine how the trend in support for redistribution varies by immutable
demographic subgroups: age, race and sex.

1.2.1      Trends by age

In Figure 3(a) we return to our focal GSS “reduce differences” question and demonstrate
remarkable heterogeneity in the trends of younger and older respondents. Over our 28 year
sample period, while those under 65 saw no significant change in mean desire for the reduction
of income inequality, those aged 65 or older grew increasingly negative toward redistribution.
Looking at our standardized party scale on the right-hand axis, we see that across our
   6 Our last ANES datapoint is 2008. The question is fielded again in 2012, but at the time of
analysis only preliminary data were available for that wave.


                                               6
sample period, the elderly decreased their support by more than 50% of the Democrat-
Republican difference. This relative decrease among the elderly is robust to using our ANES
redistribution question (Figure 3b). By this measure young Americans have seen a marginally
significant increase of about 20% of a partisan unit over the 36 year sample period, while
the elderly show a significant decline of roughly 40% of the party difference over the time
period. By either measure, the relative position of the elderly has flipped; the group begins
the time period more in favor of redistribution than the rest of the population (significantly
so in the GSS), but end the time series significantly less supportive (both for the GSS and
the ANES).

1.2.2   Trends by race

The second demographic split we investigate is race. Because of sample size limitations, we
are able to examine only two racial groups: blacks and whites.7 Like with age, we demonstrate
in Figure 3 remarkable differences in trends by race in both the GSS (subfigure c) and the
ANES (subfigure d). While there has been no significant movement on the issue by whites,
in both datasets, blacks, who have a much higher desire for redistribution on average, have
significantly decreased their support, by nearly half of a partisan unit in the GSS and about
90% of a unit in the ANES, over their respective sample periods.

1.2.3   Trends by gender

Unlike for race and age, we do not find significant trend differences by gender in either
dataset. In both the GSS and the ANES, we see that women have a higher demand for
redistribution than men and the sexes trend similarly—decreasing (increasing) in support in
the GSS (ANES)—over time (See Figure 4). This non-result is somewhat surprising given
the large income gains women have made relative to men over the same time period.


1.3     Discussion
While Americans overall have exhibited no marked trend in their support for redistribution
over the past four decades, our subgroup analyses have identified two groups with markedly
negative trends over time: the elderly and African-Americans. These groups are in fact among
  7 Moreover,   the GSS only asks about Hispanic ethnicity consistently beginning in 2000.




                                                 7
the most dependent on transfers, making their redistributive trends a priori surprising.8 In
the next section, we explore whether commonly used models of redistributive preferences
may explain the divergent trends of these two subgroups.


2     Can standard models of redistributive preferences explain sub-
      group trends

In this section, we explore to what extent we can “explain away” the black and elderly
differential trends that we uncovered in the previous section, using controls suggested by
common models of redistributive preferences.


2.1     Economic self-interest
The workhorse political economy model has voters maximizing after-tax income, with de-
mand for redistribution an increasing function of the difference between their income and
that of the average tax-payer. We thus begin our exploration of why the elderly and African-
Americans have differentially moved against redistribution by examining the robustness of
their differential trends to a myriad of income controls. As we tend to prefer the main GSS
redistribution question (i.e., our “reduce differences” question), we focus on that data source
in the analysis that follows, though all results are robust to using the ANES and for some
key results we will report the parallel ANES analysis.
    Col. (1) of Table 1 quantifies the relative decline among the elderly in support for redis-
tribution, essentially replicating the first panel (shorter time period, through 2006) of Figure
3 in regression form. With no controls besides the Elderly dummy and year fixed effects,
the elderly (relative to others) decrease their answer to this question by roughly 0.20 points
(on a seven-point scale) per year. Again, as the units of this coefficient have no intuitive
interpretation, below the table we provide two alternative measures of the magnitude of our
findings. First, we divide the coefficient by the variable’s standard deviation and report it
as the “scaled effect (SD)”. Second, we divide the coefficient by the Democrat-Republican
difference on this question, and report it as the “scaled effect (party)” below the coefficient
estimate. As the coefficient is in terms of 100 years whereas our GSS sample period typically
    8 Between1978 and 2006, the average share of total income coming from government transfers for
the elderly was approximately 65%; as opposed to roughly 10% for the non-elderly. Similarly, over
the same period, the average share for African Americans was about 25%; as opposed to around
15% for whites. Authors’ calculations using CPS data.


                                                8
spans 28 years (depending on the outcome question), the “scaled effect” listed in col. (1)
suggests that over this period, the elderly have differentially shifted their views on this ques-
tion by roughly 29% of a standard deviation (0.28 · 1.023), or by an amount equal to roughly
fifty percent (1.846 · 0.28) of the partisan gap on this question (moving in the “Republican”
direction).
   Col. (5) shows the parallel analysis for blacks. The coefficient of interest suggests that
over our 28-year sample period, relative to other groups, black support for redistribution
has moved 22% of a standard deviation or a distance equal to 37% (1.316 · 0.28) of the
Democrat-Republican gap on this question (again, in the Republican direction), consistent
with Figure 3(c).
   In columns (2) and (6) we add household income controls. We use the GSS realinc
measure, converted to 2014 dollars, and adjust for household size as in Stevenson and Wolfers
(2013). We also have a separate control for the roughly ten percent of respondents who have
missing information for this variable. Below the coefficient estimates, we report the “share
explained” (merely one minus the coefficient of interest after we include controls divided by
the original coefficient). For both groups, controlling for household income has essentially
no effect on the coefficient of interest. For the elderly, the income controls “explain” roughly
four percent of the original effect. For blacks, including income controls actually increases
the magnitude of the group’s differential trend, though, again, in both cases the effect is
close to zero.
   Especially for the elderly (many of whom are retired), actual income may be a noisy
proxy for economic well-being, and thus in cols. (3) and (7) we use education (fixed effects
for highest degree attained) as a proxy for permanent income. For the elderly (col. 3), this
control has some explanatory power, reducing the original coefficient by nearly 30% (though
the elderly differential trend remains negative and highly significant). In col. (7), controlling
for education once again increases (very slightly) the black differential trend.
   The controls we have used so far are based on respondents’ assessments of absolute,
objective measures. In the final set of analyses in Table 1 we control for more subjective and
relative measures: where the respondent places her household in the U.S. income distribution
relative to the average household (fixed effects for far below, below, average, above and far
above) and which class she sees herself in (lower, working, middle or upper). For neither
group do these controls go far in explaining different trends. The controls serve to reduce
the elderly coefficient by less than 15% and the black coefficient by less than 10%.


                                               9
   We perform a number of robustness checks related to the results in Table 1. First,
we demonstrate that the elderly and black trends (cols 1 and 4) are robust to control-
ling for each other simultaneously as well as simultaneously controlling for f emale × year,
top income quintile × year, college × year (see Online Appendix Table A.1). As such, the
black and elderly trends appear to be separately identifiable phenomena and separate from
any other groups’ trend.
   While we noted earlier that our preferred sample period excludes the Great Recession
years, in Online Appendix Table A.2 extend our sample period through 2012. While hetero-
geneity by age is greater over the longer time frame, the race gap shrinks substantially and
is no longer statistically significant when we include the period confounded by the Great
Recession, the first black president and the passage of the Affordable Care Act. However,
the limited ability of covariates to explain the basic trends holds true for both groups in this
extended period.
   In Online Appendix Table A.3 we show that the results of cols 2-5 and 6-8 in Table 1 are
robust to interacting each of these economic controls with the main effect (elderly or black,
depending on the specification). These specifications allow the controls to have different
effects on redistributive preferences across our key groups. In fact, this flexibility tends to
have less explanatory power in terms of explaining the differential trends among blacks, and
thus the differential trends that remains tend to grow using this specification.
   To maximize sample size, we create a separate category for observations with missing
household income values, but Online Appendix Table A.4 shows that our results hold if we
instead drop these observations. Finally, while we will use OLS for ease of interpretation, in
Online Appendix Table A.5 we show that our results are robust to using an ordered probit
model. In fact, the cut-points generated by the ordered probit model are very close to linear
(Online Appendix Figure A.1), suggesting OLS is a reasonable estimating model.
   Besides probing the specifications and regression samples used in Table 1, in Table 2 we
also explored whether broader measures of well-being, economic or otherwise, might better
explain the differential trends of the elderly and blacks. For ease of comparison (and because
some questions are only asked in a subset of sample years) each odd numbered column pro-
vides the baseline elderly or black specification with no additional controls on the subsample
of observations with non-missing responses to the controls used in the even numbered column
that follows. In Cols. (2) and (8) the control is self-reported happiness, which fails to explain
the elderly trend at all, but does lead to a small (ten percent) reduction in the black dif-


                                               10
ferential trend (though it remains highly significant), consistent with Stevenson and Wolfers
(2013) findings on black-white happiness convergence. Given the large life-expectancy gains
to the elderly (a topic to which we return briefly in Section 3) we control for self-assessed
health in cols. (4) and (10), which reduces the elderly and black coefficients by only eight
and two percent respectively.
   Finally, in cols. (6) and (12) we explore the explanatory power of views on intergenera-
tional mobility, which past authors have found reduces support for redistribution.9 Specif-
ically, we control for whether the respondent thinks that her children’s standard of living
will be worse than her own and whether she feels that her standard of living is worse than
her parents (we drop childless respondents). Only the latter control significantly correlates
with redistributive preferences. The inclusion of both mobility variables serves to increase
our key coefficients slightly. While we do not have intragenerational questions in the GSS,
the ANES asks whether the respondent believes that she will be better off next year. That
variable’s inclusion does not change the black and elderly differential trends significantly
(results available upon request).10


2.2        Increased conservatism and cognitive dissonance
A second hypothesis that we explore is that the declines in redistributive support among the
elderly and blacks are part of a larger trend of increased conservatism amongst these groups.
Kelly and Enns (2010), find that increased income inequality is associated with increased
conservatism. To the extent that this effect was differentially large for blacks and the elderly,
these groups may have become relatively more conservative over time.
   To explore the possibility of increasing conservatism more generally as a cause of in-
creased conservatism in redistributive views, in Table 3 we examine the extent to which our
differential trends by age (race) are “explained” by controls for conservatism. We recognize,
however, that a significant correlation between redistributive attitudes and other attitudes
could result from redistributive views as either cause or effect. Scholars have demonstrated
the relevance of the theory of cognitive dissonance (Festinger, 1957)—which posits a need
for internal consistency—to political views. (See for example Beasley and Joslyn, 2001, Mul-
   9 SeeChecchi et al. (1999) and Corneo and Grüner (2002) on the connection between intergen-
erational mobility and redistributive preferences.
  10 The classic treatment of redistributive demand as a function of personal mobility is Hirschman

and Rothschild (1973). A more recent application with Russian data is Ravallion and Lokshin
(2000).


                                                11
lainathan and Washington (2009) and Gerber et al. (2010).)
   But in fact the results of Table 3 demonstrate that for neither blacks nor the elderly is
the decline in redistributive support explained by a general movement toward conservatism.
In column 1 (5) we repeat the basic uncontrolled age (race) specification for comparison.
In cols. (2) and (6) we control for party identification (a one to seven scale running from
strong Democrat through strong Republican). For both blacks and the elderly, controlling for
party identification makes the magnitude of the differential redistributive trend even larger
(15% so in the case of blacks). As these coefficient patterns suggest, despite their movement
away from redistribution, blacks and the elderly have become no more Republican (and in
fact blacks have become, relatively speaking, significantly more Democratic, as whites have
moved away from the party while blacks have remained loyal).
   Cols. 3 and 7 show that, unlike party identification, controlling for political ideology (a
seven-point scale from extremely liberal through extremely conservative) does decrease the
coefficients of interest, but by a small amount (11% for the elderly and under 3% for blacks).
Finally, as Layman (1997) and others since have noted, religious attendance has become
increasingly linked with conservatism, so in cols. (4) and (8) we add a nine-point scale of
attendance (from never attend to more than weekly) as a control. As with political ideology,
the effect on the coefficients of interest is very limited, although this time with a larger
decrease for blacks (7%) than for the elderly (under 2%).
   In a final test of the general conservatism hypothesis we explore how views on certain
political “hot-button” issues—abortion, homosexuality and gun control—serve to explain our
patterns. We relegate these results to Online Appendix Table A.6 because of loss of sample
size. Nonetheless, like the more global attitudinal measures, these single issues explain less
than 10 percent of our trends in redistributive views by age and race. We find no evidence
that the decline in redistributive support for either blacks or the elderly is part of a wider
trend toward ideological or cultural conservatism.


2.3    Discussion
In general, controls associated with common models of redistributive preferences have limited
power to explain why the elderly and African-Americans have moved against redistribution,
relative to other Americans. In the case of the elderly, we find some evidence that the standard
model of economic self-interest may hold, as controlling for education (potentially a better
proxy of permanent income for this largely retired population than current annual income)


                                              12
reduces the differential elderly trend by 30%. For blacks, these standard controls enjoy even
less success in reducing the magnitude of the coefficient of interest.
     In the final two sections of the paper, we move beyond standard redistributive theories
and instead explore whether historical or institutional factors specific to each of these groups
can provide clues to their declining support for redistribution.


3     Explanations specific to the elderly

3.1     Do unobserved changes to elderly wellbeing explain their trend?
While we are able to observe and control for economic and attitudinal shifts among the
elderly in our sample period, our controls perhaps imperfectly capture large, underlying
trends for this group. Life expectancy over our sample period has significantly increased,
and along with it the total years of retirement that individuals can expect to enjoy. Perhaps
as a reaction, there have been increasing calls in policy circles to raise the age of eligibility
for collecting government retirement benefits, which could affect the elderly’s redistributive
preferences.
     In the United States, life expectancy for men (women) at age 65 increased from 13.2 (16.9)
years in 1970 to 17.8 (20.4) in 2011.11 And, indeed those 65 and over reporting good or very
good health between 1982 and 2011 grew from 65% to 75%.12 While we tried controlling for
health in our regression analysis, we may not be fully capturing these gains in wellbeing, nor
the effect of the corresponding policy pressure on retirement ages.
     The parallel trends of increasing life expectancy at age 65 and the postponement of full
retirement benefits generally hold across OECD countries. In this section we ask, is the
relative decline in redistributive support among the elderly replicated in other developed
countries?


3.2     Comparing the elderly: international evidence
The General Social Survey and the ANES are relatively unusual in providing the ability
to examine several decades-long trends regarding redistributive preferences. Multi-country
surveys such as the World Values Survey or the European Social Survey have only been fielded

three or four times (and in the case of the latter, only once before the 2008 economic crisis)
and are thus of limited use for long-run trend analysis. To place our results for the American
elderly in a comparative context we performed a comprehensive search of the survey data
from 17 developed countries and found only three had similar data: the UK, Germany and
Sweden.13 In all three cases the available span of years was more limited. While more data
would have been ideal, these countries give us coverage from another Anglo-Saxon economy,
as well as continental Europe and Scandinavia.
   The immutability of age and the fact that all our case countries have state-run pension
programs, allows us to examine elderly support for redistribution cross-nationally. Each
of these countries has exhibited similar gains in life expectancy conditional on reaching
the retirement age, and all but one (Sweden) have planned increases in their “pensionable
ages.”14 As such, if these broad trends were causing the decline in the American elderly’s
redistributive preferences, we should see similar evidence abroad. We discuss the three data
sources briefly before presenting the cross-national evidence.

3.2.1     United Kingdom Data

The British Social Attitudes (BSA) survey has been administered annually since 1983. Sam-
pling aims to be representative of the British population and each year roughly 3,000 re-
spondents are interviewed in their homes. Britain is an especially useful comparison to the
US given its historical connections but also because the country has seen a marked rise in
pre-tax income inequality (though somewhat smaller than the increase in the US) since the
1980s (Atkinson et al., 2011).
   In roughly half of the years since 1983, the BSA has asked three questions related to
redistributive preferences. The first asks whether the government should “reduce income
differences.” Respondents indicate their agreement with the idea on a five-point scale. The
second asks about the gaps between high and low incomes (“too small” being coded as one,
while “too large” coded as three). Finally, related to the first question, a third question asks
whether “the government should redistribute income” and again gives respondents a five-
point scale to indicate their agreement. We take the first as our focal question and relegate
analysis of the remaining questions to the Online Appendix.
  13 We   detail our search, including surveys consulted and the wording and years of relevant ques-
tions, in Online Appendix B.
   14 See “Trends in Pension Eligibility Ages and Life Expectancy, 1950-2050,” OECD publication.




                                                14
3.2.2   German Data

The German General Social Survey has been fielded roughly every other year since 1980.15
Unfortunately, the German GSS redistributive questions are both less comparable to the
American GSS and asked less frequently than those in the BSA. The German GSS asks
individuals to place themselves on a four-point scale based on agreement with: “The state
must ensure that people can live on a decent income, even in illness, hardship, unemployment
and old age.” In another question, again using a four-point scale, individuals are asked to
react to the statement “Income should not be based solely on individual achievement. Instead,
everybody should have what they and their family need for a decent life” as well as “Only
when differences in income and in social standing are large enough, is there an incentive
for individual achievement.” Given that the first statement involves the role of government,
we take it as the one closest to the GSS “reduce income differences” question and therefore
define it as our focal question, again relegating analyses using the remaining questions to
the Online Appendix.

3.2.3   Swedish Data

The Swedish National Election Studies (SNES) Program was established in 1954 to study
public opinion and voting behavior. Since 1988, the SNES has asked respondents to indicate
their agreement (on a five point scale) with the statement: “Here are a number of proposals
that have appeared in the political debate. What is your opinion about...the proposal to:
Reduce income differences in society.”

3.2.4   International Evidence

We replicate our elderly graphs using the international data in Appendix Figures 1, 2 and
3. For each country, it is clear that the elderly are not differentially moving away from
redistribution, relative to the rest of the population. Additionally, we recognize that the
German reunification introduced composition issues, but in Online Appendix Figure A.6 we
find that the same general pattern holds when we restrict the sample to those living in the
territory of old Federal Republic (West Germany).
   In Figure 5 we attempt to compare these trends in a more harmonized way across our
five datasets (our three datasets from European countries plus the ANES and GSS). We first
  15 According to the German Social Survey (ALLBUS) Program, prior to German reunification
the sample of respondents was drawn from West Germany and West Berlin.


                                             15
standardize each of the questions by dividing by its standard deviation. We next regress,
separately for each dataset, these standardized variables on an elderly dummy, year fixed
effects and an elderly-specific trend (i.e., the col. 1 specification in Table 1). We then generate
lines defined by the elderly dummy and the elderly trend, so that for each year we give
the predicted difference in support for redistribution among the elderly relative to others,
separately by dataset. We only generate this line over the sample period of each dataset.
   Figure 5 highlights how differently the elderly have evolved on redistribution in the US
relative to similar, wealthy countries. Each of the other countries show, if anything, that the
elderly are growing more supportive of redistribution relative to others (significantly so in
Germany and Sweden). For each of the U.S. datasets, the 95% confidence intervals do not
include any of the point-estimates generated by the European data.
   Past work has found that relative to other developed countries, American social spending
is more tilted toward the elderly (see, e.g., Lynch, 2001 and Tepe and Vanhuysse, 2010). In
fact, these calculations typically exclude health spending, suggesting elderly-bias is under-
stated in the US, as until very recently the elderly were one of the few groups guaranteed
government-subsidized health care in the US. The disproportionate gains to the American
elderly in terms of social spending over the past several decades may make them wary of ex-
tending redistributive programs. The next section explores this idea in the context of health
insurance.


3.3       Do views on government health insurance explain the elderly
          trend?
As the previous section noted, the elderly in the US have many important similarities with
their counterparts in other OECD countries. However, the U.S. social insurance system
exhibits a key difference: Those 65 and over are the only immutable group universally guar-
anteed government provided health insurance (i.e., not means-tested or dependent on doc-
umented disability status), whereas in other OECD countries that benefit does not depend
on age.
   Extending that protection to the rest of the population has been a key policy goal for
the American left for decades. Indeed, the last two Democratic presidents made passing
universal health insurance their first major policy goal upon taking office, though only the
current president, Barack Obama, can be said to have succeeded in that realm. In fact, views
about whether “it is the government’s responsibility to pay for doctor’s and hospital bills”

                                                16
predict both Democratic party identification and self-identification as “liberal” as strongly
as do views on redistribution.16
   In this section we explore the idea that seniors, a group unique in having guaranteed
health insurance, may increasingly feel that expansions of redistributive programs could
come at their expense. This is a view supported somewhat by the academic literature, most
recently McInerney et al. (2015), who find a reduction in spending on Medicare patients
following state Medicaid expansions. However, like prior work on the topic, the authors find
no evidence of reductions in health access or outcomes. Well placed or not, as we mentioned
previously, past work has shown that the fear of Medicare cuts triggers seniors’ political
activism (Campbell (2003)).17
   In this section we ask two questions: have seniors become increasingly opposed to gov-
ernment health insurance over our sample period and, if so, can this increased opposition
explain their general decline in redistributive sentiment?

3.3.1       Seniors’ views on government health insurance

Both the GSS and the ANES ask respondents about their views on government health
insurance. We focus on the GSS as this question is asked more often, though demonstrate
robustness with the ANES. Figure 6(a) shows the evolution over our sample period of views
on whether the government has the responsibility to pay for medical bills, separately for
seniors and other adults. Seniors show a significant decline in their support on this question,
moving (in the Republican direction) about one-third the partisan gap. In contrast, other
adults have become significantly more favorable toward the idea that government bears some
responsibility for covering medical costs.
   One might ask how, by the end of our sample period, seniors can be less supportive
of the idea that government cover medical bills given that they, uniquely, are categorically
entitled to this coverage. Mettler (2010) analyzes a 2008 survey, finding that 40% of Medicare
recipients answer that “they do not use a government social program,” suggesting a lower
bound of 40% of Medicare recipients who do not consider Medicare a government social
program. Most Medicare recipients pay a premium (that covers 25% of Part B costs), perhaps
leading them to think they cover the actuarial cost of the program. Finally, an increasing
share of Medicare beneficiaries join private Medicare Advantage health plans (fully financed

  17 This
        idea was certainly emphasized by media outlets that broadcasted video of irate seniors

                                              17
by capitation payments paid by the federal government), perhaps further weakening the
program’s association with government.

3.3.2   Views on government health insurance and redistribution

In Table 4, we explore whether respondents’ views on government’s role in covering medical
bills explains the divergent trends of the elderly and African-Americans on redistribution.
The first two columns of the table focus on the elderly results, with col. (1) replicating the
baseline results with no additional controls, but including only the subsample that answers
the government health insurance question. Col. (2) adds the control for views on government
covering medical bills. Not surprisingly, views on health insurance strongly predict views on
redistribution: moving one unit on this 1-5 question (so, from support to strongly support
the idea that government should cover medical bills) increases support for redistribution by
0.50 points (or 40% of the partisan gap on redistribution).
   More relevant for our analysis, controlling for this variable has a meaningful effect on the
differential elderly trend over redistributive preferences. The coefficient is reduced by 40%,
though remains significant at the ten percent level and given the size of the standard errors,
statistically indistinguishable from the original coefficient. This result is robust to controlling
more flexibly for view on health insurance (allowing it to enter as a fixed effect for each level
of support, instead of continuously, and interacting it with the elderly indicator). Results are
available upon request.
   Given how many potential stories we have tested in the GSS and found had little ex-
planatory power, we worry that random chance might suggest that one story might show
statistical significance even if it had no true explanatory power. To somewhat assuage these
concerns, we replicate these patterns of results in the ANES. Most years since the 1970s, the
ANES has fielded the following question: “Some people feel there should be a government
insurance plan which would cover all medical and hospital expenses for everyone...Others feel
that medical expenses should be paid by individuals, and through private insurance plans.
Where do you place yourself on this scale?” We flip the variable so that it is increasing in
support for government health insurance.
   Figure 6(b) shows how elderly versus other adult respondents have evolved on this ques-
tion. As with the GSS, the elderly started the sample period more supportive than other
adults, but have substantially moved against the idea, so that by the end of the sample period
they are well below the rest of adults in their support. As in the GSS, non-elderly adults have


                                                18
become more supportive of the idea of government insurance. When we replicate the Table
4 analysis using ANES data, we find that attitudes toward government insurance explain
a larger share —nearly 60%—of the differential elderly trend on redistributive preferences,
rendering the coefficient of interest insignificant. Results are available upon request.
     A final point to discuss about both the GSS and ANES regression results is that the effect
of controlling for views on health insurance is more muted for the regressions comparing
black and non-black redistributive trends. Blacks have slightly reduced their support for
government insurance relative to others, but the differential trend is small and insignificant,
supporting the idea that growing reservations about government health insurance is a trend
unique to the elderly during this period.


4      Blacks and fairness

There is a large literature linking redistributive preferences to perceptions of fairness (see
for example Alesina and Angeletos, 2005 and Durante et al., 2013). Those who believe the
distribution of income is fair are less likely to support government redistribution. Blacks fit
this model. Although we have shown their support is declining, the level of black support
for income redistribution remains higher than that of whites. Blacks are also on average
less likely than whites to say that economic rewards are fairly earned, a belief that is not
surprising given a legacy of slavery and segregation.
     There are reasons to believe, however, that black views about fairness may be changing.
Although the black-white earnings gap is remarkably persistent,18 Stevenson and Wolfers
(2013) document in the GSS a decline in the black-white happiness gap, a finding the authors
attribute to social gains in the arena of civil rights. In this section we ask two questions.
First, do blacks believe that economic rewards are becoming more fairly distributed And
if so, does this changing view “explain,” in a regression sense, their decreased support for
redistribution?
     We measure respondents’ sense of fairness using three questions across two surveys. Our
first question, drawn from the GSS, asks “Some people say that people get ahead by their
own hard work; others say that lucky breaks or help from other people are more important.
Which do you think is most important?” Valid answers are 1) hard work 2) equally important
    18 See
        Altonji and Blank (1999) on the stalling of the black-white wage convergence. In the most
recent decade, the black-white gap has in fact grown (see www.census.gov/prod/2013pubs/p60-
245.pdf).


                                               19
and 3) luck. We refer to this as our “luck” question. In Figure 7 we graph responses by race.
Two things are notable. First, as expected blacks are on average more likely than whites
to say luck is more important than hard work. But second, the back-white gap has closed
significantly—by a full partisan unit—over our sample period.
   We next complement the fairness measure by examining views on aid targeted specif-
ically to blacks. Is an increasing sense of fairness coupled with a view that race specific
aid is less desirable? Both the GSS and the ANES have questions on this issue. The GSS
asks, “Some people think that (Blacks/Negroes/African-Americans) have been discriminated
against for so long that the government has a special obligation to help improve their liv-
ing standards. Others believe that the government should not be giving special treatment
to (Blacks/Negroes/African-Americans). Where would you place yourself on this scale, or
haven’t you made up your mind on this?” Respondents are offered a scale from government
should help blacks (1) through no special treatment (5). ANES asks, “Some people feel that
the government in Washington should make every possible effort to improve the social and
economic position of blacks and other minority groups. (Suppose these people are at one end
of a scale, at point 1. Others feel that the government should not make any special effort to
help blacks because they should help themselves. Suppose these people are at the other end,
at point 7. And, of course, some other people have opinions somewhere in between, at points
2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. Where would you place yourself on this scale, or haven’t you thought much
about it?” We reorient both measures so that they are increasing in support for race-based
aid. We refer to these questions as our GSS and ANES “black aid” questions.
   As shown in Figure 8 responses to the ANES and GSS questions show similar patterns.
In both cases, blacks are, unsurprisingly, more likely than whites to support government aid
targeted to blacks. But what is remarkable is that the views by race are converging, as over
time blacks have become less supportive of special treatment for blacks by the government.
And like the movement on the luck measure, the trend for blacks on government aid to blacks
is quite steep. The scaled drop in support is over three-quarters of full party distance in the
GSS and more than 1.5 times that distance in the ANES. Blacks view the economic system
as becoming increasingly fair and are decreasingly supportive of government targeted aid
based on race.
   Does this changing sense of fairness “explain” blacks’ decreased support for redistribu-
tion? We examine this question in Table 5. In columns 1 and 2 (5 and 6 for the patterns by
age) we limit focus to the sample for which we have non-missing responses to the “luck” ques-


                                              20
tion. We find like previous literature that a belief that luck determines outcomes positively
predicts support for redistribution. Nonetheless, controlling for this belief only accounts for
two percent of the black-white redistribution trend gap. (The luck control explains none
of the elderly pattern.) In the remaining columns of the table we restrict attention to the
sample for which we have non-missing responses to the “black aid” question. Support for
“black aid” predicts support for redistribution. And controlling for “black aid” explains 45%
of the decline in black support for redistribution. But this “explanation” is not unique to
blacks. The control explains over 20% of the decline in elderly support.
    Thus although we have “explained” in a regression sense nearly half of the black trend
in redistribution, we recognize that this “explanation” creates new puzzles: Why, in the face
of stalled economic catch up, are blacks decreasingly supportive of racially targeted aid?


5    Conclusion

Americans have had a puzzling reaction to rising economic inequality. Across a 30-40 year
period of increasing inequality, survey respondents have failed to increase their support for
redistribution. While we do not claim to have resolved the mystery, we have tried to offer a
number of clues.
    First, we demonstrated that the overall flat trend in support for redistribution, masks con-
siderable and surprising heterogeneity. Blacks and the elderly, two groups who are relatively
more reliant on government assistance, have significantly decreased support for redistribution
over the sample period relative to other Americans.
    Second, we probed various hypotheses as to why redistributive support has trended down-
ward amongst these populations. We do not find evidence consistent with more common
models of redistribution. Measures of economic and more general well-being fail to explain
(in a regression sense) either trend, with the exception of the education control (perhaps
a proxy for permanent income in a retired population) which explains about a 30% of the
elderly trend. Nor do we find evidence that these trends reflect a wider movement towards
conservatism amongst these groups. In fact, blacks have identified increasingly as Democrats
over the period.
    Third, we moved beyond the more basic models to generate and test hypotheses unique
to each group. In the case of the elderly, we can rule out that the trend is driven by something
particular to the modern aging process, as we do not see a similar pattern in OECD countries
with comparable data. Instead, we hypothesize that the trend derives from a uniquely Amer-

                                               21
ican concern. The elderly in the US are the only immutable group entitled to government
health insurance. Thus we ask in this period in which universal health care has moved in
and out of policy discussions, whether seniors, perhaps concerned about the crowd out of
funding for their own care, have grown increasingly unsupportive of extending guaranteed
government health care. We find not only a trend of decreasing support for universal care,
but that this variable “explains” 40% of the elderly’s decreased support for redistribution.
   For blacks, we offer not as much of a hypothesis, but the identification of a concur-
rent trend. We find that blacks, while more likely than whites to support racially-targeted
government aid, are converging toward the opinion of whites. (Concurrently and perhaps
relatedly, blacks are increasingly likely to say that economic outcomes can be attributed to
hard work over luck.) We find this decrease in support for race-based aid “explains” nearly
45% of blacks’ decreased support for redistribution, a finding that deepens the puzzle: Why
is support for race-targeted aid decreasing during a period in which the black-white wage
gap has stagnated?
   Finally, while we have framed the question for the most part as “why have blacks moved
against redistribution” an equally legitimate framing is “why have whites not moved against
redistribution.” A possibility is that whites turned against redistribution during the Civil
Rights movement, when blacks became more able to enjoy the benefits of full citizenship and
government safety-net benefits. To the extent that whites’ reaction to this one-time shock
was either an over-reaction (and thus led to some regression to the mean) or a drop in support
to an extreme negative value (and thus floor effects prevent a further negative trend) then
mechanically whites may be unable to move further against redistribution. Unfortunately, it
is difficult to piece together a consistent time series on redistributive preferences from both
before and after the Civil Rights movement. However Kuziemko and Washington (2015)
show that among whites declines in Democratic party identification (a potential proxy for
redistributive preferences) after 1963 are highly correlated with conservative racial views,
especially in the South.19

  19 We thank our discussant Peter Enns for this fascinating hypothesis. It picks up on an idea in
Lee and Roemer (2006) that before the Democratic Party’s 1960s Civil Rights initiatives, “it was
possible, in the South, to vote both ‘redistributive’ and ‘racist’ simultaneously. Afterwards it was
not—and the Southern white vote gradually moved from the Democratic to Republican parties.
Thus, ironically, the Civil Rights Movement may have decreased the degree of redistribution in the
United States.”

Notes: Figures depict measures of redistributive preferences: a) The eqwlth variable from the GSS
which since 1978 asks whether the government should reduce income difference; b) The helppoor
variable (GSS) which since 1975 asks whether the government should improve the standard of
living of the poor; c) The helpnot variable (GSS) which since 1975 asks whether the government is
trying to do too many things and d) The VCF0809 variable from the ANES, 1972-2008, which
asks whether the government should ensure that each person has a job and a good standard of
living. The shorter lines (graphs a-c) depict trends through 2006 only; the longer line through
2012. Variables are reoriented (if necessary) so that scales are increasing in support for
redistribution. The left-hand axes show “native units” of each variable. The right-hand axes plot
a linear transformation of each variable in which it is demeaned and divided by the partisan gap,
where partisan gap is the difference between the average Democrat and the average Republican
answering that question. Therefore, 0 on the right-hand axes represents the view of the average
respondent during the sample period, and a one-unit positive change is equal to moving (in the
Democratic direction) the distance between the average Democrat and the average Republican.

Notes: Figure depicts the difference in the standardized trends in redistributive support between
the elderly and nonelderly (elderly minus non-elderly) as measured in each national survey: For
the UK, whether the government should reduce income differences (incdiff variable in the British
Social Attitudes Survey, 1985–2004); for Germany, whether the state should ensure people a decent
income (V183 variable in the German General Social Survey, 1984–2004); for Sweden, whether the
government should reduce income differences (v121, v130, v131, v142, v153 and v406 variables
in the Swedish National Election Studies Program, 1988–2006); for the US (GSS), whether the
government should reduce income differences (eqwlth variable, 1978–2006); for the US (ANES),
whether the government should ensure that each person has a job and a good standard of living
(VCF0809 variable, 1972–2008). The dependent variable in each dataset is reoriented so that scales
are increasing in support for redistribution and is divided by its standard deviation. Slopes and

Notes: Figures depict responses to the help sick variable from the GSS which asks since 1974
whether the government has the responsibility to pay for medical bills and to the VCF0806
variable from the ANES, 1972-2008, which asks whether there should be government provided
health insurance for all. The shorter line (graph a) depicts trends through 2006; the longer line
through 2012. Variables are reoriented (if necessary) so that scales are increasing in support for
public health care. The left-hand axes show “native units” of each variable. The right-hand axes
plot a linear transformation of each variable in which it is demeaned and divided by the partisan
gap, where partisan gap is the difference between the average Democrat and the average
Republican answering that question. Therefore, 0 on the right-hand axes represents the view of
the average respondent during the sample period, and a one-unit positive change is equal to
moving (in the Democratic direction) the distance between the average Democrat and the average
Republican.

All regressions run using GSS data and contain year fixed effects, cluster standard errors by year,
and use provided survey weights. Col. (1) and (5) contain no additional controls except an elderly
(black) indicator variable. Col. (2) and (6) contain the income measure (realinc) adjusted for
household size (we follow the OECD and give each additional adult beyond the head a weight of
0.5 and each child a weight of 0.3) and inflation and coding missing values to zero, as well as an
indicator variable for having a missing value for this variable. We lose some observations due to
missing household-size inputs. Cols. (3) and (7) include fixed effects for highest degree attained
(‘missing’ is its own category). Cols. (4) and (8) contain fixed effects for the five possible answers
to where you see yourself in the U.S income distribution and the four possible answers for your
self-assessed social class (‘missing’ is its own category). Section 2.1 provides additional detail.

Appendix Figure 1: Agreement that government should reduce income differences, elderly
versus others, British Social Attitudes survey




Notes: This figure depicts responses since 1985 in the British Social Attitudes (BSA) on whether
the government should reduce income differences. The graph uses the incdiff variable from the
BSA (though subtracts it from six so that it is increasing in support for government activism). The
shorter line depicts the trend line from 1985 to 2004 only.

German General Social Survey (ALLBUS)




Notes: This figure depicts responses since 1984 in the German General Social Survey (ALLBUS)
on whether the state should ensure people a decent income. The graph uses the V183 variable
from the ALLBUS (though subtracts it from five so that it is increasing in support for government
activism). The shorter line depicts the trend line from 1984 to 2004 only.

v130, v131, v142, v153 and v406 variables from the SNES in the years presented above, respectively
(though subtracts it from six so that it is increasing in support for government activism).

Notes: This figure depicts responses since 1983 in the British Social Attitudes (BSA) on the gap
between high and low incomes. The graph uses the incomgap variable from the BSA (though
subtracts it from four so that it is increasing in the size of the perceived gap). The shorter line
depicts the trend line from 1985 to 2004 only.

Notes: This figure depicts responses since 1985 in the British Social Attitudes (BSA) on the support
for government redistribution of income. The graph uses the redistrb variable from the BSA (though
subtracts it from six so that it is increasing in support for government activism). The shorter line
depicts the trend line from 1985 to 2004 only.

achievement, everybody should have what they need for a decent life, elderly versus others,
German General Social Survey (ALLBUS)




Notes: This figure depicts responses since 1984 in the German General Social Survey (ALLBUS) on
the link between income and individual achievement. The graph uses the V205 variable from the
ALLBUS (though subtracts it from five so that it is increasing in support for government activism).
The shorter line depicts the trend line from 1984 to 2004 only.

for individual achievement, elderly versus others, German General Social Survey (ALLBUS)




Notes: This figure depicts responses since 1984 in the German General Social Survey (ALLBUS)
on whether income differences are needed as an incentive for individual achievement. The graph
uses the V206 variable from the ALLBUS (though subtracts it from five so that it is increasing in
disagreement with the statement). The shorter line depicts the trend line from 1984 to 2004 only.

General Social Survey (ALLBUS), excluding East German residents




Notes: This figure depicts responses since 1984 in the German General Social Survey (ALLBUS)
on whether income differences are needed as an incentive for individual achievement. Respondents
included in the figure reside in the territory of the old Federal Republic (including West Berlin) at
the time of the interview (V5 = 1). The graph uses the V206 variable from the ALLBUS (though
subtracts it from five so that it is increasing in disagreement with the statement). The shorter line
depicts the trend line from 1984 to 2004 only.

Online Appendix B.            Summary of Surveys Considered for Inter-
                              national Evidence
To compare our results for the US to other countries, we conducted a comprehensive search
for comparable datasets from similar, developed countries. Our universe was the 17 OECD
nations with the highest per capita income in 2012 according to The World Bank. These
nations are in order: Norway, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Australia, Denmark, Sweden, (the
United States), Canada, Austria, the Netherlands, Finland, Japan, Germany, Belgium, Ice-
land, France and the United Kingdom. Additionally, we considered a number of cross-national
surveys, which sample across multiple countries in each wave.
    If a survey asked a consistently phrased and measured question regarding redistributive
preferences over at least a ten year period prior to 2006, we included the country in our
international analyses. We found that 3 national surveys and none of the cross-national
surveys met our criteria for inclusion. The tables on the next several pages summarize the
results of this search.
