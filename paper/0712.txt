             The Sources of Labor Productivity Variation

                     in U.S. Manufacturing, 1947—80



                               Abstract


    Because it concentrates on the co-movements of jointly determined

endogenous variables, the traditional analysts of labor productivity does not

directly address the question of the causes of productivity change. This

problem is solved by a modelling approach in which productivity and other

choice variables are assumed to respond optimally to five broad classes

of exogenous (causal) shocks. Although these shocks are unobservable

to the econometrician, maximum likelihood estimates of their relative

importance in the determination of productivity change are obtained.

1.   Introduction

          Much effort has been expended in attempts to account empirically

for changes in measured labor productivity (hereafter, simply "productivity"),

especially the changes that have taken place in the U.S. since 1973.

Denison's survey (1979) cites literally dozens of relevant studies.

Despite all this research, there is surprisingly little agreement about

the sources of productivity variation. The purpose of this paper is to

suggest that the bar to greater understanding is partly methodological

in origin and to demonstrate an alternative approach to the analysis

of productivity.

      A standard procedure for studying productivity and growth (intro-

duced by Denison (1974) but used by others) is the method of "growth

accounting." Broadly, growth accounting is a way of decomposing economic

growth    (or its per-capita counterpart, productivity) into its major "sources"
notably, increases in 1) the quality and quantity of capital inputs, 2) the
quality   and quantity of labor inputs, and 3) various "residual" factors.

These characterizations of the sources of growth have been widely influ-

ential.

          A problem arises, however, when one asks, "In what sense does growth

accounting elucidate the causes of growth or productivity increase?" The

usual notion of "causality" is of a link between exogenous (causal) variables

on the one hand, and endogenous (caused) variables on the other.. Yet in

standard economic analysis the levels of capital and labor inputs (.rowth

accounting's principal "source" variables) are thought of as jointly endogenous
                                  -2-




with productivity within the economic system. Thus one does not usually

speak of capital or labor growth as "causing" productivity change; rather,

all three variables are chosen together in light of the economic environment.

        This methodological point becomes practically important when one

attempts to apply research results to policy formulation. Because growth

accounting is not a causal analysis, its policy implications are typically

ambiguous. For example, suppose that this method reports that a productivity

slowdown is associated primarily with a reduction in the growth rate of the

capital stock. The appropriate policy response to this information depends

on the nature of the exogenous change that affected the two endogenous

variables (capital and productivity). A joint slowdown of productivity and

capital growth could be caused by an inflation-induced increase in the

burden of taxation on capital; by a reduced rate of labor-saving innovation;

by demographic shifts in the labor force; or by a lower level of output

demand, to name a few possibilities. Optimal policy (including the option

of doing nothing) would vary over these cases.

        This paper re-addresses the question of productivity determination

with techniques that solve the "joint endogeneity" problem and employ a sound

notion of causality. The specific object of study is productivity in the

U.S. manufacturing sector in the postwar (1947-80). We use a modelling

approach which recognizes explicitly that measured productivity levels are

not a "given" to the manufacturing sector but represent choices made by

workers and firms in response to exogenous constraints. Production and

input levels are assumed to be varied optimally in the face of five broad

classes of externally generated "shocks". Looking at production, prices,

wages, capital, and labor inputs as well as productivity, we can associate

different response patterns with each type of shock.
                                                -




           The fact that different types of unobservable shocks create different

patterns in the data is used to measure the relative importance of each

class of shocks for productivity. The key pieces of information are the

variances and covariances of the observables. Roughly, the type of

inference made is as follows: Suppose that a shock of type a leads to

movements of variables x and y in the same direction, while the optimal

response to a shock of type b gives the changes in x and in y opposite

signs. Then if we observe (for example) a large positive sample covariance

of x and y, we will tend to infer, using this method, that type a shocks

were more important historically than the type b variety.

           A finding of this paper is that the largest sources of productivity
change    are 1) factors that directly affect the sector's production possi-

bilities,      e.g., technology, and 2) the costs of capital, including utilization

costs. Variations in product demand, labor supply, and cyclical influences

are found to be relatively less important.

 2. A Model of the Response of Productivity to Exogenous Shocks


            This section presents a simple partial equilibrium model of the

manufacturing sector. Our purposes are to analyze the response of pro—

ductivity and other endogenous variables to certain types of exogenous

shocks and to provide a basis for the empirical work described later.

           The specification of the model begins with three equations:

            (1) Product demand

                            =
                                d    + X
                                           d



            (2)   Production function

                            =
                                X + cN + kKt          +
                                           -4-




            (3) Labor supply

                            S =   S
                                      +
                                          fl
                                          X
where

                 =   log   of manufacturing output (in period t)

            Pt =     log   of the relative price of manufactured goods

                     log of labor input to manufacturing
            Nt
                 =   log   of capital input to manufacturing

                 =   log   of manufacturing real wage


            For a given period t, the product demand on relates purchase of

manufacturing output (measured in real terms) to the sectoral relative price.1

Since production and prices are measured in logs,               fld represents the price-

elasticity of demand. Assuming a downward-sloping demand function, we take

   <   0.    X is the current level of the demand function intercept; it

captures non-price determinants of demand such as national income, tastes,

and alternative opportunities of consumers. X will be assumed to evolve

stochastically over time; see below.

            The production function is ordinary Cobb-Douglas with exponents

       and o.k ,      corresponding to labor's and capital's share, respectively. We
assume constant returns to scale, so that u +                   =   1.   X, assumed stochastic,
                                                           °k
is the (log of) the Cobb-Douglas "technical progress" index; it is the

capacity of firms to produce, given measured levels of inputs. Because of

familiar problems of measurement of inputs and output, in our estimates

       will include such factors as input quality variations and the impact

of government regulation on marketed output as well as technical and

managerial efficiency.
                                 —5—




        The U term in the production of function is the average level

of factor utilization intensity in period t. It is a choice variable,

not a stochastic disturbance. (Random disturbances to production are sub-

sumed in X.) Varying Ut allows firms to produce "off of" the pro-

duction function for a time by working labor and machines at a faster or

slower rate. Firms are assumed to aim for a long-run "normal" utiliza-

tion rate U = 0   and to balance upward against downward deviations from

this norm.

        The labor supply equation gives the number of labor hours offered

to the manufacturing sector as a function of the real wage paid in that

sector. S , the wage-elasticity, will be assumed positive. The

stochastic intercept term        summarizes current levels of non—wage

influences on labor supply, such as population, income, and wealth, as

well as the alternative opportunities of workers in other sectors, self-

enployment, or non-work pursuits.

        To complete the basic model, we assume that the unit rental and

utilization cost of capital is exogenous and given by X. X is stochastic

and includes, for example, the energy costs of running a machine, as well

as more conventional capital costs such as interest and depreciation.2

        Suppose for the time being that there are no adjustment costs

associated with changing input stocks. Then, competitive profit—maxi-

mization and the basic model imply3


         (4) Pricing equation

                    =   -X   +         +      + constant

         (5) Labor demand

                    =   -X   +
                                 a     og(ct/ct) +   - W)   +
                                             -6-



              (6)   Capital demand


                        K =    -X       +   c (log(cL/)        +    - X)   +



            The pricing equation states that, with constant returns to scale,

 prices must equal costs of production. The conditional factor demand

 equations give total input usage as a function of relative factor costs

 and desired production levels. Note that an increase in the production

 function intercept, X , lowers input requirements per unit output and
thus reduces prices.

            The dynamics of this model depend on the evolution of the stochastic

                                             .     A descriptive and quite general speci-
variables X, X, X, and
fication breaks each variable into three parts: 1) a deterministic time

trend; 2) a component in which all changes are permanent (a "random

walk"); and 3) a component in whiëh all changes are transitory (so that

the level of the component always tends towards a fixed mean). Thus we

might write



      (7)
                              x =+y+'
      where


                             XX1 +
                             —i —i                 3.




                                  = the     current value of a mean-zero
                              t
                                            stationary process
                             I = d,q,n,k


The         are constants, and the                      are independent normal shocks with

means zero and variances .

       A specification in the form of (7) will be used in the estimation

reported below. For the rest of this section, however, we will consider

only an important special case of (7).    This is the case in which        =   0,

all i and t; that is, all shocks to the       are taken to be permanent in

nature. We also assume that all variables have been detrended in order to

avoid having to carry along terms in        in our calculations.

        Let (q, p, w, n, k) denote the first differences of

' ' W,       N, K) in a model in which there are only permanent shocks.

These starred lower-case variables can be thought of as desired growth

rates, less trend. If supplies and demands are equal in factor and

product markets, the five desired growth rates satisfy the five-equation

system given in Table 1.    (Equations 3 and 4 in Table 1 are market-

clearing conditions for labor and capital, respectively; equation 5

follows from the constancy of factor shares in the Cobb—Douglas technology.)

The stochastic terms        are, recall, the current innovations to the random

walk processes 3    (i     d,q,n,k).

        A reduced-form solution of the system in Table 1 gives expressions

for the desired growth rates in terms of the disturbances .        (This

solution is given in the Appendix.) Table 2 gives the derivatives of the

desired growth rates with respect to each type of shock:

        1) A positive shock to demand raises production and prices.
            The induced increase in factor demands raises wages and
            both factor inputs.

        2) A favorable technology innovation lowers prices and there-
            fore increases output demanded. If demand is relatively
            elastic (d < - 1), the increase in demand will offset the
            lower per-unit factor requirements, raising factor inputs
            and wages.
                               -8-




         3) A positive labor supply innovation increases labor input
             and lowers wages. Lower wages lead to lower prices and
             more demand. If demand is sufficiently elastic, more
             capital inputs will be required.

        4) An increase in capital costs lowers capital input, raises
            prices, and lowers output iemanded. If demand is
            elastic, the output fall will be large enough to reduce
            labor input and wages as well.

        This model can be used to analyze the effects of external shocks

on the desired growth rate of productivity, q* -   n*:
        1) A positive shock to product demand increases productivity.
            Because capital is supplied more elastically than labor
            in the long run, the higher level of production takes
            place on a more capital-intensive basis than before. This
            long-run effect is independent of cyclical variations in
            productivity, which are due to the impact of temporary
            demand shifts on input utilization rates.

        2) An improvement in the production function raises pro-
            ductivity, both directly and through expansion of output
            demanded.

        3) A positive change in labor supply reduces productivity by
            inducing substitution toward labor inputs and away from
            capital inputs.

        4) Similarly, an increase in capital costs reduces productivity
            by inducing a substitution toward labor.


        Most of the important influences that permanently shift the level

of labor productivity can be classed as one of the four types of exogenous

influences or "shocks" of this simple model.   It will be useful to know

roughly how much of productivity variation is attributable to each of

these long-run factors, as well as to short-run influences such as the

business cycle. This decomposition is the goal of the empirical analysis

of this paper.

3. Econometric Approach

        If the desired growth rates v =   (q*, p*, w,    k*)   could

be observed, then a number of attractive strategies for determining

the sources of productivity variation in the data would be available.

One possibility would be to use the distinct sign patterns created by

different types of shocks (see Table 2) to segregate the causes of

productivity change. This approach would have the virtue of being

largely independent of specific estimates of incidental parameters.

Or, if one were willing to estimate or otherwise specify parameter

values, inversion of the system in Table 1 would allow direct calculation

of the magnitude of each shock in each period.

        Unfortunately, it is unlikely that actually observed detrended

growth rates, denoted by v= (q, p, w, n, k),will be good proxies for

their "desired" counterparts v. While the elements of v must by

assumption be serially uncorrelated, the observable vector v displays,

in practice, distinct serial correlation patterns. These serial correlation

patterns are created by the persistence of cyclical components and by the

fact that adjustment of actual variables v to desired levels v within

a year may be incomplete. Thus our approach will be to treat the desired

growth rates v, as well as an additional cyclical variable, as unobserved

components of the vector v. A generalized form of factor analysis can

then be used to extract estimates of the key variances and the parameters.

       More explicitly, we will consider representations of the observable

variables of the form

where   t is   a stationary ARMA process with normally distributed

innovations, and the b(L) and c1(L) are general lag polynomials.

The import of this specification is that each observed growth rate is

taken to be the sum of two components: 1) a gradual adjustment to the

corresponding desired growth rate4 and 2) a transitory or "cyclical"

element, represented by a distributed lag on the unobservable process y.

The process y is intended to capture effects of the business cycle; but

it can include other transitory impacts on growth rates, such as wars.

Notice that we have assumed that only one independent transitory

process affects all five variables; this prior restriction improves

the degree of econometric identification greatly. We have not imposed

cross-restrictions on the lag polynomials. Thus we do not require, for

example, that the relation of production to inputs in the short run

be given by the long-run production function. This potential inconsistency

is removed by the realistic assumption that the average utilization rate

   can vary in the short run.



distributed, mean-zero, permanent shocks C=               , );
          The desired growth rates v* are linear combinations of the normally

                                                                     thus v is

itself inultivariate normal with zero mean. The transitory process y can

similarly be expressed as a linear combination of its normal innovations
                                    -11-




Finally, the observed variables v are linear transformations   of v

and y. Thus, if we let h denote a vector of all observations of the

vector v, h will be multivariate normal itself. The mean of h will

be zero and its covariance matrix will be (0), where e is a vector

of the unknown parameters. The unknown parameters in e include the

variances of the unobservable shocks c and s>'; the parameters of the

model in Table 1, which relate v to *; the coefficients of the

lag pol'nomials in (8) above; and the parameters of the ARMA process

describing y. The log-likelihood of the sample is




     (10)         L =   -1/2 log det (B) - 1/2   h'




plus an inessential constant. The values of the parameters in e which

maximize L have the usual consistency and efficiency properties of ML

estimates.

         This estimation procedure has a relatively simple intuitive

description. For any choice of the unknown parameters B one can

calculate an implied variance matrix (0) for the observed data h.

The maximum likelihood estimates of 0 are those which imply the

matrix        most closely matched to the variances and covarianceS of

the actual sample.

         The estimates reported in this paper were obtained by use of

a program written by Bronwyn Hall. The program, described in B.H. Hall

(1979), employs analytic derivatives and the method of scoring.

         For an early. application of this econometric methodology, see

Chamberlain and Gril.iihes (1975). The present paper owes a great deal

to a similar variance decomposition exercise by R.E. Hall (1978), in which

the sources of macroeconomic fluctuations were analyzed.

 4.   Data

         The data used in the empirical analysis are as follows:

         1.   Q:  Index of industrial production, manufacturing; Survey
              of Current Business


         2.   P: Wholesale price index, manufactured goods, June of each
              year; adjusted for seasonal variation and deflated by the
              PCE implicit price deflator; SCB


         3.   W: Average hourly gross earnings per production worker on
              manufacturing payroll; deflated by the PCE implicit price
              deflator; SCB


         4. N: Index of aggregate weekly employee hours, production
             workers; SCB


         5.   K: Fixed nonresidential business capital, constant cost
              valuation, 1972 dollars, manufacturing; equipment and
              structures; from Bureau of Economic Analysis, Fixed
              Nonresidential Business and Residential Capital in the United
              States 1929-75, arid SCB updates.

All data are annual. Coverage is from 1947 to 1980. The log-differenced

and detrended forms of the above data, denoted by lower-case letters,

are given in Table 3. To illustrate the interpretation of the numbers

in Table 3, note that the value for q in 1948 was - .0025; this tells

us that between 1947 and 1948 production grew at a rate of 0.25% below the

postwar trend.

         The last column of Table 3 reports the detrended growth rate of

labor productivity (output per production worker hour). This column

confirms the usual observation that recent productivity growth has been

weak: Productivity growth was below the postwar trend in every year

from 1973 to 1980 except 1976. Another observation is that the annual

nature of the data and the use of hours as a measure of labor input

all but eliminate the cyclical aspect of productivity. For example,

productivity growth was above trend in the severe recession year 1958;

and 1975 had no worse productivity performance than some other recent

years.

         For the purposes of our estiirtation the moment matrix of the data

captures all usable information. The raw sample covariances (which

5. Results of the Estimation

        The estimation procedure required the numerical maximization of

a likelihood function with respect to the vector of free parameters.

Keeping computer costs down and, indeed, achieving a solution required

the list of estimated parameters to be as short as possible. Accordingly,

we looked for specifications that would be parsimonious without being

inflexible. We also assumed



                               -   .30

                           n
                               =   .70



These are conventional values for the Cobb-Douglas exponents.

        Given the prior restrictions, a number of simple variants of the

general specification provided reasonable and largely identical results.

A representative model is given in Table 5; corresponding estimates are

reported in Table 6. Note that, despite parsimonious specification

and some pre-testing to eliminate extraneous parameters, estimation of

this model required maximization of the likelihood function with respect

to nineteen free parameters. Nineteen is a large number for this sort

of procedure.

        The key results of this exercise are the estimates of the variances

of the different types of unobservable shocks (parameters 1-5). Presen-

tation of these we leave to the next section. Here we briefly examine the

implications of the estimates of the remaining fourteen parameters.

         Nearly all of these other parameters were introduced to describe the

dynamics of the observed variables. Recall from (9) that the dynamic

behavior of the observed variables was modelled as being comprised of two

parts: 1) a gradual adjustment of the actual growth rates v to the

long-run desired rates v, and 2) a response to cyclical or other

transitory forces. There are five of these growth rates to be considered -

production,   prices, wages, labor, and capital.

         The growth rates of production and of labor input were highly

correlated and thus can be looked at together. For neither variable

could ou preliminary tests reject the hypothesis that complete adaptation

to change in long-run desired growth rates occurs within the first year;

this was imposed in the reported estimates. The non-zero serial correlation

of production and labor growth is therefore explained entirely by cyclical

influences. The cyclical component of output (identical to the unobservable

process y) was modelled as AR(2), with estimated parameters       =   .098 and

   =   -. 394.   Labor input (measured as hours) was found to be sensitive to

the output cycle. The estimate of        implies that a 1% temporary increase

is production is associated with a 0.86% increase in labor hours. Since

the response of labor input to output fluctuations is less than one-for-one,

high points in the business cycle are associated with above-normal utilization

rates and corresponding temporary increases in productivity. As noted

previously, however in these data the cyclical effect on productivity is

small (and, indeed       is close to one.)


          Manufacturing relative prices also are seen to adjust rapidly to

changes in long-run desired levels. The response of prices in the first
                                    -16-




year to permanent shocks is estimated to be 80% (pr).   The subsequent rate

of adjustment to permanent shocks (A) could not be pinpointed; the actual

estimate is small negative but the standard error is very large. Prices

are fairly responsive to transitory influences as well; a temporary

1% expansion in manufacturing output leads the next year to a 0.82%
                                                                        ()
increase   in relative prices. The fact that the relative price response is

this large suggests that transient shocks specific to the manufacturing

sector are not insignificant in comparison to aggregate business cycle

shocks.

          As might be expected, the adjustment of real wage growth to

desired long-run rates is more sluggish. The estimate of first-year real

wage adjustment       is 56.2%; the gap is closed at a rate of 59.8% (A)

in subsequent years. Thus a unit shock to the desired rate of real wage

growth leads to the following cumulative wage growth response in the first

four years:


                1         2       ___         4

              .562      .823      .929      .971




Interestingly, the response of real wages to transitory output variations

is negative: A temporary 1% increase in output leads toa 0.62% drop

     in real wages the next year. This result seemed quite robust to

different specifications; it may have arisen because nominal wages are

less responsive in the short run than are prices.
                                      -17-




           The estimated model also provides information about the rate of

capital stock adjustment. Only 16.7%             f an unanticipated change in

the manufacturing sector's long-run desired capital stock can be made up

in the first year, with 26.9% (Xk) of the remaining gap filled in each

subsequent year. This leads to the following six-year cumulative response

pattern:



                 1       2       3           4       5       6

               .167    .391    .555     .675       .762    .826




These estimated investment lags are somewhat longer than those found by

more conventional methods. This slow-adjustment result should not, however,

be dismissed; We would point, first, to the very low standard errors of

the estimates of k and Xk; and, second, to the fact that our method

does not suffer the simultaneity problems common to many investment

studies. Investment also reacts positively to transitory increases in

output: A 1% temporary expansion of production is associated with a

0.37%        increase in investment the following year.

        The last two parameters for which estimates are reported are the

price-elasticity of demand for manufacturing output (rd) and the

wage-elasticity of the supply of labor to the manufacturing sector

(ri5). The value of      is a plausible -0.34. The estimate of 7.07    for
   seems too high until one remembers that the supply of labor to a

given sector is quite different from the supply of labor in the aggregate.
                                    -18—




Even if total labor supply is wage-inelastic, changes in the manufacturing

wage appear able to induce large reallocations of labor between sectors.6

This finding will be seen to have much bearing on the explanation of

productivity variation.

        The parameter estimates given in Table 6 imply a fitted covariance

matrix c(9) for the variables v. The fitted matrix, given in Table 7, may

be compared with the actual sample covariances reported in Table 4, The

matchups are reasonably good, though there are misses. The contemporaneous

covariance matrix (the top third of each table) contains the covariances

which are largest in magnitude and is thus especially important as a check

on the estimates. Here the model has caught most of the features of the

data. The variances of
                            r w, n. and kt are well-predicted. The
large covariance of production and labor input is captured. The fitted

covariances of the other variables with capital inputs are too high, however.

        As has been mentioned, the model reported here was representative

of a small number of similar models with which we experimented. Although

the details of these models differed, they provided very similar estimates

of the variances of the unobservable shocks. We turn now to these estimates.

 6. Decomposing Productivity Variation

                In our model permanent variations in productivity can be caused

 by four different types of unobservable shocks:

                         1. Shocks to product demand (                          )

                         2.   Shocks to the production function q

                         3.   Shocks to labor supply (                  )
                                                                    k
                         4.   Shocks to capital costs (                     )
The effects of each broad type of permanent shock on productivity were

analyzed in Section 2.

              In addition, temporary productivity changes can be induced by

transient or "cyclical" shocks (                c'      ),   which cause utilization rates
to depart from normal levels.

            The estimated variances of these shocks are reported in lines 1-S

of Table 6. The variance of labor supply shocks is by far the largest,

being an order of magnitude greater than the variances of the shocks to

product demand and to capital costs. The latter are, in turn, about ten

times the size of the variances of production function and cyclical dis-

turbances.

            The raw variances alone do not tell us the relative importance of

the sources of productivity variation, however, because each type of

shock affects productivity with a different weight. To see this, use

lines (1) and (4) from Table 5 to write the growth rate of labor productivity,

q -   n,   as



       (11)          q        =   q*   —   * + (1   —

we get

                                   ak        d - S)   Ek    + (1 -

             where             =         +    S -



 Inserting estimated values for d S                        and prior values for
                                                                                  ct1, ak.

 then squaring and taking expectations, we find that7


   (13)      var(q-n) = .00155                +   .94804    + .00155    + .08532

                          + .01988
                                         y



          With the weighting in (13) we can calculate the productivity variance

decomposition given in the first part of Table 8. The results are striking.

Almost 90% of the variance in manufacturing labor productivity in the

1947-80 period can be attributed to shocks to the production function and

to capital costs. Changes in product demand and labor supply, together

with transitory influences, are relatively insignificant factors.

          Can this result be explained? The negligible influence of the

cycle is easy to rationalize; it has already been suggested (Section 4) that

the nature of the data is such as to minimize cyclical effects. The

explanations of the small impacts of product demand and labor supply shifts

can be seen to center on the large estimated sensitivity of sectoral labor

supply to real wage changes: 1) Shocks to demand can have permanent effects

on productivity only if, by changing the scale of production, they result

in a significant change in the capital-labor ratio. When both capital and

labor are elastically supplied to the sector in the long run, the optimal

 capital-labor ratio is insensitive to the scale of production; thus the effect

 of demand on productivity in the long run is small.   2) Shocks to labor

 supply affect productivity through a similar channel. A disturbance to the

 intercept of the labor supply curve, by changing the equilibrium real

 wage, modifies the optimal capital-labor ratio and thus the chosen level of

 productivity. But again, if the elasticity of labor supply is large this

 effect on productivity is weak. A high elasticity means that only small

 wage movements are needed to offset labor supply shocks, so that the

 capital-labor ratio and the level of productivity remain insulated.

      On the other hand, an elastic sectoral labor supply does not prevent

production function and capital cost disturbances from affecting productivity.

 Given the stability of the manufacturing real wage at different levels of

employment, changes in capital costs are able to influence desired capital-

 labor ratios significantly in the long run; the productivity response may

be large. Shifts in the production function do not change the capital-labor

ratio in an important way, but they affect labor productivity directly by

changing overall factor productivity. This channel is insensitive to the

labor supply response. Thus, given the estimate of r, the dominance of these

last two factors in the explanation of productivity changes is to be expected.

        The importance of capital cost changes in the variance decomposition

is an informative result. It confirms the notion that factors such as energy

prices, taxes on investment goods, real interest rates, and the supply prices

of new capital are crucial for productivity in the long run. Note that this

is not the same as saying that productivity depends on the level of capital

investment per se. For example, an expansion of the capital stock caused

by a permanent increase in the demand for manufacturing output would be

associated primarily with an increase in sectoral employment, not an
                                  —22—




increase in productivity. Similarly, an unanticipated change in capital costs

could affect productivity through capacity utilization, hiring, and pricing

decisions well before the capital stock could respond.
                                                                    function
       The large (one might say, preponderant) role of production

shocks in productivity determination provides somewhat less information.

Like Denison's famous "residual", this is a catch-all category that includes

not only technological and managerial factors but also any errors of

measurement of inputs (e.g., because of changes in input quality) or of

outputs (as when increased "production" of worker safety is substituted

for directly measured output). Aggregate analysis of the sort done here

cannot hope to sort out the many miscellaneous factors that enter this

category; it can only suggest that the returns to more detailed study are

potentially great.8
        Productivity trends have changed quite a bit inthe last decade.

To find out if this would show up in the analysis of productivity variation,

we held the incidental parameters (6-19) fixed and re-estimated the five

shock variance for the sub-periods 1947-69 and 1970-80. The decompositions

are given in the bottom two-thirds of Table 8.

        The results for the two periods appear similar; disturbances to the

production function and to capital costs are still the dominant causes.

However, this way of presenting the data tends to conceal some differences

between the subsamples: In Table 9 the relative sizes of the estimated

 shock variances from the two periods are reported. The 1970-80 period

 was clearly the more turbulent, as only the variance of shocks to product

 demand was smaller than in 1947-69. The heavily-weighted production

function disturbances were 18.6% more variable after 1970. The 71.2%

increase in the variance of labor supply shocks and the 31.8% expansion in

the capital costs variance are consistent with our perceptions of the last

decade. Fianlly, cyclical effects were fully three times as large in the

l970s.

         The comparative analysis of the two periods demonstrate the use-

fulness of the econometric approach of this paper. It is possible, we have

shown, to agree that the last ten years have seen large disturbances in

labor markets (e.g., due to demographic factors) and in the business

cycle; and yet simultaneously to argue that these disturbances have had

relatively unimportant effects on manufacturing productivity. Capital

utilization costs and   the   factors subsumed by the term "production function

shocks" are the principal explanations of the recent productivity experience.

 7. Conclusion

        Traditional growth accounting methods, which study the co-movements

of jointly endogenous variables, provide little information about the

direction, magnitude, or channels of causal relations. The econometric

method used in this paper shows how productivity changes can be linked

with exogenous causes, even though those causes are not directly observable.

        There are obvious ways in which the analysis of productivity through

this method could be extended, e.g., different or more refined data sets

and model specifications. There is also scope in this approach for

gaining more information about the "black box" of changes in the production

function.

        A point that should be made, however, is that the choice of pro-

ductivity as the variable upon which to focus the discussion of our results

was an arbitrary one. Any endogenous variable in the model could have

been analyzed in the same detail without further estimation. For example,

the reported results are all that is needed to do a rather detailed study

of capital formation in the manufacturing sector. This analysis would not

only assess the importance of different sources of capital formation but

would provide time patterns of response of the capital stock to each kind

of exogenous change. This provision of information in several different areas

is another advantage of the explicitly structural modelling approach employed

in this paper.

 1.   Additions to inventories will be treated as part of purchass, for
       simplicity.

 2.   This specification is convenient in that it allows the difficult-to-
      measure full cost of capital to be treated as an unobservable in the
      econometric work. The assumption that X is exogenous is empirically
      reasonable, since the feedback of variations in U.S. manufacturing
      demand for capital to long run capital utilization costs (such as the
      cost of energy) is certainly small. (In our estimates below, we find
      that even labor costs may nearly be treated as exogenous to the manu-
      facturing sector.) The exogeneity of X is not tantamount to perfect
      elasticity of capital supply in the short run, since later we will
      assume adjustment costs are associated with changes in input stocks.

3.    See Varian (1978), p. 15.

4.    The desired growth rates v* were derived, recall, under an assumption
      of no adjustment costs. Gradual adjustment of actual towards desired
      rates is a way of reintroducing these costs in the empirical specifi-
      cation.


5.    Alternative AR and MA processes were tried; the results were not affected.


6.    That is, fl5   measures the response of manufacturing labor supply to
      changes in the manufacturing wage, given the national wage level.
      The national wage is exogenous to the manufacturing sector and is
      thus subsumed in X.


7.    Recall that the expression 2 is the variance not of the transitory
      process y but of its innovation Y. (13) uses the relation

                         var(y) =
                                    a/(.84O6)
      which is derived by inserting the estimates of p1 and p2 in the
      expression for the variance of an AR(2) process.

8.    There is no shortage of such attempts. Denison himself has analyzed
      the 'residual" in some detail in his 1978 articles.
