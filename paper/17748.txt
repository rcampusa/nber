Health Reform, Health Insurance, and Selection: Estimating Selection into Health Insurance
Using the Massachusetts Health Reform

                                            ABSTRACT

We implement an empirical test for selection into health insurance using changes in coverage induced
by the introduction of mandated health insurance in Massachusetts. Our test examines changes in the
cost of the newly insured relative to those who were insured prior to the reform. We find that counties
with larger increases in insurance coverage over the reform period face the smallest increase in average
hospital costs for the insured population, consistent with adverse selection into insurance before the
reform. Additional results, incorporating cross-state variation and data on health measures, provide
further evidence for adverse selection.
