                                             ABSTRACT


       This   paper has two aims.       First, to examine alternative ways     of .od.lling
VERS in imperfectly compettwe markets.             This is important, since     th. effects
of VERS are sensitive to the models used.           Second,   to argue that the effects

of VERS also depend on whether goods are complements or Substitutes. This

point   is   illustrated by extending the model      of   krishna (1983) to allow

complementary goods to be produced by domestit and foreign firms.               If goods
are   substitutes,   VERs   et   at free trade levels raise all profits, while if

they are coliplements, the VERS have no effect.           Thus tarrifs and quotas are

fundamentally non-equivalentunder Bertrand duopoly when Substitute goods are

produced, but are equivalent pinen coaplementarygoods ar. being produced.
this is   contrasted to     the case of Stackelberg leadership.      Th. importance of

specifying the effects of any restr ction on the payoff functions of agents

and using this to analyze its affects on equilibrium of the gam. is

emphasized.

3.      IntroductIon
        The post World War        II era is often hailed as a   period of   great trade

liberalization,         which led to gains for all parties through fre. trade.       Due to

$    series   of negotiations conducted under the auspices of GAIT, tariffs have

been negotiated steadily downwards, until at present they are at an average

level    of about 4t on .anufactured goods.1           However, this figure does not

necessarily indicate          that protection has fallen over tims.     Since 1970, a new

kind of protectionism involving non tariff barriers (NTBs) has arisen.

        The leading instri.aents of this "new protectionis." have been the so-

celled "voluntary export restraint" or VER, and Its rsletion. the orderly

marketing arrangement (OMA).            Although the articles of GAIT explicitly forbid

quotas since they are inherently discriminatory,             the proportion of total world

trade    that moves under so.. kind of quantitativ, restraint Is thought to be

between 30 and         50%.
        The rise in the "new protectionism"coincided with the slow economic

growth and higher unemployment of the early 1970's, and Is often linked

causally to the adverse economic environment faced by established industries

in this period.          The populerity of   VEils   is du, to a number of legal, political

and economic advantages which they have over more traditional protectionist

measures.       This is likely to make the. even more widely advocated in the

future.       VEils,   however,   tend to be socially Inefficient ways of providing

protection although they do have advantages for certain groups.

       There are two broad sets of reasons which are often given for why VEilS

ar, being increesingly used.            The first Set relates to the legal and political

environment. The second set relates to the economic environment.
                                          —2-


       Consider their legal and political advantages. There are at least three

such advantages.

       The first one Is that GAIl    places several restrictions on     the use of the

more traditional forms of protection, tariffs and quotas. Tariffs have been

restricted through agreements on bindings        (which are promises to bind tariffs)

and through negotiated reductions in tariffs.         Quotas are expressly forbidden

by article XI of   GAIT.   Thus,   It is natural   for substitution to occur towards

other legal forms of protection Such as VERa

       The second advantage of VERs compared to less discriminatory measures           is

that the VERS are set on particular industries and countries. Their

inherently discriminatory nature allows producer and labor groups in the

effected industry,   who stand to gain from a VER, to easily coordinate their

efforts in the hope of mutuil advantage.         On the other hand, consumer losses

from higher prices are spread over all consu.ers and this makes it harder to

coordinate opposition to such measures from consumers, since an Individual

consumer has less to lose than th. interest groups in the affected Industry

do.    As VERa on each industry are    l.posed   mi   piecemeal   fashion,   consumers

and consumer groups are even lass likely to strongly oppose each individual

VER.

       More important, VERa tend to circumvent the public debate which is

associated with policies which have to go through Congress.           Since VERa are

 n.gotiated between th. executive branch and forel9n governments who agree to

enforce   thee, Industries can, in   affect, obtain VERa without      prolonged public
debate.3

       Next, consider th. economic advantages of VERa.       The .ost discussed

economic reason for their popularity Is thit VERa, unlike tariffs,           offer a
                                          —3—


bribe    to   the foreign producers in the form of th* implicit quota r.nts which

accrue    to foreigners. This, it is f.lt. makes them more amenabis to such

arrangements. This is particularly true since th.        carrot of   additional

revenues is accompanied by the threat of tariffs.        Howevsr,   Tlir   (2985), for

example,      argues that this threat is not necessarily credible given that

tariffs are hard to obtain from Congress.       In addition, they arm often Illegal

under GATT so that a presidential veto would ilmost certainly have to follow

congressional approval.       This lack of credibility is not, however,    an issu. if

producers are better off with a VER.       This is quite probable since another

effect of      a VER is to, In effect, legally create a cartel organized by the

agency    Implementing the VER.    This is another advantage of a VER for foreign

and domestic producers, since such a cartel is likely to raise their profits.

        In an imperfectly competitive market the creation of a cartel is not

required      for foreign firms to benefit from a VER.   This Is due to the fact

that the VER itself alters the "game' that domestic and foreign firms play by

acting as a credible constraint on the output of ths foreign firm.         There are

two aspects to this.       The first Is related to the fact that a VER allows a

foreign entrant In an established domestic Industry to      prscoit     to a smell

size.    In the sequential game that follows,    the entrant sets a low enough

price so that the established domestic firm does not find it worthwhile to

undercut the foreign fir. and accommodates .ntry. This is an example of the

"Judo economics" described by G.lman and Salop (1983).

        The second way in which a VER changes the "game" played by firms Is that

the capacity constraint on the foreign firm acts as a facilitating devIce

making It optimal for the domestic and foreign firms to      ral.    their prices in
equilibrium when they produce substitute goods.     This gives them higher

equilibrium profits.   This argument   is independentof the cart.lization of

foreign firms by the implementing authority previously mentioned.        This is
shown in Krishna (1983).

     This paper has two aims.   First,   to examine alternative ways of modelling

VERS in imperfectly competitive markets.    This is important, since the effects

of VERS are sensitive to the models used.    Second, to argue that it is vital

to be clear about the timing of moves by players,   and to model the effects of

a VER carefully. This point is Illustrated by extending the     model   of   Krishna

(1983) to allow complementary goods to be produced by domestic and foreign

firms.   If goods are Substitutes, VERs set at free trad,   levels raise all

profits, while If they are complements, the VERS have no effect.        Thus tarrifs

and quotas are fundamentally non-equivalent under Bertrand duopoly when

substitute goods are produced, but are equivalent when complementary goods are

being produced.   This Is contrasted to the case of Stmckelberg leadership.

The Importance of specifying the effects of       restriction on the payoff

functions of agents and using this to analyze Its effects on equilibrium of

the game Is e.phasized. The next section briefly surveys some of the work In

this area.

2.       Approaches to the Analysis of VERa

         The an.Iyss of voluntary export restrictions (VERS) has attract.d much

attention since the impositionof VERa on the import of Japanese               lutosobiles
to   the United States in 1981.         A number of different approaches have been

taken to modeling          their effects in imperfectly competitive markets,     at both a
theoretical and empirical level.            The classic work of Bhagwatl (1965) on the

non-equivalence of tariffs and quotas in the presenc. of a domestic monopoly

is the starting point of much of this work.

         The approaches used to analyz. the effects of VERs vary fro. static

oligopoly models to dynamic repeated ga.e             odels. Static models tend to give

more clear Cut empirically testable results than dyna.lc ones.               This is both

because of the normal •ultipllcity of equilibria which arise In dynamic

models,    and because the more varied effects which occur in such models can

offset each other.          Ultimately, the choice    of   modeling strategy should, of

course, be guided by the empirical validity of Its predictions. For this

reason It       Is   worthwhil, focusing on the empirically testable implications of a

given modeling technique.

      I   will focus on static models in this paper and argue that It is

important       to model   carefully the   effects of a VER upon the game played by the

firms.     This is particularly so when neither the domestIc nor the foreign fir.

Is a Stackelberg leader.          Recent work by Harris (1985) and Itoh and Ono (1984)

does not adequately model this case.           As a consequence, their results differ
from those obtained when the effects of a VER on the profit function of the

firms,    and hence on the gam,      itself, are more carefully analyzed as     in Krishna

(1983).     1   will first discuss how      the work of    HarrIs (1985) and Itoh and Ono
                                           —6-


(1984) relates to     my work, and   then briefly survey other recent work in the

area which is less closely related to this paper.

       Itoh and Ono (1984) analyze the effects of a VER in an oligopoly model

with one foreign and one domestic firm.          Firms are assumed to compete in price

and to produce differentiated substitute products.            They argue that tariffs

and quotas are equivalent in such a model. However, Itoh and Ono'S results

hold only when excess demand for the foreign good has no effect on the demand

for the domestic good.      Since the goods are substitutes, this is hard to

justify.    When the game is carefully modelled,       as in Krishna (1983),          it is

clear that VERa have effects by their very existence and that this makes

tariffs and quotas fundamentally non-equivalent when foreign and domestic

goods are substitutes

       Harris (1985) argues that VERa are truly voluntary since they raise

profits of all firms. However, he does not model the effects of the VER on

the profit functions of both firms and hence on the game itself in a careful

way.    Rather, he assumes that a VER makes the domestic firm into S              Stackelberg
leader.    Krishna (1983) does not make this assumption, but proves that in the

unique mixed strategy equilibrium the domestic         firm   earns the same profits as

a Stackelberg leader when a particular rationing rule is used.                 Both papers

deal only with the case when the products of the two            firms are   substitutes.

In this paper   I show   that   when the products produced      by   the two   firasare
coaple.entary, the VER his no effect on equilibrium and does not even give the

do.eetlc firm   the   profits of   a Stackelb.rg   leader.

       Th. essence of the argument that the game       Itself   changes due      to   a VERcan

be understood by realizing that there are three effects of a VER in
                                             —7—




oligopolistic markets.     I   call these the "competitive", "monopoly" and

 interactive" affects.

      The "competitive" or "C" effect is the only one that operates in

competitive environments.       In   a competitive framework, a VER works by altering

market demand and/or supply functions wherever the constraint is binding.                  If

the VER is set at the free trade level of imports it will have no effect,

since such policies only affect equilibrium in competitive markets by being

set   at restrictive levels.

      With domestic monopoly and foreign competition, even VERa set at free

trade levels have effects.       These arise because VER5 alter demand and/or

                                                                           end
supply conditions at points other than the unconstrained equilibrium point

so affect the decision of the domestic monopolist. In this manner

restrictions can have significant effects by their very presence.               This point

was made by Bhagwati (19b5).         I   call this the monopoly or   "14"   affect and it

operates in addition to any "C" effect that may occur,

       In   an oligopoly model not only do the effects present under monopoly

occur, but because each agent can be affected in the same manner as the

monopolist, and the actions of all agents are interdependent, an additional

effect,     which I call the interactive or "I" effect, arises.

       In the analysis of VERa with differentiated products, when firms co.pete

in price and produce substitute goods,          the imposition of a VER on the foreign

firm makes the domestic firm's demand function less elastic for price

increases. This makes it profitable for the domestic firm to raise its price

at what would be the free trade equilibrium.           This is the "H" effect.       The

increase in the domestic firm's price makes the constraint bind on the foreign
                                       —8-


firm bnd makes it optimal for it to also raise its price since it is

effectively supply constrained. This is the essence of the "I' effect.

     Both "I" and "N" effects raise domestic profits when the goods are

Substitutes. Moreover,    as long as foreign supply is not constrained too far

below the free trade level, foreign profits also rise along with prices.         This

is basically the argument in Krishna (1983) about how VERs facilitate

collusion with substitute goods.    The equilibrium with a VER is shown to be a

mixed strategy one which gives the domestic firm the profits of a Stackelberg

leader when a particular rationing rule is used, and raises profits both at

home and abroad.

     Since Harris (1965) assumes that a yEn makes the domeStic firm into a

Stackelberg leader, his results on profits are similar to the above when goods

arm substitutes. However, when complementary products are considered, there

are no "H" and therefore no "I" effects,     as is shown below. Thus, with

complementary products,   tariffs and quotas are equivalent even 'iith Bertrand

duopoly.   This is not the result obtained by assuming that a VER makes the

domestic firm into a   Stackelberg leader.
     There has been a good deal of work on the effects of VERs in other market

structures, and using other strategic variables.     I   briefly review some of

this literature in order to relate the results to those of this paper.5

     Work has focused on the effects of VERs in Stackelberg leadership models,

Cournot models, repeated game models, and on the quality change effects of

quotas.    The models traditionally used are duopoly or monopoly models since

they ar. the si.plest ones in which such issues can be adressed.

     St.ckelberg leadership models show that quotas are not In general

equivalent to a tariff In such a setting and that a      VEIl   may have effects even
                                           -9—



when Set at free trade 'evels.        Moreover,   these models ShOW     that   the

endogenous determination of a Stackelberg leader tends to work In favor of th

home firm being the leader.        The work of Itoh and Ono (1982).       (1984) addresses

Such issues.    however, $t   is   not clear why one should expect on. or th. other

firm   to hav, a first mover advantage and        it   is   deslraD. to consider models

without   this requirement.

       The effect of a VER and the equivalence/non—equivalenceof tariffs and

quotas when neither firm is a Stackelberg leader and fires compet, in quantity

a la Cournot is elementary, when quantity is the strategic varibl,, tariffs

and quotas are obviously equivalent and a VER at the fre. trade level has no

effect.

       Although both price and quantity competition modelS (and their variants)

are widely used,    it is   a bit unsatisfactory to use         Cournot *odels in analyzing


quantity constraints, since quantity constraints restrict th. strategic

variable itself and leave no room for firms to change their strategic behavior

endogenously. This is the main reason in favor of using pric, setting models

in   the analysis of VER5.     The sensitivity to the strategic variabl, used of

the results of trade restrictions in oligopoly models has been analyzed in

Eaton and Grossman (1986) ,b

       The effects of   ERs   have also been studied in the context of repeated

games. Their effects in such models are herder to predict, since a VER

reduces the profitability of deviations from a collusive outcose but also

curtails the ability to punish such deviations. In addition,               the usual

problems in such games of having too many equilibria also arise.                Davidson

(1984)    deals with the effects of tariffs while Rotemberg and Saloner (1986)
                                                -10-


deal with quotas.         Lambson and Richardson (1986) deal with the effects of

quotas in such models, both from a theoretical and empirical point of view.

       In the long run, firms could choose to Codify product type as well as

price in response to a VER.           This is studied for monopoly and competitive

Situations by Rodriguez (1979), Santoni and Van Cott (1980), Das and

Donnenfeld (1984), Falvey 11979) and Krishna (1984,1987). Des and Donnenfeld

11986)   also analyze the effects of trade restrictions with a special duopoly

model of vertical product differentiation. However,              to the extent that

product adjustment takes longer than price adjustment, models focusing on the

Short run effects of trade restrictions can safely neglect such effects.

       A good deal of empirical        work has also been evident in this area.          In

particular the work of Feenstra (1984, 1985, 1987), who documents the rise in

quality of automobile imports following the VER, and of Aw and Roberts 11986)

on footwear,      is worth mentioning.      In addition,    Dixit (1986) and levinson

(1987)   Is a mix of theory,        simulation and empirical work in the automobile

industry    which seems particularly promising. While none of the empirical               work

explicitly tests whether the VER5 on automobiles made fires behave more

collusively, there are indications that they may have done so.              For example,

while the VERs imposed in March 1981 for March 1981-April 1984 were at 1.68

million cars per       year,   about 5% below   th, existing level   of imports,   the

increase    in   th,   price of   Japanese imports was almost 20% In th, first year of

th, VER.7    Levinson (1987) estimates the own         elasticity of   demand for Japanese

Imports to be around 1.57.          This would   am to     suggest that the VER may have

had   the kinds of     effects suggested by the mod.l of Krishna (1983) and that it

is worth understanding such models better.

     In this paper      I   wifl concentrate on the effects of a VER with

complementary goods in order to focus on the difference betw.*n Harris'

approach   an   mine.       Its effects when goods are substitutes are    .ore   cosplix

and are dealt with in Krishna (1983).         The .odel    Is pr.s.nt.d   in the n.xt

section and a VER is analyzed in Section 4, as        is   a tariff.   Tariffs and

quotas are shown to DC equilvalent when goods are complements, in contrast to

their non—equivalence when goods are substitutes. The final section contains

some concluding remarks.

3.      The Model

     There are two firms, domestic and foreign,                producing differentiated goods

in amounts x and x* respectively. Demand arises from utility maximization by

an aggregate domestic consumer of U(S) + n, Subject to a budget constraint.

The scaler. S •      F(x,x*),     represents the services produced by the two goods.

Services can be thought of as being produced by the aggregate consumer in

which case F(.) is a household production function. Alternatively, S could be

thought of as being produced by competitive suppliers of services who in turn

require x and x* to make S.             F    is assumed to be a constant return to scale

production function.           n is the amount of the numeraire good consumed.           As

usual,    the budget constraint         is   given by


                    +n     I   + I
            P5S

where       is th, price of a        Unit of services which      of course depends on the

prices of x and x* and the production technology.                  I   and I denote lump sum

income and any tariff revenue that arises.                 I and I are taken as given

constants in the .axl.izmtion of utility.

     These assu.ptlons give rise to a demand function for S, S0,                  whre

            $0      0(P5).


Of course, P5 • C(P,P*) where            C(.) is th. Unit cost of producing a Service

associated with th, production function F(.) given that, th. prices of goods

produced   at home    and abroad are P and P*, respectively. This Is because of

•lth.r co.petltlon In the            sarket   for services or because of household

production of S.         The deeand for the       ho.e    fir. Is therefore given by

produce   a   unit of S at minimum cost, given the prices of x and x*.                  Si.ilarly.

the foreign firm's demand function is given by


              x*(P,P*)     a*(p/p*)D[C(p,p*)}


where a*(P/P*)

     An increase       in the price of the imported good,        *,     has two effects it

raises x(.) since it raises a(P/P*l,       but it also reduces x(.), as it raises

C(.) and hence reduces OIC(.)1.        The intensity of the first effect depends

positively on the elasticity of substitution between x and x* in making S.

The intensity of the second effect depends on             .   the   price elasticity of

demand for S.      With a constant elasticity of substitutioa               ,   between x and

X*, goods are substitutes       when   -       0 and complements when a           -   C <   0.8
     I   will consider the case where a -               0, so   that the goods are

complements in demend.        Firms are assumed to compete in price.9                 In order to

eliminate the possibility of aultimarket interactions.                 I   assume that marginal

costs of production of the two firms are constint at r and r*.                    The domestic

firm chooses P to maximize its profits         ii(.),   where


                          (P_r)a(P/P*)0(C(P.P*)1.


It takes P* as given and chooses its optimal P for every P*, which yields its

best response function 8(P*). Similarly, the foreign firm's maximization of

m*(p,P*) defined analogously yields B*(P).              The Intersection of B(.) and
                                            -14-


9*(,) gives     a Nash equilibrium point.    I   will assume that n(.) and    iT*(.)   are
concave in their own pric, for any given price of the other and that a unique

stable Nash equilibrium exists,      In order to focus      on any possible   effects of

a VER,   I   will assume for simplicity that in its absence firms are identical.

     Both upward and downward sloping best response functions are possible,              so

that no assumptions about the Slopes of B(.) and B*(,) are made aside from

their both being of the same sign, and the system being stable.           The stable

equilibrium with downward sloping best response functions is depicted in

Figure 1.      Profits of each firm increase as    the   other's price decreases, as is

shown by the direction of the arrows in Figure 1.

4.      The Effects of Trade Restrictions

        Having specified the operation of the model in the absence of trade

restrictions,    I   turn to the effects         of   trade restrictions on the equilibrium

of the game.     I   first consider the effects of VEils and then turn to the

analysis of tariffs.

        The first step is to identify the region of prices where the                 VEil   is


binding.    To do so, consider the Set of prices such that the constraint on

imports    is exactly met.      I   will assume in the exposition that the VER is set

at the free trade level.            It will become clear that the analysis generalizes

for any level of the VER in a straightforwardmanner.

        The line P*   •   G(P) depicts the       set of   P end    * such that    the demand for

x* equals its level under free trade. Hence,                     it passes through tEN' Pt), the

Nash equilibrium point. As the goods are complements, 6(P) is downward

sloping,   and the constraint binds on the foreign fir* at points below the line

6(P).     For a given P. low values of P* raise its demand and sake the

constraint bind.       For a given     P,   low values of P raise the demand for x*,

making the constraint bind.

        Consider the effect of the       VEil    on the best respons. function for the

foreign firm,     The case depicted in Figure             1   with downward sloping best

responses will be analyzed.           It should be obvious that similar arguments can

be used to analyze upward sloping best responses. For P <                    H'   the foreign

firm would, in the absence of a          VEil,   choose to charge a price such that its

demand exceeds the level of the          VEil.    This Is evident fro. Figure         1   as 8(P)

lies to the left      of   6(P) for P <           The    VEil,   however, forces the foreign

firm to sell less than It would desire, and its optimal                   strategy   is to sell
                                                    —16-


all that it         is allowed at      the price that clears the market —-                 i.e.,    at 0(P).10

For prices above             N'   B*(P) lies to the right of 0(P) and the constraint

does not affect the foreign firm's behavior.                        Thus,   the foreign firm's best

response         function in this region is given by B*(P) which is depicted by the

dashed line in Figure 1.

       Next, consider the effect of the VEP                on      the profits of the domestic firm.

Define ,t(P)             w(P,G(P)). n(.) gives the profits for the domestic firm along the

line 0(P).          It is assumed that w(P) is concave and reaches a finite maximum at

       tm,   shown in Figl4res 1 and 2.           T(P)   is depicted in Figure             2.


       w(P,P*)           is also depicted    in Figure 2 for a given value of                      Notice

that   (P,P*) • ,r(P) when P            is such that 0(P) •         P* ——    i.e.,   at   P•    0(P*).      At

this point it is easy to see that                              <
                                                                   w(P). This is          because an
                                  w(P.P*)
increase         in P reduces P* along 6, which acts to raise e, while no such effect

operates on         ir


       Let w(P*,P) be the profit function of the domestic firm when the VER is

imposed      on the        foreign fire.     For a given value of           *,   the domestic firm can

charge       a   low price and make the constraint bind on the foreign fire, or charge

a high price and leave the foreign fire unconstrained by the VER.                                  If the

domestic         fire charges a relatively low price, I.e. below                  G(P*), the          foreign

fir. Is Supply constrained at P* since its Supply Is                         limited      by the VER and its

deeand exceeds this level.                 In this case,   I    assume that the following

rationing         rule applies:      Consumers fortunate enough to obtain th. foreign good

at P* will r.sell It at a price that clears the market.                           Since the form of the

domestic consumer utility function implies that there are no Income effects,

the effect        on th. domestic firm Is exactly              that of the foreign firm charging
                                                          —17—




G(P) itself.         However,        this is exactly what m(P)

is defined to be.             Hence.         if P <   G1(P*), m(P,P*)         •   (PJ.
         If,   on   the other hand, the domestic firm charges a high                        price,        i.e.,

P     G1P*).        the VER does not bind on th. foreign firm when It charges P* so

that It is not supply-constrained                      and th. domestic firms            profits remain

e(p,p*).       Hence,       if P         G1(P*), n(P,P*) •

       m(.)     is depicted         in Figure 2.         Notice that l(.} is continuous in P by

definition.         Since
                             1r(P)
                                         >
                                             W(P,P)      at p •   1(p*) and         ,r(.}   and   ,v(.)   are

concave in P. one of the three cases must hold.                              Either


                                   (.)   ) 0,         Case (a)


                         > 0 >                    Case ID);
                                   e(.).

or             0              >                   Case (c).
                     n(.)          ir(.).

These three cases are depicted In Figure 2(a), (b} and (c).

       Notice that even though w Is made up of segments of m and n, It remains

concave.       Thus,     the best response function of th, domestic firm with a VER,

8(P*),     is continuous.           In fact,      It is easy to see what B(P*) is from Figure 2.

In Case (a), 8(P*) •           B(P*); In Case           (b).,   B(P*)    •   01(P*);     and in Case (c),

B(P*) =             Also,    each case Is coepl.tely characterlz*d by the slopes of

     and       along G(P).          Thus in Figure        1   when    *>P         the relevant case          Is (a).

When P     c P* <
                       P,    it Is (b) and when P*                P     it Is (c).       This gives ris,          to
the   B(P*) function depicted by the solid line In Figure 1.

       Notice thst a VER at the fre, trade levels has no effect on the

equillbriu. when goods x and x* are coaplements. Intuitively,                                 this     result can
be explained        as   follows.         Consider     the effect of the VER on the demand for x

the domestic       product on the assumption that                   the foreign fire sells the exact

amount of the VER which requires thet                      P*.     G(P).    Henc., x(P) a x(P,G(P)).

x(P) is also depicted in Figure 3(a).                       It Intersects                  at   P    PP4•
                                                                                                            It
                                                                              X(P.PP4)

is also steeper than X(P.PP4) at                            as depicted in Figure          3(a).     This is

because                 •                        +                           which exceeds

     x(.)
        The demand function facing the domestic fire in the presence of a VER is

given by the curve MC sirce the VER only binds on the foreign firm when                                     P<PP4

since the goods arm complements. Although the demand function for the

domestic firm on the Cssumption that the                         foreign   firm sells the amount of the

VER is lass elastic than th. demand curve facing the domestic firm when the

foreign firm's                       is given,       the VER only   restricts   the   foreign       firm when P

is low.         Thus, the VER aales the demand facing the domestic fir, less elastic

but only for price levels below the                      competitive equilibrium price.              This does

not    create any       incentive to rais, or              ow,r price on the part of the domestic

fir. ——     La.,      no     'P4"   effect occurs.

                        is depicted In Figure 3(b).                 x* is the demand facing the foreign

at   the level of the VER.                It intersects x*(PN,P*) at P*           =   p.        The VER is only

binding when P* <             PP4•
                                       Thus, the VER .ales the demand curv, facing the foreign

firm into        AEC'.         Hence,     the foreign fir, also has no reason to change its

price given                 and the free trade equilibrium remains an equilibrium.
                   P,
l4oreovar, the VER does not give the domestic fir, the                          profits     of a Stackelberg

leader.

         This is in contrast to the effects of a VER with Substitute goods.                            It

 is easy to see that if
                                 it(.)
                                           >   0, es it is    with    substitute goods, G(p*) is

upward sloping.          However,   even in this case.               remains greater than       irp   at
P .   G(P*).        Therefore.      the   three cases    pr.viously mentioned remain the

only ones.        However,     the constraint binds       for          values of P and not low

ones.      This is what creates a nonconcavity In               it      when goods are suostitutes.

This nonconcavity         causes a discontinuity in th, best response                function and

makes the unique equilibrium a mixed strategy one.                      However,    since the peak
of (p). the profits of a Stackelberg leader, can be attained Dy the domestic

firm by charging a high enough price,               the domestic firms profits must be at

least those of a Stackelberg leader and In equilibrium can be shown                            to be
equal to those of a Stackelb.rg leader.

         The details of this analysis can be found In Krishna (1983)., In

equilibrium, all prices and profits are ahown to ris, when                      a   VER at     or
clos,     to the frme trade level of imports             Is   1.posed. Some     intuition      for this

comes from noticing that th,
                                                                            *       -
                                          relationship    between x(PN,PN)      and   X(Pft}
                                                                                               with

substitut. goods remains the sam. as with complementary goods.                           This Is

because 0(P) >       0   and
                               x(.)        0 so that
                                                     xp(PN.P)
                                                              C
                                                                         x(P)      as before.

However,    the constraint now binds for high values of P given                     P.    Hence, th,

demand curve facing the domestic produc.r Is                  given    by BED in Figure 3(a) and

bcomes ore        inelastic for prices above PH.              This creates an       Incentiv,       for th.

domestic fir. to raise Its prica.                This in turn shifts th, foreign firms

demand    function   outward to 80 in Figure 3(b), and makes it opti.al for the

foreign    firm to also raise its prices to that corresponding to the point F In

Figure    3(b).    This ia why all prices tend to rise, which tends                   to raise
profits as well.

     Returning     to the effects of a VER with complementary goods, it is easy to

verify that if best response functions are upward sloping,           exactly analogous

arguments show that there is no effect of a VER at free trade levels. In this
                                              *
case, 8*(P) always lies to the right of P* .    so the Nash equilibrium

profits also equal the profits when the domestic firm is           a Stackelberg leader.
     Now consider the affects of a tariff.        A tariff on imports shifts the

foreign firm's best response function outward to one such as 8*(P,t)               in

Figure   1.   This leads to an equilibrium at E.        The line     •   G(P,t)   depicts
the set of prices which lead to the demand       for,   imports being equal   to their

level under the tariff t.      As G(P,t) lies above 0(P), the level of imports

falls.    It is easy to verity,   by using   arguments    analogous to those previously

eade, that if this level of imports Is set as a VER, the equilibrium of the

game remains at E.     Thus, tariffs and VERs are equivalent with complementary

goods.   The only difference between them lies in the fact that no revenues are

collected by the domestic governmentunder a VER.           However, tariffs and VERs

are not equivalent when the goods are substitutes for on. another,                In this

case VERa hav, effects by thur very presence,           even when they are not set at

     Given that tariffs and quotas have different effects depending on whether

goods are substitutes or complements,     the natural question to ask is when one

might expect to see lobbying in favor of VERa and by who..

     If goods are complements,    a restrictive VER reduces foreign output, which

reduces domestic    profits.   (This can be seen in Figure 1 as profits rise in

the direction of the arrow so that domestic profits at E are lower than at A.)

Intuitively this is because a reduction In the availability of the foreign

good reduces the willingness to pay for the domestic one because of
their complementary nature.            It is, therefore, unlikely that domestic firms

would lobby for VERs.            For the same reason, the domestic firm would not lobby

for a tariff     on   imports.     The foreign fire is also unlikely to desire VERs

that are even moderately restrictive.              It will not des,r. them if best

response     functions    are upward sloping.       However,    if best response functions

are downward sloping, slightly restrictive VERa would raise its profits.                      This

is because the iso-profit          contours eré horizontal at A and a slight VER would

move the equilibrium into the shaded area in Figure                1   where the foreign firms

profits rise.      However,      the increase    in profits    is likely to be marginal.

       The incentives to lobby when goods are substitutes are coaplmtely

different.      In this case a VER serves as a precommitment device that

fmcilitates     collusion and all profits rise in a discrete manner when               a   VER at

or close to free trade is imposed.              Lobbying for VERa by both foreign and

domestic firms is to be expected in this case.                 Tariffs on the other hand,

improve the competitive position of do.estlc firms and raise their profits,

but reduce thosa of the foreign firm.              This is becaus, th, tariff tends to

raise the foreign price when goods ar, substitutes. This acts to raise

domestic profits along the domestic best response function                 --   and reduce

foreign profits.         Here,   a domestic firm   wlU   ThbDy    for a   tariff and a foreign

one   wifl   oppose   t   -- which   is   the usual presumption.

5.      Corclusion

        The results of    me   preceding analysis suggest that we should see efforts

to lobby for VERs when substitutionpossibilities between products in making

the services are large compared to the elasticity of demand for services —-

i.e..    when goods are substitutes in demand.           We should not see    such efforts

when they are complements.         Thus,   if domestic   producers made only speakers and

foreign    ones made only emplifiers, one would not expect to see lobbies for

VERS on amplifiers.        However,   if both made complete systems      and only sold them

as a    unit, one would expect to see such lobbies.          Moreover,    the results imply

that    tariffs    end quotas ar. equivalentwhen goods are complements -- even with

oligopoly. However,        they are fundamentally non-equivalentwhen goods are

substitutes.

        The paper suggests that large price increases should be associated with

the    imposition of    a VER with substitute goods,      but   not with complementary

goods.     This is so even when the VER is set at a          level   close to the tree trade

one.     While a    VER does give the domestic firm the profits of a          Stackeberg
leader when goods      are substitutes. and a     particular rationing     rul. is

employed,    it does not    necessarily do so    when they are complements end it is

inappropriate       to assume that a VER cakes       the domestic firm   into a Steckelberg

leader.

        Finally,    the profusion of models used to study the        effects of   VERs end

the variety of results yielded Dy them make further             work on the   empirical   side

highly desirable.

4.     In Gelman and    Shop        (1983) capacity choice plays th. sam, role a VER

plays here.      However,     it can be prohibitively expensive        for   the   foreign firm
to constrain capacity if it sells in other markets as well.                   A VER then

operates as a selective capacity constraint.

quantity competition models by showing that the Cournot outcom, arises as the

equilibrium of a two stage game, where firms              first   choose   capacities    and then

compete in price,      given Capacities.

10.    The unconvinced reader should draw a concave ,r*(P,P*)              for    a given P end

verify that the VER alters w*(P,P*) by           creating   • linear segment for low P*.

The   resulting kink    in   ,r*   is what makes it optimal   to   price at      0(P).
