                      DISABILITY STATUS AS AN UNOBSERVABLE:
                        ESTIMATES FROM A STRUCTURAL MODEL


                                    ABSTRACT



      We propose an index of "true disability" by treating disability sta-

tus as an unobservable phenomenon which is both causally related to a

number of exogenous characteristics of an individual and correlated with

a number of observed indicators of health, impairment and qualifications

for   empløyment.
      First, we define true disability and distinguish it from related con-

cepts. We then discuss the importance of an objective and reliable

measure of disability for research on the determinants of behavior.

Next, we present the specification of our structural model for estimating

true disability as a latent variable. Finally, we report the results of

our estimation in a simple model of Labor force participation, and com-

pare the effect of using the constructed index and a self-reported disa-

bility measure on understanding the determinants of behavior and choice.

                      Disability Status as    am Unobs.rvabl.*
                        EsUast..   fro. a Structural Nodal


   The true health or disability status of          an   individual is an important
determinant   of a wide variety of his/her decisions.         Prominent among

these are   decisions   regarding fertility and marriage, whether or not to

work, how much to work and the     kind   of work to do, whether or not to

apply for income transfer benefits, whether or not to seek retraining and

rehabilitation services, and the extent of health          care service     utiliza-

tion. Research designed to model and empirically estimate the               deter-
minants of these decisions requires reliable and objective indicators of

the presence of a health problem or disabling condition, and,               if   present,

of the severity of the problem. Nearly        without    exception, studies of the

determinants of   individual behavior have     employed     one   of   the following

health or disability status     indicators, each of which has substantial
disadvantages for both behavioral research and           statistical descriptions

of the   disability   status of the   population:

    1.    Individual self-reports. These are subjective and potentially
          endogenous with the choices under consideration. The self-
          reports are likely to reflect preferences in addition to true
          activity—limiting conditions.

    2. Medical reports. These are partial in their evaluation, loosely
        related to individual labor market potential, and of limited
        availability.

    3.    Post-observation mortality. This measure reflects only those
          physical and mental characteristics associated with individual
          longevity, many of which may be unrelated to functional ability.


    In this paper, we     propose and estimate a new       index which is designed

to measure the °true disability" status of an individual. This index

treats true disability status      as   an unobservable phenomenon, but one
                                        2




which is both causally related to a variety of exogenous characteristics

of an individual and correlated with a variety of observed measures of

statuses and behaviors believed to be associated with true limits on

functioning. tn Section 1, we define what we mean by true disability,

and distinguish it from the related concepts of impairment, handicap, and

health Status. Section It discusses the importance of an objective and

reliable indicator of disability status for economic research, using the

studies of the work-effort response of individuals to available income

transfers to illustrate the problem. Section III presents the specifica-

tion of our structural model for estimating true disability as a latent

variable, and Section IV presents the resulting estimates of the relevant

parameters. Finally, we compare our estimated index with a limited

self—reported measure in a simple model of labor force participation.



I•   DISABILITY, IMPAIRMENTS,    AND HEALTH STATUS



     A   definition of disablement or impairment is necessary to identify

the population group we will label "disabled." Unfortunately, there is

no definition that    is   unambiguously the correct one, as the concept of

disability ultimately rests on a social judgment. Only when a person

falls    significantly below some threshold of deviation from the level of

physical or mental capacity required to engage in productive activities

within a social environment does society designate that person as suf-

ficiently atypical to be classified as disabled. However, no unambiguous

threshold has been identified and no uncontroversial indicator exists by

which to designate certain individuals as disabled or to indicate the

severity of their condition. All efforts to identify the disabled
                                          3




population and to measure the     extent       of their limitation have relied on

some surrogate or proxy     indicator, often a       response to a survey question-

naire.

      We seek a measure of disability appropriate for analyzing the nature

and   determinants of economic behavior.         Such a   measure should accurately

reflect the functional capabilities possessed by individuals relevant to

the aspect of behavior being studied. Henc., in analyzing individual

market work behavior, we define disability as a shortfall in the physi-

cal, mental, or emotional capability of an individual to adequately per-

form activities required for jobs which, on other grounds, he or she

would be qualified to hold. Consistent with this functional-capability

definition of disability, we define handicap to be a limitation of a phy-

sical, mental, or emotional sort which reduces, to varying degree,, one's

ability to perform the functions required for jobs as well             as   other   acti-
vities.    And we define impairment as a loss         in physiological, anatomical
or mental capacity which may lead         to a handicap. These definitions

reflect   three considerations    which affect an individual's success in the

labor    market: whether or not    an    individual is limited in specific work-
related functions; the severity of these           limitations; and the require-

ments    in terms of functional performance that are imposed by occupations
which an    individual   could normally bold, given his or her age,          education,

training, and skills (see Nagi, 1969).
    With these definitions, an individual's true disability status ie
distinguishable from his or her health status, even though the b,o con-
cepts overlap. Health status concerns deviations             from   what is commonly
referred to as "good health," and typically involves impairments in one
or more of the body's systems.          Such   impairments are often short-term
                                         4




(e.g., influenza); they may also be          long   ter,   or   termin.el. When they are

long term, they may or may not impair a person'. ability to perform the

functions required by his or her       occupation.         Thus, a severely disabled

person (e.g., a quadriplegic) may well be in good health. Conversely, a

person sick with influenza may have no job-prejudicing impairments. On

the other hand, a person bedridden with terminal cancer has poor health

status and is severely disabled.'



II. DISA3ILITT STATUS AND ECONOMIC IEIiAVIOR


    An individual's disability (and health) status is relevant to a wide

variety of his or her economic choices—-e.g., marital status, fertility,

labor supply, occupation, and geographic location. Studies of the deter-

minants of individual choice in all of these dimensions typically focus

on the   role   of economic and demographic factors in explaining observed

behavior. Success in obtaining unbiased estimates of the                role   played by

the economic variables requires accurate measures of control variables

which are also related to the observed status, including the                   presence
and severity of handicaps.

   Considet, for example, studies analyzing the decision to retire, most

of which have relied upon some for, of self-reported disability (or

health) status. Use of such self-report measures ha. been criticized on

grounds that     the   disability or health-statue responses offered by indivi-

duals both reflect and serve to justify decision, that have already been

made (see Parsons, 1982; Leonard, 1986). If, for stigma or other

reasons, respondents rationalize a decision not to work (e.g., retiring

before age 65) by citing work-related handicaps (or poor health) as
                                      5




reasons,   the coefficient associated with the self-reported disability

status variable will be larger     than   that on a variable measuring true

disability status (Bound, 1987). As a corollary, the measured effect of

expected Labor   market income   on the decision to work will be a biased

estimate of its true effect.2

    Parsons (1982) attempted to evaluate the problems associated with se

of a self—reported disability index in a single equation retirement/

replacement rate/disability transfer model. Comparing results from using

both a self-reported disability indicator and actual mortality experience

five years after the observed work status choice decision, be found that

the subsequent mortality measure was less closely related to the work

effort decision than was the contemporaneous self-reported measure, and

that the replacement rate was more significant when the mortality measure

was used. From this exercise, he concluded that use of self-reports of

disability in models of behavior tends to distort the measured effect of

economic variables.

    The use of the subsequent mortality indicator to proxy true

disability status at the time of a work-retirement decision has been cri-

ticized by Havemaa and Wolfe (1984) as being arbitrary, a notoriously

weak proxy for work-impairing limitations (the factor which is likely to

be dominant in affecting work choices), and as excluding a wide variety

of handicaps that are unrelated to longevity. The results of Colvez and

Blanchet (1981), indicating the inverse movement over time of mortality

rates and the incidence of handicaps and impairments of a wide variety of

 types cast further doubt on the appropriateness of this indicator in
                                              6




studies of individual behavior. The puzzle is made even more               complicated
by the findings of recent studies indicating that Individual              self—reports

of health are stable over time, highly correlated with medical doctor

reports, and show no evidence of exaggeration of problems related to

being out of the work force (see Maddox and Douglass, 1973; Waldron,

Rerold, and Dunn, 1982; Ferraro, 1980 and Mossey and Shapiro, 1982).

       Existing research findings, then, leave unresolved the choice of a

disability indicator for studies of individual economic behavior. Both

simple self-reports of the disabled/nondisabled Status of the individual

and    indicators of current                     physicians reports or sub-
                                      disability based on

sequent    mortality have serious limitations for use in behavioral studies.
More comprehensive self-reported indicators, especially those that
reflect    the severity of impairing conditions, may         be subject   to fewer of
these    weaknesses.



III.     AN INDICATOR OF TRUE DISA3ILITT: ThE MODEL


       Given the   absence   of
                           reliable empirical counterpart to an economic
                                  a

concept of disability--and the controversy regarding use of simple self-
reported    disability or subsequent mortality indicators in the analysis           of
the    determination of individual choice--an attempt to develop an indepen-

dent, more comprehensive measure of true             disability   is in order. In this

section, we present      our proposed        measure. This indicator is designed to

be a multi-purpose indicator of true disability, and emphasizes the func-

tional and work-related character of impairing conditions. Hence, the

indicator    is applicable for a number of purposes,          including the
                                             7




identification of the size and characteristic. of the disabled popula-

tion,   and as    a control variable    in   analyses of the determinants    of econo-
mic   behavior.
      Consistent    with the economic definition      of disability   presented in

Section 1, a reliable measure of true disability ihould reflect thtee

phenomena: (I) functional limitations, (2) severity of handicap, and (3)

occupational capacity related to functional limitations. The index of

'true disability" proposed here treats disability status as an unobser-

vable condition, which is both causally           related to a number   of exogenous

individual characteristics and correlated with a number of observed indi-

cators of individual health and disability, and with the availability of

employment for which one is qualified. This measure of "true disability"

is modelled jointly along with the individual's income from a system of

structural equations. Figure 1 presents a sketch of the model.

      The relationship between the disability index and income net             of

transfers (personal income) is clear. Better health and less severe han-

dicaps are positively related to productivity and hence one's               earnings.
On    the other   hand, the demand     for   health increases with the wage rate.

In the model, true disability and income are also determined by a set of

exogenous variables. These include the socioeconomic characteristics of

the individual (education, age, race, urban-rural, sex, marital and

veteran status), personal habits, and the requirements and charac-

 teristics of     an individual's normal occupation. They are shown in the
boxes on the left-hand side and bottom of the figure. The exclusion of

 race and current marital status variables from the true disability struc-

or functional limitations and provide indirect measures of the underlying

disability. These are shown on the right-hand side of the figure, and

include      the extent of disability reported by both the interviewer and the

tespondent, self-reported work limitations, whether the individual is

unemployed because of a health problem, the presence of a sight problem,

an    indicator of      strength   and of the change in strength, and the     percen-

tage of      weighted   occupations for which a person is       qualified   (based on a

comparison of individual capabilities with requirements of each

occupation      from the    Dictionary   of   Occupational   Titles). Among these, the
self—report      of disability and self-report of        future work prospects are

ordered      4-category discrete variables; the        interviewer disability check,

and    the presence of      a   sight problem are ordered 3-category discrete
variables;      self-report work limitations, being unemployed because of a

health problem, and the strength indicator are binary variables; the

variables reflecting strength change and the percent of jobs for which

 the individual is qualified are continuous indicators. Each of these 9

 indicators are taken to be associated            with the   measurement of the unob-

 served "true disability"           index.

       Let   Y be the    logarithm    of individual personal income, D* be     the imob-

 servabl.e disability index, and X1,              be vectors of exogenous charac-

 teristics of the individual. In essence, we estimate a three stage

 model. In the first stage, a set of measurement equations for D5 are

 estimated including Y (personal income). In the second stage, we
                                               10




estimate a set of reduced form equations for D* and Y from the measure-

ment equations (stage one). Also in this stage, we obtain the estimates

of the coefficient parameters of the                measurement equations. In the third
stage, we estimate a structural model, in which D* and I are jointly

determined. We begin these estimates with the reduced form estimates

from stage b4o. Throughout, we use ordered polychotomous probit equa-

tions and linear regressions as appropriate to the indicator variable.

      The structure of this model, using the notation and parameters

corresponding to the notation of all post-parameterized variables and

parameters in the Appendix3, can be stated as



(1)          + l2 D          1j   l   +

         2l Y + D 1 .2 +

where U'             (U1, U2) is bivariate normal and is i.i.d. across individuals.

The measurement equations for D are

where         is a measure of the unobserved variable D; the cj's are inde-

pendent of U and have an i.t.d. normal distribution across individuals.

In order to identify the measurement equations, ci and X1 have been

normalized to be 0 and 1 (or -1), respectively.4 Solving equations (1)

and inserting the reduced form of                   into (2), we obtain a set of reduced

form equations.

Since U'            (U1, U2) is a bivariate normal and               n    — (n1, ri2), the linear
combination of U1 and                is also a bivartate normal. By the property of

estimation          for   this model     is   generally   not feasible. Lee (1982)                   proposed

a   three-stage procedure on a multiple discrete indicators model, which is

model follows this three-stage procedure.

Social Security Administration Survey of                   Disabled      and Nondisabled Adults.
To these data we added a constructed variable measuring the percentage of
occupations             for which a person is qualified, based on            information in the
Dictionary of Occupational Titles compared to their m education and

physical capabilities. We weighted the education and physical require-

ments of 3—digit occupations by the prevalence of each                        occupation   by sex,

and then matched these to individuals according to their education and

physical characteristics.

       Among male8, for the   disability   measure. [reported in columns (I) —

(9)1, education    and age are generally significant and enter with sign.

that    the Literature would predict. Those living in rural areas tend to
have less indication of the presence of impairing conditions, and this
variable is statistically significant in about one-half of the cases.
Having been exposed to adverse atmospheric conditions prior to the onset
of disability is positively related to impairments and is significant in

several cases; few of the hazardous job characteristics are significant.

With but few exceptions, neither the race nor the marital         status

variables are significant. Having been a         veteran is   generally related to

poorer health status, but is statistically significant in but a few

cases. While the alcohol consumption variable is generally positively

related to the absence of disability statue, it is rarely significant.

The opposite is true of the cigarette consumption variable; it is posi-

tively related to disability status and has a statistically significant

coefficient in several of the estimates. Finally, the two economic

variables--income and having a work history-—are inversely related to the

presence or severity of disability, and are generally significant.

       The Last column of the table reports the personal income regression.

Education and age enter with the expected signs, and the squared terms of

 each are very significant. Rural residence is associated with higher

 income, and is also significant. Being exposed to hazardous employment

 prior to being disabled is associated with        significantly higher income;

 being    married prior to the onset of disability also has higher associated
                                       28



income.     Somewhat surprisingly, the race variables are    not significant.
As has often been found, alcohol consumption is positively and

significantly associated with income; tobacco consumption is a       negative
and significant determinant.

    Table    3 presents estimates from the same model,    but for females. The

patterns are similar to those for males, with the primary exception of
the work-nonwork variable. For females, a history of never working tends
to be positively associated with better health and fewer impairments,
perhaps indicating the economic pressure on women with impairments who
simultaneously    tend to be   unmarried. Again, alcohol consumption tends to
be positively related to health; cigarette consumption is associated with
more serious disablements and is significant in about one-half       of the

cases. The results in the income equation are similar         to those for men.
    Stage    2 entails estimation of the reduced form parameters, fl, fl

[see equation (3)) and the      coefficients of the measurement   equations for

D Lsee equation (2)1.

    The reduced form coefficients are reported        in Table 4 for both men
and women.     The income coefficients are the same    as those reported in
Tables 2 and 3; the reduced form coefficients on           are in the second
column of the bjo panels of the table. For both males and females, edu-
cation and age are strongly related to the unobserved D', and have the
expected signs. Being a rural resident is negatively and significantly
associated with true disability      in   these reduced form estimates. Again,
hazardous work does not appear      to contribute strongly to D*, while expo-

tends to be positively associated with current levels of true dabi1ity

for females, rower levels of D ste associated with being currently

married for both genders. Black men (women) have significantly 1ot

(higher) levels of D, relative to whites and the omitted racial cate-

gories. Hale veterans tend to be more disabled. And, consistent with

the estimates in Tables 2 and 3, alcohol (cigarette) consumption is asso-

ciated with lower (higher) levels of true disability.

    The parameters in the measurement equations for D (see equation 2)

are shown in Table 5, with A      1, a        0 imposed on the Future Work

(Limited Work) equations for males (females). All of the signs are as

expected and the coefficients on each of the eight indicators are very

significant--with t-values ranging from 1.4 to 117. The last indicator,

percentage of jobs for which the respondent is qualified has a very

significant association suggesting the importance of vocational con-

S idera tions.

    The final or third stage involves estimation of the structural para-

meters, B and r   [equation   (10)) from II, fl. See Table 6. Consider

first the income equation estimates. For both males and females, D is

inversely and significantly associated with personal income-- the        t-
statistics   are very large. Again for both groups, age and education are

significant determinants of income, with reasonable nonlinear patterns of

the relationships. For males and females, education beyond 6 years is

positively associated with income. The age variable for males indicates

a standard hump-shaped profile, peaking at 53 years. For females, the

profile   is positive throughout, suggesting that earnings       increase after

childbearing. This relationship is likely to be related to the large and

significant coefficient on the never worked variable for females.

     As   is   expected, for both       sexes,    being currently married is associated

with higher income. Urban-rural location i negatively related to

income, but is never significant. The atmosphere variable reduces per-

sonal Income for males, but is not significant. For both bLack and white

males In this sample, personal income is Lower than for the omitted

racial categories; for white females personal income is higher than for

black females and for those in the omitted racial category.

     The second column in each panel presents the structural estimates of

the determinants of true disability. For both males and females, income
                                *
is   negatively related to 1)       ,
                                        and is significant in both cases. For males
                                                                                 *
and females, education appears to be negatively associated with D , as

expected. Age is positively and very strongly associated with the true

disability variable for both men and women. For men and women, rural
                                                                         *
residence      is significantly and negatively associated with 0 .             Hazardous

work contributes to disability status for males and females. Never

having worked is negatively associated with true disability for females,

and the coefficient is statistically significant. The negative coef-

ficient on the atmosphere variable for males is unexpected, but if com-

pensating wage differentials exist, this effect may be picked op in the

Income variable. As expected, veterans status is significantly related

 to D for males, and somewhat lees so for females. Marital                   status   at

onset is positively associated with                   for both females and males.

Finally, as observed previously, alcohol consumption appears to be in-

versely related       to disability status, while cigarette consumption is a
                                              36



significant         contributor to disability status for males.                For    females,

alcohol consumption appears to positively affect disability status; no

affect of cigarette conaumption is observed.

      We use these estimates to obtain a predicted disability status                          for
each observation using the formula D* 21 +                                    where           and

      are obtained from the        previous    three stages estimation procedure as

listed       in Table 6. Our mean predicted            values for D* are -.2085 (0.62)

for    men   and 1.182 (1.916) for women.
      Table 7 compares our estimated                measure, a continuous variable,

with o N-chotomous disability indicators--an interviewer check of disa-

bility and self-reported disability--for a selection of demographic

subgroups. All of the values reported there are etated as a ratio to the

mean of the sex-specific indicator; higher values indicate more severe

disability.          While the    patterns   across    the    three measures    are similar,
        *
the D indicator displays a greater range and variance which is con-

sistent with its continuous nature.



V •    HKALTH STATUS AND LABOR SUPPLY: A COMPARISON


       The effort to estimate           an index of true disability (or health) status

is    motivated by the      need    for an independent and comprehensive measure of
individual health or           disability,    if   estimates     of the determinants of
behavior and choice are            to   be unbiased.     In    this   section, we compare
D     with    a   self-reported    disability variable in a           labor   supply model, and
compare       the   resulting partial derivatives of the variables                in   this   model

in    their role as determinants of labor supply. The model of labor supply

that we estimate         is:

       We estimate equation 11 by standard ptobit estimation methods. The

partial derivatives from these regressions are reported in Table 8.

Included in this       simple   model are race (white), education, age, other

family income and disability status. The model is estimated separately

by gender.

       Consider first the male results. Both of the disability measures

have the    expected    sign--work and disability status are negatively

related. Both measures are statistically significant at the 1 percent

level of significance. Recalling that the means are .52 and 2.22 for

0 and self-reported health, respectively, the measured influence of

     is substantially greater than for self-reported health. A 5 percent

increase in 0* is expected to decrease male labor force participation by

.5   percent; the same       percentage   increase   in self-reported health is

expected       to increase participation by .18 percent.

      While   white males are estimated to be more likely participants in
both equations, the      measured   influence of race is approximately 5 times
greater in the equation including the D* measure of disability.
      In the caseof     0* the   influence   of education on labor force par-
ticipation should include both the direct effect and the indirect effect

via its influence on disability (see Table 6). In both equations more

education is associated with greater participation. The total (direct

and indirect) effect of education in the probit with D* (as measured by

the partial derivative at the mean) i 1.78, a value substantially

greater than the very small .0003 partial derivative from the equation

with the self-reported health measure.

      A with education, measurement of the effect of age on work requires

consideration of both direct and indirect effects (see Table 6). The

partial derivative of age on male participation in the fl* equation is

-
    .186,   as compared to -.0003 in the equation with self-reported health.

Again a sizable difference exists, with a very small influence measured

in the equation with self-reported health and a large and significant
                                       *
influence in the equation with 0
      The last variable in the male equations is other family income. The

coefficient has the same sign in both estimatee, but once again the par-

tial derivatives at the mean are quite different in magnitude (-.027 and

—.008); again the larger influence is in the probit with 0*.

      The pattern among women is similar. The partial derivative (at the

mean) of the disability measure is substantially greater for             than

self-reported health. A 5 percent increase in the           disability measure
is   associated with a 1.98 percent decrease in women's labor force par-

ticipation for Dt, but only a .7 percent increase using self-reported
                                          41




health. Race (white) is not significant in either equation, but the par-

tial derivative for the total effect of age is -2.74 in the D* equation,

compared to -.003 in the estimate         using   self-reported health. For educa-

tion, the partial derivative for the total effect to 7.82 in the estimate
           *
with      D , and .015 with self-reported health. For other family income

this pattern is reversed--the partial derivative is -.009 in the
    *
D        equation, and a larger -.039 in the equation with self-reported

health.

         These results indicate the importance of the choice of the measure of

health status in understanding the determinants of economic behavior--in

this case, work effort. Not only is the health status measure chosen

crucial to accurately estimating the effect of health on work effort, but

also       to effectively capturing the   influence   of a variety of other
variables on choice.


VI.        CONCLUSION


          An indicator of true disability status has been constructed using a

3—stage multiple discrete indicators model. Disability, impairments,

functional limitations, work limitations, and jobs for which qualified

have alL been incorporated into the index. Kence, Dt would appear to

capture the essential characteristics of disability: the inability of an

    individual to adequately perform activities required for jobs (or other-

wise perform productively in a social environment) owing to a shortfall
                                                                         *
    in   physical, mental, or emotional capacities. In particular, 0 would

    appear to reflect the three moSt important dimensions of disability: the

    extent of functional limitations, the severity of these limitations, and
                                     42



the requirements of functional performance in Jobs for which the indivi-
                                          *
dual is qualified on other grounds. D can be constructed for any data

set with the exogenous variables included in its construction; it does

not require that the indicators (extensive data on disability, impair-

ments and limitations) be available.

    The usefulness of the measure is tested in a simple model of labor

force participation. The results suggest that   the   choice of the health

status indicator included in behavioral equations (such as labor force

participation) has an important influence on the measurement of both the

contribution of health status to behavior and the effects of other deter-

minants on the behavior under investigation. The known     limitations   of
                                                                     *
alternatives to the comprehensive1 though unobserved, indicator, D

suggest its use in empirical work.

    'Extensive discussions of the concepts of disability, impairment, and

health status are found in i1ey and Nagi (1970); Nagi (1979); Berg

(1.973); Eisen, et al. (1979); Haveuian, Ia1berstadt, and Burkhauser

(1984). The importance of the concept used to measure health or disabil-

ity status    in assessing the   extent   of health or disability problems in

the population, and changes in it, was revealed in Calves and Blanchet

(1981). Their analysis of trends in the annual Health Information Survey

(HIS) reveals that health conditions limiting work and other activities

increased substantially in the United States from 1965 to 1975 among all

age and demographic groups, at the same time           that   longevity was

increasing.

    2Anderson and Burkhauser (1985) emphasize another problem. It may             be

that    true disability status is itself a choice variable which depends on

the same exogenous variables as, say, retirement (or depends on variables

that are correlated with those determining work effort). If this is the

case,    the effect of disability status, however measured, on work effort

will be overstated, and the true effect of economic variables

camouflaged.
