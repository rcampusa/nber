                                              ABSTRACT

This paper provides a new and simple model of endogenous horizontal product differentiation based
on a standard demand structure derived from quadratic utility. One objective of the paper is to explain
the “empirical Bertrand paradox” – the failure to observe homogeneous product Bertrand oligopoly,
while homogeneous product Cournot oligopoly has significant empirical relevance. In our model
firms invest in product differentiation if differentiation investments are sufficiently effective (i.e. if
differentiation is not too costly). The threshold level of differentiation effectiveness needed to induce
such investments is an order of magnitude less for Bertrand firms than for Cournot firms. Thus there
is a wide range over which Bertrand firms differentiate their products but Cournot firms do not. If
Cournot firms do choose to differentiate their products, corresponding Bertrand firms always differentiate
more. We also establish the important insight that if product differentiation is endogenous Bertrand
firms may charge higher prices and earn higher profits than corresponding Cournot firms, in contrast
to the general presumption that Bertrand behavior is more competitive than Cournot behavior. Interestingly,
consumer surplus increases with differentiation in the Cournot model but, due to sharply increasing
prices, decreases with differentiation in the Bertrand model.

1. Introduction

    One of the classic topics in oligopoly theory is the “Bertrand Paradox”, which dates from

Bertrand’s (1883) review of Cournot (1838). Bertrand suggested a model in which symmetric

price-setting duopoly firms produce a homogenous product at constant marginal cost. The

resulting (Nash) equilibrium, in which price equals marginal cost, seems unreasonable. As stated

by Tirole (1988, pp. 210-211): “We call this the Bertrand paradox because it is hard to believe

that firms in industries with few firms never succeed in manipulating the market price to make

profits.” It also seems implausible that the price should be completely unaffected by the number

of firms as we go from two firms in a market to an arbitrarily large number.

    A related puzzle, referred to as the “empirical Bertrand paradox”, is that we rarely if ever

observe an apparent Bertrand equilibrium in an oligopoly producing a homogeneous product,

whereas homogeneous product Cournot oligopolies appear to be empirically relevant.

Homogeneous product oligopolies are much more likely to be well approximated by the Cournot

than the Bertrand model. Slade (1995, 9. 381) summarizes empirical work using Cournot and

Bertrand models and reports no cases in which the Bertrand model is applied to the

homogeneous product case. In contrast, the Cournot model is commonly applied in such cases.

Recent examples of such Cournot applications include Carvajal, Deb, Fenske, & Quah (2013) for

petroleum and Jansen, van Lier, van Witteloostuijn, & von Ochssée (2012) for natural gas.

    Our first objective in this paper is to develop a model that can explain the empirical Bertrand

paradox. There is a substantial prior literature suggesting possible resolutions of the Bertrand

paradox, but our approach, based on endogenous horizontal product differentiation with a

standard demand structure arising from quadratic utility, is new. A main contribution is to

                                                   3
provide a natural and very simple explanation of why homogeneous product oligopoly is rarely,

if ever, observed, and at the same time, to explain why homogeneous product Cournot models

are likely to be empirically relevant.

    We emphasize that our model does not seek to encompass in a single model all important

resolutions of the Bertrand paradox. Nor is it an attempt to fully explain the empirical record of

any particular industry. In particular, we acknowledge that vertical differentiation is empirically

important in many industries. Our objective here is to abstract from various important

phenomena that have been studied before, including vertical product differentiation, so as to

focus on the role of costly horizontal product differentiation. We believe that focusing attention

in this way allows for the development of valuable insights that would be obscured by a more

complete model.

    A second objective of this paper is to determine whether Bertrand industries are necessarily

more competitive than corresponding Cournot industries once we allow for endogenous

horizontal product differentiation. The conventional wisdom of oligopoly theory is that Bertrand

industries are more competitive than Cournot industries in the sense of having lower prices and

lower profits. However, this conventional wisdom is based on models in which firms have a

common level of product differentiation. We show that Bertrand firms can charge higher prices

and earn higher profits than corresponding Cournot firms due to greater horizontal product

differentiation under Bertrand competition. We also examine implications for consumer surplus.

    A classic example of investment in horizontal product differentiation is provided by the

much-studied rivalry between Coca-Cola and Pepsi, which has been estimated using a Bertrand

specification in Gasmi et al. (1992). As has been well-established in the marketing literature,

many people cannot tell Coke and Pepsi apart in blind taste tests, yet high levels of advertising

                                                   4
and other marketing activities create strong perceived product differences from the point of view

of consumers. A classic study of this type is Woolfolk et al. (1983) which demonstrates that

stated preferences by Pepsi and Coke “loyalists” depend strongly on whether they are given a

Coke bottle or a Pepsi bottle, regardless of whether Coke or Pepsi is actually in the bottle.1

     These advertising investments are economically important and both Coca-Cola and Pepsi are

among the world’s largest advertisers. 2 It is the investment in advertising, packaging, and other

marketing activities that “creates” product differentiation in this case. In an interesting paper

using MRI brain imaging, McClure et al. (2004) shows that the brain responds very differently to

Coke and Pepsi when brand cues are available. As stated in the article: “In the brand-cued

experiment, brand knowledge for one of the drinks had a dramatic effect on expressed behavioral

preferences and on the measured brain responses.” Thus the enormous advertising investments

undertaken by Coke and Pepsi apparently do have a significant measurable effect on the brain’s

responses to perceptual stimuli. Horizontal product differentiation is also consistent with major

empirical examples such as breakfast cereals.3

     Our model is based on a standard quadratic utility function with two substitutable goods and

a numeraire good. The model nests the two extremes of homogeneous goods and unrelated goods

and allows for easy comparisons between Bertrand and Cournot duopoly outcomes. As in much

of the related literature, the model has two stages. Firms simultaneously decide how much to

         The packaged breakfast cereal market is dominated by two large firms – General Mills and Kellogg’s, with a
couple of other significant firms (Post and Quaker) and a number of small firms.

                                                            5
invest in horizontal product differentiation in stage 1 taking into account the equilibrium

outcome of the subsequent price (Bertrand) or quantity (Cournot) game in stage 2.

    A feature of our model is the introduction of an exogenous parameter, denoted β, that shifts

down the effectiveness of differentiation investment or equivalently, shifts down the cost of

achieving a given level of differentiation. Use of this parameter allows us to determine the

threshold at which the effectiveness of such investment is just high enough to induce investment

under each mode of competition. This approach provides additional insights not found in the

existing literature. For example, in the vertical differentiation literature, Motta (1993) assumes a

plausible cost of investment and finds that Cournot and Bertrand firms always invest in quality

so as to make their products distinct. 4 Our more general approach allows for the important

possibility that there is some sufficiently low level of differentiation effectiveness at which firms

choose not to differentiation their products.

     We show that there is a very wide range of values of β (and hence a wide range of the cost

of achieving a given level of differentiation) under which Bertrand firms invest in horizontal

differentiation, but Cournot firms do not. Thus in accordance with the “empirical Bertrand

paradox”, our model can explain why we might commonly observe homogeneous product

industries that are consistent with the Cournot model, but rarely if ever do so in the Bertrand

case. In addition, for any given value of β, we show that Bertrand firms differentiate their

products more than corresponding Cournot firms, making it possible for them to charge higher

prices and earn higher profits in equilibrium.

        Motta (1993) assumes a cost of investment, u2/2, where u denotes the quality resulting from the investment.

                                                             6
         Our paper also provides what we view as valuable insights concerning the welfare

comparison of Bertrand and Cournot models. Specifically we show that, in the Bertrand case,

increasing differentiation is always associated with reduced consumer surplus, despite the fact

that consumers like variety. Consumer surplus falls because horizontal product differentiation

significantly increases prices and these higher prices more than offset the benefits of increased

variety. Product differentiation in the Cournot case has the opposite effect: an increase in product

differentiation is always associated with increased consumer surplus so that the benefits of

increased variety are larger than the loss due to higher prices.

     Section 2 is devoted to a review and discussion of the related literature and Section 3 sets

out the basic model structure. Sections 4 and 5 respectively develop the implications of

horizontal product differentiation for Bertrand and Cournot duopolies, while Section 6 provides

comparative results. Section 7 contains concluding remarks.

2. Literature Review

    Following Hotelling (1929), a well-known approach to horizontal product differentiation is

to interpret the characteristics of a product as determined by the location of the product on a line

or a circle.5 Each consumer buys at most one unit of the product. As shown by d’Aspremont,

Gabszewicz, & Thisse (1979), if firms first choose their locations on a Hotelling line and then

choose prices, they will choose to locate as far apart as possible, at the ends of the line, violating

the principle of minimum differentiation proposed by Hotelling (1929).




     5
        Location choice may have either a horizontal or vertical interpretation. If all locations are equivalent to each
other, then location choice corresponds to horizontal differentiation. However, if some locations are better than
others then location choice can have a vertical interpretation.

                                                               7
    One important difference between our analysis and the location choice literature is that we

require firms to make costly investments in order to differentiate their products rather than

simply choosing their location. The role of investment in product differentiation seems

fundamental in many cases – making the analogy with location choice potentially misleading.

Our approach also allows for a straightforward comparison of Bertrand with Cournot

competition, whereas issues of existence and multiple equilibria arise in the location choice

literature.6 More generally, our consideration of a quadratic utility function in which consumers

can purchase different quantities of each product extends our understanding of horizontal product

differentiation to a different form of demand.

     Another major approach to the Bertrand paradox is based on vertical product differentiation

in which firms choose quality as pioneered by Shaked & Sutton (1982, 1983) and Motta (1993).

Consumers purchase just one unit of a good that varies in quality. Firms commit to distinct or

different quality levels in a first stage so as to avoid cutthroat Bertrand competition in the second

stage. In Motta (1993), costly investment results in a wider gap in qualities (and higher profit in

the fixed cost of quality model) under Bertrand than Cournot competition. Interestingly,

however, Boccard & Wauthy (2010) show that introducing a capacity choice prior to the choice

of quality can eliminate quality differentiation.

     We argue that horizontal product differentiation provides an alternative means by which

Bertrand firms can avoid extreme price competition and, at the same time, explains the choice of

Cournot firms to produce homogeneous products. Horizontal product differentiation has the



     6
      Quadratic costs with respect to distance ensure the existence of Bertrand equilibrium prices (see
d’Aspremont, Gabszewicz, & Thisse, 1979), but the existence of a unique Cournot equilibrium requires that
demand be elastic (perhaps by adding an outside good) and a specification as to which locations get served (see
Anderson, De Palma, and Thisse, 1992, p. 332).

                                                            8
advantage of simplicity in that, unlike models of vertical integration, it does not require

asymmetry at the solution.

    A further approach to the Bertrand paradox focuses on the possibility that the mode of

conduct itself (Bertrand or Cournot) might be an endogenous choice variable as in the classic

treatment of Singh & Vives (1984). If so, depending on the details of model specification, the

combination of homogeneous products and Bertrand conduct might be ruled out. If firms know

that they will produce homogeneous products, they would opt for quantity-setting behavior

rather than price-setting behavior. Following Singh & Vives (1984), this literature relies

primarily on an assumed ability of firms to sign binding price contracts or binding quantity

contracts that make the mode of conduct endogenous. Instead of taking the mode of conduct as

exogenous and the extent of product differentiation as endogenous, the mode of conduct choice

literature does the reverse, taking the extent of differentiation as exogenous and the mode of

conduct as endogenous.

    Although not specifically modeled, our analysis is not incompatible with the endogenous

choice of mode of conduct. Firms knowing that it is costly to them to differentiate their products

may try to commit to quantity-setting behavior. Once commitment to a mode of conduct has

been made, our analysis then shows that the incentive for a firm to differentiate its product

depends on the mode of competition: for the same effectiveness of investment in product

differentiation, Cournot competition will result in less product differentiation than Bertrand

competition.

    Based on the work of Kreps & Scheinkman (1983), Friedman (1983, p. 47), Shapiro (1989,

pp. 350-351), and Loertscher (2008), it is also possible that the mode of conduct is largely

determined by the nature of technology in an industry and therefore properly viewed as

                                                    9
exogenous with respect to the product differentiation decision. Specifically, if quantity is hard to

change – as when it is determined by capacity constraints – and price adjusts to clear the market,

then the Cournot model is appropriate7. If on the other hand, quantity can be readily changed to

clear the market, then it becomes plausible that firms in an oligopoly would differentiate their

products and engage in Bertrand price-setting behavior. Thus the mode of conduct can be

exogenous – or at least hard to change relative to product differentiation decisions. For simplicity

we do not model the barrier to entry that maintains the oligopoly. Some products, such as butter

or sugar are hard to differentiate and do not have natural capacity constraints. Pure competition

would result without government market support programs.

     We do not take a position here on the relative empirical significance of endogenous mode of

conduct models. They do seem to require the existence of contracts that, while not uncommon,

are far from the norm and that can be rendered undesirable by realistic transaction costs or by

uncertainties of various types. We simply argue that in many markets changes in technology are

slow-moving relative to product differentiation induced through advertising (as with soft drinks)

or minor changes in product specification (as with automobiles). If so, treating the mode of

conduct as exogenous would often be appropriate. As mentioned above, it is conceptually

possible for our model to be extended to allow for an endogenous mode of conduct decision

combined with a decision to invest in horizontal product differentiation.

     Yet another potential resolution of the Bertrand paradox is based on the possibility of

implicit collusion in repeated price-setting games as noted in Tirole (1988) and extensively

studied in the subsequent literature. Also, experimental work on the Bertrand model, including


     7
       The automobile industry provides an example where capacity constraints are important, but there is also
scope for significant product differentiation. Our model suggests that if automobile producers were not capacity
constrained, they would be involved in even more product differentiation.

                                                           10
Bruttel (2009), suggests the possibility that the Bertrand paradox may be avoided for behavioral

reasons or for reasons related to bounded rationality. The Bertrand paradox can also be avoided

if cost is uncertain and firms are risk averse, as in Wamback (1999), resulting in prices above

marginal cost.

    The comparative competitiveness properties of Bertrand and Cournot models have been

addressed by several authors. The basic finding, provided by Cheng (1985), Singh & Vives

(1984), Vives (1985), Hsu and Wang (2005), and others is that if Bertrand and Cournot

duopolies face the same demand and cost conditions, then the Bertrand industry would generate

lower profits, lower prices, and more consumer surplus. Also Tremblay and Tremblay (2011)

compares the stability characteristics of Cournot and Bertrand models under product

differentiation.

    Qiu (1997) provides an important extension in which cost is made endogenous through the

introduction of endogenous process R&D. The paper finds that the conventional ranking of the

two models may be reversed. Cournot firms will often have a stronger incentive to invest in

R&D, causing costs to fall and possibly providing more consumer surplus (and more total

surplus after including profits) than in the Bertrand case. Symeondis (2003) examines product

R&D that can improve product quality and, like Qui (1997), finds that the Cournot model can

generate more total surplus if there are strong R&D spillovers and products are not too strongly

differentiated in equilibrium. Our model differs from Qui (1997) because investment causes

product differentiation not cost reduction and differs from both Qiu (1997) and Symeondis

(2003) in that it is not based on R&D spillovers. In our setting, investment in product

differentiation reduces, but never eliminates, the higher consumer surplus generated by Bertrand

competition. Also, Bertrand competition can be more profitable than Cournot competition.


                                                  11
3. Model of Horizontal Product Differentiation

     We assume a duopoly model in which firm 1 produces quantity x1 and firm 2 produces

quantity x2. Goods x1 and x2 can range between being perfect substitutes (homogeneous) to being

totally unrelated. Using M to represent consumption of a numeraire good, the aggregate or

representative utility function is taken to be

     U = a(x1 + x2) – (b/2)(x12 + x22) – sx1x2 + M .                                                        (1)

Since M is additively separable, there are no income effects of demand. The parameter s

represents the degree of substitutability between the products x1 and x2.8

         Without loss of generality we undertake an algebraically convenient normalization and

rescaling of variables such that b = 1. If b =1 then the feasible range for s is between 0 and 1. If s

= 0, then demand for each good is independent. Since products are unrelated, each firm has a

monopoly with respect to its good. If s = 1 (or, more generally, if s = b), goods are perfect

substitutes and are, in effect, identical or homogenous. To measure the degree of differentiation,

we define a parameter v = 1 – s (v for “variety”) where 0 ≤ v ≤ 1. However, it is convenient to

use s in the specification of the demand structure, yielding the following inverse demand

functions:

     p1 = ∂U/∂x1 = a – x1 – sx2.

     p2 = ∂U/∂x2 = a – x2 – x1.                                                                             (2)




     8
      We do not examine the possibility considered in Singh and Vives (1984) that the products could be
complements (s < 0).Such an extension addresses what, in our view, is an essentially different issue – coordination
of complementary products rather than competition between substitutes.

                                                           12
    Since other things equal (i.e. holding quantities x1, x2, and M constant), we obtain ∂U/∂s = -

x1x2 < 0 and since v = 1 – s, it follows that consumers gain from variety or equivalently from

greater product differentiation. This property could reflect a taste for variety at the individual

level or some distribution of tastes captured in aggregate utility function U.

    Firms 1 and 2 can each choose to increase the degree of product differentiation (variety) by

making a differentiation investment, denoted k1 and k2. The combined effect, K = k1 + k2, of the

investments of both firms determines the value of v. We make the simplifying assumption that

the differentiation investment affects only the degree of differentiation (or the degree of

substitutability) with no effects on other aspects of demand. One possibility is to interpret the

differentiation investment as an advertising cost aimed at making the product more distinct from

the other product in the eyes of consumers. Another possibility is to interpret the investment as

the cost of changing some physical characteristic of the product that differentiates it from the

other product, as when breakfast cereal companies come up with additional variations in taste,

texture, and packaging or when car manufacturers adopt new colors and or new body shapes for

cars or undertake other differentiation activities of a costly but essentially horizontal nature.

    We model the effect of differentiation investments on the degree of differentiation (variety)

experienced by consumers using the following convenient functional form:

    v = 1 – s where s = 1/eβK = e-βK                                                               (3)

for β > 0 and K = k1 + k2. If neither firm invests in differentiation, then K = 0 and variety v = 0,

so the products are effectively identical (substitutability, s, is 1). If either firm invests in

differentiation (such as by advertising or by superficial product adjustment) then v > 0 (s < 1)

and the products are differentiated. An increase in differentiation investment by either firm

increases v at a decreasing rate.

                                                      13
       An important feature of Equation (3) is that differentiation expenditures by one firm have

a symmetric effect on the other firm in the sense that s increases equally for both firms. This is

an intrinsic feature of horizontal product differentiation. If product A is differentiated relative to

product B it follows that product B is equally differentiated relative to product A. This point is

particularly obvious in the case of locational differentiation where if B moves further from A

then A must also become further from B and by exactly the same amount.

       In practice, when firms make differentiation investments they might also seek to create a

better product (i.e. vertically differentiate) and take business from the rival. This could be

captured in our model by allowing the intercept of demand, parameter a in Equation 2, to be firm

specific with a1 increasing in k1 and decreasing in k2 and vice versa for a2. However, as we wish

to focus on the effects of pure horizontal product differentiation, we abstract from such

considerations here.

    The functional form (3) captures the empirically reasonable property that there is no finite

amount of advertising or other investment aimed at differentiating products that can make

substitutable products into completely unrelated products. The monopoly outcome in which

product are unrelated (v = 1 and s = 0) is reached only in the limit as the combined differentiation

investment, K, approaches infinity. Strictly speaking v can never equal 1 as that would require an

infinite investment, so the admissible range for v is the half-closed interval [0,1). In the context

of the coke and pepsi example, this property means that no amount of advertising can make

consumers think that coke and pepsi are completely unrelated.

    The parameter β represents the effectiveness of investment in creating product

differentiation. We imagine that β could take on different values depending on the nature of the

product. If β is small, then investment has little effect in changing variety as perceived by

                                                    14
consumers whereas, if β is large, even a small amount of investment can have a substantial

effect. As previously mentioned, by exogenously varying β we can determine the threshold at

which investment becomes profitable under each mode of competition. As a result, we can

characterize the range of values of β under which Cournot firms will produce homogeneous

products while Bertrand firms differentiate their products. This region provides our resolution of

the “empirical Bertrand Paradox”.

    The two-stage game played by firms gives rise to a sub-game perfect Nash equilibrium.

Each firm simultaneously commits to its investment in stage 1 taking the investment of the other

firm as given. In making its investment, each firm correctly anticipates the effects of its

investment on the outcome of the Bertrand-Nash or Cournot-Nash equilibrium in stage 2.

4. Bertrand Competition

    Suppose first that the firms act as Bertrand competitors. We solve for the second stage

equilibrium conditional on s, and then show how the equilibrium changes with product

differentiation, v = 1- s. We then consider the first stage in which product differentiation is

determined by the choices of k1 and k2.

4.1 Second Stage – Pricing Decisions

    In the second stage, each firm maximizes variable profit with respect to its own price

treating the other firm’s price as exogenous and treating k1, k2, and therefore s as predetermined.

Variable profit for firm i for i = 1,2, denoted Vi, excludes the differentiation investments, ki, sunk

at stage 1:

          Vi  (pi – c)xi                                                                          (4)




                                                    15
To express outputs as functions of prices and s, we rewrite the inverse demand functions (2) as x1

+ sx2 = a – p1 and sx1 + x2 = a – p2 and solve to obtain:

        x1 = [(a – p1) – (a – p2)s]/(1 - s2);

        x2 = [(a – p2) – (a – p1)s]/(1 - s2)                                                      (5)

The demand equations (5) require s < 1, which applies if the products are not homogenous. If

products are homogenous (s = 1), consumers will buy from only one firm if that firm has a

strictly lower price. If the firms charge the same price, we adopt the standard convention that

they share the quantity demanded equally.

       We next maximize variable profit (4) using (5) to solve for the Bertrand equilibrium

prices and quantities. Conditional on an exogenous (or pre-determined) level of product

differentiation, the properties of this model are known, but we report and prove the specific

results for our setting. At the stage 2 Bertrand equilibrium, each firm has the same price, output,

and variable profit. As shown in Appendix 1, these common values, denoted p, x, and V

respectively, depend on s and hence on v = 1-s as follows:

    p = pB(s) = (a-c)(1-s)/(2-s) + c

    x = xB(s) = (a-c)/[(2-s)(1+s)]

    V = VB(s) = (1-s2)(xB(s))2                                                                    (6)

A superscript B identifies functional relationships as depending on Bertrand competition.

    As (6) shows, in order for output to be positive the maximum willingness to pay, a, must

exceed marginal cost, c. We impose a > c as a regularity condition for all subsequent analysis. If

s = 1 (homogeneous products), then (6) implies p = c and x = (a-c)/2. This is the standard

Bertrand solution with homogeneous products. If s = 0 (separate monopolies for goods 1 and 2),
                                                  16
then the equilibrium prices are higher: p = (a + c)/2, which exceeds c due to the requirement

that a > c. Interestingly, however, the quantities are the same in this dual monopoly case as in the

homogeneous product case: x = (a-c)/2. Each firm produces the same amount but consumers are

willing to pay more because the products are differentiated.

     As shown in Proposition 1, increases in product differentiation cause the Bertrand price to

rise for the admissible range of v (from 0 to 1). Correspondingly, reductions in v – less variety –

cause price to fall. Also, starting with homogeneous products (v = 0), quantities initially fall as

differentiation increases, reach a minimum at v = ½, then increase as differentiation increases

further. Greater product differentiation always increases (variable) profits.

Proposition 1: Under Bertrand competition, an increase in product differentiation, v, causes

i) prices to rise,

ii) outputs to fall if 0  v < ½ , reach a minimum at v = 1/2, and then rise for ½ < v < 1.

iii) variable profits to rise.

Proof: i) Differentiating (6) with respect to s yields dpB/ds = - (a-c)/(2-s)2 < 0. Since s = v – 1, it

follows that dpB/dv = (dpB/ds)(ds/dv) = - dpB/ds > 0.

ii) Differentiating output as in (6) with respect to s yields

     dxB/ds = x(2s-1)/[(2-s)(1+s)]                                                                    (7)

It can be seen from (7) that dxB/ds is positive if s > ½, zero if s = ½ and negative if s < ½. Since v

= 1 - s, it follows that dxB/dv is negative if v < ½, zero at v = ½ and positive if v > ½.

iii) From (6) and (7), we obtain

     dVB/ds = - 2x2(1 – s + s2)/(2-s) < 0                                                            (8)


                                                     17
As dVB/dv = - dVB/ds it follows from (8) that dVB/dv > 0. ***

4.2 First Stage – Investments in Product Differentiation

    In stage 1, firm 1 chooses k1 and firm 2 chooses k2 to maximize profit taking the investment

of the other firm as given. Due to sequential rationality as implied by the subgame perfect Nash

equilibrium, Bertrand firms understand that a failure to differentiate their products will yield a

second stage outcome in which profits are zero. This understanding provides a strong incentive

to undertake positive differentiation investments in the first stage.

    The differentiation investments k1 and k2 jointly determine K = k1 + k2, which in turn

determines the degree of differentiation, v = 1-s where s = e-βK (see (3)). The partial effect of

each firm’s investment on s, taking the investment of the other firm as given reduces

substitutability (and increases the degree of differentiation)

    ∂s/∂k1 = ∂s/∂k2 = ds/dK = - βe-βK = - βs < 0                                                     (9)

Recognizing that variables will take on equilibrium values (6) in the second stage, the first stage

profit for firm i can be written as:

       πi = VB(s) - ki = (1-s2)(xB(s))2 - ki                                                         (10)

where s and v = 1-s depend on k1 and k2 as in (3). In setting ki, each firm i for i = 1, 2 correctly

anticipates the effect of ki on its variable profit at the second stage equilibrium, but takes the

investment of the other firm as fixed. Using (8) and (9), the first order condition for an interior

solution (ki > 0) to firm i’s profit maximization problem is therefore

    ∂πi/∂ki = (dVB/ds)(∂s/∂ki) – 1 = 2βs(xB(s))2(1 – s + s2)/(2-s) – 1 = 0                           (11)




                                                    18
A corner solution in which there is no investment in differentiation arises if ∂πi/∂ki ≤ 0 at ki = 0.

In order for Equation (11) to characterize a maximum rather than a minimum it is necessary that

the second order conditions are satisfied, which is shown in Appendix 2.

         Since equilibrium output, x, varies with s, equation (11) is a complicated function of s,

making a closed form solution for s and for the common level of investment, k = k1 = k2, difficult

to obtain. However, we are able to determine important characteristics of the solution. In

particular, Proposition 2 indicates the threshold level of β below which product differentiation is

prohibitively costly. Our assumption of an exponential functional form (see (3)) to specify the

relationship between variety, v, and investment is not critical. If, for example, instead of (3), we

assume a power function: s = (1 + k1 + k2)-β, exactly the same threshold level applies.9

Proposition 2: Under Bertrand competition, both firms choose to differentiate their products at

stage 1 if and only if β > 2/(a-c)2. If β ≤ 2/(a-c)2 then no differentiation investment takes place

and products are homogeneous at stage 2.

Proof: No differentiation (s = 1) takes place if and only k1 = k2 = 0, which occurs if and only if

∂πi/∂ki ≤ 0 at ki = 0 and s = 1 (i.e. at v = 0). Substituting s = 1 into (11) and using x = (a-c)/2

from (6) shows that ∂πi/∂ki = β(a-c)2/2 – 1 ≤ 0 if and only if β ≤ 2/(a-c)2.***

         In the case of prohibitively expensive differentiation costs, it is still feasible for both

firms to enter, so we cannot rule out homogeneous product Bertrand oligopoly. However, in that

case each firm is indifferent about whether to produce or whether to withdraw from the industry.




     9
       If s = (1 + k1 + k2 )-β, then ∂s/∂ki = - βs/(1 + k1 + k2). If k1 = k2 =0, then s = 1 and ∂s/∂ki = - β, which setting s
= 1 in (10) is the same as if we had assumed s = e-βK. The proof of Proposition 2 then goes through as before. We
could also use a Taylor’s series expansion to approximate s=e-βK by s = 1 – βK + β2K2/2, which implies that ∂s/∂ki
= - β(1-βK) < 0 for βK < 1. Since ∂s/∂ki = -β at k1 = k2 = 0, Proposition 2 again applies.

                                                                19
As a result, any positive entry cost or fixed cost would prevent the Bertrand outcome. Provided β

exceeds the threshold level, Bertrand firms will necessarily differentiate their products.

5. The Cournot Model

        Suppose now that the firms are Cournot competitors. We first examine the second stage

choice of output before considering the choice of differentiation investment in stage 1.

5.1 Second Stage – Quantity Decisions

    In the second stage, we take ki as given from stage 1. Setting output, x1, to maximize

variable profit, V1, as in (4), holding x2 fixed and setting x2 to maximize V2 holding x1 fixed and

using the demand functions given by (2), we obtain the first order conditions:

        ∂V1/∂x1 = a – c – 2x1 – sx2 = 0

        ∂V2/∂x2 = a – c – sx1 – 2x2 = 0                                                         (12)

    Equations (13) define the Cournot equilibrium values of output, which are unique and

symmetric. Equilibrium prices and variable profits then follow from (2) and (7). Using v = 1-s

and a superscript C to identify functional relationships associated with Cournot competition, we

express the common output, price and profit at the stage 2 Cournot equilibrium as follows:

          x = xC(s) = (a-c)/(2 + s)

          p = pC(s) = (a-c)/(2+s) + c

          V = VC(s) = (xC(s))2                                                                  (13)

The effects of variation in product differentiation are set out in Proposition 3.

Proposition 3: Under Cournot competition, an increase in product differentiation v, causes

outputs to rise, prices to rise, and variable profits to rise.


                                                      20
Proof: From (13), we obtain

           dxC/ds = - (a-c)/(2+ s)2 = - x/(2+s),

           dpC/ds = - (a-c)/(2 + s)2 and

           dVC/ds = - 2(xC(s))2/(2+s) = -2(a – c)2/(2 + s)3                                        (14)

Since dv/ds = - 1, the result follows. ***

    In the limit as v approaches 1, each firm is effectively a monopolist over an independent

good, produces output level, x = (a-c)/2, and charges the common price, p = (a + c)/2, as in the

Bertrand case. If v = 0, then products are homogenous and output and price are at the standard

homogenous product Cournot levels: x = (a-c)/3 and p = (a + 2c)/3. It is notable that each firm

sets a higher output (and charges a higher price) at the monopoly outcome with independent

products than if products are homogeneous.

5.2 First Stage – Investments in Product Differentiation

    Recognizing that variables will take on equilibrium values (14) in the second stage, the first

stage profit for firm i can be written as: πi = VC(s) - ki = (xC(s))2 – ki. As with the Bertrand model,

in the first stage each firm i sets its differentiation investment, ki, to maximize profit,

understanding its effect on variable profit at the second stage equilibrium, but taking as

exogenous the differentiation investment of the other firm. Using (14) and (9), the associated

first order condition for an interior solution for firm i is given by

            ∂πi/∂ki = (dVC/ds)(∂s/∂ki) - 1 = 2βs(xC(s))2/(2+s) – 1 = 0                             (15)




                                                     21
where xC(s) = (a-c)/(2 + s) from (13). (See Appendix 2 for a proof that second order conditions

are satisfied.) The corner solution in which ki = 0 occurs if dπi/dki  0 at ki = 0. Proposition 5

identifies the threshold level of β below which product differentiation does not occur.

Proposition 4: With Cournot competition, firms choose to differentiate their products at stage 1

if and only if β > 13.5/(a-c)2. If β ≤ 13.5/(a-c)2 then no investment takes place and products are

homogeneous at stage 2.

Proof: No differentiation (s = 1) takes place if and only if and only if ∂πi/∂ki ≤ 0 at ki = 0 and s

= 1 (i.e. at v = 0) for i = 1,2. Substituting s = 1 into (15) and using x = (a-c)/3 from (13) shows

that ∂πi/∂ki ≤ 0 if and only if β ≤ 13.5/(a-c)2. ***

As with the Bertrand case, firms undertake less product differentiation than would be needed to

maximize joint profits.

6. Comparing the Cournot and Bertrand Models

6.1 The Empirical Bertrand paradox

    Proposition 6 provides a characterization of the range of differentiation effectiveness, β, for

which product differentiation occurs or does not occur in the Bertrand and Cournot models. The

proposition also establishes that if Bertrand firms have an incentive to differentiate, they will

always invest more than their Cournot counterparts leading to greater product differentiation

under Bertrand than Cournot competition. To facilitate the exposition, we use superscripts B and

C to represent Bertrand and Cournot outcomes respectively. Thus pB and xB represent the

(common) price and (common) level of output and vB = 1 - sB denotes the level of product

differentiation under Bertrand competition.




                                                    22
Proposition 5:

(i) If β ≤ 2/(a-c)2, then products are homogeneous under both Bertrand and Cournot competition.

(ii) If 2/(a-c)2 < β ≤ 13.5/(a – c)2, then products are differentiated under Bertrand competition

and are homogenous under Cournot competition: vB > vC = 0.

(iii) If β > 13.5/(a-c)2, then products are differentiated under both Bertrand and Cournot

competition, but are more differentiated under Bertrand than Cournot competition: vB > vC > 0.

Proof: Parts (i) and (ii) follow directly from Propositions 2 and 4. (iii) If β > 13.5/(a-c)2, then kCi

> 0 from Proposition 5. From kCi > 0, (15) and (14), we have dπiC/dki = 0 which implies

2βsC(xC)2 = 2+sC where sC = 1/eβK > 0 for K = kC1 +kC2. Setting K = kC1 + kC2 and s = sC in (11),

we obtain ∂πiB/∂ki = 2βsC(xB)2(1 – sC + (sC)2)/(2-sC) – 1. For the same value of s > 0, it follows

from (6) and (13) that xB = (2 + s)xC/(2- s)(1+ s) > xC and hence 2βsC(xB)2 > 2βsC(xC)2 = 2+sC

and dπiB/dki > (2+sC)(1 – sC + (sC)2)/(2-sC) – 1 at K = kC1 + kC2 . Since (2+sC)(1 – sC + (sC)2) -

(2-sC) = (sC)2(1 + sC) > 0, we obtain ∂πiB/∂ki > 0 for K = kC1 + kC2, which implies kBi > kCi and sB

> sC for β > 13.5/(a-c)2 ***

       Proposition 5 indicates that for both Bertrand and Cournot competition, whether the firms

undertake differentiation expenditures depends on the effectiveness of differentiation

investments, measured by β, relative to the difference, (a – c) between the demand intercept and

marginal cost – a reflection of the strength of demand. The stronger is demand, the less effective

differentiation investments needs to be to justify differentiation. Letting βB ≡ 2/(a-c)2 represent

the critical level of differentiation effectiveness needed for Bertrand firms to undertake

differentiation and βC ≡ 13.5/(a-c)2 the corresponding critical value for the Cournot case, Table 1

shows the values of βB and βC as the strength of demand increases.


                                                    23
Table 1: Critical Values of Differentiation Effectiveness, β
 Demand (a – c)     Bertrand (βB)    Cournot (βC)
2                   0.50             3.38
4                   0.13             0.84
8                   0.031            0.21
12                  0.014            0.094
16                  0.0078           0.053

50                  0.00080          0.0054



       As can be seen from Table 1, the critical values, βB and βC rapidly get smaller as demand

increases, but since βC/βB = 6.75 independent of demand, the critical value of differentiation

effectiveness required to induce differentiation under Cournot competition is always a factor of

6.75 higher than for the Bertrand model. Consequently, our results explain the empirical

Bertrand paradox in a way that is robust to the level of demand: there is a very wide range of

parameter values under which products are homogeneous under Cournot competition, but

differentiated under Bertrand competition.

6.2 Endogenous Product Differentiation and Comparative Competitiveness

    It is well-known that if products are homogeneous, Bertrand competition is more intense

than Cournot competition. As shown by Singh and Vives (1984), this insight generalizes to any

common level of product differentiation short of being completely unrelated. Using a demand

structure similar to ours, Singh and Vives (1984) demonstrate that, for any (exogenous) common

level of differentiation less than unrelated products (v < 1), the Bertrand model generates higher

output, lower prices and lower profits than the Cournot model. If products are unrelated (v = 1),

then prices and outputs are at the monopoly level in both models.




                                                  24
    However, when we allow for the highly relevant possibility that product differentiation is

endogenous, the comparison of Cournot and Bertrand is more difficult and very different in its

implications. If any differentiation at all occurs, Bertrand firms choose a higher level of product

differentiation than Cournot firms. This consideration tends to raise prices and lower output in

the Bertrand case to an extent that can offset the inherently greater competitiveness of Bertrand

behaviour conditional on a given common level of differentiation.

       Proposition 6 establishes that, even with endogenous product differentiation, the Bertrand

model generates higher output than the Cournot model. However, prices and profits are not

necessarily lower in the Bertrand case. Therefore, allowing for endogenous product

differentiation is an important limitation on the general presumption that Bertrand industries are

“more competitive” than corresponding Cournot industries.

Proposition 6:

i) Independent of whether product differentiation is the same across modes of competition or is

chosen endogenously, output is higher under Bertrand than Cournot competition: xB > xC.

ii) For the same level of product differentiation, both price and profit are strictly lower under

Bertrand than Cournot competition: pB < pC and πB < πC.

iii) With endogenous product differentiation it is possible for Bertrand firms to charge higher

prices and earn more profit than corresponding Cournot firms. For example, for an effectiveness

of investment parameter, β = 13.5/(a-c)2, Bertrand firm undertake more differentiation (vB =

0.60823 > vC = 0), charge higher prices and earn more profit than corresponding Cournot firms.

Proof: i) From xB = (a-c)/(2-sB)(1+sB) and xC = (a-c)/(2 + sC) (see (6) and (13)), we obtain




                                                    25
xB = (2+sC)xC/(2-sB)(1+sB), which implies xB > xC if and only if 2+sC - (2-sB)(1+sB) = sC - sB +

(sB)2 > 0. Since sC  sB > 0 from Proposition 6, the condition holds and xB > xC.

ii) It follows immediately from downward sloping demand and xB > xC (see part i) that the

Bertrand price must be less than the Cournot price for the same v for v = 1 – s < 1. Now

examining profits, if k = 0 (homogeneous products), then s = 1 and v = 1 - s = 0 and from (6) and

(13), we obtain VC(1) > VB(1) = 0 and hence πC > πB = 0. If kB = kC > 0, then sB = sC = s < 1 and

VB(s) =VC(s)(1-s)(2+s)2/(1+s)(2–s)2 (from (6) and (13)). Letting ψ(s) ≡ (1+ s)(2–s)2 - (1-s)(2+ s)2,

we obtain πC - πB = VC(s)ψ(s)/(1+s)(2-s)2 > 0 since ψ(s) > 0 for all s  (0,1].

iii) If β = 13.5/(a-c)2 , then from Proposition 5(ii), products are differentiated under Bertrand

Competition (vB > 0 and kB > 0) and homogeneous under Cournot competition(vC = 0 and kC =

0). Since kB > 0, it follows from (11) that dπBi/dki = 2βs(xB)2(1 – s + s2)/(2-s) – 1 = 0 where xB =

(a-c)/(2-s)(1+s) from (6). Setting β = 13.5/(a-c)2 and solving for s we obtain sB = 0.39177 and vB

= 1 – sB = 0.60823. We have pB > pC since substituting vB = 0.60823 into (6) and vC = 0 into

(13), yields pB = 0.378(a-c) + c and pC = (a-c)/3 + c. Now examining profits, for β = 13.5/(a-c)2,

we obtain xB = 0.44677(a-c), VB = 0.168968(a-c)2, VC(1) = (a-c)2/9 from (6) and (13). Since kB =

- ln(sB)/2β (from s = e-βK), we further obtain kB = 0.0347(a-c)2. Thus πB = VB(sB) - kB =

0.13427(a-c)2 > πC = (a-c)2/9 = 0.1111(a-c)2. ***

       Figure 1 illustrates the variation in the prices charged by Bertrand and Cournot firms as β

is increased, raising the effectiveness of investment as a means to create product differentiation

(or equivalently lowering the cost of a given level of product differentiation). We assume that the

intercept of demand and marginal cost are given by a = 14 and c = 2, so a – c = 12. For a wide

range of parameter values, β ≤ βC = 0.094, Cournot firms will not invest in product

differentiation, corresponding to the flat part of the Cournot price response curve in Figure 1.

Bertrand firms begin to differentiate at the much lower level of β = βB = 0.014.

                          Differentiation Effectiveness, 


           As Figure 1 shows, when products are homogeneous (v = 0), Cournot firms charge $6,

whereas Bertrand firms set the much lower price of $2, which equals marginal cost. At β = βB =

0.014, Bertrand firms start investing, causing the Bertrand price to rise. At β = 0.0703 (approx.),

the Bertrand price surpasses the Cournot price of $6 and remains higher for a significant range of

values of β, illustrating the result in Proposition 7, part iii, that price can be higher under

Bertrand than Cournot competition. Eventually, Cournot firms start investing (at β = βC = 0.094)

and the Cournot price again exceeds the Bertrand price for β ≥ 0.107 (approx.), but the difference

is sufficiently slight that the two prices are virtually identical. Ultimately, as β becomes very

large, products become unrelated and both prices approach the monopoly price of $8.

     The Bertrand price is much more sensitive to product differentiation than the Cournot price.

We do not show price as a function of differentiation, v, in the diagram. However, changing v

from 0 (homogeneous products) to 0.4 raises the Cournot price from $6.00 to $6.62 – a modest

                                                     27
increase of about 10%. For Bertrand firms, an increase in product differentiation from 0 to 0.4

causes price to rise dramatically – from $2 to $5.43 – an increase of over 150%! The ability of

Bertrand firms to aggressively raise prices makes variable profits under price competition much

more sensitive to product differentiation than are variable profits under Cournot competition. As

a result, Bertrand firms undertake differentiation investments at much lower values of β than do

Cournot firms. Bertrand firms have a powerful incentive to invest in product differentiation since

it enables them to rapidly move away from the cutthroat price competition that prevails when

products are homogeneous.

    A comparison of the effects of product differentiation on output is also interesting. Again for

a - c = 12, Figure 2 shows output per firm for both Bertrand and Cournot competition as the

degree of product differentiation, v, varies. The qualitative relationship between output and

product differentiation does not depend on the magnitude of a – c. If products are homogeneous

products (v = 0), each Bertrand firm produces xB = (a-c)/2 = 6, whereas Cournot firms produce a

lower quantity, xC = (a-c)/3 = 4. As products become more differentiated, Cournot output

increases steadily until it reaches the monopoly output of 6 at v = 1. Thus Cournot firms exploit

the increased demand arising from greater product variety by raising both quantity and price (see

Figure 1). In contrast, Bertrand firms initially reduce output as products become differentiated,

with output reaching a minimum at v = 0.5. Since output falls, it follows that Bertrand firms

initially realize the benefits of product differentiation solely through aggressive price increases.

Despite this pattern of output response, output is always higher under Bertrand than Cournot

competition with or without endogenous product differentiation (see Proposition 6, part i).

      Figure 3 compares the variation in industry profit under Bertrand and Cournot competition

as β is increased making investment more effective as a means to create product differentiation.

For Figure 3, we again assume a – c = 12, but profit has the same qualitative relationship with β

for any values of a - c. As shown by the initial flat portion of the Bertrand line in Figure 3,

products are homogeneous (v = 0) and profit is zero under Bertrand competition for β ≤ βB =

0.014. Under Cournot competition, products are homogeneous for a much wider range of β,

namely β ≤ βC = 0.09375, but each Cournot firm earns $16, with a combined profit of $32 for

the industry. For β > βB = 0.014, Bertrand profits rise due to product differentiation. Cournot

firms invest for β > βC = 0.09375, but, already at β = βC, Bertrand firms earn a combined profit of

$38.6, which exceeds the $32 in industry profit earned under Cournot competition. At higher

levels of β, profit under Bertrand competition continues to exceed profit under Cournot

competition, but profit levels become almost indistinguishable.

6.3 Endogenous Product Differentiation and Consumer Surplus.

            There is a significant literature comparing the effects of Bertrand and Cournot

competition on consumers. The effects of different levels of investment in process R&D under

the two modes of competition have been considered, but the literature does not address the

effects of different levels of investment in horizontal product differentiation.

            Letting G  U – (p1x1 – p2x2 – M) denote consumer surplus (or “gains”), then from (1) for

b = 1, (2) and the equality of outputs and prices across firms, we obtain

            G = 2(a-p)x – (1+s)x2 = (1+s)x2                                                      (16)

Since the relationship between output and product differentiation has a different functional form

depending on the mode of competition (see (7) and (14)), we define GB = GB(s) = (1+s)(xB(s))2

and GC = GC(s) = (1+s)(xC(s))2 to examine consumer surplus as a function of product

differentiation, v, where v = 1 – s. Proposition 7 follows.




                                                      30
Proposition 7:

i) For any given level of product differentiation, v, an increase in v:

       (a) reduces consumer surplus under Bertrand competition.

       (b) increases consumer surplus under Cournot competition.

ii) Whatever the levels of product differentiation, vB and vC, other than unrelated products (v = vB

= vC = 1), consumer surplus is always higher under Bertrand than Cournot competition.

Proof: i) From (16), dxB/ds = - xB(1-2s)/(2-s)(1+s) (see (7)), dxC/ds = - xC/(2+s) (see (14)) and s

> 0 (from v = 1- s < 1), we obtain

        dGB/ds = 3s(xB(s))2/(2 - s) > 0

       dGC/ds = -s(xC(s))2/(2+s) < 0                                                         (17)

Since v = 1- s and dG/dv = - dG/ds, it follows from (17) that dGB/dv < 0 proving (a) and dGC/dv

> 0 proving (b). ii) If v < 1, then s = 1 – v > 0. Since dGB/ds > 0 and dGC/ds < 0 for s > 0 (see

(17)), we have GB > GC for any vB, vC  [0,1] provided vB < 1 or vC < 1. If v = 1(products are

unrelated), then xB = xC = (a-c)/2 (see (7) and (13)) and we obtain GB = GC from (16) ***

       Proposition 7 makes the striking point that when Bertrand firms produce differentiated

products rather than homogeneous products, consumers are made worse off. Even though

consumers get more utility from differentiated products at given prices, Bertrand firms take

advantage of product differentiation to raise prices sufficiently that the price increase more than

offsets the direct gain in utility experienced by consumers. By contrast, the price increases

arising from increases in product differentiation under Cournot competition are relatively modest

and are not sufficient to offset the consumer gains from greater variety.



                                                   31
                       Despite the fact that consumers are made worse off by Bertrand product differentiation

and better off by Cournot product differentiation, it is still true that for any given level of

differentiation, consumer surplus is higher under Bertrand than Cournot competition. Indeed, as

shown in Proposition 8, part ii, consumer surplus is always higher under Bertrand competition,

regardless of product differentiation decisions. This last result follows from the fact that the

limiting case of monopoly in which products are completely independent (variety is at v = 1),

represents the lower bound for consumer surplus under Bertrand competition and the upper

bound for consumer surplus under Cournot competition.

                       The results of Proposition 7 are illustrated in Figure 4 assuming, as before, that a - c = 12.

7. Concluding Remarks

                       This paper provides an explanation of the empirical Bertrand paradox based on

endogenous horizontal product differentiation. By the “empirical Bertrand paradox” we mean the

failure to observe homogeneous product Bertrand oligopoly in practice while homogenous

product Cournot oligopoly is of empirical relevance. Even though product differentiation is

                                                                   32
costly, we show that Bertrand firms have a much stronger incentive to undertake product

differentiation than Cournot firms.

       Our model of differentiation is sufficiently general that prohibitive differentiation costs

are possible, even in the Bertrand case. The critical value of differentiation effectiveness required

for differentiation under Bertrand competition is reflected by a differentiation effectiveness

parameter that we label βB. At β = βB, and even at a value of β twice or three times βB, Cournot

firms will produce homogeneous products. The level of β must rise to 6.75 times βB before

Cournot firms will undertake differentiation. Consequently, there is a very wide range of

differentiation effectiveness (and hence differentiation costs) over which Bertrand firms would

differentiate but Cournot firms would not.

       While there are other reasons why we might rarely if ever observe homogeneous product

Bertrand oligopoly, we suggest that our model of endogenous horizontal product differentiation

provides a natural explanation with significant empirical relevance. Examples include cases such

as soft drinks – where differentiation is achieved through advertising – and automobiles, where

much of the year to year changes that are made in model specification are small styling

differences that have little to do with performance and much to do with creating perceived

differentiation. In the case that differentiation investments are very ineffective in creating

differentiation of relevance to consumers, Bertrand firms would earn zero profits and would be

indifferent between producing and staying out of the market. Since even the slightest fixed costs

or entry costs would generate negative profits, it is unlikely we would observe homogeneous

product Bertrand oligopoly as an equilibrium outcome.

       We also investigate the relative competitiveness of otherwise equivalent Bertrand and

Cournot industries. Interestingly, we find that for sufficiently high values of differentiation

                                                   33
effectiveness (i.e. low differentiation costs) Bertrand firms charge higher prices and earn larger

profits than Cournot firms. For any given level of product differentiation short of completely

unrelated products, variable profits are lower under Bertrand competition than Cournot

competition. However, the cutthroat nature of price competition when products are homogeneous

is rapidly tempered by product differentiation. Indeed, the enhanced market power enjoyed by

Bertrand firms as differentiation increases more than offsets the benefits to consumers of greater

variety, with the result that consumer surplus falls. Cournot competition, however, exhibits the

opposite result, as greater product differentiation increases consumer surplus. Nevertheless,

regardless of differences in product differentiation across the two modes of competition,

consumer surplus is always higher under Bertrand competition than Cournot competition.

       This paper deals only with the simultaneous move game – in which two duopolists are in

a symmetric position with respect to timing. A natural extension is to consider sequential move

games in which entry deterrence or, at least, entry manipulation becomes important. In such a

case an incumbent might wish to make a commitment to “plant the flag” in the face of potential

entry, even though it would have a post-entry incentive to differentiate its product. In such a

context endogenous product differentiation is one of several types of investment that allow firm

to take a particular “positon” or “niche” in the market, as in Bloch, Eaton, and Rothschild (2014).

Another useful extension would be to consider multi-product firms (as in Chen and Chen (2014))

More broadly we believe that the model of horizontal product differentiation developed in this

paper provides potentially useful insights for both simultaneous and sequential interactions

between firms in oligopoly markets.

Appendix 1: Bertrand price, output, and profit

    To prove the equilibrium conditions (6), we derive each condition as a function of s. where s

= 1 – v . Each firm i for i = 1,2 sets its price to maximize variable profit taking the price of the

other firm as given. From (4) using (5), the first order conditions are

    dV1 /dp1 = x1 - (p1 – c)/(1 – s2) = [(a + c - 2p1) – (a – p2)s]/(1 - s2) = 0

    dV2/dp2 = x2 - (p2 – c)/(1 – s2) = [(a + c - 2p2) – (a – p1)s]/(1 - s2) = 0

These first order conditions simplify to 2p1 – sp2 = (a + c) – as and 2p2 – sp1 = (a + c) – as,

which imply a common price, denoted, p, where

       p = pB(s) = (a + c - as)/(2-s) = (a-c)(1-s)/(2-s) + c                                    (A1.1)

where the superscript B identifies functional relationships in the Bertrand model. Substituting

(A1.1) into the demand functions (5) yields the common equilibrium quantity:

       x = xB(s) = (a – p)/(1 + s) = (a-c)/(2-s)(1+ s)                                          (A1.2)

Equations (A1.1) and (A1.2) apply for s < 1 (differentiated products) and for s = 1

(homogeneous products). Substituting (A1.1) and (A1.2) into variable profit, Vi  (pi – c)xi, from

(4) yields the common equilibrium variable profit at the second stage:

       V = VB(s) = (1-s2)(xB(s))2                                                              (A1.3)




                                                    35
Appendix 2: Second order conditions for differentiation decisions.

Show ∂2πi/(∂ki)2 < 0 for all s  (0,1] or v = 1 – s  [0,1)

For both Bertrand and Cournot competition, each firm i sets ki taking kj for j ≠ i fixed and using

∂s/∂ki = ds/dK = -βs from (9), we obtain ∂πi/∂ki = - βs(dV/ds) – 1 = 0 for ki > 0 from (11) and

(15) and hence that

       ∂2πi/(∂ki)2 = β2s[(dV/ds) + s(d2V/(ds)2]                                            (A2.1)

For Bertrand competition, using dVB/ds = - 2(xB)2(1 – s + s2)/(2-s) from (8) and dxB/ds = - xB(1-

2s)/(2-s)(1+s) from (7) it can be shown that

       d2VB/(ds)2 = - 6(xB)2[3s – 1 - s2(1 - s)]/(2 - s)2(1 + s)                           (A2.2)

It can then be shown from (8) and (A2.2), that

       dVB/ds + s(d2VB/(ds)2) = - 2(xB)2ΨB/(2-s)2(1+ s)                                    (A2.3)

where ΨB ≡ (1–s+s2)(2–s)(1+s) + 3s[3s – 1 - s2(1-s)] can be expressed as

          ΨB = 2(1-s)(1-s+s2) + s2(5+s+2s2) > 0                                            (A2.4)

From (A2.1), (A2.3) and (A2.4), we obtain ∂2πBi/(∂ki)2 < 0 for all s  [0,1].

       For Cournot competition, using dVC/ds = - 2(xC)2/(2+s) from (15) and xC = (a-c)/(2+s)

from (13), we obtain

       d2VC/(ds)2 = 6(xC)2/(2+s)2                                                          (A2.5)

It then follows from (15) and (A2.5), that

       dVC/ds + s(d2VC/(ds)2) = - 4(1-s)(xC)2/(2+s)2 < 0                                   (A2.6)

and hence, using (A1), that ∂2πCi/(∂ki)2 < 0 for all s  [0,1]. ***
