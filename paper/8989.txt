                                              ABSTRACT

        Over the past 20 years, demand for acute care hospital services has declined more rapidly than
has hospital capacity. This paper investigates the extent to which the preponderance of the nonprofit form
in this industry might account for this phenomenon. We test whether rates of exit from the hospital
industry differ significantly across the different forms of ownership, and especially whether secular
nonprofit hospitals reduce capacity more slowly than do other types of hospitals. We estimate the effect
of population changes (a proxy for changes in demand) at the zip-code level between 1985 and 1994 on
changes in the capacity of for-profit, secular nonprofit, religious nonprofit, and public hospitals over the
same period, holding constant metropolitan statistical area (MSA) fixed effects and other 1985 baseline
characteristics of residential zip codes. We find that for-profit hospitals are the most responsive to
reductions in demand, followed in turn by public and religiously affiliated nonprofit hospitals, while
secular nonprofits are distinctly the least responsive of the four ownership types.

I.     INTRODUCTION

       Hospital care is the most prominent of several important service industries – concentrated

heavily in health care, education, and the arts – in which nonprofit firms account for a substantial

share of total production. Nonprofit firms do not, however, provide all of the nation’s hospital

care; the industry is also heavily populated with both for-profit and governmental firms. The

mix of ownership forms in this industry has fed a long-standing debate among economists,

sociologists, and legal scholars about the patient and social welfare implications of ownership,

with particular attention to differences between nonprofit and for-profit institutions. In this vein,

several studies (reviewed in Kessler and McClellan 2002) have examined the effects of

ownership on quality of care, operating efficiency, prices, costs, and the volume of charity care.

We explore here a different but related issue: the effects of ownership on the rapidity of exit in

the face of declining demand.

       In recent years, hospital care in the U.S. has been characterized by rapidly falling

demand, likely due in large part to technological advances in medical procedures and to managed

care (Cutler 2000). Between 1980 and 1999, inpatient non-federal days in short-stay hospitals in

the U.S. fell from 293,830,162 to 160,560,460, or 45.4 percent (Health United States 2001,

Tables 1 and 91). Capacity, however, has declined significantly less rapidly. The number of

non-federal hospital beds fell from 1,247,188 to 938,746 over this period, or 24.7 percent (Health

United States 2001, Table 108).

       The preponderance of the nonprofit form in the hospital industry may largely explain this

divergence between the rate of decline in demand and the rate of contraction of capacity. The

managers of nonprofit hospitals, lacking a class of owners to whom they are accountable, face no



                                                  3
external pressure to maximize profits, or even (like a public utility) to produce at least a market

rate of return on the firm’s invested capital. Rather, when cash flow is positive, they are free to

reinvest all of it, expanding capacity to the point where net revenues (and hence the marginal rate

of return on existing investments) is zero. And, even if cash flow is negative, they are free to

maintain capacity by drawing down on accumulated net assets (which, among nonprofit

hospitals, are often substantial). Indeed, managers of nonprofit hospitals may even feel it is their

duty to behave in this fashion, believing in good faith that all of the firm’s revenues and net

assets must be dedicated to providing the maximum amount of hospital care possible.

       A natural and potentially more efficient alternative would be for the hospital to return its

(potential) free cash flow, beyond what can be reinvested with an appropriately high social rate

of return, to patients in the form of lower prices. But for hospital managers this alternative is

rendered even less morally salient than it might otherwise be by the fact that the bulk of hospital

revenue today comes, not directly from patients, but rather from third-party insurers. (Another

alternative would be to donate net revenues or assets to other charities with greater social need,

as is sometimes done with the proceeds from conversion from nonprofit to for-profit form.)

Reluctance to reduce capacity is likely to be strongly reinforced, moreover, by pressure from a

hospital’s affiliated staff physicians, whose income may be threatened by reduction or

elimination of the hospitals’ facilities (Pauly and Redish 1974).

       To be sure, the managers of for-profit firms, and particularly of broadly-held business

corporations, also have at times both the incentive and the opportunity to engage in empire-

building. But the market for corporate control acts as an ultimate check on such tendencies, as

demonstrated by the numerous hostile takeovers of the 1980s, which were in part directed at



                                                  4
reducing overcapacity and excessive reinvestment (Jensen 1988). No similar check exists for

nonprofit firms, which cannot be the subject of a hostile takeover.

       It follows that a nonprofit firm not only can, but might well be expected to, maintain

capacity and even expand in circumstances where its for-profit competitors choose to contract or

exit the market entirely. And this can remain true even if for-profit firms are significantly more

cost efficient, and even if the nonprofit firm receives no special subsidies (Hansmann, 1996a). In

short, nonprofit firms have a tendency to act as capital traps, in which capital remains

inefficiently embedded over long periods.

       The social welfare implications of such behavior are theoretically indeterminate. On one

hand, “slow” adjustment of capacity to demand may be optimal. Altering the level of a factor of

production whose costs are as sunk as those of a hospital bed is socially costly. On the other

hand, “slow” adjustment may be socially wasteful. Maintaining a hospital bed is costly, in both

financial and nonfinancial terms. Substantial research, starting with Roemer (1961), has

suggested that high levels of bed capacity per patient lead to longer lengths of stay and higher

costs. More recent research indicates that hospitals that treat relatively few cases of any

particular type of patient – a potential consequence of high capacity – may deliver lower-quality

care. Kessler and McClellan (2000), for example, find that elderly heart attack patients from

markets with high levels of capacity per unit cardiac patient experience both generally higher

levels of Medicare expenditures and higher mortality rates (although somewhat lower rates of

cardiac complications).

       Thus, it is important to understand how ownership affects capacity choice. If ownership

forms respond differently to changes in demand, then public policies that favor one ownership



                                                 5
form over another may affect welfare not just by altering the mix of ownership forms itself, but

also by affecting the aggregate level of industry capacity. Moreover, identifying differences in

the response of capacity to demand by ownership type can help distinguish among competing

general models of nonprofit firm behavior.

       Despite the importance of the subject, however, little empirical work has focused on the

impact of ownership form on capacity choice. Two studies have examined the differential

supply response of nonprofit and for-profit firms, and of hospitals in particular, to rapid increases

in demand. Both studies found that the market share of for-profit as opposed to nonprofit firms

was significantly higher in areas that had recently experienced rapid growth in population.

(Steinwald and Neuhauser 1970; Hansmann 1987.) These studies concluded that this pattern is

explained, in important part, by the difficulties that nonprofit firms face in obtaining rapid access

to capital.1 The long-term pattern of development in the hospital industry, prior to the

implementation of Medicare and Medicaid in 1966, was that the ratio of for-profit to nonprofit

firms increased during periods of rapidly increasing demand, and then fell -- owing, in part, to

conversions from for-profit to nonprofit form -- as demand growth slackened (Steinwald and

Neuhauser 1970). The sluggish nonprofit supply response to increasing demand was thus largely

a short-term phenomenon.

       The principal problem facing the hospital industry today, however, may not be to hasten

capacity expansion to meet growing demand, but just the opposite: to hasten the elimination of

excess capacity already in place. Moreover, the problem is not peculiar to the hospital industry.

The nonprofit form frequently performs a transitional role in the early stages of a service

industry’s development, serving as an important source of production until adequate demand-



                                                  6
side financing is organized, and the service is sufficiently standardized or regulated, to permit

for-profit firms to serve as efficient providers. After that, the nonprofit firms lose their special

raison d’etre, yet retain a substantial market share owing to trapped capital. Savings banking is a

conspicuous example from the past (Hansmann, 1996b); health insurance and health

maintenance organizations are contemporary examples; and higher education may be an example

in the future (Hansmann 1996a). The problem of trapped capital is generic in the nonprofit

sector.

           We have spoken so far of the effects of nonprofit versus for-profit ownership on the rate

of capacity adjustment, but the underlying model of behavior described above can explain other

differences in capacity choice between ownership forms. Hospital care, like some other

important services such as education, is also provided in substantial part by governmental

institutions. Supply response in general, and trapped capital in particular, may be less of a

problem for these public firms than it is for nonprofit firms. A public hospital is not a nonprofit

entity, but rather a proprietary entity, with the government as the owner. And the government

has other pressing uses for its funds besides providing hospital care. Consequently, when the

private sector becomes capable of providing services formerly provided by the government,

governments may face political incentives to exit. Consistent with this logic, after Medicare and

Medicaid relieved much of the need for public and nonprofit hospitals to provide uncompensated

care, there was substantial exit by public institutions, whose share of total beds dropped from

roughly 31% to 24% between 1971 and 1992, while for-profit hospitals simultaneously increased

their market share from 6% to 12%. In striking comparison, nonprofit hospitals, rather than

    See Lakdawalla and Philipson (1998) for related work on other constraints on nonprofits’ ability to expand.

                                                            7
exiting in large numbers like the public institutions, actually increased their market share slightly

during that period, from 63% to 64%. (Hansmann 1996a.)

       For similar reasons, one might expect nonprofit hospitals to differ among themselves in

terms of supply response. The most conspicuous divide in this respect is between religiously-

affiliated and nonreligious hospitals. Like public hospitals, religiously-affiliated hospitals often

have an owner of sorts, if not in the formal legal sense then at least in the functional sense that

they are commonly associated with another entity, the church, that both exercises substantial

control over them and stands to benefit from economies achieved in the hospitals’ operations

(and can serve as a source of funds and act as entrepreneur when expansion or entry is called

for). By this reasoning, religiously-affiliated hospitals would show greater supply response than

non-religious nonprofit hospitals.

       In this paper we seek to test whether rates of exit from the hospital industry differ

significantly across the different forms of ownership, and especially whether secular nonprofit

hospitals, which supply the majority of industry capacity, are much slower to reduce capacity

than are other types of hospitals. We examine the relative responsiveness of the different types

of hospitals to changes in demand for hospital services, using changes in the size of the elderly

population as a proxy for changes in demand. We present estimates of the effect of population

changes at the zip-code level between 1985 and 1994 on changes in the capacity of for-profit,

secular nonprofit, religious nonprofit, and public hospitals over the same period, holding

constant metropolitan statistical area (MSA) fixed effects and other 1985 baseline characteristics

of residential zip codes. We decompose the effect on each ownership form’s capacity of

population into four mutually exclusive and exhaustive sources: changes due to opens and closes



                                                  8
of hospitals, changes due to conversions, changes due to mergers and spinoffs, and changes due

to changes in hospitals’ bed size. We also investigate whether the responsiveness of different

ownership forms’ capacity to population differ according to zip codes’ baseline 1985 hospital

market characteristics.

        Sections II through IV present the statistical models, the sources of data, and the

empirical results. Section V concludes with some observations about the implications of our

results for the hypothesized model of nonprofit firms’ behavior described above, and for

economic efficiency in sectors dominated by nonprofit firms.



II.     MODELS

        For every residential zip code z = 1, …, Z in a MSA in 1985 and 1994, we construct a

measure of the hospital capacity serving that zip code. We assume that z is served by every

nonfederal, general medical /surgical hospital j = 1, …, Jz within 35 miles of the patient’s

residence with at least five heart attack (AMI) admissions, and every large, nonfederal, general

medical/surgical teaching hospital within 100 miles of the patient’s residence with at least five

AMI admissions.2 We allocate a hospital’s beds Bj to z in inverse proportion to the distance

between the hospital and the center of z, such that the capacity of z in 1985 is defined as

                                                      Jz
                                                                 B j ,85
                                             C z ,85 = ∑          Zj
                                                                              ,
                                                                        1
                                                             D jz ∑
                                                      j =1

                                                                  z =1 D jz

 We explain the reason for these a priori constraints in Kessler and McClellan (2000); because markets for cardiac
care are generally much smaller than the constraints, they are not restrictive.

where Djz is the distance from j to z for every z = 1, …, Zj that is served by j. We define Cz,94

analogously, and the log growth of capacity in zip code z as dlnCz = ln(Cz,94) – ln(Cz,85). The

normalizing factor

                                                              1

                                                    ∑D z =1       jz



assures that for any hospital, the sum across the zip codes that it serves of the weights allocating

its capacity equals 1, i.e.

                                       Zj
                                             1                1
                                      ∑D          *      Zj
                                                             1
                                                                            = 1.
                                                       ∑
                                      z =1   jz

                                                       z =1 D jz



          We decompose capacity in two ways to explore whether market conditions and changes

in demand for hospital services have different effects on the capacity provided by hospitals of

different ownership types. First, we decompose each residential area’s capacity by its form of

ownership. We define the secular nonprofit capacity of z, CzSNP, as

                                                  Jz
                                                         B j ,85 * SNPj ,85
                                         ,85 = ∑
                                     C zSNP                            Zj
                                                                               ,
                                                                         1
                                                              D jz ∑
                                                  j =1

                                                                   z =1 D jz



where SNPj = 1 if j is a secular nonprofit hospital. We define for-profit capacity Cz,85FP, religious

nonprofit capacity Cz,85RNP, and public capacity Cz,85P (and their associated growth rates)

analogously. Estimates of the effect of market conditions and changes in demand on each

ownership form’s capacity will show how different types of organizations respond to exogenous

shocks.




                                                            10
           Second, we decompose each area’s change in capacity by the source of the change. We

categorize changes in total capacity and changes in each ownership form’s capacity as due to one

or more of four exhaustive and mutually exclusive causes: opens and closes of new hospitals;

conversions (i.e., changes in ownership status); mergers and demergers; and changes in bed size

for hospitals not experiencing any of the three changes above. We construct an area’s

(counterfactual) change in capacity due to (for example) opens and closes as follows. Define

each hospital’s 1985 capacity Bj,85 as its actual 1985 capacity; define each hospital’s 1994

capacity Bj,94 = Bj,85, unless the hospital opened or closed, in which case define Bj,94 = Bj,94.

Then, recalculate each area’s capacity and change in capacity using these counterfactual hospital

capacities.

           We model area changes in capacity as a function of 1985-1994 changes in a zip code’s

Medicare enrollee population (to proxy for changes in demand for hospital services), the 1985

demographic characteristics of each zip code, the 1985 hospital market characteristics of each zip

code, and MSA fixed effects. Thus, our effects are identified from within-MSA changes in

population and within-MSA differences in market characteristics. We allow hospital capacity to

respond asymmetrically to population increases and decreases. Our basic models specify the log

change in residential zip code z’s capacity of ownership form k as a linear function of these

factors:

(1)                      dlnCzk = αk + β+dlnPz+ + β-dlnPz- + Xzφ + Mzγ + εz,

where αk is an MSA-specific constant term; dlnPz+ is z’s log change in population if z’s

population expanded, 0 otherwise; dlnPz- is z’s log change in population if z’s population

contracted, 0 otherwise; Xz is a vector of six variables denoting the proportion of z’s population



                                                 11
in 1985 who were female, black, age 70-74, age 75-79, age 80-89, and age 90-99 (omitted group

is the proportion of population that were white males aged 65-69); Mz is a vector of six variables

denoting whether z in 1985 was in a highly-concentrated hospital market (in the top quartile of

the distribution of Hirschman-Herfindahl indices), and whether z in 1985 had above the median

density of patients admitted to large hospitals, teaching hospitals, hospitals that were members of

multi-hospital systems, for-profit versus nonprofit hospitals, and public versus nonprofit

hospitals;3 and εz is an independently-distributed error term, with E(εz | dlnPz, Xz, Mz) = 0. We

weight each observation by the number of beds of ownership type k in zip code z, Czk.

           We reestimate model (1) including controls for baseline 1985 beds per capita as a control

variable, to investigate the extent to which our results are sensitive to differences in baseline

capacity that are correlated with ownership status across areas:

(2)                 dlnCzk = αk + β+dlnPz+ + β-dlnPz- + Xzφ + Mzγ + θlnCz,85 + εz.

           We also estimate two expanded models to investigate whether the responsiveness of

capacity to population shifts varies by 1985 baseline characteristics of hospital markets. First,

we estimate models that interact lnCz with dlnP, to investigate the extent to which capacity is

differentially responsive to demand in high- versus low-capacity areas:

(3) dlnCz = αk + β+dlnPz+ + β-dlnPz- + δ+ lnCz,85 *dlnPz+ + δ- lnCz,85 *dlnPz- +

                             + θlnCz,85 + Xzφ + Mzγ + εz.

Second, we estimate models that interact Mz with dlnPz:

(4) dlnCz = αk + β+dlnPz+ + β-dlnPz- + δ+ Mz*dlnPz+ + δ-Mz*dlnPz- + Xzφ + Mzγ + εz.

Estimates from this model will show, for example, the extent to which capacity of different

ownership forms respond differently to demand in more versus less competitive markets.



III.   DATA

       We use data from four sources. First, we use data on U.S. hospital characteristics

collected by the American Hospital Association (AHA). The response rate of hospitals to the

AHA survey is greater than 90 percent, with response rates above 95 percent for large hospitals

(>300 beds). We exclude rural hospitals and hospitals owned by the federal government

(primarily Veterans’ Administration hospitals) because the process governing capacity decisions

for these hospitals may differ from other hospitals. We analyze the capacity of only those

hospitals that ever reported providing general medical or surgical services (for example, we

exclude psychiatric and rehabilitation hospitals from analysis). To assess hospital size and bed

capacity per patient, we use total general medical/surgical beds, including ICU/CCU and

emergency beds. We classify hospitals as teaching hospitals if they report at least 20 full-time

residents.

       Second, we use a hospital system database constructed from multiple sources (see

Madison 2001 for a detailed discussion). The AHA survey contains extensive year-by-year

information on hospital system membership status. Our validity checking indicated that the

universe of systems and system hospitals, and the timing of hospitals’ system membership, as

defined by AHA did not conform to discussion of hospital systems in the trade press such as

Modern Healthcare. We therefore created our own system database based on a combination of

the AHA and other sources. We classify hospitals as for-profit, secular nonprofit, religious



                                                13
nonprofit, or publicly-owned. We classify all public hospitals as non-system hospitals because

system membership of public hospitals in our data did not reflect reliably actual transfer of

control to an outside entity.

       Third, we use Medicare enrollment data to calculate the size and age/gender/race

distribution of each non-rural zip code’s elderly population. The Health Care Financing

Adminstration’s HISKEW enrollment files include demographic information on virtually all

elderly Americans (including those enrolled in Medicare HMOs) because of the extremely high

rate of takeup in the Medicare program.

       Fourth, we use comprehensive Medicare claims data on the hospital choices of virtually

all elderly Medicare beneficiaries with heart attack in 1985, matched with the three data sources

described above, to estimate a model of patients’ demand for hospital services as a function of

travel distances between patients and hospitals, the characteristics of patients, and the

characteristics of hospitals. With these estimates, we construct measures of patient flows to

hospitals of different broad types (ownership status, size, teaching status, system membership

status) that are based only on the arguably exogenous factors described above. Then, we

calculate a vector of six indicator variables describing the hospital market characteristics of each

zip code in 1985 as described above (see Kessler and McClellan 2000, 2002 for a detailed

discussion).

       Table 1 describes how hospital capacity under different ownership forms has changed

over the 1985-1994 period, and the sources of those changes. Table 1 decomposes changes in

the number of hospital beds (and the facilities experiencing changes in beds) into four exhaustive

and mutually exclusive categories: changes due to conversions (changes in ownership status),



                                                 14
changes due to opens and closes, changes due to mergers and spinoffs, and changes due to

changes in bed size (absent a conversion, open/close, or merger/spinoff). The most salient

feature of the hospital industry during our study period was a massive contraction in capacity.

       In percentage terms, religious nonprofit hospitals experienced the greatest contraction in

bed capacity (32.5 percent), with public hospitals close behind (29.6 percent). For-profit beds

contracted by 21.4 percent, while nonreligious nonprofit beds contracted the least, by 20 percent.

These simple percentages do not give a clear picture of relative supply response, however,

because the environments in which these four forms of ownership are found tend to differ. In

particular, at the beginning of the study period, nonprofit hospitals, in comparison with for-profit

hospitals, tended to be concentrated in areas with unusually high levels of capacity, where the

need for reduction in capacity was presumably greatest. In results not presented in Table 1, the

correlation coefficient between Mz5 (=1 if the concentration of for-profit/nonprofit admissions in

the zip code were above the median, 0 otherwise) and log(capacity per person in 1985) is .062, p

< .01, and the correlation coefficient between Mz6 (=1 if the concentration of public/nonprofit

admissions in the zip code were above the median, 0 otherwise) and log(capacity per person in

1985) is .025, p < .01.

       In recent years, much attention has been focused on conversions of nonprofit hospitals to

for-profit form – attention that has been due, in part, to concerns about private profiteering that

accompanying some of these conversions (see, e.g., Sloan, Taylor, and Conover 2000). Table 1

suggests that the pattern of conversion activity is not well described, however, as an overall shift

of capacity from nonprofit to for-profit form. Rather, Table 1 shows that conversions were in

fact a net source of increase in secular nonprofit hospital beds between 1985 and 1994, and it



                                                 15
further shows that, in aggregate, net conversion activity in that period was out of both public and

religious nonprofit hospitals and into both for-profit and secular nonprofit hospitals.

       To provide a more refined view of conversion activity, Table 2 tabulates the conversions

in our data according to the ownership status of the hospitals involved both before and after the

conversion. Those data show that, while there is a substantial number of conversions directly

from secular nonprofit to for-profit form, there are also nearly two-thirds as many conversions in

the reverse direction – likely as a response to declining profitability. The principal net

conversion activity across ownership forms is, instead, from public hospitals to secular nonprofit

hospitals, which accounts for nearly all of the overall net increase in secular nonprofit hospitals

through conversion during the period in question.4

       Table 3 shows how residential zip codes’ hospital capacity responds to changes in

population, according to the size of the zip codes’ MSA, and previews the results of our

regression models. Table 3 reports the 1985-1994 percentage change in the four hospital

ownership types’ capacity by MSA size for fast- growing versus slow-growing MSAs.

Specifically, Table 3 groups zip codes according to the quartile of the zips’ urban 1985 elderly

population, with 80 MSAs in each quartile. Then, within each population quartile, each of the 80

MSAs is classified into one of two groups of 40 MSAs, depending on its 1985-1994 growth in

elderly population.

       Table 3 shows that, in the second and third population quartiles, variation across MSAs in

supply response is consistent with the predictions that follow from the organizational incentives

discussed in Section I. Capacity for all ownership types decreased in each group of MSAs, as




                                                 16
one would expect in an industry generally characterized by substantial overcapacity. For all

ownership types except secular nonprofits, moreover, the percentage reduction in capacity is

markedly greater in the slow-growing MSAs than in the fast-growing MSAs. For example, for-

profit capacity in areas in the second population quartile shrank by 26.8 percent in fast-growing

MSAs, but by 37.8 percent slow-growing MSAs. For secular nonprofit hospitals, however, not

only is the relative rate of capacity reduction in fast- versus slow-growing MSAs much smaller

than the relative rate of contraction for the other three ownership forms, but also the absolute rate

of contraction in fast-growing MSAs is actually higher than the rate of contraction in slow-

growing MSAs.

         The rates of capacity change in the most-populous and least-populous MSA quartiles

present a more complex pattern. In particular, Table 3 shows that, among the most populous

MSAs, for-profit hospitals exited the faster-growing MSAs at a slightly faster rate than they

exited slower-growing MSAs. At the same time, for-profit hospitals actually expanded capacity

in the slowest-growing MSAs in the least populous quartile. Both these results are consistent

with a wholesale shift by for-profit hospitals from the largest urban areas to smaller MSAs,

regardless of expected trends in demand. The figures for the least populous quartile of MSAs,

including particularly the large percentage increase in for-profit capacity that appears there, are

also affected by the small number of institutions from which the figures are computed: the

quartile of least populous MSAs contains dramatically fewer hospital beds than does the quartile

containing the most populous MSAs.




4
  There is, however, an important caveat to be added here. We do not count as a conversion the potentially
important phenomenon of nonprofit hospitals’ contracting-out management of its facility to a for-profit firm.


                                                         17
       The fact that the response to changing demand of hospitals of different ownership types

differs depending on the characteristics of the cities in which they are located motivates our

regression models. Those models identify the effects of changing demand on capacity based on

within-MSA variation in population rather than on variation across MSAs, to control for such

unobserved differences in hospitals’ strategies. Specifically, we estimate the effect, on zip-code

level measures of changes in capacity, of zip-code changes in demand and zip-code hospital

market characteristics, holding constant MSA fixed effects. Descriptive statistics of all of the

variables used in the regression analysis appear in Table 4.



IV.    RESULTS

       Table 5 presents estimates of the effect of population changes and base year hospital

market characteristics on changes in differently-owned forms of hospital capacity from model

(1). For hospitals overall, and for each individual ownership type, responsiveness to increases in

demand, as proxied by population increases, is lower than responsiveness to decreases in

demand, controlling for other market characteristics. A one percent increase in population leads

to a .017 percent increase in overall capacity, holding other factors constant, while a one percent

population decrease leads to a .095 percent decrease in overall capacity. This is what one would

expect in an industry generally characterized by overcapacity.

       Comparing the second through fifth columns of the first row of Table 5 shows that

responsiveness to increases in demand for secular nonprofits is similar to that for religious

nonprofit and for-profit hospitals, and rather lower than that of public institutions. This is

perhaps because the expansionary incentives facing (the managers of) secular nonprofits, which



                                                 18
– as we have suggested above – are arguably greater than those present in the other three

ownership types, are counterbalanced by the greater difficulty that secular nonprofits face in

obtaining rapid access to capital.

       Of primary interest to us here, however, is the relative responsiveness to decreases in

demand exhibited by hospitals under different forms of ownership. Here, the results in Table 5

follow precisely the pattern that our theoretical discussion would predict. For-profit capacity is

most responsive to decreases in demand. Next most responsive are public capacity and religious

nonprofit capacity, for which the estimated coefficients are nearly identical. Secular nonprofit

capacity is distinctly the least responsive to decreases in demand, with a coefficient that is less

than half the coefficient for public and religious nonprofit capacity, and only one third of the

coefficient for the responsiveness of for-profit capacity.

       Tables 6 and 7 present estimates of models (2) and (3), respectively. Estimates of model

(2) from Table 6 differ from the estimates of model (1) from Table 5 in that the former are

calculated controlling baseline (1985) total hospital capacity per elderly Medicare beneficiary.

Estimates of model (3) from Table 7 differ from the estimates of model (1) in Table 5 in that the

former are calculated controlling for baseline hospital capacity plus baseline capacity interacted

with the two population change variables, producing estimates of the effect of demand

responsiveness that vary with the level of baseline capacity.

       Table 6 shows that, especially for both forms of nonprofit capacity, the estimated

responsiveness of capacity to increases in population grows larger once baseline capacity is held

constant. The results are similar for the alternative specification in Table 7. In both Tables 6 and

7, this increase in responsiveness is offset by a significant negative effect of high baseline



                                                 19
capacity on the rate of growth in capacity. These are the results one would expect: there is less

need to expand capacity to meet growing demand when the capacity in place is already unusually

large.

         The estimated responsiveness of capacity to population decreases remains essentially

unchanged from Table 5 to Table 6 for all forms of ownership, even though baseline capacity is

statistically significantly correlated with population decreases, just as it is with population

increases (from analysis not in the table, D = .106 and D = -.047, respectively). One possible

interpretation is that areas with declining population are already marked by sufficient

overcapacity that they are contracting as fast as feasible (given organizational constraints), and

that the added stimulus of yet further overcapacity has no important effect on the rate of

contraction. In Table 7, the responsiveness of capacity to decreases in population drops

substantially for all ownership types. High-capacity areas are less responsive to decreases in

demand than are low-capacity areas, likely due to the same factors – not captured in these

models – that were responsible for the high capacity to begin with.

         Table 8 presents estimates of model (4), which allows the effects on capacity of increases

and decreases in population to vary by hospital market characteristics. For-profit hospitals adjust

to demand contractions much more rapidly when the market is concentrated, as, to a much lesser

extent, do religious nonprofits. Secular nonprofit hospitals, in contrast, do not respond

differently to demand contractions in concentrated versus unconcentrated markets.5 One

possible interpretation is that individual institutions internalize more of the gains from capacity

reduction when they have a larger market share, and thus have a stronger incentive to eliminate


5
 In results not presented in the table, we also reestimated equation (4) with controls for baseline 1985 capacity per
capita (as we did for equation (1), with results in Table 5), which had no substantial effect on this finding.

                                                          20
excess capacity in such circumstances – but only if the institutions value profitability above size

and survival, which is presumably true of for-profit hospitals but may not be true of secular

nonprofits. Differences by ownership status in the response of capacity to population increases

in concentrated versus unconcentrated markets follow a different pattern. For-profit and public

hospitals adjust to demand increases statistically significantly more rapidly in concentrated

markets, whereas religious nonprofits adjust to demand increases statistically significantly less

rapidly, reflecting the conflicting incentives for, and constraints on, expansion of hospitals of

different ownership statuses discussed above.

         Tables 9 through 13 present estimates of model (1) analogous to those in Table 4, but

decomposed by the source of the change in capacity. Each table decomposes the changes in a

single ownership form’s capacity into four exhaustive and mutually exclusive sources: opens

and closes, conversions, mergers and spinoffs, and changes in bed size.6 Table 9 gives results for

hospital capacity in aggregate. The exhaustive/exclusive nature of the decomposition is reflected

in the fact that the coefficients across columns in Table 9 add to approximately the coefficients in

column 1 of Table 2. Tables 10 through 13 give results for each ownership form taken

separately.

         Table 9 indicates that, as means of responding to both increases and decreases in demand,

neither conversions nor mergers/spinoffs are significant vehicles for all forms of ownership in

aggregate. This is not surprising, since those transactions do not in themselves lead to any

change in aggregate capacity, although they can be the occasion for change. More interesting is


6
  The effects of population (and other covariates) on changes in an ownership form’s capacity due to different causes
do not necessarily average to the total effects on that ownership form because the a zip code’s percentage change in
the (counterfactually constructed) capacity due to the four causes does not necessarily average to a zip code’s total
percentage change in capacity.

                                                         21
the result that opens/closes, but not changes in bed size, is a significant means of responding to

increases in demand. One reason for this pattern may be that areas with increasing population

are often newly developed sections of MSAs that are far from existing facilities, and hence not

easily served by expanding those facilities; rather, new facilities must be built to serve those

areas. Another reason may be that, with changes in technology, it is often easier to build an

entirely new facility than to expand an existing one.

       The most surprising result in Table 8, however, is that only changes in bed size, and not

opens/closes, are a significant means of reducing aggregate hospital capacity in response to

decreases in demand. This result is due to the fact that (as seen in Tables 9 and 10) both secular

and religious nonprofit hospitals use reductions in bed capacity much more than closure of

facilities to respond to decreasing demand, consistent with the strong managerialist bias against

complete exit that theory suggests we would find at least among secular nonprofits.

       At first glance, Tables 10-13 appear to suggest that conversions are not used to transform

the ownership structure of beds in response to demand changes: rows 1 and 2, column 2 of

Tables 10-13 are small and statistically insignificant. However, this may be an artifact of our

limited definition of conversion (i.e., same name and AHA identifier in 1985 and 1994, but with

a different ownership status), which may exclude some changes in control that were de facto

conversions. Tables 10-13 hint that this may be the case. In areas of decreasing population,

nonprofit capacity contracts through opens/closes, while for-profit and public hospitals actually

expand capacity significantly through opens/closes, suggesting that some of the closes and opens

involved may actually be conversions. This finding underscores one potential limitation of the

analysis of tables 10-13: any classification of changes in capacities into mutually exclusive



                                                 22
categories necessarily involves some arbitrary decisions that may not reflect the complex

realities of the changing structure of the hospital industry.



V.       CONCLUSION

         Numerous empirical studies have sought to identify how differences in the incentives

facing managers of nonprofit and for-profit firms lead to differences in economic performance.7

Many of these studies have taken the hospital industry as their focus. Depending on the

dimension of performance examined, these studies have reported both similarities and

differences across ownership forms.8 We have focused here on a largely neglected aspect of

performance – rapidity of exit -- where differences in behavior between nonprofit and for-profit

hospitals seem likely to be unusually pronounced, and where those differences may have

important implications for the overall structure and performance of the industry.

         Managers of for-profit hospitals, and to a lesser degree also managers of public hospitals

and of religiously affiliated nonprofit hospitals, have an incentive to minimize costs of service,

and hence to eliminate unused or underused capacity. Managers of unaffiliated nonprofit

institutions, in contrast, may not feel such an incentive so long as net cash flow does not become

negative. Consequently, it is a plausible hypothesis that nonprofit hospitals adjust capacity much

more slowly than do for-profit firms in response to reductions in demand, effectively serving as

capital traps.

versus professional managers lead to differences in price and quality in the California wine industry.

  Compare, for example, Kessler and McClellan (2002), who find that areas with a presence of for-profit hospitals
have lower levels of hospital expenditures but virtually the same patient health outcomes to Duggan (2000), who
finds that nonprofit firms responded as strongly as for-profit firms to a California program that greatly increased
immediate financial incentives to treat the indigent.

                                                        23
       The results presented here provide strong support for that hypothesis. For-profit hospitals

are the most responsive to reductions in demand, followed in turn by public and religiously

affiliated nonprofit hospitals, while secular nonprofits are distinctly the least responsive of the

four ownership types.

       It follows that, if excess capacity is a continuing social problem in the hospital sector,

then the high density of nonprofit firms, which are the legacy of a very different era of hospital

technology and financing, may be in large part responsible. This suggests, in turn, that

encouraging exit by nonprofit institutions – and particularly by secular nonprofits – may enhance

efficiency. For example, the withdrawal of federal, state, and local tax exemption from nonprofit

hospitals, or at least from those that do not provide substantial amounts of uncompensated care

(much as federal tax exemption was withdrawn from nonprofit health insurance companies in

1986) could lead to a reallocation of assets to more productive uses. Alternatively, facilitating

conversion to more cost-sensitive forms of organization by altering the fiduciary duties of

nonprofit directors under corporate law to deny them the right to “just say no” to acquisition

offers from other firms, and particularly from for-profit firms (Hansmann, 1996a, 2000), could

accomplish the same goal. The latter reform would restrict the defensive tactics available to the

managers of nonprofit corporations even more severely than those available to the managers of

business corporations. Given, however, that nonprofit institutions by their nature are relatively

insensitive to market pressures for exit, more expansive legally imposed fiduciary duties may be

socially optimal.
