                          WAGES, EMPLOYER COSTS, AND
                        EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE IN THE FIRM



                                   ABSTRACT



       In this paper   I use data fros a survey of firms to estimate the effects

of a firm's wage level on several measures of its hiring costs and the

characteristics and performance of its employees.      These measures include the

previous experience and current tenure of its employees; subjective

productivity scores for these employees; job vacancy rates; perceived ease of

hiring qualified workers for the firs; and hours spent hiring and training new

workers.   In doing so, I distinguish the case of high wages imposed on s firm

by unions from that in which the firm might be choosing its wage level in

order to maximize its profits.    I also provide some rough measures of the

extent to which firms offset their high wage costs in each case.

       The results show generslly positive effects of firm wages on employee

experience and tenure as well as on subjective productivity scores.        The

firm's wsges generally have negative effects on job vacancy rates and positive

effects on the perceived ease of hiring qualified workers.      Training time is

slso reduced.   While the magnitude of each individusl effect    rssy   not aiwsys be

large or even significant, their combined effects suggest that firms offset 5

good desi of their higher wage costs through improved      productivity and lower

hiring and turnover costs among their employees.

I.   Introduction
         It    has long been recognized that firms which are forced to pay above

                                                                                    If, for
market—clearing wages will respond by altering their hiring behavior.

               unions raise the wages of unskilled workers for     a   firm or industry,
instance,

firms should respond by substituting capital for labor and more highly skilled

workers     for   those   less skilled.1   Thus, we would expect to find higher skill

levels and higher productivity observed among workers at unionized firms,                 in

order to prevent workers from fully extracting their monopoly rents.                The

amount of training provided to these workers once hired might be affected as

well.2

         Of course, these labor demand—side explanations often assume          that the
skills of      workers are     perfectly observable, that workers within   skill
categories        are   homogenous, and that supplies of workers in each   category are

limitless (I.e.,          perfectly elastic).3   If, however, these conditions are not

met, profit—maximizing firms might themselves choose to pay higher wages even

in   the absence of unions.     recently burgeoning "Efficiency Wage"
                                     The

literature stresses these difficulties which firms may have in hiring,
monitoring, and/or retaining high productivity workers.5 ecause of these
difficulties, firms might choose to pay higher wages In order to raise the
quality     and/or quantity of job applicants, reduce supervision costs and reduce

turnover.         Employer search and matching models also suggest     that firms might
choose high wages in order to lower the foregone profits associated with

 lengthy      job vacancies    and perhaps to lower hiring costs as well.6 Finally,

 firms might change the structure and method of pay in          addition to   its   average

 level   in order to create greater incentives for worker performance.7

          A great deal of empirical        evidence has also been produced on these

                                                                      of firm—
 general topics, but surprisingly little considers the direct effects
level wages on employee characteristics and performance. For instance,               the

effects of unions on worker productivity, profits,             training   and turnover have

received widespread attention, though few studies focus on the direct effects

of wages as opposed     to the institution of unionism on these outcomes.8           More

generally, wage effects on turnover          and absenteeism have been studied.9      But a

much broader range of employee coats and productive characteristics or

outcomes among workers must be considered in order to correctly measure the

firm's ability to offset the costs of higher wages.              The magnitudes of the

effects must be considered as well in any reasonable attempt to gauge the

overall effects of wages on the firm.1°

        In this paper    I   use data from a survey of firms to estimate the effects

of a firm's wages on its hiring costs and on the characteristics and

performance of its workers.        The focus on wages at the level of the firm (as

opposed to the industry or individual worker) will distinguish this work from

most previous studies on related issues.            This focus is consistent with the

evidence of wage differentials between firms for comparable workers of which

economists have long been aware (e.g. Dunlop (1957)) but which remain poorly

understood to date.

        Several measures of worker quality and performance are used as outcomes

here.   These include:       the previous experience of the worker and his/her

tenure with the current employer; as well as subjective productivity scores as

gauged by the employer.       In addition,    I will consider job vacancy rates and

the perceived ease of hiring qualified workers to measure firm hiring

difficulties and how wages affect them.            Finally,   I will consider the number

of hours spent hiring and training these new employees by the employer. This

fairly comprehensive list of responses to firm wages will enable us to

approximately measure the degree to which high wage costs are offset by firms,

In a manner which has not been attempted to date.

                                               2
          In estimating fire—level        wage effects on these outcomes,            we will

distinguish between the effects of unions on wages, which are generally

imposed exogenously on the firm;11 and other determinants of wage levels which

might conceivably reflect firm choices.                These other determinants will include

industry and firm size, both of which have clearly been show to be associated

with long—run wage differences between firms.12 While this analysis is not an

explicit test of "Efficiency Wages" or any other theory of wage determination,

it should shed some light on the general notion of whether firms eight ever

find it in their      interest to pay high (relative to the market) wages.

          The data which are used here to measure             firm   effects are from the 1982

wave    of the   Employment    portunity Pilot         Project   (EOPP) Survey      of    Firms.13
This wave of the survey was administered to approximately                   31100   firms in      28
local areas.      The survey is discussed in greater detail below.

          The results of the estimation can be briefly summarized here.                      We

generally find positive effects of firm wages on employee experience and

tenure as    well as on subjective productivity scores.               The   firm's    wages     also
have negative     effects     on   job vacancy rates    and   positive effects       on   the
perceived ease of hiring qualified workers as well as negative                      effects on
hours    of training.    While the magnitude and/or significance levels                   of many of
the individual effects are not large, taken together they suggest that firms
offset    a good deal   of their higher wage costs through improved productivity
and lower    hiring   and turnover     costs   among   their employees.

         The rest of the paper is laid out as follows:                Section II describes the

data and the equations estimated in greater detail, while Section III
                                                                      presents
the results of estimated equations.             Section IV presents a summing up of the

various effects to estimate an overall effect of wages on profits,                        while

Section V contains the conclusion and implications of this work.

         In order   to consider the effects of a firm's wage level on its cost and

its variable costs and revenues of operating. For a given period of time, a

firm's profits can be written as follows:

currently available in the firm; and F, Q and W reflect prices, output

wages at the firm.         Both output and labor costs therefore depend on non—vacant

revenue here.
                                                                          as net
         The frequency of hiring should reflect employee turnover as well

                         at the firm.    The

duration and intensity of hiring activity, which in turn should influence the
number of hours spent by company personnel in recruiting, screening, and

training new employees. The wages of company personnel and other direct
hiring expenditures (such as advertising, etc.) are included as well in this
                                                on both the frequency and
 term.   Finally, the vacancy rate also depends

 positions being filled are actually vacant.
                                                                         firm to
         The firm's wage level might raise output levels by inducing the

 hire more qualified workers.           This should be easier to do if the quantity
and/or quality of job applicants attracted by the firm rises with the wage.

The wage level might also affect direct hiring costs in a variety of ways.                             By

reducing employee turnover            (or, equivalently, raising employee              tenure with the

firm),   higher wages will reduce the frequency with which new employees must be

hired.        Costs per    hire might      also be reduced if a larger and better applicant

pool leads to fewer hours spent recruiting and training by company

personnel. Monetary costs of recruiting should be reduced as well.                           Finally,

reductions in the frequency and duration of hiring will also reduce vacancy

rates and thus the costs of foregone output associated with vacant jobs.                           Of

course, large offsets of wage costs in terms of training or expected

productivity should imply smaller ones in terms of vacancy rates and/or

turnover, as the net attractiveness of high—wage jobs for workers becomes

diminished.

          Assuming that the price level and number of jobs are fixed, the effects
of wages on firm      profits can          be seen by differentiating Equation           1) as

follows:

wherethe costs of higher wages must be balanced against the potential
benefits of higher output, lower vacancies and lower direct hiring costs. If
the    firm   is free to    choose    its wage level, it          will   do so   in the usual manner
of    equating these marginal costs and benefits.                     If, however,   the wage is

exogenously determined (by unions or otherwise), Equation 2) simply enables us

to measure the degree to which these higher costs can be offset by the firm.

          The data with which we will analyze these issues are from the EOPP

Survey of firms in 1980 and 1982.          This survey was administered in 28 local

areas that were sites for the EOPP labor market experiments in the late

1970's.     The sites are heavily concentrated in the South and mid—West,          and

about half are SMSA's.        Large and/or low—wage firma were oversampled within

each site.

          The 1982 survey, which we use below,      asked   two general types of

questions of employers: one type covering firm—wide characteristics (e.g.,

number of employees, fraction unionized, number of vacancies, perceived             hiring

difficulties etc.) and the other covering the last worker hired during the

previous year.       Mong   the latter   questions in the 1982 Survey were the

occupation, sex, age and years of education of the worker, as well as his or

her wages — both starting and current (or most recent if the employee was no

longer    with   the firm).

          One measure of employee performance that is available for these workers

is a subjective performance rating.         Employers were asked to score the most

recent employee's productivity on a scale from 0 to 100, where the former

would reflect no productivity and the latter the maximum feasible Output on

the job.     The question was asked for different points in the employee's tenure

at the firm:       the first two weeks, the third through twelfth weeks, and

currently/most recently.        Separate   questions were asked   for "typical"


employees on the same job so that relative comparisons could be made within

the firm.

          As for more objective employee characteristics which might be

performance—related, a few different measures of employee experience are

available in these data.        One question asked how many months of previous

experience the employee had that has some application to the current job.



                                              6
Presusably, this question gauges occupation and/or industry—specific
                                                              of education,
experience. From the question on the employee's age and years

we can also calculate a standard measure of total labor market experience

(i.e.,    age minus years of education minus 6).

          For a measure of turnover and therefore of hiring frequency, tenure

within the firm was specifically asked from those employees who were no longer

with the firm.       For those still present, tenure can be calculated from the

date of hiring and the survey date.              In addition to the tenure measures,


several      questions were asked   about    the asount of time explicitly invested in

training      by the new employee. Total hours        of   formal and informal       training
provided by management, supervisors, or trained personnel               as   well as time
                                                                                    and screening
spent with co—workers are available. The hours spent recruiting

workers for this position are available as well.
                                                                               a
          Using these data, we can estimate the effects of firm—level wages on

variety of labor outcomes. We note that an individual employee's wages and

quality (or productivity) can be decomposed into firm—wide and individual—

specific components:



              3)                +
                     W1     W

              I)     Q..    Q.(W.) +



where    Wand Q     reflect wages   and   quality respectively    while the subscripts i

and   j denote     the individual   and   firm   respectively. Thus an       individual's     wage

is    some   function   wj(Qj) of his/her        perceived quality in addition to a firm—

wide premiun       W,   which in turn     influences the quality   of   worker     attracted
and/or    retained by the firm.         Other equations    comparable to     'I)   could be




                                                  7
specified for employee tenure or for time spent training the employee.                                         In

addition, some firm—wide outcomes (such as vacancy rates or ease of hiring)

can be denoted as follows:



            t)         V.3
                                     V(W.)

                                                  3


with both wage—determined and random components.

       If direct observations on the firm -wage premium                                        were available,

these equations could be estimated recursively. But given that only

individual employee's wages are available                                in the data, we estimate the

following simultaneous equations:



                       W              a    b     + c Z   + d Y. + c

exogenous worker and job characteristics, and the                                      are exogenous

characteristics of the uirm.l!!

       The             variables used here include sex, occupation and education (i.e.
                 Z1j
high school or college) dummies.                            The
                                                                  Y Include 2—digit industry dummies as
well as fraction           unionized and a group of firm size variables. The latter

include a continuous measure                      of       firm   size   within the site as well as a set of

dummies    for total         firm size (i.e.,                0—99,       1OO—249,   250—'99,   500—1999, 2000+).

       The       crucial assumption of this                        model    is that the        can be excluded

from and    thereby used to Identify                        equations 6) and 6').          This    is   tantamount   to


                                                                   8
assuming that these variables affect the various labor outcomes strictly

through the wage and not directly.       This assumption is no doubt questionable,

especially for industry (where technological differences independent of the

wage may determine differences in hiring).          Even   firm size might directly

affect the quality of job applicants independently of the wage.15

        Furthermore, the exogeneity of industry and size with respect to the

wage as well as the observed outcomes might also be in doubt,          as wage

differentials with regards to each might reflect maximizing behavior and

therefore self—selection. Indeed, the "Efficiency Wage" theories noted above

predict such self—selection, which may cause biases (though mostly towards

zero)   in estimated wage effects.16

        For those reasons,     we estimate different specifications of Equations 6)

and 6').   In some, the fraction unionized and/or plant and firm size will be

used to identify the outcome equations; while in others, industry dummies will

be used as   well.   In all cases,   statistical tests will be discussed for the

validity of the exclusions used.

        An additional concern in some cases below involves the subjective

nature of certain outcome variables —      i.e.,    the productivity ratings and

perceived ease of hiring.       The former, in particular, are known to contain a

good deal of measurement error (Bishop,         1987)   and may also contain firm   —

specific   components   that   are correlated with our instruments     for   firm—level

wages, thereby causing biased estimates.17 Of course, the additional use of

objective outcomes    (i.e., experience/tenure instead of productivity scores             and

vacancy rates   instead of ease of hiring) provides a check on any results

obtained   with the subjective outcomes.        Furthermore, evidence will be provided

below on the relationships between experience, productivity scores,             and wages

that will underscore the validity of both.          In partaicular, we will note that



                                            9
fixed—effects estimates of these relationships are fairly comparable to cross—

sectional ones, thereby suggesting that biases from firm—specific effects are

not severe.

         We note a few other econometric issues before moving on to the

results.    We estimate the various outcome equations independently of one

another,   thus abstracting from cross—equation effects and error

correlations.18         Thus, the outcome equations are   of a reduced—form nature.

         A few other aspects of the estimation below are noted mm well.        For one

thing, certain limited dependent variable functions will be estimated where

appropriate, using predicted firm wages as the independent variable.19

Finally, continuous hazard models of the Weibull form will be estimated in

order to gauge the effect of the firm's wages on tenure outcomes.



Ill.    Empirical Results

         In Table   1   we find means and standard deviations of several key

variables for the sample used here.        Two types of variables are considered:

those which reflect the characteristics and performance of the last worker

hired as well as those of the firm itself.

        Several characteristics of workers and firma in the sample are

noteworthy. The starting wages are relatively low, reflecting a sample which

is predominantly comprised of high school workers in clerical, males, and

service jobs.   It is also a fairly young sample, averaging 8—9 total years of

experience in the labor market.        Average tenure on the job is just under   1


year.   These characteristics of workers reflect the fact that low—wage firma

were overaaapled and also that the last—hired workerm will over—represent

high—turnover, low—wage jobs and low—tenure workers within firms.

        The vast majority of training hours reported here are for informal

training by both co—workers and management. Flours spent hiring by management

are lower than those spent training.          Current or most recent productivity

scores average about 80, which is significantly higher than those attributed

to workers at the time of hiring.

        P.s   for the firms themselves, we find that they are relatively large but

less unionized relative to random national samples.20 Vacancy rates are

fairly low, and a majority of firms do not report difficulties in hiring

qualified workers.



Fixed   Costs:     Hiring Time, Training   Time

        In    Tables 2 and 3 we present estimates of the effects of the firm's

wage levels on its hours spent hiring and training respectively. These

estimates are from versions of Equation 6) above in which hours spent hiring

or training are the dependent varlablea.            A similar set of equations are

estimated for other outcomes and reported below.

        The    equations reported here     and below are estimated       using   two—stage

least   squares.    Several specifications are presented In which industry,
fraction      unionized and   firm size variables   are used     to identify the    two stages

and   provide estimates of the firm      wage.     To   test   whether high wages caused by

unions have different effects from those chosen by the               firm,   we present


separate estimates of the union wage effect (column 3) and the size—wage

premium effect (Column H).        Coefficients on these variables when they appear

as controls are presented as well.         We use       the individuafs starting wage to

calculate this premium,       and we control for a variety of personal

characteristics (i.e., education, sex, occupation, site,               and year hired) in

the outcome equation.21

       Table 2 contains results for hours spent hiring.      Because high—wage and

large firms receive more job applicants which, in turn,     should require more

time spent screening and interviewing applicants, we present estimates of

equations for total hours spent as well as hours spent per applicant.22

       The results show that high—wage firms generally must spend more total

time on their hiring activities than do other firms.     Only when a strict union

wage premium is considered (i.e., when we control for industry and firm size)

does this result not appear.    However,   hours spent per applicant show no such

effect.    If anything, these effects are generally negative (though not

significant). Thus, the larger quantity (and perhaps quality) of job

applicants received by high—wage firms requires them to spend more time on

screening, though some small economies of scale may emerge.23

       The effects of firm wages on hours spent training new employees appear

in Table   3.   Separate equations appear for the three types of training

considered: formal, informal provided by management, and informal provided by

co—workers.

       The results show generally negative effects of firm wages on all three

types of training,   though most effects are not significant. Only the effects

on hours of informal training provided by management are marginally

significant when we control for industry but not firm size.2      We also note

that the results here conflict somewhat with those presented by Barron et. al.

using the same data.25

       Comparing Tables 2 and 3, we find that the magnitudes of the combined

negative training effects are generally larger than the positive effects on

total time spent hiring. While the costs associated with the different kinds

of time presumably differ, the results suggest that total time spent and costs

per new employee might be lower in high wage firms.

Hiring Frequency:          Tenure

          Of'   course,   the question remains as         to   how frequently these new

employees must be hired, which depends on turnover.                      Previous research (cited

above) has shown lower turnover among high—wage employees and industries as

well as unionized firms.            In Table   14   we consider whether this holds more

                                                                         of
generally for employees of high—wage firms. The table presents estimates

hazard functions in which the dependent variable is months of job tenure.

Estimates are presented using the Weibull functional form.

          The results show that higher firm wages generally lead to higher tenure

with the firm.26 The effect of high wages in large firms is particularly

strong,    while that in union firms is negative but not significant.27

                                                                            it to
          Overall, then, we find that high wages in a firm generally enable
                                                                                          as well as
reduce turnover and thus the number of new employees it must hire,

the total time associated with each new employee.                      Fixed hiring costs thus

appear to be lower in high—wage firms.



Vacancies and Ease of Hiring

           As noted above,     a firm's output and labor costs reflect its vacancies

as well as its direct wage costs, and vacancy rates can                     give   us some

indication       about    the frequency and duration of          hiring activities.       In Table 5


we present estimates of vacancy rate equations.                      Given the large fraction of

firms (i.e., about 85%) which report no vacancies, we estimate those equations

using Tobit as       well as   OLS.    In   both    cases,     the   firm—level wage is   the

predicted wage       based on   virtually the        same    instruments as    were used in     the

previous tables,28           Control   variables are comparable as well.

             NOTE:   In these equations, firm wage is a predicted variable based on the
                     regressors used in all of the previous tables.  Industry dummies
                     are 1—digit here.
          The results show that higher wages are usually associated with lower

vacancy rates, though once again the exact magnitudes are difficult to pin

down.     Comparing Tobit estimates to those from OLS equations we find

coefficient magnitudes among the former which are much more unstable,                        varying

in both sign and magnitude.             We also    find standard errors which are always

larger among the former.             The largest and most significant negative effect is

the one associated with union wages in the Tobit equations, while the Tobit

effect of large firm size has the opposite sign.

          An alternative method of testing for hiring effects of wages can be

found by analyzing the firm's perceived ease of hiring qualified workers.                         As

noted above, this subjective variable may refer to any or all components of

hiring    costs   and may      also reflect firm—specific factors that could cause
biases    if correlated with regressors.            Still,   it   provides us   with    an

additional measure of hiring            costs with which to the estimate the effects of a

firm's wages.

         Equations      for    the   effects of   wages on perceived ease       of hiring    appear

in Table    6.    In   these equations, the dependent variable takes on             a   value   of
one    if firms report        that   the hiring of qualified werkers is "very easy" or
"not   very difficult" and zero if such hiring is "somewhat difficult" or every

difficult". Other specifications not reported                 here provided relatively

similar estImates. 29            Equations are estimated using two—stage least squares.

         The results of Table 6 show           that higher    wages generally     cause the

perceived    ease of hiring qualified workers to rise as well.                  Only the union

wage effect is not significant here, while the wage effect associated with

firm size is quite large.


         Overall, then, we find firm wage levels to be negatively associated

with hiring costs and difficulties. Though hours spent recruiting and

Employee   tharacteristica and Performance
         For employees of relatively long tenure, the variable costs
                                                                     of higher
                                                   any reductions in fixed
wages   per hour or week of work will likely swamp

                       they might cause.   These   variable costs must therefore be
hiring costs which

employees hired in these firms.
                                                   we use two different proxies
         Without direct evidence on worker output,
                                  the firm.         One is the number of years of

prior experience which

                                            estimates of OLS equations for
 worker productivity, the Appendix contains
                                                   The wage equations correspond to
 wages and productivity scores of
                                  workers.

                                                                       score

                                                      experience. Furthermore,
 the effects of productivity scores on wages seem to be
                                                        largely (though not

totally) explained by prior experience. The productivity score equations also

show particularly large effects of related experience.

         Furthermore, a variety of wage—change and productivity—changeequations

presented in Hoizer (1988) show results which are fairly comparable to those

presented in the Appendix.31 Since these change equations omit fixed effects

of firms   in the performance ratings (which should capture some of the

subjective differencess across managers of different firms in how they rate

employees), we may conclude that both prior experience measures as well as

subjective productivity scores are reasonable proxies for worker performance

at the firm.

         In Tables 7 and      8   we move on   to   consider the effects of firm—level

wages on our various proxies for worker preference. Table 7 contains
equations for years of prior experience while Table 8 contains the firm
productivity        scores.

         Table 7 provides separate estimates for general and related

experience.         Because of the large fraction (i.e., about     110%)   of workers with

no   related experience reported,       we   provide Tobit estimates as well for this
latter   measure.32 The results show generally positive effects of              firm   wages
on years of prior experience. However, these estimates are generally not

significant once we have controlled for industry.             Furthermore, it generally

appears as though industry effects exist independently of firm wages

(according     to   F—tests on the industry dummies).

           results of productivity score equations in Table 8 provide strong
         The

support for the notion that worker productivity rises with the firm wage
level. Effects of wages are positive and significant in all cases except for

 IV.   A Summing Up of Wage Effects

           Given   the   variety of firm wage effects which we have estimated for
                                                                     we now
 hiring and training, vacancy rates, and worker quality/performance,

 must sum up these magnitudes to determine the extent to which wage costs can

 be offset    for high—wage firms.        While this effort requires some fairly heroic

                                                                    it does
 assumptions and therefore must be viewed as being only suggestive,



                                                  17
shed light on the relative magnitudes of the estimated effects and therefore

on how   these effects net out for firma.
         To do this computation, we             consider   Equation (2) from page 5     above,
which decomposes wage       effects on profits into components based on output
(directly and       through vacancy rates), wage costs, and fixed hiring costs.                  In


order   to   make   Equation (2) tractable for this effort, we must transform it
into the following:

                      dm1!       dlnPQ           dlnWC        dlnHC
                             -
                      dlnW       dlnW          w dlnW       H dlnW


where the revenue (PQ) and wage cost (WC) elasticities include the direct

effects of wages (first and third terms of Equation 2) respectively) as well

as their indirect effects through the vacancy rate (second and fourth terms of

Equation     2)   respectively). The hiring cost (HC) elasticity includes wage

effects on both frequency and coat per hire (fifth and sixth terns of Equation

2)), while the        l's represent the shares of revenue accounted for by direct

wage costs and hiring costs respectively.

         We obtain Equation         (7)   by dividing               Equation (2) by PQJ/W. The

estimated effect of wages on profits can then be calculated from our estimated

means and coefficients in previous tables.33 To perform the calculation, we

make the assumption that labor accounts for about 70% of the total value of

output and that 10% of this goes to specifically personnel—related activity,

so we can approximate 1            and         with the fractions   .6 and .1 respectively.
                                          1H
         In order to obtain estimates of the elasticity of revenue with respect

to wages, we also make the following assumptions:                    1)   proportional changes in

performance ratings equal proportional changes in output per                     rker   and


therefore     in revenue (since we are treating prices as constant); and 2) the

          As for the elasticity of profit with respect to hiring costs, we aasume

that the hiring frequency is the inverse of expected job tenure and then use

our estimated wage effects on duration (Table 4) to calculate the effects of

wages on this rrequency.4     We use hours spent recruiting and training each

each new employee as a measure of the cost per      hire.35   But since an hour

spent by co—workers is presumably not as costly to the firm as an hour spent
                                                                               of
by management personnel, we value each of the latter      at twice the value


each of the rormer.6 We also adjust time spent in formal training to account

for the fact that each hour of management time usually accommodates multiple

employees.37 The elasticity of total hiring coats is then obtained by

aggregating these effects and dividing by appropriately weighted means.

          In Table 10 we present calculations of how a 10% rise in the firm's

wages will effect profits. We present separate estimates based on wage

effects           of the four specifications used in Tables 2 through 8.
           from each

Table 10 also presents estimates of each of the three terms of Equation (7),
which are appropriately weighted and summed to produce estimates of total

effects    as well.

          The results show that a 10% rise in wages will lower profits by 2.2% to

4.3%.     More specifically, the increase caused by unions will lower profits by

3.3% while such a wage increase    associated with firm size reduce profits by

about 2.5%.     Comparing the total reduction in profits to that which would be

caused without any adjustment by the firm, these results suggest that about

46% of the higher wage costs associated with unions and about 58% of that

associated with firm size is offset by firms.




                                            19
         The results are, of course, driven primarily by the relatively large

weight attached to the revenue effect and to the magnitude of the wage effect

on revenue    (output)     which ia comparable between the union and firm aize

casem.   While the crucial aamumption that observed wage effects on performance

rating effectm equal those on output is indeed questionable, we also note that

the estimated magnitudes of the offset are consistent with various estimates

of the fraction of the union wage differential that is accounted          for by


personal characteristics (e.g., Mincer (1983), Freeman (1984)).           The evidence

of lower profits in the union sector despite higher experience and/or

productivity (Becker and Olson (1987)) is also consistent with the finding

here of a partial wage offset for unionized firms.           Finally, we note once

again that problems such as self—selection noted above are likely, if

anything, to bias these results in downward direction.



V.   Conclusion
         In   this paper   I   provide estimates of how the wage level of a firm

affects its hiring and training costs as well as the observed characteristics

and performance of its employees. This is done using data from a nationwide

survey of firms on the number of hours spent hiring and training their most

recent employee;     the characteristics (i.e., experience and job tenure) and

performance (subjective ratings)        of that employee; and vacancy rates   as well


as other measures of hiring difficulties. Separate estimates are provided for

union wage premia as opposed to those associated with firm size and/or

industry.

         The results generally show that high—wage firms have lower hiring and

training costs as well as better employee performance. More specifically, we

find fewer hours spent on informal         training,   longer tenure with the firm, more



                                              20
years of previous job experience, higher performance ratings,          lower vacancy

rates,    and higher perceived ease in hiring for higher       wage firms.    However,

the exact magnitudes and significance levels (as well as the signs in a few

cases)    are quite sensitive to whether identification is achieved through

fraction    unionized or employee size.

         Furthermore, we make some attempt to crudely measure the overall costs

and benefits to the firm    of these      higher wages.   These calculations are quite

incomplete and require some heroic assumptions to which the results are quite

sensitive. Nevertheless, the calculations suggest that about           6% of    the

higher wage premia unions and about 58% of those for of large firms are offset

by reduced costs and improved performance.

         Future research on these wage effects require better measures of

outcomes,    especially those measuring worker Output and performance. Financial

data on the profits and capital values of firms might be preferable. More

careful    specifications of how various outcomes are related to       each   other and
to   wage measures would   also   be   useful.

            1References to employer substitution in response to union wages date

back as far as Lewis (1963) and were also stressed by Johnson(1975).

Oiscussions of union effects on productivity and profits appear in Slichter

                                                on institutional factors     rather   than direct
at.   al.    (1960), though they focus

wage effects.             It should    be noted that the predicted effects of union wages

within a labor demand framework                contrast with those of the "efficient

contracts" approach,               which stresses union control over employment as well as

wages (Farber,            1986).     Union effects may also be present for non—union       rkers

due to "insider" power (Lindbeck and Snower, 1986) or the threat of

unionization (Dickens,                1985).

            2The effects of unions on hours            of'   training are theoretically

ambiguous.          If     unions have a larger effect on starting wages than on

                                                                      in the
subsequent ones, we might expect unions to reduce on—the—job training

same manner as the minimum wage appears to do (Haahimoto,                   1981).    But if

unions raise wages independently of (or more than proportionately with)                        job

             it may pay for firms to invest more training in the new Mres.                  On the
tenure,

other hand, employee incentives to invest in such training may be reduced

(Mincer,         1983).     The specificity of the training involved and the expected

tenure of the employee should also affect the firm's training choices.

            3simple labor—demand           models of   wage—taking firms assume infinitely

elastic       supplies      of labor in each category of workers.          If, instead,   firms

 face upward—sloping labor Supply curves (especially in the short—run), the

market—clearing wage would                clearly rise as well. Firms might still prefer to
 pay an above—market wage               to generate a queue of highly skilled workers from
 which      to   choose.


                                                       22
          4lhis     possibility has, of course,      long been recognized in the

personnel/human resources literature. See, for example,               Milkovich and Newman

(1987).

          5The different versions of efficiency wage theory are summarized in

Yellen    (19814)    and Katz (1987).

          6Employer search models include Barron et. al. (1985), Jackman              et.   al.


(1985),    and Albrecht and Axell (1985).         These models frequently posit that

employees choose wages and/or search intensities to maximize profits which, in

turn, depend on efficient matching of jobs and workers.               Models in which wages

depend on bargaining solutions once a match has occurred               include Pissarides

(1985)    and Davidson et. al.     (1987).     Evidence on employer     search intensity

also appears in Barron et. al.

          7See Brown (1988) and Ehrenberg and Milkovich (1987) for discussions of

these issues.

          8Union effects on productivity are reviewed          in Addison and Hirsch


(1986) while those on firm        profits    are discussed in Becker and Olson (1987).

For union effects on turnover see Mincer (1983) and Freeman and Medoff

(1984).     The turnover studies generally sort out wage and union effects.                 An

alternative approach to this issue is to use panel data in determining the

extent to which the cross—sectional union wage effect is an actual wage

premium as opposed to a return for higher quality workers.                   Mincer (1983) and

Freeman (1984) conclude that half or more of the observed effect is a union

premium.

          9See Pencavel     (1970), Viscusi (1980)      and Allen   (1981)    for evidence on

turnover and absenteeimn effects of wages.

         10For    recent papers   which consider    the effects of   wages on several

employee outcomes and then compare          potential benefits with the costs of        higher

wages see   Raft'   and Summers (1987)     or Leonard (1987).   The former considers

data on the Ford Motor Company before and after the introduction of the "Five—

Dollar Day" in 19iI.        The latter analyzes effects of wages on supervisory

personnel and turnover        in six occupations for a sample    of high—technology

firms.

         11This assumes,      of course,   that estimated union wage effects are not

fully explained by differential union organizing success among highly—skilled

workers.

         12lndustry wage effects (and their relative constancy over time) are

described in Krueger and Summers (1987) and Dickens and Katz (1986).               Intra—

industry wage differences are also considered in Groshen (1985).              Evidence of

firm size effects on wages is provided in Mellow (1980) and Brown and Medoff

(1987) as well.

         13The    1982 wave   of the EOPP Survey was designed at the National Center

for Research on Vocational Education (Ohio State University) and administered

by Gallup,   Inc.

                 would be   possible to use individual instead of firm—level       wages    in
Equations U).        However,   we continue to use firm—level wages, as the focus of

this steady is on wage differentials at that level.             The firm—wide wages also

lessen the problem of       unobserved heterogeneity which      would plague wages at the

individual level.

         15Evidence presented in Hoizer et. al. (1988) shows that firm size

affects the quantity of job applicants received per opening by firms

independently of wages paid.         Assuming that the quantity and quality of the

best applicants are positively correlated, firm size might have independent

effects on the quality of hires as well.

here, but the identical specifications          of right—hand side variables eliminated

80%) report no vacancies.        They will also he used for applicable experience,

where about l0% of the sample reports move.             The use of predicted wage

variables in these equations is an approximation to a fuller treatment of

correlation here between starting and current wages Is about .9, and

 results using both variables are quite similar.

          22See Footnote 15.

          23These results are generally consistent with those of Barron, Bishop

 and Ounkelberg (1985).

       2Industry controls       appear   to affect training independently of the

wage, as F—statistics on these dummies are highly significant in all of the

training equations.

       25arron   et. al use log—odds specifications for the probabilities of

workers receiving each type of training.          Using   continuous as opposed to

discrete training variables, as well as the use of firm—level rather than

individual wages, appear to cause the conflicting results.

       26lndustry dummies are again significant in these outcome equations.

            is important to remember while interpreting the coefficient on

unions that this is a partial effect, controlling for the effects of firm

wages which, in turn, already capture industry,           size and union effects.

       28For computational reasons,        we use 1—digit rather than 2—digit

industry dummies here.    All other instrtsnents and controls are comparable.

       29For instance, defining the dependent variable as one if hiring is

very easy and zero otherwise produces quite comparable results.

       30See,   for instance,    Medoff and Abraham (1981) for evidence that tenure

with the firm may not enhance worker productivity.

            those equations,      I   interpret   employee tenure at the firm as the

change in total experience for that worker.          Experience effects on

productivity scores and on wages as well as productivity scores effects on

wages continue to be positive and significant in those equations, with most

magnitudes remaining quite comparable to those of cross—section estimates,

       32As in the case of vacancy rate equations, the predicted wage variable

is based on the same set of instruments as in all other equations except for

the use of 1—digit dummies.       Controls are comparable as well.




                                             26
         33We   divide    by J for this and all other terms of the equation since our

estimated effects apply only to the last worker hired.                  The estimated effect

of loW on performance ratings is then divided by mean performance and added to

the vacancy rate effect of lnW to obtain the elasticity estimate.                   We use the

OLS rather than tobit estimates of vacancy effects,                  since the former   are more

stable   and plausible in magnitude.

         3If    FH
                     =   l/T   then
                                      dLnFH/d&nW     —dLnT/d&nW, which is simply the

additive inverse of any of the Weibull hazard function coefficients presented

in Table

         35We thus       abstract from direct monetary costs of recruiting.

         36Mean weekly wages in May, 1978 for managers was $322 compared to 231,

175, and 152 for sales, clericals, and service workers respectively who                      are
paid weekly.      Hourly rates are       '4.66,   2.93,   3.72,   and 2.93 respectively. (BLS

Bulletin 2096,       September 1982).      The two—to—one ratio of managerial to non—

managerial wages is thus a reasonable approximation here.

         37See Bishop (1988), who assumes an average class—size of two                  at   formal

training sessions.
