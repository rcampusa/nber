                                              ABSTRACT

        This paper documents the evidence for a productivity based model of the dollar/euro real
exchange rate over the 1985-2001 period. We estimate cointegrating relationships between the real
exchange rate, productivity, and the real price of oil using the Johansen (1988) and Stock-Watson (1993)
procedures. We find that each percentage point in the US-Euro area productivity differential results in a
five percentage point real appreciation of the dollar. This finding is robust to the estimation methodology,
the variables included in the regression, and the sample period. We conjecture that productivity-based
models cannot explain the observed patterns with the standard set of assumptions, and describe a case
in which the model can be reconciled with the observed data.

1 INTRODUCTION

        A commonplace observation is that exchange rates appear to behave in seemingly

inexplicable ways. Even by this standard, the euro’s behavior has confounded most observers’

expectations. Rather than fulfilling expectations of appreciation, the euro spent the better part of

its first two years of existence depreciating against the dollar.

        Many arguments have been forwarded for this trend. They include income surprises (as

signals of revisions in trend productivity growth, in Corsetti and Pesenti, 2000); black market

holdings of euros (Sinn and Westermann, 2001); overly restrictive fiscal policy (Cohen and

Loisel, 2000); and higher equity returns on New Economy assets in the U.S. relative to the Euro

Area, a view common in the financial sector.1

        While it is easy enough to point to trends in one’s favorite variable, it is much more

difficult to pinpoint a statistical correlation that stands up to close scrutiny. In this paper, we

document a robust but inherently puzzling correlation, displayed below in Figure 1.




 Figure 1: Real Dollar/Euro Rate and
 Variable X

   1
      See for instance Rosenberg, 2000; Owen, 2001; van de Craen and Vanden Houte, 2001. The
focus on capital flow composition is consistent with this perspective. See for instance Brooks et
al. (2001).
With the exception of the mid-1980's surge in the dollar’s value, variable X has exhibited a

strong correlation with the synthetic real euro.

        The mysterious “Variable X” in the figure is the Euro area-US log productivity

differential, multiplied by 5.0. Below we document that this correlation is not “spurious” in a

specific statistical sense; in other words the real exchange rate appears to be cointegrated with a

broad productivity differential. Over a number of specifications, sample periods, and estimation

techniques, one finds that each one percentage point increase in the U.S.-Euro area productivity

differential results in between a four to five percent real appreciation in the dollar/euro exchange

rate.

        While this correlation accords with popular explanations linking the New Economy to

asset markets, the magnitude of this correlation is much larger than what is to be expected from

the dominant theoretical model for productivity effects, the Balassa-Samuelson model. Similarly,

the neoclassical models of Lucas (1982) and Stockman (1980) that comprise the other major

competing paradigm typically do not predict a real exchange rate appreciation in response to a

productivity shock.

        In this paper, we propose the following reconciliation of our findings with theory. Faster

productivity growth can increase U.S. aggregate demand through two channels, consumption and

investment. Forward looking consumers increase consumption due to expectations of higher

future income and higher productivity increases expected future profits, raising investment

demand (Bailey, Millard, and Wells, 2001). We focus on the former effect in Ricardian

framework and argue that U.S. demand for domestic goods is so high due to wealth effects that it

overwhelms the downward pressure higher productivity exerts upon the terms of trade.


                                                   2
Consequently, on net the real exchange rate appreciates.

       This paper proceeds in the following manner. In Section 2, data preliminaries are

discussed, and a possible theoretical explanation forwarded. In section 3, the econometric

methodology is discussed. The empirical estimates and out-of-sample performance of the models

are examined in Section 4. Some concluding remarks are included in Section 5.



2. Patterns and Hypotheses

       The path of the real dollar/euro exchange rate is presented in Figure 2. Two measures are

used as price deflators: the CPI and the PPI. Interpretation of these movements is complicated by

the obvious fact that the euro is a recent innovation so that pre-1999 trends have to be proxied by

movements in the synthetic euro. Abstracting from this complication, we observe that the

dollar/euro exchange rate has been characterized by two large swings: the mid-1980's dollar

spike and the current dollar surge. Over this long span, movements in the CPI or PPI deflated

Dollar/Euro Exchange Rate




                                                 3
exchange rate are largely the same.2

       While we have data extending back to 1980/81 for Euro Area GDP and productivity, we

decided to focus on the post-1984 sample, largely because none of our candidate variables is able

to explain the rise and fall in the dollar during the middle of the 1980's. Thus, we do not have

anything to add to the debate over the mid-1980's mystery of “the dazzling dollar”.3

       Our first observation is that there is no apparent trend in the real exchange rate (Table 1).

Of course, the real exchange rate fails to reject a unit root test, so even if an apparently

significant correlation were obtained, it would not necessarily be meaningful.

       As mentioned earlier, GDP growth is one factor that has often been viewed as important.

Using GDP data extending back to 1985q1, one finds that there is an apparently substantial

elasticity of the real rate with respect to the GDP differential of approximately -1.7. This finding

appears to validate the conjecture that income differentials are key to the euro weakness. In

addition, higher anticipated asset returns in the U.S. are thought to be correlated with this gap.

The theoretical link between profitability and the exchange rate is made explicit by Bailey,

Millard, and Wells (2001), who argue that an increase in productivity raises future expected

profits, raising equity prices and stimulating investment. This additional investment can be

financed by capital inflows, enabling domestic residents to finance the additional investment

demand without forgoing current consumption. These effects are consistent with other aspects of



   2
   Although as noted in Chinn and Alquist (2000), the PPI deflated dollar/euro rate over the
more recent period has exhibited more evidence of stationarity.
   3
    The title of Frankel’s (1985) article on the dollar. The correlation between the real rate and
productivity differentials that we identify holds up in regressions over a sample extending back to
1980q1, although the cointegration test results are ambiguous.

                                                   4
the “New Economy” explanation of the appreciation of the dollar with respect to the euro

(Meredith, 2001). This explanation argues that high returns on U.S. investments have attracted

large foreign inflows of capital, which in turn have appreciated the dollar through capital account

effects.

           In the next column, we examine a perennial favorite for proxying productivity effects in

the Balassa-Samuelson framework: the relative nontraded-traded price differential. An apparently

strong relation is detected. Each one percentage point increase in the intercountry nontraded-

traded price differential results in a 5.3 percent real appreciation.

           Economy-wide productivity differentials also appear to have a strong impact on the

dollar/euro rate. In this case, the elasticity is -4.4, that is, a one percentage point increase in the

U.S.-euro area productivity differential results in a 4.4 percent appreciation.

           In the final column, we present the results of an OLS regression with government

spending to GDP ratio as the independent variable. There is apparently only a weak relationship

between government spending and the real exchange rate. Assuming government spending falls

predominantly on non-tradables, the government spending to GDP ratio possesses the correct

sign. As the paper subsequently documents, other procedures couched in terms of a long-run

relationship fail to detect a strong correlation between the real exchange rate and government

spending.

           The correlation between the real exchange rate and the two productivity measure provides

the puzzle that this paper addresses: why does productivity matter so much? In most

productivity-based models, productivity increases yield appreciations of a magnitude comparable

to the share of nontradables in the aggregate basket. Literally, this means that the coefficient on


                                                    5
productivity should be bounded in absolute value between zero and one (see the discussion in

Chinn, 1997), which makes it difficult to appeal to measurement error in explaining this finding.

Even assuming that both the relative price variable and the broad productivity indices

mismeasure the relevant tradable/nontradable productivity differential, the observed elasticity is

still more than four times the expected magnitude.4 The situation is even worse when one

considers competing productivity based models. In the Lucas (1982) and Stockman (1980)

models, productivity increases reduce the relative price of home goods, and hence under the

simplest assumptions regarding preferences, lead to real depreciations of the currency. Similarly,

models in the Ricardian framework (Dornbusch, Fischer, and Samuelson, 1977) suggest that

productivity increases lead to depreciations in the home currency.

       To see why this is necessarily true, consider a world with an infinite number of

differentiated goods. The set of goods produced at home, versus abroad, is defined by relative

labor productivity levels; the relative wage rate is endogenously determined in conjunction with

the relative labor demand curve. The solution is straightforward when utility is Cobb-Douglas

and consumption of goods is proportional to income, which ensures that trade is balanced.

       In Figure 3, the A schedule depicts relative unit labor costs across a continuum of goods,

ordered from highest to lowest. The B schedule shows demand across these goods. Equilibrium

as depicted in Figure 3 is determined by the intersection of the two schedules. 0 to z1 products are

produced at home, while z1 to z4 are produced in the foreign country. The relative wage rate is



   4
     Consider what happens if a = "aN + (1-") aT, where N (T) denotes nontradable (tradable)
sectors, and a is productivity. Then for " = 0.5, and with the correlation between a and aT
selected to maximize the estimated coefficient, the probability limit of the regression coefficient
on aggregate productivity in a regression of the real exchange rate on productivity is 1.

                                                 6
given by w/w*. This relative wage rate is also the real exchange rate, given the model’s Ricardian

structure.

        An increase in productivity across the board would be represented by an upward shift of

the entire A schedule, resulting in an increase in home relative wages. Since the B(z) curve slopes

upward, the increase in equilibrium relative wages is smaller than the effect of the productivity

increase.5 This means the price of home goods falls and implies a real depreciation, an outcome

that runs counter to what has been observed.

        If, on the other hand, the productivity growth occurs only in the U.S. there is a kinked

shift up of the A schedule to A’. Income increases without changing relative wages and the real

exchange rate. One could interpret the advent of the New Economy in this way. As documented

by Gust and Marquez (2000), the pickup in labor productivity appears to be largely restricted to

the U.S., and has yet to diffuse to the rest of the OECD countries.




   5
    If the B(z) curve is vertical, the increase in equilibrium relative wages exactly offsets the
change in productivity.

       This leaves the appreciation, not merely the strength, of the dollar over the past half

decade unexplained. The dollar has been rising on a trade weighted basis and against the euro

since early 1995. Tille, Stoffels, and Gorbachev (2001) provide an empirical analysis of the effect

of productivity on the euro-dollar rate over three decades using annual OECD data. They find

that the Balassa-Samuelson effect accounts for an approximately 1% per year depreciation of the

real exchange rate for the 1990s, or about two-thirds of the 1.8% annual depreciation of the real

euro-dollar rate over the decade. Clearly the magnitude of the effect of productivity on the real

exchange rate documented above is much larger than theoretical considerations warrant. As

Meredith (2001) points out, taking the results of Tille, Stoffels, and Gorbachev at face value, one

would expect a cumulative real appreciation of the dollar of around 5% from 1995 onwards.

Instead the euro lost about 42% of its real value between 1995 and the end of the decade.


                                                 8
       To reconcile the euro’s depreciation with the Dornbusch-Fischer-Samuelson model, one

has to drop the assumption that preferences are homothetic. Instead, one needs to argue that there

has been a shift in demand toward U.S. goods, interpreted in the diagram as a shift downward in

the B schedule. This is a more difficult case to sustain, as the late 1990's have been marked by

large trade deficits. However, these could be rationalized to some extent by wealth effects

omitted from the Ricardian model.

       As any reader of the current literature on the New Economy and the strength of the dollar

knows, none of these ideas is new in themselves. Rather, we believe it is useful to categorize

some of the many – not necessarily internally consistent – ideas in a framework that is

recognizable to economists. We now move to documenting formally the correlation between

productivity and the real exchange rate.



3 ECONOMETRIC METHODOLOGY

       Two approaches are used in estimating long-run relationships. The first is the Johansen

(1988) and Johansen and Juselius (1990) maximum likelihood approach which allows for

multiple cointegrating vectors. The other approach is the dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS)

approach of Stock and Watson (1993). The two sets of estimates are used to check for the

robustness of the results. On the basis of monte carlo simulation experiments, Stock and Watson

report that although the maximum likelihood estimates obtained from the Johansen technique are

unbiased, the estimates are also more dispersed than those provided by alternative estimators,

such as those obtained from DOLS. In particular, although the DOLS estimates are biased, they

have a smaller mean squared error.


                                                 9
3.1 The Johansen Maximum Likelihood Approach

       Let xt be a m × 1 vector of I(1) variables. Then one can estimate the VAR(p):

                                                                                                    (1)



where '1, '2, ... 'p-1, and A are m × m matrices of unknown parameters, zt is a s × 1 vector of I(0)

variables (such as time trends) and u is distributed N(0,E). The matrix A is estimated by the

Johansen maximum likelihood procedure subject to the hypothesis that A has reduced rank (i.e., r

< m). This hypothesis is written:

                                                                                                    (2)



where " and ß are m × r matrices. If r < m then under certain conditions the ß'xt is stationary (i.e.,

the elements of x are cointegrated).

       There are two tests proposed by Johansen, and described in greater detail in Johansen and

Juselius (1990). The trace statistic for testing H(r) against H(m) is given by:



                                                                                                    (3)



where 1 is the vector of parameters, and the 8's are the solution of a determinantal equation

involving residuals from a regression of x on first difference terms.

       The maximal eigenvalue statistic for testing H(r-1) against H(r) is given by


                                                                                                    (4)



                                                 10
The asymptotic critical values for the case where trends are allowed in the cointegrating vector

but not in the data generating process are drawn from Osterwald-Lenum (1992). Cheung and Lai

(1993) have shown that finite sample critical values may be more appropriate given the relatively

small samples which are generally under study.6 Results for both sets of critical values are

reported below.

3.2 The Dynamic OLS Approach

        Stock and Watson propose a OLS-based estimator for cointegrating relations, which has

desirable properties under the conditions that (i) the system is triangular and (ii) there is only one

cointegrating relationship.

        Let xt represent a m-dimensional time series, the elements of which are I(1). Suppose

E()xt) = 0, and the m × r matrix of r cointegrating vectors is " = (-1, Ir)' , where 1 is the r × (m-

r) submatrix of unknown parameters to be estimated. The triangular representation for xt is:




                                                                                                                 (5)




where xt is partitioned as (xt1, xt2), xt1 is (m-r) × 1 and xt2 is r × 1, and vt = (vt1, vt2)' is a stationary

stochastic process.

        The dynamic OLS estimator is obtained by running the regression:


   6
     The finite sample critical values are obtained by adjusting the asymptotic critical values for
the loss of degrees of freedom due to the estimation of the parameters describing the short term
dynamics. The adjustment factor is given by (N - (p × m))/N > 1, where N is the number of
observations. More directly, the finite sample critical values can be calculated from their
equation 11 and the coefficient estimates in Table 1. See Cheung and Lai (1993) for details.

                                                      11
                                                                                                    (6)



The leads and lags of the difference terms serve to orthogonalize the error term associated with

the dependent variable.

         The requirement of recursiveness will not be particularly onerous in the current context

since the right hand side variables (such as GDP and labor productivity) can plausibly be

interpreted as exogenous.




4 EMPIRICAL RESULTS

4.1 Data

         The data are quarterly in frequency, for the period 1985q1-2001q4. The real exchange

rate is calculated using consumer price indices. GDP figures are in real constant 1995 units for

the euro area and chain weighted 1996 units for the United States. The government spending

variable is the log of real government spending minus log real GDP. (Greater detail on the data

sources and variable construction can be found in the Data Appendix.). The predicted negative

sign on government spending is conditional on most government spending falling upon domestic

goods.

         Quarterly data on Euro area economy-wide labor productivity levels are calculated from

the ECB growth rates for GDP per worker reported in the ECB Monthly Bulletin, while those




                                                 12
from the U.S. are the standard non-farm business sector series reported by the BEA.7 Oil prices

are measured by the world price in dollars deflated by the U.S. CPI from International Financial

Statistics.

        The two measures of productivity differ across the regions. The Euro Area productivity

variable is a per worker series which includes all of GDP (agriculture, public sector), while the

U.S. series pertains largely to the private sector, and is calculated on a per hour basis. This

difference may be problematic if there are trend differences in the behavior of GDP/worker and

private sector/hour series. The two series will also tend to diverge during cyclical peaks and

troughs.

        The problems associated with using different productivity measures are illustrated in an

OECD study (Scarpetta, et al., 2000) which demonstrates that one’s conclusion about U.S.

productivity growth in the 1990s is potentially sensitive to the measure used to assess U.S.

performance. In particular, the performance of U.S. productivity growth looks less striking when

compared with Europe’s if GDP per hour worked is used as opposed to GDP per employee.

However, the authors of this study nevertheless partially attribute U.S. growth performance to the

productivity improvements in the information and communication technology sector and suggest that

the diffusion of these technologies to other industries contributed to the strong output and

productivity growth in the U.S. during the 1990s. In any event, the OECD study employs annual

productivity data, whereas ours is unique in that it uses quarterly data. To the extent that we are

mainly concerned with long-run relationships, the problems associated with using the different


   7
    It might be argued that average labor productivity is tainted by demand effects (labor
hoarding, etc.) However, the virtue of couching the analysis in terms of cointegration is that one
can sidestep such issues.

                                                 13
measures may be mitigated. Until comparable quarterly productivity data for the U.S. and the Euro

Area become available, we are constrained by the data at hand.

        Unit root tests were performed on all the relevant variables. The results of these tests are

reported in Appendix Table A1. No series rejected the unit root null using ADF tests at the 5% level,

except for the real government spending differential and real oil prices. Hence, we proceed assuming

the relevant series are I(1). As indicated below, the estimated system that includes the real

government spending differential implies the relevant variables are stationary, although the large

effect of the productivity differential on the real exchange rate still stands out.



4.2 Cointegration Results

        The maximum likelihood results are presented in Table 2. Using the 5% asymptotic critical

values, there appears to be evidence for at least one cointegrating vector in the system of real

exchange rates and (log) productivity differentials. These conclusions are unchanged if a time trend

in the data generating process is allowed for. The elasticity of the real exchange rate with respect to

the differential is -5.1, regardless of whether a time trend is assumed in the cointegrating vector or

not. Inclusion of oil prices (columns 3 and 4) yields similar though slightly lower estimates of this

elasticity, although oil prices themselves do not appear to be an important determinant of the real

exchange rate and the Johansen procedure fails to identify a cointegrating relationship between the

variables when the finite sample critical values are used.

        We compare the results using (log) GDP differentials in place of productivity (columns 5

and 6). The Johansen procedure indicates an absence of cointegration, although higher U.S. income

is associated overall with a stonger dollar, which conforms to the conventional wisdom about the


                                                  14
recent behavior of the euro. Hence, it appears that the long run relationship between output and the

real exchange rate is not robust, although a short run relation in growth rates might still hold.

        Finally, we augment the productivity equation with government spending (columns 7 and 8)

and find that although government spending has the expected negative sign, it is not statistically

significant and the Johansen procedure fails to detect a long-run relationship between the variables.

The effect of productivity on the real exchange rate remains large, however.

        As Stock and Watson have pointed out, the DOLS estimator exhibits less dispersion than the

Johansen estimator. Hence, we also examine the estimates obtained using their procedure. The

DOLS estimates for eight specifications are presented in Table 3. In contrast to some other studies

(Chinn, 1997), the productivity coefficient estimates are similar to those obtained using the Johansen

procedure: -4.4 to -4.8 (in columns 1-4). The price of oil enters with the expected sign, although it

is significant only in the specification including a time trend.

        In columns 5 and 6, the productivity differential is replaced with the GDP differential. One

finds that the estimated relationship is insensitive to the inclusion of a time trend, suggesting that the

correlation in levels is not spurious. This is a surprising pattern of results, given the failure to detect

cointegration for the exchange rate-GDP pair using the Johansen procedure.

        In columns 7 and 8, we present the results of the productivity equation with government

spending included. We find evidence of three cointegrating vectors, even when using finite sample

critical values. One interpretation is that the Johansen procedure is detecting the stationarity of the

government spending differential and real oil prices, hinted by the univariate tests. Perhaps this is

why we fail to identify a close relationship between the real exchange rate and government

spending. The the effect of the productivity differential remains large (approximately -2 to -3) and


                                                    15
statistically significant.

        It is of interest to compare these results with those obtained by some other recent studies. In

particular, the very strong effect of productivity on output is rather remarkable, although not unheard

of. Applying the Johansen procedure to annual data from 1960 to 1991, Strauss (1996) estimated

tradable/nontradable productivity elasticities of between -1.2 to -8.7. However, these results pertain

to OECD countries in general, rather than the constituent currencies of the euro, or the synthetic

euro.

        In analyses of the synthetic euro, Makrydakis et al. (2000) identified an elasticity of between

-0.95 and -1.21 over the 1980-1999 period, where productivity is measured by aggregate GDP

divided by employment. Alberola, Cervero, Lopez and Ubide (1999) identifies a smaller (in absolute

value) elasticity of -1.64, as does Koen, Boone, de Serres and Fuchs (2001) for the real effective

euro, but not for the dollar/euro exchange rate.8 In more recent work, Maeso-Fernandez, Osbat and

Schnatz (2001), obtain an elasticity of -5.1 in a specification similar to ours.



4.3 Implied Equilibrium Values

        The parameter estimates obtained from the constrained specification are economically quite

large. They indicate that a 1% increase in US productivity induces approximately a 5% real

appreciation in the dollar relative to the euro. Using this parameter9, an estimate of the long-run real


   8
    The somewhat lower impact may be attributed to the fact that the productivity variable is
measured as GDP/worker, a variable more likely to be comove with GDP than with labor
productivity as measured by output per hour. The GDP/employee elasticities are very similar to
our GDP elasticities of -1.7 to -3.1 in columns 5 and 6 of Table 3.
   9
     The actual specification conforms to that reported in Table 3, column 3. This assumes a
fairly small oil price elasticity of -0.05.

                                                  16
exchange rate is generated. This estimate is illustrated in Figure 4.




Figure 4: Actual and Equilibrium Real
Dollar/Euro Rate


       Interestingly, this calculation suggests that the current value of the euro is slightly above its

equilibrium value. As of 2001q1, our model implies an equilibrium exchange rate of 0.85 $/euro,

while the actual average value was 0.92 $/euro, a gap of 8%. This estimated disequilibrium is larger

than that identified in other studies, but the estimated gaps will necessarily differ according to their

reference period, and the underlying economic model.

        There are few other studies estimating the equilibrium in 2001q1. Fels and Yilmaz (2001)

use a behavioral equilibrium exchange rate (BEER) model incorporating productivity and real

interest differentials and the real price of oil. They conclude that the euro was approximately at the

equilibrium value of 0.95 dollars/euro at the beginning of 2001.

        One potential criticism of our approach is that the estimate of the dollar/euro equilibrium

value may merely be incorporating a fragile correlation between the dollar/euro rate and productivity

differentials that has become increasingly pronounced in the past few years, and that might dissipate

in the near term. While it is not possible to determine ahead of time whether this relationship will


                                                  17
hold in the future as strongly as in the recent past, it is possible to determine whether using pre-1998

data would have led to drastically different results. Using the 1986-98 sample, one would have

obtained a 15% misalignment, instead of the 8% indicated using the entire sample.10 This

discrepancy arises because of the smaller elasticity (-2.7 versus -5.0) and the effect of oil prices.11

Hence, the productivity trends of 1999 and 2000 are not driving our estimates.



6. CONCLUSIONS

        This paper has documented the evidence in support of a stable long-run relationship between

the real dollar/euro exchange rate, productivity differentials, and the real price of oil. Productivity

differentials enter into to the relationship in a robust, although unexpected, manner. Productivity has

too large an effect to be rationalized within the Balassa-Samuelson framework, and it possesses the

incorrect sign for simple versions of two-good neoclassical or Ricardian models. Thus, one needs

to incorporate additional assumptions. We believe the key required assumption is that spending falls

disproportionately on domestic goods – an assumption commonplace in ad hoc macroeconometric

models, but often omitted in neoclassical models for the sake of tractability. Higher income, and

expectations of higher income, induce a disproportionate increase in spending on domestic goods,

thereby causing an appreciation of the home currency (the dollar in this case) when a depreciation


   10
      This specification incorporates elasticities of -2.7 for the productivity differential and -0.03
for oil prices. As one shortens the sample, the productivity elasticity declines in absolute value,
and the implied misalignment increases.
   11
     Several studies refer to the end of 1999. Clostermann and Schnatz (2000) estimate a
misalignment of approximately 8%, while Chinn and Alquist (2000) find a 15% misalignment,
based on historical correlations from a monetary model. Using our specification with
productivity and oil prices for a sample extending up to 2000q4, the euro was some 4%
undervalued at the end of 1999/beginning of 2000.

                                                  18
would be predicted on the basis of only supply side effects.

        In terms of prospects for the dollar/euro rate, the productivity based model that we use is best

thought of as a means of assessing the direction of the dollar/euro rate conditional upon a given trend

in US-euro area productivity differential. Unfortunately, there is considerable uncertainty about the

future path of this trend. Even before the events of September 11th, it was apparent that the Euro area

growth was unable to transcend the limits encountered in previous expansions, although there is no

clear reason why “New Economy” opportunities should remain confined to the United States. Thus,

while the approximately 1.5 percentage point productivity differential in favor of the U.S. observed

over the 1995-2000 period is unlikely to be sustained, it is also plausible that a positive productivity

differential might persist even as the U.S. economy enters into a recession.12 If this is the case, the

long run value of the euro may continue to decline, although cyclical and portfolio balance factors

associated with recent events may obscure that trend.

the 5% critical values adjusted for sample size as per Cheung and Lai (1993). The
numbers in brackets [.] are the implied number of vectors using the asymptotic
critical values from Osterwald-Lenum (1990). Coefficients are the parameters from
the estimated cointegrating vector, normalized on the real exchange rate. If zero
vectors are indicated, the estimated cointegrating vector is calculated assuming
one cointegrating vector. Lag length is determined by the Akaike Information
Criterion (AIC). The AIC picks one lag in levels and thus no lags in the VECM for
the regressions in columns 3, 4, 7, and 8. In these cases, we augment the VECM
with one lag in first differences.
