The Power of Asking: How Communication Affects Selfishness, Empathy, and Altruism

                                           ABSTRACT

To understand the “pure” incentives of altruism, economic laboratory research on humans almost always
forbids communication between subjects. In reality, however, altruism usually requires interaction
between givers and receivers, which clearly must influence choices. Charities, for example, speak
of the “power of asking.” Indeed, evolutionary theories of altruism are built on human sociality. We
experimentally examine communication in which one subject allocates $10 between herself and a
receiver, and systematically altered who in the pair could speak. We found that any time the recipient
spoke, giving increased – asking is powerful. But when only allocators could speak, choices were
significantly more selfish than any other condition. When empathy was heightened by putting allocators
“in the receivers shoes,” altruism appeared as if recipients had been able to ask, even when they were
silent. We conclude that communication dramatically influences altruistic behavior, and appears to
largely work by heightening empathy.

1    Introduction
    Laboratory experiments on altruism have almost exclusively studied subjects in isolation from social
interaction in order to protect anonymity and identify “pure” incentives to give. Yet in the real world giving
occurs in the context of a social interaction between giver and receiver and the incentives to give are affected
by the social factors surrounding this interaction. A common finding is that most subjects exhibit significant
altruism and inequity aversion (Fehr and Schmidt, 1999; Bolton and Ockenfels, 2000). Recent work has
linked these preferences to brain activity (in areas associated with rewards) arguing in favor of “hardwired
egalitarianism” (Tricomi et al., 2010). However, in the United States and other industrialized countries there
is vast inequality in consumption, while charitable giving is only 1-2% of income (Andreoni, 2006). How
can we reconcile a taste for equality with behavior that indicates people generally tolerate a great deal of
inequality in their daily lives? In this paper we argue that while humans do have a strong capacity to behave
altruistically, selfishness typically predominates. Furthermore, social cues have evolved so that altruism is
not expressed indiscriminately, but rather is likely to be expressed when it is instrumental in serving other
selfish (or imperfectly altruistic) ends.
    To test this hypothesis, we use a subtle manipulation of a single social factor: verbal communication.
Communication is a natural social cue because it forms the backbone of the interaction between giver and
receiver. Indeed a leading theory on the origins of verbal communication is that it arose out of gestural com-
munication to facilitate mutually beneficial coordinative acts (Grice, 1957; Tomasello, 2008). Furthermore,
verbal communication typically entails recursive belief formation about the subject matter and language
conventions. In Experiment 1 of our study, we used the Dictator Game (DG) and systematically altered
who in the pair (one, both and the order) could send a message. We find that in the condition in which only
the allocator could speak, only 6% of the endowment was donated, which was significantly lower than the
no-communication baseline of 15%. This is the condition in which roles were most asymmetric in the social
interaction. In stark contrast, anytime the recipient spoke, at least 24% of the endowment was passed —
asking is indeed powerful. Interestingly, giving was highest in the conditions that involved two-way com-
munication. In these conditions 30% of the endowment was passed on average, even when the allocator was
first to speak.
    To help understand verbal expression and motivations, third-party reviewers performed textual analysis.
We find that content of the messages from allocators significantly depended on the presence of an “ask.”
For instance, fairness was significantly more likely to be spoken about in the presence of an ask, whereas
luck was significantly less likely. Interestingly, the content did not differ based on whether the allocator was
responding directly to an ask, or sending a message knowing they would receive a reply before they made
their final allocation decision. In the latter condition allocators did a good job of “anticipating the ask” (the
modal ask focused on fairness and equal division) and tailored their message appropriately. Conversely, in
the one-way communication condition in which only allocators spoke, messages were one-sixth as likely to
mention fairness and typically offered an apology.
    The results of Experiment 1 are stark. When only the allocator could speak, he typically was very
selfish and issued a hollow apology, but the apologetic “blocking mechanism” was not employed in the


                                                       2
presence of an ask; in this case allocators’ messages displayed more of an understanding of the other’s
position. This finding, along with recent findings in the neuroeconomics literature linking areas of the brain
associated with communication and social contexts with empathic concern (De Vignemont and Singer, 2006;
Decety and Jackson, 2006; Moll et al., 2006; Hare et al., 2010) led us to hypothesize that communication
from a recipient facilitates altruism through feelings of empathy. In Experiment 2 empathy was heightened
by putting allocators “in the receivers shoes.” Experiment 2 used modified version of the two conditions
involving one-way communication in Experiment 1. Before roles were determined, all subjects filled out
a decision form for each role. Then roles were randomly determined and unused decision forms were set
aside. In the condition in which only the allocator could speak, the allocations and verbal content appeared
as if recipients had been able to ask. Making choices from the position of both roles and being subjected to
a verbal request led to nearly identical pass distributions. Our interpretation is that asking leads the allocator
the actively consider and identify with the role of the recipient; we call this feeling “empathy.”1 However,
there are limits in terms of the associated effects on giving. In both experiments, requests for more than
equal division (“selfish requests”) lead to average pass levels significantly below the baseline.2
       There is considerable evidence that feelings of empathy are strongly connected to altruistic and pro-
social behavior (Batson et al., 1988; Batson, 2002; De Vignemont and Singer, 2006; Preston and de Waal,
2002). The “empathy-altruism hypothesis” posits that feelings of empathy are the primary explanation for
altruistic acts for which the agent does not expect to receive compensating material benefits through reci-
procity or the absence of sanctions. Laboratory experiments have found that altruistic behavior is promoted
through the reduction of social distance (Roth, 1995; Hoffman et al., 1996; Bohnet and Frey, 1999) and
making potential victims of selfishness more identifiable (Schelling, 1968; Small and Loewenstein, 2003).3
However, recent work has argued that selfish concerns such as guilt aversion (Charness and Dufwenberg,
2006; Battigalli and Dufwenberg, 2007) and self-image maintenance through self-signaling (Bodner and Pr-
elec, 2003) and self-deception (Dana et al., 2007) can help explain seemingly altruistic behavior. Although
the idea has not received explicit attention in the literature, it indeed it may be the case that empathy operates
through these channels. For example, it may raise the cost of self-deception.4 In Section 4 we discuss this
possibility.
       Given the economic and social importance of altruistic behavior, several theories have been proposed
to explain the origins and evolution of altruism and cooperation in humans. Leading theories include kin
selection (Hamilton, 1964), reciprocity (Nowak and Sigmund, 2005; Trivers, 1971) and norm adherence
through sanctions (Gurerk et al., 2006; Fehr and Gächter, 2002; De Quervain et al., 2004). These theories
provide a sound theoretical backbone for the existence of altruistic behavior in the human psychological
composition and can help explain why people are often generous in situations in which the conditions of
the theories are not met (e.g. acts of altruism towards non-kin, in the absence of reciprocity/sanctions or
   1
      In a formal model, one could define empathy as inversely proportional to the variance of one’s belief about another’s expecta-
tions.
    2
      Rankin (2006) also finds this result for numerical requests.
    3
      Laboratory work has also demonstrated that altruism can be elicited through self-interest related channels. Examples include
monetary rewards/punishment (Gurerk et al., 2006; Fehr and Fischbacher, 2003), emotion-based rewards/punishment (Masclet
et al., 2003) and appealing to subjects’ desire to maintain a positive social image (Andreoni and Bernheim, 2009).

                                                                 3
one-time gifts to strangers). However, they rely in two important ways on the fact that humans are a social
species. First, the social nature of human interaction allows for the underlying theoretical mechanisms to
function (for instance communication allows for reputation building and reciprocity). Tomasello (2008)
shows that the differences in altruism between great apes (which exhibit effectively no pure altruism) and
humans can be be linked to humans’ advanced social capacities such as verbal communication. Secondly,
the theories rely on humans to respond to social cues so that they are not indiscriminately altruistic and
hence perish quickly.
        Neuroimaging studies provide support for both points. The evidence indicates that the human brain
is wired so that the decision processes underlying altruistic behavior and socialization are strongly linked
(Harbaugh et al., 2007; Moll et al., 2006; Hare et al., 2001). In addition to the neural evidence, the reasoning
underlying our argument that communication affects empathy and elicits altruism rests on a unique feature
of human communication known as “recursive mindreading” or “role imitation reversal” (Hare et al., 2001;
Akhtar et al., 1996). That is, in any dyad, person 1’s communicative acts depend critically on 1’s beliefs
concerning person 2’s beliefs and 2s beliefs about 1s beliefs, and so on. In economics, this is the familiar
notion of iterative belief formation, which underlies game theoretic solution concepts.5 This recursively
structured belief formation helps establish the “joint attentional frame” necessary for effective, high level
communication (Clark, 1992).
        In Experiment 1, communication from recipients, regardless of the order of who spoke, led to a “conver-
sation” more likely to be centered around fairness and more generous behavior. This is surprising in that the
content of requests is quite predictable; one would presumably expect a message center around fairness and
a numerical request for equal division and this is exactly the modal message. Despite the predictability of
the request, allocators in the condition in which only they got to speak behaved more selfishly than the base-
line and sent messages centered around luck or apology — “asking for the obvious” matters. Experiment 2
indicates that it matters through the elicitation of empathy associated with the belief formation necessary for
communication. In the discussion section we explore the possibility that empathy affects behavior through
self-interested channels such as guilt aversion and self-deception.
        The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 presents the experimental design, Section 3
provides the results, Section 4 contains a discussion and Section 5 concludes.


2        Experimental Design
        In order to test our hypothesis that verbal communication has evolved to mediate the expression of
altruism, we manipulated the communication available to subjects playing a modified version of the dictator
game (DG). The DG is regarded as the standard decision task to study altruism in experimental economics
(Forsythe et al., 1994; Andreoni and Miller, 2002). In the baseline version of the game, two subjects share
100 money units (MUs). MUs are always worth $0.10 to all subjects. One subject is randomly assigned the
role of allocator and the other is assigned the role of receiver. The allocator initially holds all 100 MUs and
    5
     In fact, behavioral models of bounded rationality, such as level-k thinking, arrive at new equilibria by limiting the number of
iterative steps, see for instance Crawford and Iriberri (2007).



                                                                 4
        Figure 1: Decision form in which the recipient first sent request (Ask or Ask then Explain)



makes the decision of how many MUs pass to the receiver, without communication between subjects. The
allocator’s decision is final and completely determines monetary payoffs.
   We conducted two experiments building on the baseline DG without communication. Experiment 1
included 238 subjects who played two rounds of the DG with different anonymous partners. Roles remained
constant across rounds. In addition to the baseline DG were four conditions that allowed subjects, to varying
degrees, to communicate via written verbal and numerical messages. Communication was always optional
and free form.
   In condition “Ask”’ (A), the receiver wrote a verbal message along with a numerical “pass request,”
which the allocator read before making the pass decision. After the allocator made the pass decision the
receiver was informed of the payoffs for the game. In “Explain” (E), the allocator sent a written verbal
message along with the pass decision, however the receiver stayed silent. In “Ask then Explain” (AE), the
receiver first sent a verbal message and numerical request and then the allocator recorded the pass choice
accompanied by a verbal reply message. In “Explain then Ask” (EA) the allocator first sent a verbal message
along with a “non-binding allocation,” the receiver then responded with a verbal and numerical request, after
which the allocator determined final payoffs. The breakdown of subjects across condition was: Baseline 40,
A 40, E 40, AE 80 and EA 38.
   The subjects were not given any suggestions regarding the content of the messages; the only restriction
prohibited the inclusion of identifying information or promises external to the laboratory. Anonymity was
maintained in order to identify the effect of communication without confounding factors, such as reputation
outside of the experiment, which are known to influence behavior in the DG (Roth, 1995). All instructions
are available in the appendix. Figure 1 provides an example decision form.
   Our secondary hypothesis is that communication from the recipient leads the allocator to consider the
recipient’s position more fully and this empathic consideration induces altruistic behavior. To directly test


                                                     5
this hypothesis, Experiment 2 used augmented versions of A and E in which feelings of empathy were
intentionally heightened. Before roles were determined, all subjects filled out decision forms for the first
stage of both the A and E versions of the DG. One form (E) placed the subject in the role of allocator and
the other (A) the role of receiver. For each version, the subjects were assigned different counterparts and we
made this clear to the subjects in the instructions. The intent was to lead the subjects to “put themselves in
the other’s shoes,” while maintaining one-way communication. After the Stage 1 decisions were made, role
were randomly determined and we set aside the A forms from allocators and E forms from receivers. The
remaining forms were then used to determine monetary payoffs. 40 subjects played a single round in this
manner. It is important to note that despite filling out decisions for each role, each subject played only one
role, which always involved one-way communication.


3        Results
Experiment 1 Results
        Figure 2 presents mean amounts passed in Experiment 1 (panel A) and the fraction of all pass amounts
equal to zero and to equal division on the right (panel B). The evidence is clear. Both the existence and struc-
ture of communication significantly influenced allocators’ expressed altruism. In the no-communication
baseline, allocators passed an average of 15.3 MUs. In E, allocators gave significantly less than the base-
line (Wilcoxon rank-sum z = −2.73, p < 0.006), chose fewer equal divisions (t = −2.33, p < 0.025,
two-tailed t-test, standard errors clustered by subject) and more zeros (p < 0.007). Conversely, in the two-
way communication conditions (AE, EA) allocators’ transfer greatly exceeded the baseline (AE: z = 3.29,
p < 0.001, EA: z = 2.04, p < 0.041). Giving in A was higher than the baseline and the difference becomes
significant when we only consider requests for an even division or less (z = 1.965, p < 0.049). A full
comparison of conditions is given in Appendix Table 2.
        In the conditions in which allocators “spoke” first, giving was very much a function of whether the
communication was one-way (E) or two-way (AE, EA). Passes were on average over four and half times
higher in EA than in E (EA mean= 27.0, E mean= 6.5; z = 4.28, p < 0.0001), while equal division was
ten times more likely (t = 3.69, p < 0.0004). In fact, the mean of the non-binding allocation from the first
round of communication in EA was 25.8, far exceeding the mean pass in E (z = 4.41, p < 0.0001).6
        Table 1 examines whether the content of subjects’ written communication was associated with pass
behavior. Each message was evaluated for content by seven undergraduate reviewers (gender balanced to
match the subject pool) who had no prior knowledge of the study. The communication items are intended
to capture the basic content of a message. A message can fall into more than one category, or none at all. In
a majority of cases, reviewer opinion was unanimous. In the remaining cases, the average rating was used.
The instructions to reviewers are contained in the appendix.
        The statistical tests in Table 1 compare communication in the two-way conditions to their one-way coun-
terpart. Overall, allocator communication varied in ways consistent with the expressed altruism. Allocators

    Although the means of the non-binding and final allocation in EA are not significantly different from each other, there is a
significant majority of subjects shaded slightly up.

in EA and AE were more likely to express fairness and less likely to express remorse than allocators in
E. These differences are large in magnitude and highly significant. Receivers’ written messages (requests)
varied by condition as well, while the numerical request did not. Receivers were significantly less likely to
communicate flattery and acknowledge the allocator’s power in the two-way conditions. These differences
are most likely due to the more balanced nature of two-way communication. Unsurprisingly, the modal
request in all conditions expressed fairness and called for an equal division. Also, the likelihood of using
verbal communication at all was significantly higher in the two-way conditions.
       Across conditions, allocators who expressed fairness behaved far more altruistically (n = 48, mean pass
= 40.21) than those who did not (n = 110, mean = 16.04, t = 7.20, p < 0.000). Conversely, remorse
was associated with far lower pass values (n = 45, mean = 10.42, vs. n = 45, mean = 28.54, t = 4.93,
p < 0.000). Conditional on the numerical request, the content of the request, as measured through the
communication categories presented in Table 1, did not significantly affect allocator behavior. The quantile
regression used to support this conclusion is contained in the appendix. The estimated coefficient on fairness
was well within a standard error of zero (coeff. −3.83, t = 0.32, p < 0.75); there was sufficient variation to
estimate this coefficient as 61.6% of subjects requesting an equal division mentioned fairness.7 None of the
other categories approached standard significance levels as all were well within one standard error of zero.
Perhaps paradoxically, the words themselves in requests do not appear to directly affect allocator behavior,
but the existence of a request matters tremendously.8
   7
      Including a term for fairness interacted with the level of the request yields a coefficient estimation of 0.81, not significantly
different from 0.

      Rankin (2006) finds that numerical requests increase passes in an anonymous DG, but actually reduce passes when the inter-

    Numerical request had a significant effect (coeff. 1.00, t = 3.76, p < 0.000), but asking for more
than equal division was costly (coeff. −1.25, t = −3.02, p < 0.001). Table 2 shows why this is the case
and the result is illustrated graphically in Figure 3. Subjects rarely got more than they asked for, with the
exception being requests for quite low amounts and these requests comprise only 10.2% of all requests.
Across conditions, 15% of requests for 40 were granted and 11% were exceeded. Of these passes that
exceeded 40, the mean was 50. In contrast, 39% of requests for 50 were granted. The difference 39%
vs. 11% of subjects receiving 50 across these two requests is highly significant (t = 2.79, p < 0.006)
– asking is indeed powerful. However, asking for more than an equal division was detrimental; only 5%
of such requests were granted and none were exceeded. The mean pass for these “selfish requests” was
less than half of the mean for the modal request of equal division and less than the mean in the baseline
no-communication condition.


Experiment 2 Results: Empathy as a Proximate Factor
    The patterns of communication content (Table 1) provide evidence that the positive effect of two-way
communication on altruistic behavior is mediated by feelings of empathy.9 Experiment 2 tests this hypoth-
esis directly by using one-way communication and intentionally heightening feelings of empathy towards
one’s partner (and this is common knowledge). Fig. 4A presents mean pass by condition of Experiment
2. The mean pass of “E with empathy” (E(e)) was 21.7, which is significantly higher than E (z = 4.03,
p < 0.0001). The mean pass of “A with empathy” (A(e)), was 27.6, which was greater than A, although

action is face-to-face. He argues that the requests can crowd-out pro-social motivation present in the face-to-face treatment. In our
experiment, it is possible that mentioning the numerical requests crowded out the content of verbal communication.
    9
      Note that we only claiming this altruistic behavior, not altruism. This leaves open the possibility that although empathy is a
proximate factor, it is mediated through selfish channels, such as self-deception or guilt aversion. We address these points in Section
4.

not significantly (z = 0.79, p < 0.42) and very close to the generous behavior observed in the two-way
conditions of Experiment 1 (EA = 27.0, AE = 30.2). As hypothesized, the selfish behavior exhibited in E
was eliminated with the heightened empathy, just as it was with the existence of a subsequent request in EA.
This is shown in Fig. 4B, which compares the fraction of equal divisions and zeros in all the conditions in
which allocators spoke first.
    Subjects exhibited significantly more generosity in both Experiment 2 conditions as compared to the
baseline in Experiment 1, regardless of the fact they both involved one-way communication (A(e) z = 1.85,
p < .032; E(e) z = 1.45, p < 0.073 one-tailed t-test).10 Most interestingly, the distribution of choices in
the empathy-inducing conditions in Experiment 2 were nearly identical to the true two-way communication
conditions of Experiment 1. This is displayed graphically in Fig. 4C, which compares the pooled distribution
of EA & AE to E(e) & A(e) (within each pool the conditions are not significantly different from each other).
The distributions are virtually identical.
  10
     We use a one-tailed test here due to the bulk of evidence from the psychology literature that empathy increases observed
generosity.

4     Discussion
    In the introduction we argued that static inequity aversion did not match real-world inequality and that
such “indiscriminate altruism” would not be a fit trait.11 We argued further that theoretical explanations
for the underpinnings of altruism rely on people responding to social cues so that altruistic acts are meted
out efficiently and to ensure the would-be altruist does not end up in the poor house, or worse. Brain
imaging studies and traditional laboratory experiments have shown that in many contexts people have a
strong aversion to inequality. However, in our daily lives we are exposed to inequality regularly, but take
costly actions to lessen it only in special circumstances, such as when asked to give a charitable donation
(Andreoni and Payne, 2003; Landry et al., 2006) or observed by an audience (Andreoni and Bernheim,
2009). Our view is that although one may feel the pangs of sympathy in the face of inequality (and associated
brain activiation), the response is mediated by social cues and incentives, selfishness typically predominates.
    The results of our experiments support this claim. In both experiments, factors such as the relative in-
equality and worthiness of the recipient were held constant. Subjects were always playing a DG in which
one subject began with all the wealth and had an opportunity to share. In the condition in which roles were
most asymmetric in terms of both power and speaking, E, we observed near universal selfishness (93% of
money was kept). When we modified E so that receivers could respond to the written message before final
allocation decisions were made (EA), giving quadrupled. These differences were highly significant. Com-
munication appears to be a powerful social cue in eliciting unselfish behavior. In the following subsection
we examine why this the case.

The Power of the Ask
    A natural view of communication is that it affects actions through its content alone (for a discussion
see Mohlin and Johannesson, 2008) . In this light, our results are surprising. The actual messages sent in
the conditions with an “ask” mattered very little. One reason could be that the content of written requests
appears obvious. One would presumably expect receivers to request 50-50 splits and extol fairness, which is
precisely the modal message. This obviousness could explain why the verbal content of receivers’ messages
had no significant effect on allocations. This obviousness cannot, however, explain the primary finding of
the paper that the fact of being asked matters tremendously, despite the fact that any request is obvious.
    Figure 3 provides clear evidence of “the power of the ask.” It presents fitted values of the role of nu-
merical request on pass value across all conditions, the distribution of numerical requests and sample means
for relatively frequent requests. Asking for more typically leads to a greater pass but with limits — subjects
who requested more than an equal division were punished. So while “asking for the obvious” is effective,
asking for more than one’s fair share typically results in getting nothing in return.
    This “paradox of obviousness,” which has been studied in other contexts (Ellingsen and Johannesson,
2004; Charness and Dufwenberg, 2006; Charness and Rabin, 2005; Charness, 2000; Xiao and Houser,
   11
      It is worth noting that indiscriminant altruism, roughly speaking, exists in what are known a eusocial species. Although
exceedingly few species are eusocial, they are a few prolific examples such as ants and bees. Individual members of these species
act to preserve the meta-organism (the hive) and many of their instincts go against self-preservation (for example, when a drone bee
stings, it dies).


                                                                11
2009), must be understood from two different perspectives. First, in E the (unspoken) request the receiver
would make was just as obvious as in EA, yet subjects in E sent self-serving messages while in EA they
expressed less remorse and more fairness.12 Moreover, the mean of the non-binding allocation in EA was
four times that of the final allocation in E (p < .0001) (final allocations in EA were shaded up slightly from
the non-binding allocation). The allocators in EA were clearly successful in anticipating (and preemptively
responding to) the ask, while those in E were able “explain away” their selfishness. The giving behavior
and verbal messages suggests that the communicative “joint attentional frame” differed significantly across
these one and two-way communication conditions.
       Second, allocators in E not only were more selfish than in all conditions containing an ask, they were
also significantly more selfish than the baseline, when both parties were silent. We saw that the predominant
content of messages in E was remorse. Often this was simply the words “I’m sorry.” The baseline differed
from E in that expressing remorse was not possible. If expressing remorse could reduce one’s guilt, then
explaining one’s choice could have an instrumental value to allocators in E relative to the baseline. This
explanation is consistent with previous findings of guilt aversion (Dufwenberg and Gneezy, 2000; Charness
and Dufwenberg, 2006). Another related explanation is that E facilitated self-deception. The allocator
convinces himself that passing nothing and issuing an apology is a morally acceptable action.
       The interesting contrast is that explaining does not have the same instrumental value in EA that it has in
E. Instead, allocators in EA are significantly more generous than both the baseline and E, and statistically
indistinguishable from A and AE. There are also on average four times less likely to issue an apology.
Asking, it appears, has the power to neutralize any value of explaining. When the allocator does not have to
consider the other’s position through communication or experimentally induced empathy, this self-deception
and guilt avoidance comes at low cost. When pushed to form more precise beliefs about the other’s position,
these self-serving rationalizations are defanged.
       The findings of Experiment 1 confirm our primary hypothesis that communication can greatly influence
the level of altruism. Studying the “pure” incentives by ignoring this social component of giving will hide
significant aspects of giving behavior.


The Advantage of Empathy
       This leads to our secondary hypothesis: the existence of communication from the receiver to the allocator
increases the allocator’s empathy with the receiver. In Experiment 2, we initially placed subjects in roles of
both allocator and recipient, and then randomly determined which of the two roles to use for the completion
of the games and determination of monetary payments. Since the subjects made both A and E decisions,
they had to put themselves in the mindsets of both roles.
       The data strongly support our hypothesis. Subjects in E(e), who faced no ask, were significantly more
altruistic than E subjects, and statistically indistinguishable from the EA subjects, who actually did face
an ask (Fig. 2B). That is, having to formulate an (unused) ask themselves was as effective as facing an
actual ask from another subject. Our inference is that two-way communication leads one to appreciate and
  12
       Xiao and Hauser (2009) find that allowing recipients to complain ex-post leads to more generous behavior.



                                                                 12
identify the other’s position more fully (which we call empathy). This inference is motivated by the fact
that an essential (and unique) feature of human communication is what linguists call recursive mindreading
(forming beliefs about the other’s beliefs).13 Facing an ask, be it explicitly or implicitly through empathic
reasoning, blocks self-serving communication and selfish choices.
       Although there has been a large amount of work linking empathy and pro-social behavior (see a review
in Batson, 1991), it has not been established that empathy increases “pure altruism” (genuine concern for
others). Three channels of impure altruism have been the subject of recent attention in the literature: con-
cerns for social-image (Andreoni and Bernheim, 2009; Tadelis et al., 2008; Ariely et al., 2009), self-image
and self-signaling (Bodner and Prelec, 2003; Dana et al., 2007) and guilt aversion (Charness and Dufwen-
berg, 2006; Battigalli and Dufwenberg, 2007). In our experiment, social distance and anonymity remained
constant, so the results are unlikely to be explained by differing concerns for social image. We discuss the
other two channels below.
       Past work has defined guilt aversion to be proportional to the degree to which the action falls short of
recipient’s expectations (“let down aversion”) (Dufwenberg and Gneezy, 2000; Charness and Dufwenberg,
2006). This interpretation works well for Experiment 1 conditions E, A and AE, under the assumption that
requests (in part) form receiver’s expectations (and allocator’s recognize this). The prevalence of apologies
in E is also supportive as apologies are associated with feelings of guilt (Tangney, 1995). However, it has
trouble explaining why behavior in EA is so similar to AE and so different from E. One would expect the
allocator to use the first message (non-binding allocation and verbal) to depress receiver’s expectations in
order to reduce guilt, but non-binding allocations are generous and the message content does not mirror that
in E. Furthermore, in the E(e) condition of Experiment 2, allocators never receive any actual communication
and yet still give much more than E and more than the baseline. This indicates that apologies and efforts
to intentionally depress expectations lose their force in the face of empathy, whether it is induced by an ask
or through direct consideration of both roles as in Experiment 2, because the issuer is more likely to see
the apology as unsatisfactory (he would not find it satisfactory were he the receiver). Our conclusion is that
guilt aversion can only explain the results if empathy limits the effectiveness of strategies to reduce guilt;
guilt aversion based solely upon the recipient’s expectations is difficult to reconcile with all our experimental
findings.14
       The argument in favor of self-image maintenance rests upon self-signaling and strategic ignorance. The
basic premise is that allocator’s do not consider the other’s position if they do not have to. An analog is the
finding by Dana et al. (2007) that roughly half of subjects willfully remain ignorant about how their actions
will affect their counterpart in a modified dictator game or that people on the street “avoid the beggar”
(Dana et al., 2006). Grossman (2010) revisits the Dana et al. (2007) game and replicates the finding that
half of subjects remained ignorant when it was the default choice, but also finds that only 25% actively chose
  13
      Great apes appear to have the capacity for level-1 mindreading only. For example, in the game of hind-and-seek an ape can
correctly recognize what the seeker can and cannot see during hiding process. But they do not act in a way that is consistent with
recognizing that other apes recognize this as well, whereas human toddlers do (Call and Tomasello, 1999). Level-2 mindreading
is required for anything beyond very basic communication, as such, this sort of communication is distinctly human (Tomasello,
2008).
   14
      As mentioned earlier, the empathy in this study was in a sense always “common knowledge of empathy” in that recipients
knew allocators would read the messages and everyone knew their fellow subjects filled out decision forms from both roles.


                                                               13
ignorance when no default was provided and that only 3% chose ignorance when knowledge of the other’s
payoffs was the default. Our results have a similar tone. In the Experiment 1 conditions with an ask, the
situation moves from one which the allocator has the potential to know the recipient’s feelings (baseline) to
one in which she is forced, based on the belief formation associated with verbal communication, to actually
consider her.15 This knowledge raises the cost of self-deception. An active understanding of the position
of the other is precisely what we have defined as empathy. As such, under this interpretation, empathy
promotes altruistic behavior by making self-deception (self-signaling) more difficult (costly).
         The results of Experiment 2 are consistent with this interpretation. Many subjects found it difficult to
simultaneously request a fair division and administer a stingy one. But subjects who did pass 0 were just
as likely as other subjects to request an equal split. It is interesting that the subjects that were not moved
from a position of selfishness by this intervention seemingly had no trouble requesting a bulk of the pie and
typically included a verbal message. However, 63% of these subjects did not communicate verbally in E(e),
far more than the 14.8% observed in E for subjects sending 0.
         The question of how empathy promotes altruism is an interesting one we leave to future research. We
note that our results are consistent with both the more traditional view that empathy generates a genuine
concern for others (Batson, 1991) and the view that it operates through self-interest, either by raising the
cost of self-deception or by blocking strategies that ameliorate guilt.


5         Conclusion
         Our results highlight the importance of the social component of giving and assert that studying giving
without considering communication between the giver and recipient has the potential to overlook many
valuable insights. Because standard explanations for the existence of altruistic behavior in humans, espe-
cially among non-kin, rely heavily on the social nature of our species, a direct study of the social factors that
affect altruistic behavior is a natural and important step in furthering our understanding. Our study intro-
duces communication into an economic experiment and shows that communication, especially the power of
asking, greatly influences feelings of empathy and pro-social behavior. It suggests that selfishness typically
predominates and the human capacity for altruism is activated through social cues. Humans have evolved
the dual capacities to both be very compassionate and to put on blinders to protect us from our naturally
altruistic tendencies. Communication from recipients, be it real or inferred through introspection, is one
way that our species triggers the empathy required to remove these protective blinders.

6.2   Experiment 1 Instructions Sample: Condition AE
Welcome and thank you for participating in this study. For agreeing to participate you will automatically
earn a $7 “thank you” payment. Anything you earn in the study will be added to this.

Confidentiality
    We promise you total anonymity and confidentiality in this study. We will never record your name any-
where and no other participant will ever be able to tie you to the decisions you make. Whatever you earn
will be paid to you in a sealed envelope. As a result, not even those running the study will be able to connect
you to the decisions you made.

Quiet Please
During this study, please do not talk or make any other audible noises. This is very important. Any talking
will mean that we will have to cancel the study.

Thank you for your cooperation.

This Study
In this study you will be paired with one other participant for a single decision. The actions you and the
other subject take will result in dividing 100 tokens between the two of you. Tokens are worth $0.10 each.
This means you will be determining the allocation of $10 between the two participants.

After this decision you will be randomly re-matched with one other participant and make another decision
like that just described. Again you will allocate 100 tokens, that is, $10. Your role in the decisions will be
the same both times.

After this decision the study will be complete and we will prepare your payments.

The Allocation
One of the two participants in your pair will be randomly selected as the Allocator. This will be called
Person A. The other participant will be called the Receiver, or Person R. Person A will choose an allocation
for the pair. Person A will do this by filling in the blanks in this statement:

“Of the 100 tokens, I choose to hold _______ for myself and pass _______ to Person R.”

Person A’s decision will determine the final payoffs for both Person A and Person R.

The Stages for this Study
There will be several stages to the study. These stages will be conducted by having each pair of participants
fill out a Decision Form. We will pass the form back and forth between participants in such a way that the
two participants cannot identify each other. This is how the stages will work.
Stage 1: Person R can make a request to Person A by filling in the spaces like this:




                                                      20
In addition, Person R can write a message to Person A in the space provided. The message can say anything.
The only restriction is that it contain no information that could allow participants to identify each other.

We will then carry the form to Person A for the next stage.

Stage 2: Person A chooses the allocation of the 100 tokens by filling in blanks in this line of the Decision
Form:




Note: The amounts in hold and pass must sum to 100.

Person A will get the tokens in the hold portion and Person R will get the tokens in the pass portion. How-
ever, Person A can hold any number from 0 to 100, including 0, 100 and any number in between.



                                                    21
When Person A has chosen the allocation of tokens, he/she will write the allocation in terms of dollars in
the space provided (remember, each token is worth $0.10).

In addition, Person A can write a message to Person R in the space provided. The message can say anything.
The only restriction is that it contain no information that could allow participants to identify each other.

We will then carry the form to Person R for the next stage.

Stage 3: Person R must see the message from Person A and acknowledge this by checking the box at the
bottom of the decision form.

This ends a round.

The Two Rounds
After all the stages described above are complete we will reassign people to new partners and we will begin
the second round of decisions. No one will know anything about their partner’s decisions and outcomes in
the first round. The second round will be conducted the same way as the first. The study will end after the
second round.

Your Earnings
At the end of the second round, we will prepare your payments. This includes the $7 “thank you’ payment,
plus the earnings from the allocation of the 100 tokens in the two rounds.

We will place each person’s earnings in a sealed envelope. We will pay participants in the role of Person A
first and allow them to leave. We will then pay those in the role of Person R and allow them to leave.

Your Role
After everyone has read the instructions we will flip a coin to determine who will play which role. You will
stay in the same role for both decision rounds.

If HEADS: Odds will be Person A, Evens will be Person R

If TAILS: Evens will be Person A, Odds will be Person R

Things to Remember

1. You automatically get a $7 “thank you’ payment.
2. Your confidentiality is assured.
3. Quiet Please. No audible sounds can be permitted.
4. There will be two decision rounds.
5. For each decision round you will be paired with a different participant.
6. You will be assigned the role of Person A, the Allocator, or Person R, the Recipient. You will stay in that
role for both decision rounds.
7. Person A has the choice of how to allocate the 100 tokens.
8. Each token you earn is worth $0.10. Hence, the most you can earn in the study is $27, the least is $7
(including the $7 “thank you’ payment), or you can earn anything in between.
9. We will pay in cash in a sealed envelope at the end of the study.


                                                     22
Once all questions have been answered we will begin by flipping a coin to determine your role.


6.2.1   Experiment 2 Instructions
Welcome
Welcome and thank you for participating in this study. For agreeing to participate you will automatically
earn a $7 “thank you” payment. Anything you earn in the study will be added to this.

The Two Decision Tasks
Today’s study includes two separate decision tasks, which we will call Decision Task X and Decision Task
Y. Each of the tasks has several things in common.


   • Both Decision Tasks will pair you with an anonymously chosen person on the other side of the room.
     IMPORTANT: For each decision task, you will be paired with a different anonymous participant.

   • Both Decision Tasks assign roles to the two participants in each pair. As you will see, one role is
     called Player A, and the other is called Player R. IMPORTANT: When we select roles, you will be in
     the same role for both decision tasks

   • Both Decision Tasks have several stages where players alternate activities. We conduct this by passing
     a Decision Form between the players in each pair until all the stages are complete..


The two decision tasks have some differences as well.

   • In Decision Task X, Person R moves in Stage 1, Person A moves in Stage 2, etc.

   • In Decision Task Y, Person A moves in Stage 1, Person R moves in Stage 2, etc.


Shortly, we will be going over the Directions for both Decision Tasks X and Y.

Making Stage 1 Decisions
Before we assign you your role today, we are going to ask you to make the Stage 1 decisions for both roles.
That is, you will make the Stage 1 decision for Decision Task X as if you are in the role of Person R, and
you will make the Stage 1 decision for Decision Task Y as if you are in the role of Person A.

After everyone has made the Stage 1 decisions for both decision tasks we will flip a coin to determine who
will play which role. You will stay in the same role for both decision tasks.

    If HEADS: Odds will be Person A, Evens will be Person R

    If TAILS: Evens will be Person A, Odds will be Person R

IMPORTANT: Since it is equally likely that you will be in either role, it is in your interest to make the Stage
1 decisions for each role as if you were actually known to be in that role.


                                                      23
If you are chosen to be Person A:

We will carry out your Stage 1 decision from Decision Task Y.
We will set aside your Stage 1 decision form for Decision Task X. What you did in Stage 1 for Decision
Task X will never be seen by another person in the study.

If you are chosen to be Person R:
We will carry out your Stage 1 decision from Decision Task X.
We will set aside your Stage 1 decision form for Decision Task Y. What you did in Stage 1 for Decision
Task Y will never be seen by another person in the study.

Making Stage 2 Decisions
If you are chosen to be Person A:

Your Decision Form for Task X will be carried to an anonymous person in the Role of Person R, who will
then make the Stage 2 decision for Decision Task X.
You will also receive a Decision Form for Decision Task Y from a different anonymous person in the role
of Person R and will be asked to make a Stage 2 decision in Decision Task Y.

If you are chosen to be Person R:

Your Decision Form for Task Y will be carried to an anonymous person in the Role of Person A, who will
then make the Stage 2 decision for Decision Task X. You will also receive a decision form for Decision Task
X from a different anonymous person in the role of Person A and will be asked to make a Stage 2 decision
in Decision Task X.

 Your Earnings
At the end of all the decisions, we will add your earnings from Decision Task X and Decision Task Y, plus
the $7 thank you payment. We will place each person’s earnings in a sealed envelope and hand them to you
individually, by your participant number.

Next we will go over the directions for both Decision Tasks. Each Decision Task has separate directions, and
separate Decision Forms. After we have gone over all the directions, you can fill out the Stage 1 decisions
for both Task X and Task Y. You may fill them out in any order you like.

When you have finished, please put the Decision Form for Decision Task X in the envelope marked “X”,
and put the Decision Form for Decision Task Y in the envelope marked “Y”. When everyone is done with
both decisions, we ill collect all the Decision Forms. At that point we will flip a coin to determine roles.

IMPORTANT: Do not make any decisions until we have gone over the directions for both Decision Tasks,
and the Experimenter instructs you that you can begin making decisions. Thank you for your cooperation.

We will now begin reading the directions for the two decision tasks.

(Both decision tasks were then explained just as in Experiment 1)

6.3    Instructions to Reviewers and Precise Definitions of Communication Categories
Structure of the Game

    In the DG there are two players: the allocator and the receiver. A coin toss determines role assignment.
The allocator is given ten dollars to split between herself and the receiver. She can pass to the receiver any
dollar amount from zero to ten.
    In some conditions of the experiment, subjects were allowed to communicate via written messages.
There were two types of communication: ask and explain. The ask phase allowed receivers to send a
message requesting a certain portion of the ten dollar pie, along with a written message. The explain phase
allowed allocators to send a written message along with the pass amount. The experimental conditions
were varied such that some contained no forms of communication, while others contained one or two. The
order was also changed. For the DG there were the following conditions: ask only, explain only, ask then
explain and explain then ask. Note that for the explain then ask, allocators also sent a non-binding numerical
“proposed” allocation.
    Each subject played two rounds of the game (condition remained the same) with two different partners.
For example, for the DG ask-explain condition, the game was played as follows.


   1. Receiver sends a written message to the allocator, along with a numerical pass request.

   2. The allocator chooses the pass amount and sends it to the receiver along with a written message.

   3. The players are paid according to the split determined by the allocator.

    It is important to remember the order of the communication when analyzing the content of the messages.
For instance, for the “explain then ask” condition, the explain message should be coded first followed by
the ask condition. Also it is important to note the numerical request (or non-binding proposal) because the
subjects would read and interpret the message with the request in mind as well. Basically you want to read
the communication as a subject would (i.e. in the right order and using all information available to the
subject) and analyze the content. The spreadsheet provided to you will contain columns for each condition.
For example if you see a 1 in the “ask then explain” column this means that was the condition used. In every
condition except “explain then ask” the communication (if applicable) order is: ask, explain, comment. So
you really just need to watch out for the “explain then ask” condition and be sure to read the explains first
for this case.
    The following section explains precisely how the content will be analyzed.

      Coding the communication

     Each form of communication needs to be categorized according to its content. These categories are not
exclusive, that is a message could very well fit into two or more categories. The categories were chosen
to limit the inherent subjectivity in determining the content of the message. Please read these guidelines
carefully.
     In the coding spreadsheet you have been provided with you will notice that to the right of the column
containing the written communication there are columns with the appropriate communication categories.
For instance, next to the column labeled “Ask” there are columns labeled “a fairness”, etc. After reading the
message you will put a 1 in a column if you feel it qualified as that category of communication and 0 if it,
in your opinion, did not qualify. Invariably there will be some judgment calls to be made, in these situations


                                                     25
just try to be consistent and do your best.
