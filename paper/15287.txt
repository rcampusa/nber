Alternative Measures of Offshorability: A Survey Approach

                                            ABSTRACT

This paper reports on a household survey specially designed to measure what we call the “offshorability”
of jobs, defined as the ability to perform the work duties from abroad. We develop multiple measures
of offshorability, using both self-reporting and professional coders. All the measures find that roughly
25% of U.S. jobs are offshorable. Our three preferred measures agree between 70% and 80% of the
time. Furthermore, professional coders appear to provide the most accurate assessments, which is good
news because the Census Bureau could collect data on offshorability without adding a single question
to the CPS. Empirically, more educated workers appear to hold somewhat more offshorable jobs, and
offshorability does not have systematic effects on either wages or the probability of layoff. Perhaps
most surprisingly, routine work is no more offshorable than other work.

       This paper reports on a pilot study of the use of conventional household survey methods to

measure something unconventional: what we call “offshorability,” defined as the ability to

perform one’s work duties (for the same employer and customers) from abroad. Notice that

offshorability is a characteristic of a person’s job, not of the person himself. We see this research

as important for two main reasons.

       First, one of us has argued previously (Blinder (2006, 2009a)) that offshoring is potentially a

very important labor market phenomenon in the United States and elsewhere, perhaps eventually

amounting to a third Industrial Revolution. In the first Industrial Revolution, the share of the

U.S. workforce engaged in agriculture declined by over 80 percentage points. In the second

Industrial Revolution, which is still in progress, the share of American workers employed in

manufacturing has declined by almost 25 percentage points so far, with most of the migration

going to the service sector. The estimates presented here, like those of Blinder (2009b), suggest

that the share of U.S. workers performing what Blinder (2006) called “impersonal service” jobs

(defined precisely below) might shrink significantly while the share performing “personal

service” jobs rises.

       Second, while readers must judge for themselves, we deem the pilot study to have been

successful—by several criteria that we will explain later. So we hope our survey methods will be

replicated, improved upon, and eventually incorporated into some regular government survey,

such as the Current Population Survey (CPS). Doing so would enable the U.S. government to

track this important phenomenon over time.1

       The plan of the paper is as follows: Section 1 defines offshorability in more detail, expands

upon why we believe that measuring it is important, and reviews some previous attempts to do
1
    And perhaps also to look backward historically by applying the methodology to old survey records.


                                                                                                        2
so. (There are only a few.) Section 2 describes the survey questions we designed as part of an

original, multi-purpose labor force survey.2 The survey provides multiple ways to assess the

offshorability of a given job, and we focus on three. One asks respondents directly about the

difficulty of having their work performed by someone in a remote location. In the second, we use

respondents’ answers to a series of questions about the nature of their work to classify jobs by

their offshorability ourselves. The third relies on professional coders to decide how offshorable

each job is, based on the worker’s description of his or her job tasks.

     One key question for us is: Do these three alternative survey methods lead to similar or

different results? Section 3 summarizes our findings, both in terms of technical indicators of

survey quality (e.g., response rates, reliability, etc.) and of substantive findings (e.g., how many

jobs are estimated to be offshorable?). To us, the two types of results are equally important—at

least until the survey methodology is well established. In Sections 4 and 5, we report on some

simple econometric exercises using the survey data. For example, what are the most important

determinants of offshorability? And what effects, if any, does offshorability have on wages?

Finally, Section 6 is a short summary.



     1. What is “offshorability” and why does it matter?

     Offshoring refers to the movement of home-country jobs to another country—whether or not

those jobs go to another company. Thus General Electric offshores jobs when it moves a factory

to China, and JP Morgan Chase offshores jobs when it does security analysis at its offices in

India instead of in New York. Since the two are often conflated, offshoring needs to be

distinguished from outsourcing, which refers to moving jobs out of the company, regardless of


2
 The data generated by this survey are also used in several other studies in the Princeton Data Improvement
Initiative (PDII).


                                                                                                              3
whether those jobs leave the country. In neither of the two preceding examples are jobs

outsourced. But Citigroup outsources (but does not offshore) jobs when it hires another U.S.

company to run a credit-card call center for it in South Dakota, and Goldman Sachs outsources

jobs when it hires a New York City janitorial firm to clean its offices. Of course, sometimes jobs

are both outsourced and offshored, as when IBM moves its call center to India and hires Wipro

to run it.

     Offshoring, which is an observable action,3 must also be distinguished from offshorability,

which is a job characteristic. We call a job “offshorable” if its nature—e.g., what must be done

and where—allows the work to be moved overseas in principle, even if that movement has not

actually occurred. So, for example, we know that all textile manufacturing jobs in the United

States are offshorable even though some of them are still here. (Most, however, have moved

offshore.) By the same token, virtually all American call-center jobs are offshorable. But

performing surgery and driving a taxicab are not.4

     In some jobs, offshorability is clear and unambiguous—as in the preceding examples of call-

center operators (easily offshorable) and taxi drivers (impossible to offshore). But in other cases,

the degree of offshorability is less clear. Think, for example, about accounting, filing documents,

watch repair, and paralegal work. The degrees of offshorability of positions like these are matters

of subjective judgment. And therein lies the measurement challenge, for one person’s judgments

may not correspond to another’s. One of the central questions of this paper is: Can these

judgments be made with a modicum of consistency and validity?



3
  At least in principle. In practice, it can be difficult. For example, if Mattel opens a toy factory in China to export
back to the United States, but does not close a factory in the U.S., are the jobs in China offshored?
4
  Immigrants or guest workers can move to the U.S. to do non-offshorable jobs. But then those jobs are not
offshored. Offshoring refers to the location of economic activity (like GDP), not the nationality of the worker (like
GNP).


                                                                                                                           4
    Economists typically shy away from such subjective judgments; we prefer “hard data”

instead. But data users often forget that much of the official government data that we use so

routinely reflect subjective judgments—not by economists, but by survey respondents and the

people who code their responses. In the CPS occupational data, for example, respondents have

not self-categorized themselves into one of the (roughly) 800 Standard Occupation Codes (SOC).

If they did so, they would probably do it poorly. Instead, a trained coder assigns each

respondent’s job to an SOC based mainly on the answers to these two questions:

               What kind of work do you do, that is, what is your occupation?

               What are your usual activities or duties at this job?

    In neither case do respondents pick from a pre-set list. Rather, they answer free form, in

their own words. To give readers an idea of what the raw survey data look like, here are three

verbatim examples culled from our survey:

       What kind of work do you do, that     What are your usual activities or
       is, what is your occupation?          duties at this job?
       “inn keeper”                          “guest services, housekeeping,
                                             reservations, marketing, etc.”
       “pastor”                              “preach, teaching, visiting
                                             home/hospital counseling”
       “work in the lobby”                   “clean tables, clean seats and
                                             mop the bathroom floors”


Based on such information, trained coders in Indiana decided on the occupation code for each

respondent. As we explain in detail in the next section, one of our methods for coding

offshorability follows this procedure exactly. In fact, whether or not professional coders can

classify jobs according to their degree of offshorability correctly and consistently are among the

most critical questions for our study. As will be seen, we think the answer is yes. A related

question is whether we can develop a reliable mapping from occupational information to




                                                                                                     5
offshorability. If so, the BLS or the Census Bureau would be able to track offshorability over

time by going back to old CPS and Census data.5

     But why take on such a hazardous task, involving so many subjective judgments, in the first

place? Because we believe the answers are potentially important to education policy, trade

policy, and labor-market policies, to name just three.6 For public policy purposes, it probably

does not matter much whether the share of American jobs that are offshorable is 20% or 30%.

That much imprecision in measurement would not affect the plausible policy responses in any

substantial way. But we believe that both the economically appropriate and the politically

feasible policy responses to offshoring would be fundamentally different depending on whether,

say, the share of the American workforce holding jobs deemed to be offshorable is 2%, 25%, or

75%. In the 2% case, we should probably ignore offshoring as a detail of little consequence. In

the 75% case, we should perhaps be looking for radical solutions to the manifold problems

caused by massive job dislocations. Our estimates, like those of Blinder (2009b), are closer to the

25% mark—which, we believe, calls for certain marginal (and some not so marginal) policy

adjustments, but certainly not for panic. But this paper is about measurement, not policy. So we

leave policy implications for elsewhere and concentrate on the data.

     We are not the first to attempt to estimate how many U.S. jobs are potentially offshorable.

Blinder (2009b) used information about job content in the O*NET data base to assign a two-digit

ordinal offshorability index to each of the (roughly) 800 SOC codes. For example, data

keypunchers were rated as 100, bookkeepers were rated 84, factory workers were (around) 68,

stock clerks were 34, and child care workers were 0. Once all the occupations were so rated,

Blinder (2009b) drew the line between offshorable and non-offshorable jobs in a variety of

5
  One major qualification, of course, is that the upward march of technology is probably making more and more jobs
offshorable over time.

  For much more on policy implications, see Blinder (2006, 2009a).


                                                                                                                6
places. His “conservative,” “moderate,” and “aggressive” definitions placed 22.2%, 25.6%, and

29.0% of all U.S. jobs, respectively, in the offshorable category. But using only occupation-level

data misses any within-occupation variability in the degree of offshorability—and there is

probably plenty. As mentioned earlier, the natural unit of observation for measuring

offshorability is the job, not the individual. However, there may be a great deal of heterogeneity

within certain occupation codes. For example, some secretarial and clerking jobs are clearly

offshorable while others are not. We seek to overcome that difficulty here by using worker-level

data.7

     Other studies have obtained a variety of different estimates. For example, the McKinsey

Global Institute (2005) used detailed consulting-style analysis of eight “representative sectors” in

rich countries around the world to estimate that only about 11% of worldwide (not just U.S.)

private-sector service employment might potentially be offshored to developing countries within

about the next five years. Presumably a larger portion of manufacturing jobs is offshorable.

Furthermore, McKinsey’s five-year time frame seems much too short to us; and U.S. jobs are

probably more vulnerable to offshoring than, say German or French jobs, because there are so

many more English-speaking (than German- or French-speaking) workers in, e.g., India.

Bardhan and Kroll (2003) estimated that about 11% of all U.S. jobs are offshorable. But they

explicitly restricted themselves to “occupations where at least some [offshore] outsourcing has

already taken place or is being planned” (p. 6). Since service-sector offshoring was in its infancy

then (and probably still is), their self-imposed purview seems far too limited. Van Welsum and

Vickery (2005) based their estimates of offshorability in OECD countries on the intensity of ICT

use by industry. Their estimate for the U.S. was about 20% of total employment. Finally, Jensen


7
 Blinder (2009b) dealt with this problem by arbitrarily dividing occupations like “secretary” into sub-occupations
with different degrees of offshorability. This involved a lot of guesswork.


                                                                                                                     7
and Kletzer (2006) used geographical concentration within the United States to estimate how

“tradable” each occupation is. They then estimated that 38% of U.S. workers are in tradable, and

therefore offshorable, occupations. Thus the range of pre-existing estimates runs from11% to

38%—which is quite wide.

    Finally, we should note that our distinction between jobs that are or are not offshorable is

conceptually distinct from, though related to, Autor, Levy, and Murnane’s (2003) well-known

distinction between jobs that are or are not sufficiently rule-based to be performed by a

computer/robot. On the surface, it seems plausible that, other things equal, jobs that can be

broken down into simple, routinizable tasks are easier to offshore than jobs requiring complex

thinking, judgment, and human interaction. However, a wide variety of complex tasks that

involve high levels of skill and human judgment can also be offshored via telecommunication

devices as simple as telephones, fax machines, and the Internet. Think, for example, of statistical

analysis, computer programming, manuscript editing, and security analysis, to name just a few.

We believe that Blinder’s (2006) distinction between personal and impersonal services—which

we elaborate on in the next section—is far more germane to the offshoring issue than is the

question of routinizability. That said, the two criteria should overlap, and we examine that

overlap below.



    2. The Surveys

    The present authors, along with other scholars and the staff of Princeton University’s Survey

Research Center, worked with Westat, a leading statistical survey research organization to

develop a multi-purpose questionnaire for the Princeton Data Improvement Initiative (PDII).

Westat was selected for the project, in part, because of its wealth of experience working with the




                                                                                                   8
Census Bureau. We began with the relevant questions from the CPS and added additional

questions on the feasibility of performing respondents’ work remotely, job tasks, career

experience, etc. Westat then administered the random digit dialing (RDD) survey, coded the

responses, and tabulated the results.8 In this paper, we focus on the portions of the survey that

were designed to estimate offshorability, making only minor reference to other aspects of the

survey.

       According to Blinder (2009b), the offshorability of a particular job depends on two principal

criteria:

         1. whether the job must be done at a particular U.S. location (examples: selling food at a

             sports arena, building a house);

         2. whether the work can be done at a remote (presumably foreign) location and the work

             product—whether a good or a service—delivered to the end user with little or no loss of

             quality.

The second criterion is clearly a continuum rather than a yes-or-no variable, so some jobs are

more offshorable than others—which is why Blinder (2009b) created a numerical index.

       For example, virtually all manufactured goods can be made abroad, put in a box, and

transported to the United States. Within the service sector, the work of a keypuncher, call center

operator, or computer code writer is approximately as useful to the end user if the work is

performed next door, in Bangor, or in Bangalore. Blinder (2006) labeled jobs like these

impersonal services, and noted that they are easily offshorable. At the other extreme, some

service-sector jobs such as brain surgeon, taxi driver, and day care worker—which Blinder

(2006) labeled personal services—are completely impossible to offshore. In between sits a vast

array of service jobs that are less offshorable than writing computer code but more offshorable

                                                                                                                 9
than performing surgery. College teaching may be one such job, or might become one as the

technology improves.

    Our first research question is whether trained coders—such as the people who classify

occupations in the CPS—can understand this conceptual distinction and apply it in a consistent

way to actual survey responses of the sort displayed earlier, which are sometimes messy.

    A pre-existing survey

    As an initial step, Westat staff went back to a restricted-use version of the 2003 National

Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL)—a survey of over 18,000 respondents. They drew a

stratified random sample of 3,000 observations and re-examined the answers to the three

questions that coders used then to decide on a respondent’s occupation and industry—questions

that are very similar to the two CPS questions shown earlier:

      For what kind of business or industry do you work?

      What is your occupation, that is, what is your job called?

      What are the most important activities or duties at this job?

Based on the answers, coders were asked to classify each respondent’s job on the following five-

point offshorability scale that we developed with Westat explicitly for this purpose:

           1: not offshorable
           2: offshorable only with considerable difficulties and/or loss of quality
           3: mixed or neutral
           4: offshorable, though with some difficulties or loss of quality (that can be
              overcome)
           5: easily offshorable with only minor (or no) difficulties or loss of quality

    In the instructions, coders were told that the following job characteristics push a job toward

the low end of this five-point scale, that is, toward “not offshorable”:

       •    Need for face-to-face interaction with customers or suppliers
       •    Delivering/transporting products or materials that cannot be transported
            electronically (e.g., mail, meals, fruits and vegetables)


                                                                                                  10
       •    Public speaking
       •    Requires “cultural sensitivity” (e.g., newscaster, sports broadcaster)
       •    Providing supervision, training or motivation to others working in the U.S.
       •    Physical presence at site (or sites) in U.S. is required
       •    Maintaining or repairing fixed structures that are in the U.S. (e.g., roofs, plumbing,
            gardens, yards)
       •    Maintaining or repairing large objects (e.g., cars, boats, washing machines)

As some examples of jobs that are not offshorable (coded 1), we used mail deliverer, carpenter,

waiter, farmer, and surgeon.

    At the other end of the spectrum, coders were instructed that the following characteristics

push a job toward the high end of the offshorability scale, that is, toward “easily offshorable”:

       •    Extensive use of computers/email
       •    Processing information/data entry
       •    Talking on the telephone
       •    Analyzing data
       •    Assembling or packaging a product

Some examples we used of jobs that should be coded as 5s were computer programmer,

telemarketer, proofreader, and reservation clerk. Finally, coders were instructed to score any job

that involves a mixed set of offshorable and non-offshorable characteristics as “mixed or neutral”

(3 on the scale above).

     Westat selected four coders who had no previous experience with SOC coding, and

conducted a one-day training session to familiarize them with the SOC codes, the concept of

offshorability, and the five-point scale just explained. In fact, Westat personnel reported to us

that much more of their training was devoted to understanding the 800 SOC codes than to the

five offshorability codes. In the training, coders examined raw data from the three NAAL

occupational questions shown above, and discussed the SOCs and offshorability codes that

should be applied with Westat personal. Westat had, in turn, discussed these same principles




                                                                                                    11
extensively with us, including reviewing many concrete examples to make sure we were “on the

same page.”

     After the training session, each of the four coders was given 750 randomly-selected cases on

which to work. They were asked to assign an SOC and an offshorability code (using the five-

point scale displayed above) to each. During their first week of work, supervisors provided

especially close oversight and feedback to the coders regarding the accuracy of their

assignments; and throughout the job, a supervisor was always available to answer questions and

provide guidance as needed.

     The next—and important—step was to examine the inter-coder reliability of the assigned

codes. About 10% of each coder’s cases were randomly selected to be coded again by another

coder. Of these 298 cases, the two coders agreed on the assigned offshorability score in 226

cases, or 76%—even though they had no previous experience with even the presumably more

routine task of occupational coding. It seems virtually certain to us (and to Westat) that

experienced coders would have agreed even more. This strikes us as a high degree of inter-coder

agreement; after all, coders do have to make subjective judgments. Furthermore, and important

to our purpose, coders declared themselves unable to decide on the degree of offshorability in a

mere 0.5% of cases, a negligible proportion. Finally, in cases in which the two coders disagreed,

Westat supervisors adjudicated the disputes. As it turned out, they sided with the first coder in

93% of the cases, suggesting that even cross-checking every coding decision would have made

little difference.

     Each of these survey findings bolstered our confidence in the procedure and emboldened us

to take the next step: creating a de novo survey aimed specifically at measuring offshorability.




                                                                                                    12
For comparison with results shown later, the 2,985 NAAL cases wound up being coded for

offshorability as follows:

            1:   not offshorable………………………….. 71.9%
            2:   offshorable with considerable difficulties.. 4.8%
            3:   mixed……………………………………. 6.2%
            4:   offshorable with some difficulties………. 5.3%
            5:   easily offshorable……………………….. 11.8%.

Thus the most restrictive definition of offshorability would encompass 17.1% of employment

(responses 4 and 5) while the most expansive definition would cover 28.1% (all responses except

1).

      New Survey Results: Externally-coded and Self-reported Offshorability

      The PDII survey was a random-digit dialing (RDD) survey of 2,513 labor force participants

age 18 and older, conducted between June 5 and July 20, 2008. Although Westat made as many

as 15 phone calls to sampled households to elicit a response, the response rate was only 17.9% ,

which is hardly unusual in RDD surveying. Sample weights were developed to make the sample

representative of the population in terms of sex, age, race, Hispanic ethnicity, education,

employment status, geographical region, and other demographic variables; all the results shown

in this paper are based on weighted data. Most important for our purposes, the PDII survey

included the CPS occupation and industry questions, and Westat’s coders applied the same

procedures they used for the NAAL data to provide an external assessment of the offshorability

of each respondent’s job.

      An externally-coded measure

      When the methods described above for utilizing the standard industry and occupation

questions in the NAAL data were used by professional coders to rate the offshorability of each

survey respondent’s job, the results were:




                                                                                                 13
              1: not offshorable…………………………… 68.4%
              2: offshorable with considerable difficulty …...8.3%
              3: mixed or neutral…………………………….6.3%
              4: offshorable with some difficulty……………6.2%
              5: offshorable with minor or no difficulty……10.9%


If we arbitrarily divide the “mixed or neutral” response equally between “offshorable” and “not

offshorable,” we would conclude that 20.3% of jobs are potentially offshorable.9 But looking

forward to the superior technology that will be available in the future, as Blinder (2009b) did, we

should probably include some of the “2” responses as well. An overall estimate in the 22-23%

range might be reasonable. Thus, basing the assessment on subjective judgments by external

coders, this worker-level survey gives aggregate estimates of offshorability comparable to the

lower end of Blinder’s (2009b) occupation-based coding (which was 22.2%).

       Self-reported measures

       But since this was our own survey, we also devised and included several new questions

designed to get survey respondents to shed light on the nature and extent of offshorability in their

own jobs. After experimenting with a number of variants on small, experimental samples (and

rejecting most as unworkable), our main question for assessing self-reported offshorability was

as follows:

Q27.       Some jobs can be done remotely using a telephone or a computer, while others require
           face-to-face or physical presence at the job. For example, a telephone survey-taker like
           me can call you from some other state or even from a foreign country. A computer
           programmer or a person who takes customer orders over the phone can do the job from
           anywhere using a computer or telephone. However, a taxi-cab driver, a barber, or a
           waitress must be at the same place as their customers, and a construction worker has to
           be physically present at a job site.

           So thinking about the distinction I just described, can the work that you do for your
           current employer or customers be done at a remote location or does it require you to be
           physically present where the employer or job site is?


9
    Stunningly, this is exactly what we would get from the NAAL data summarized above.


                                                                                                  14
                  CAN BE DONE AT REMOTE LOCATION ...                        1                     18.6%
                  CAN BE DONE REMOTELY, BUT
                  WITH DIFFICULTY .....................................     2                      1.5%
                  REQUIRES PHYSICAL PRESENCE AT
                  A PARTICULAR LOCATION ........................            3                     67.7%
                  SOME PARTS/SOMETIMES .........................            4                     11.8%
                  REFUSED OR DON’T KNOW                                                            0.5%

The rightmost column again shows the distribution of survey responses. Most work done in

America is clearly not offshorable in the view of those who do it. Notice that the 68% of (self-

reported) jobs that “require physical presence” (ignoring the “refused” and “don’t know”

responses) is virtually identical to the 68.4% of jobs that are “not offshorable” according to

external coders.10

     Several other features of these results are notable. First, the fraction of respondents who

either could not or would not answer the question was negligible—which is very good news for

the question as worded. Second, if we simply count the 1s as offshorable, the 3s as not-

offshorable, and split the 2s and the 4s on a 50-50 basis, we would conclude that 25.3% of all

jobs are offshorable—which is remarkably similar to Blinder’s (2009b) “moderate” estimate.11 If

we employ a much more demanding definition, counting only the 1s as offshorable, we would

get an estimate of 18.7%, which is slightly below Blinder’s most “conservative” estimate. But

this definition seems far too restrictive.

     To examine the credibility of the responses to Q27, Westat asked a random sample of 197

respondents a free-form question regarding why they said their job can be done remotely or why

it requires their physical presence—depending on how they answered Q27. The answers to these



10
   While the aggregates are almost identical, the compositions of the two groups are not. For example, among the
jobs that external coders classify as “not offshorable,” individual jobholders report that their physical presence is
required in 77.4% (not 100%) of the cases. Conversely, of the cases in which individuals report that physical
presence is required, only 77.7% (not 100%) were classified as “not offshorable” by the external coders. More on
this later.
11
   In making this and similar tabulations, we always omit the “refused” and “don’t know” responses.


                                                                                                                        15
follow-up questions give us some basis for believing that most of the respondents correctly

understood what we were after. Based on a laborious case-by-case reading of the data file, the

free-form explanations seemed inconsistent with the responses to the offshorability question

(Q27) in 11.7% of the cases. 12 This subjective “error rate” was about the same for jobs that

respondents said could be done remotely (10.8%) and jobs that require physical presence

(11.9%). These results give us reason for cautious optimism. Misclassification errors look

modest, though certainly not negligible. More important, they also seem to be random, that is,

not correlated with offshorability. Still, if as many as 11.7% of respondents might misclassify

themselves, Q27 might not be the ideal question.

     So another, related set of offshorability questions was asked of every respondent, starting

with:

Q29.    To what extent does the work you do on your main job involve face-to-face contact with
        people other than your co-workers or supervisors? Would you say a lot, a moderate
        amount, a little, or none at all?

                 A LOT .............................................................   1   52.6%
                 A MODERATE AMOUNT..............................                       2   17.0%
                 A LITTLE .......................................................      3   18.0%
                 NONE AT ALL ...............................................           4   12.4%
                 REF OR DK                                                                  0.0%

Here the number of refusals and “don’t know” responses is essentially zero—just two out of

2513 survey respondents. Ordinary people obviously can cope with this question without

difficulty.

     Notice that the wording of Q27 put the emphasis on the ability (or lack thereof) to do a job

from a remote location. By contrast, Q29 emphasizes the frequency of face-to-face contact on the

12
  An example of an inconsistent response is an individual who replied that his work required his physical presence
“because it comes through the computer queues that are on a mainframe at the job location.” From the other
perspective, a questionable response was someone who said that his job could be performed remotely and offered as
an explanation that he “has to be at the house of residence.”



                                                                                                               16
job with someone other than one’s co-workers and superiors; it does not even ask respondents

whether their job could be done from a remote location. Thus, while related, the two job

characteristics described in Q27 and Q29 are conceptually distinct.

    Yet each is an important hallmark of whether or not a job is offshorable. Thus answers of “a

lot” or “a moderate amount” to Q29—which together comprise almost 70% of total

employment—would seem to indicate that these respondents are not in highly-offshorable jobs.

Some (perhaps many) of the people answering “a little” face-to-face contact (18%) might be in

jobs that are offshorable, albeit with some effort. And it is tempting to classify most of the

respondents saying “none” (12.4% of the sample) as probably holding jobs that are easy to

offshore. If we succumb to this temptation, and split the “a little” responses (coded 3) evenly, we

would conclude that 21.4% of all jobs are offshorable.

    But we can do much better than this. To dig deeper, the survey posed two follow-up

questions. First, consider the 12.4% of all respondents who reported in Q29 that none of their

work involves face-to-face contact with people other than fellow workers. Are all those jobs

easily offshorable? Surely not. Just think about air traffic controllers or janitors who clean office

buildings after hours. So we asked these respondents:

Q32.   To what extent is it possible for you to do the work on your job without being physically
       present? By that I mean could you do the work at a remote location and then deliver it by
       mail, by telephone, by sending it over the Internet, and so on. Would you say all of the
       work could be done that way, most of the work, a little of it, or none at all?

               ALL OF THE WORK .....................................         1     2.1%
               MOST OF THE WORK ..................................           2     1.9%
               A LITTLE OF THE WORK ............................             3     1.2%
               NONE AT ALL ...............................................   4     7.2%
               REF OR DK                                                           0.0%
               [Not asked                                                         87.6%]




                                                                                                   17
     Notice that this question asks respondents to think a bit beyond current practices—to what

could be done. While it recognizes the reality that many tasks are in fact executed face-to-face

today, it asks respondents to ponder whether this personal contact is really necessary. Those who

answer “none at all” to Q32, constituting 7.2% of the whole sample (and thus 58% of the sub-

sample), are telling us that none of their work could be done remotely and transmitted to end

users. These people are almost certainly in non-offshorable jobs despite the dearth of face-to-face

contact.

     The others, amounting to 5.2% of the whole sample (or 42% of the Q32 subsample),

indicate at least some ability to deliver the work from a remote location. They were then asked:

Q32a. If work like yours is done elsewhere and delivered from a remote location, by how much,
      if at all, do you think the quality would deteriorate?

                  A LOT .............................................................1    0.3%
                  A MODERATE AMOUNT..............................2                        0.8%
                  A LITTLE .......................................................3       1.0%
                  NONE AT ALL.............................................. 4             3.0%
                  REF OR DK                                                               0.1%
                  [Not asked                                                             94.8%]

We classified those who answered either “a little” or “not at all” to this question, plus half of

those who answered “a moderate amount” (thus 4.4% of the overall sample), as being in

offshorable jobs. The other jobs are deemed not offshorable. 13

     Next, we turn to the 87.6% of the sample who did not answer “none at all” to Q29, thereby

indicating that at least some face-to-face contact with, say, customers or suppliers is part of their

jobs. 14 They were asked a follow-up question that closely tracks Q32 above:


13
   Respondents to Q32a, and to the companion question Q31a below, were asked how such remote delivery would
be accomplished. A stunning 71% responded that their work would be sent via a computer network, about 41% said
by fax or telephone, 35% said their work would be sent by mail, and under 14% said it would go by truck or ship.
(Note: Many respondents gave multiple responses.)
14
   About 85% of these respondents reported face-to-face contact with customers, about 58% reported face-to-face
contact with suppliers or contractors, and about 61% reported face-to-face contact with students or trainees. Again,
multiple responses were common.


                                                                                                                  18
Q31.     Now think about the work you do face-to-face with others. To what extent is it possible
         for you to do that work without being physically present? By that I mean doing the work
         at a remote location and then delivering it by mail, by telephone, by sending it over the
         Internet, and so on. Would you say all of the work could be done that way, most of the
         work, a little of it, or none at all?

                  ALL OF THE WORK .....................................              1         3.4%
                  MOST OF THE WORK ..................................                2        12.6%

                  NONE AT ALL ...............................................        4        43.1%
                  REF OR DK                                                                    0.3%
                 [Not asked                                                                   12.4%]

As before, those who answered “none at all” to this question—constituting 43.2% of the entire

sample—were immediately classified as non-offshorable. The rest were asked this follow-up

question:

Q31a. If work like yours is done elsewhere rather than face-to-face, do you think the quality
      would deteriorate a lot, a moderate amount, a little, or none at all?

                  A LOT .............................................................1   17.3%
                  A MODERATE AMOUNT..............................2                        8.1%
                  A LITTLE .......................................................3       9.1%
                  NONE AT ALL.............................................. 4             9.9%
                  REF OR DK                                                               0.1%
                  [Not asked                                                             55.6%]

If we again take the 3s, the 4s, and half the 2s as telling us that their jobs are potentially

offshorable, that group would constitute 23.1% of the entire sample.

     Adding the two pieces together yields an estimate that 4.4% + 23.1% = 27.5% of the jobs in

the overall sample are offshorable, a number right in between Blinder’s (2009b) “moderate” and

“aggressive” estimates. Incidentally, this more complicated breakdown of the data shows why it

would be unwise to rely solely on the answers to Q29 (“how much face-to-face contact…?”) to


14
  About 85% of these respondents reported face-to-face contact with customers, about 58% reported face-to-face
contact with suppliers or contractors, and about 61% reported face-to-face contact with students or trainees. Again,
multiple responses were common.


                                                                                                                   19
decide on offshorability. According to the calculations just outlined, among respondents

answering that their jobs involve no face-to-face contact at all, only 34% wind up classified as

offshorable—which is pretty far from 100%. Meanwhile, among respondents answering that

their jobs entail at least some face-to-face contact, the percentage classified as offshorable is

26%—which, while lower, is pretty far from zero.

     However, the more complicated measure of offshorability just explained (based on the

answers to questions Q29, Q31, and Q32) and the simple self-reported measure of offshorability

discussed earlier (based on question Q27) do not correlate as highly as might be hoped. For

example, among respondents who say that their jobs require a lot of face-to-face contact with

people other than fellow workers, about 77% also say their job cannot be done at a remote

location (that is, they answer “3” to Q27)—which makes sense. But about 9% of such people

report that their jobs can be done at a remote location (they answer “1” to Q27), which makes us

wonder if they understood the question. At the other end of the offshorability spectrum, among

respondents who say that their jobs require no face-to-face contact with people other than co-

workers, only 36% report that their jobs are easily done from a remote location.

     There is both good news and bad news in these comparisons. The bad news, of course, is

that there appear to be some inconsistencies in the responses, which is hardly unusual in survey

work.15 The good news is that the three assessments of offshorability each contain independent

information not contained in the other. Given how little we know about assessing offshorability,

more information is perhaps welcome.

     We have now used self-reported information from jobholders to derive three different

estimates of the share of U.S. employment that is offshorable. They are 25.3%, based on self-


15
  See, for example, Zaller (1992, Chapter 4). The unusual responses in this survey are not literally illogical. But
they do make you wonder what kinds of jobs these people have.


                                                                                                                      20
reporting via Q27; 21.4%, based on self-reporting via Q29 only (which we are inclined to

discount); and 27.5% based on supplementing Q29 with questions Q31 through Q32a, as just

described. In addition, we noted earlier that external coders rate about 23% of all jobs as

offshorable. The average across all four estimates is 24.3%. And if exclude the 21.4% figure, as

we will do in what follows, the average rises to 25.3%. More important, all four estimates are

remarkably close, given the inherent imprecision in each. They are also remarkably close to

Blinder’s (2009b) range, which was 22.2% to 29.0% based on occupations, not on individual

responses. As a robust stylized fact, about one-quarter of U.S. jobs appear to be offshorable.

      To facilitate comparisons among our three preferred measures of offshorability—which we

will henceforth refer to as “self-classified” (using Q27), “inferred” (from responses to Q29

through Q32), and “externally-coded”—we compressed the responses to the first and third

measures into a two-point scale to make them directly comparable with the second measure. In

the three 2x2 contingency tables shown below, “Yes” indicates that the respondent’s job is

offshorable while “No” indicates that it is not. The tables show that the percentage of cases in

which two indicators of offshorability agree ranges from 70.2% (externally coded versus self-

classified) to 78.6% (self-classified versus inferred from responses). The corresponding “kappa”

coefficients range from 0.19 to 0.47. 16




16
  κ, which is analogous to a correlation coefficient, is probably unfamiliar to most economists. See Maxwell (1970)
for an explanation. In the 2x2 case, denote the four elements of the contingency table (using decimal fractions) as:

     Our overall conclusions, then, are twofold. First, a wide variety of indicators of

offshorability, based on both self-reporting and professional coding, suggest that roughly 25% of

U.S. jobs are offshorable. Second, the alternative indicators of offshorability are different, either

because of measurement error (e.g., misclassifications) or because the various indicators of

offshorability differ conceptually—probably both. But third, the commonalities across the

measures greatly exceed the differences. There is much more agreement than disagreement in

these ratings.17

     Offshorability versus routinizability

     Earlier, we noted that the Autor, Levy, and Murnane (2003) concept we call

“routinizability” is related to but different from offshorability. Our survey also included several

questions pertaining to routinizability. The main such question was:

    Q25b. How much of your workday involves carrying out short, repetitive tasks? Would you
say…
            Almost all the time .........................................1 32.4%
            More than half the time ..................................2    17.2%
            Less than half the time, or ..............................3    27.3%
            Almost none of the time ..................................4    22.7%
            REF OR DK                                                       0.5%

17
  Indeed, the degree of disagreement is exaggerated a bit by our procedure for collapsing multiple responses down
to two categories. To do so, we divided “mixed” or “partial” responses 50-50 using a random number generator,
which creates some spurious disagreements.


                                                                                                                22
Clearly a low number on this scale indicates a high degree of routinizability, so that a computer

or robot might be able to do the job well. If you are looking for an estimate of how many jobs

have “high” versus “low” routinizability, the sample divides almost exactly 50-50. On the other

hand, if you are looking for an estimate of how many jobs cannot be done by a computer to any

significant extent, the estimate is a low 23%. While this indicator of routinizability is clearly

another imperfect measure, we at least expect to find that more of the people answering 1 and 2

to this question (and thus in easily routinizable jobs) are in offshorable jobs, as compared to the

people answering 3 or 4 (and thus in jobs that are harder to routinize).

       But we do not. In fact, according to the self-classified measure of offshorability (from Q27),

only 18.3% of the routinizable jobs are offshorable versus 32.2% of the non-routinizable jobs.

Similarly, if we use our inferred measure of offshorablility (from Q29-Q32) instead, we find that

20.5% of routinizable jobs are offshorable versus 34.3% of non-routinizable jobs. Finally, if we

use external coders’ ratings of offshorability, there is essentially no difference in offshorability

between routinizable and non-routinizable jobs. Thus, not only are the two criteria—

routinizability and offshorability—conceptually different, as we have emphasized, they are not

even positively correlated. The latter is certainly surprising.

       Offshorability and occupational licensure

        One way in which workers in particular occupations might seek to protect their positions

from the threat of offshoring is by requiring practitioners to obtain a government license to do

the work. For example, existing technology allows radiology to be offshored rather easily, but

licensure largely prevents it.18 Instead, while much radiological work does get outsourced, it goes

to cheaper domestic locations—say, to Indiana rather than to India.



18
     See Levy and Yu (2006).


                                                                                                       23
        We find clear support in the PDII data for the notion that licensure deters offshoring, or at

least offshorability as we measure it. According to the external coders, only 6.5% of jobs for

which a license is needed are offshorable, versus 24.3% of jobs for which no license is needed.

The other measures of offshorability agree, though with less dramatic differences. Using self-

classification to measure offshorability (Q27), 17.1% of licensed jobs and 28.3% of unlicensed

jobs are offshorable. Using our inferences from the answers to Q29-Q32, the corresponding

figures are 16.7% versus 31.1%. Thus, in all cases, licensure and offshorability are negatively

related, as expected.



         3. Measuring Offshorability

        The survey results outlined in the preceding section yield four different--though not

independent--estimates of the fraction of U.S. jobs that are potentially offshorable. Of these, we

have focused on three: two based on self-reporting and the other based on judgments by external

coders. The four estimates span a reasonably narrow range, from 21.4% (which we think is too

low) to 27.5%. Thus a number in the 24-25% range might be a reasonable distillation of these

disparate results. But even if we accept the entire range, the four estimates are all very close in

the policy-relevant sense mentioned in Section 1: Each estimate represents a non-trivial minority

of all jobs, roughly comparable to the shift from manufacturing to services between 1960 and

now.19 In other words, the shift toward service offshoring is a potentially dramatic labor market

transformation.

        But raw tabulations take us only so far. We would like to know, for example, what types of

jobs are most and least offshorable, and what types of people are most and least likely to be in

offshorable jobs.
19
     In 1960, 31.0% of payroll employees worked in the manufacturing sector. By 2008, this share was down to 9.8%.


                                                                                                                24
        Offshorability by occupation

        Table 2 reveals some sharp disagreements between our survey respondents and Westat’s

professional coders regarding the offshorability of different occupations. For example, survey

respondents rate about half of all “management, business, and financial” occupations as

offshorable, while coders rate only about one-sixth of them as offshorable. On the other hand,

Westat’s coders—following our instructions—rate 81% of “production occupations” (which are

mainly in manufacturing) as offshorable, versus only about 20% from our respondents

(averaging the two versions). Other large discrepancies appear in “service occupations,”

“farming, fishing and forestry,” “construction,” and “installation, maintenance, and repair.” In

each case, it seems to us, the professional coders make the more reasonable judgments.

        Offshorability by Industry

        In what sorts of industries is offshorability prevalent, and in what industries is it rare? Table

3 displays estimates of offshorability by 12 major industry groups.20 Here, once again, we see


20
     Major industry groups are defined as those employing at least 3% of the workforce.


                                                                                                                 25
what seems to be overestimation by our survey respondents of the offshorability of jobs in

construction, retailing, transport, education, health care, and food services—with far lower

numbers from external coders in each case. Correspondingly, survey respondents are far less

sanguine than external coders about the possibilities for offshoring in manufacturing.21 In both

cases, we think the external coders are closer to the mark. But all three measurements agree that

offshorability is very high in Finance and Insurance, Information, and in Professional and

Technical Services.

     Offshorability by educational level

     Disagreements are much smaller when it comes to appraising offshorability by educational

attainment. (See Table 4.) The survey respondents see offshorability as (roughly) increasing as

you move up the educational ladder. The external coders do, too, but with one major

discrepancy: They rate people with advanced degrees as in substantially less offshorable jobs.


21
  This discrepancy may point to a flaw in the question. Manufacturing workers do have to be physically present as
their workplaces. But, in most cases, the factory could be abroad. Respondents may not have understood that.


                                                                                                                 26

    Offshorability by income class

    Classifying workers by their (annual) incomes produces pretty similar rankings across

methods, and also leads to the conclusion that higher income people are in more offshorable

jobs—except perhaps at the top. (See Table 5.)

    Offshorability by race and sex

    Tables 6 and 7 show only small differences in offshorability between blacks and whites and

between men and women—with one major exception. According to the external coders, but not

the survey respondents, blacks are far less likely to be in offshorable jobs than whites.

    Offshorability by age

    Table 8 shows that all three methods strongly agree that the two youngest age groups—

comprising 16- to 24-year-olds—are concentrated in the least offshorable jobs, and they weakly

agree that offshorability by age follows a roughly hill-shaped pattern. But they disagree on where

the peak of the hill comes. According to self-classification, offshorability peaks at ages 35-44.

Our inferred measure of offshorability puts the peak coming at ages 25-35 instead. And Westat’s

professional coders put the peak offshorability age range at 45-54.

    Offshorability by geographical region

    Finally, does the offshorability of U.S. jobs vary much by region? Table 9 shows that the

answer is no.

     4. Empirical models of offshorability

    Cross tabulations, such as those just presented, are useful descriptive devices. But they take

us only so far when the various categories are not orthogonal. So this section reports on an initial

attempt to develop some multivariate ordered probit models to explain offshorability (as a multi-

category variable).

    Table 10 presents three different ordered probit models, one for self-classified offshorability

(our Q27), the second for inferred offshorability (our Q29-Q32), and the third for offshorability

as recorded by Westat’s coders. In each case, the offshorability categories are ordered from

lowest to highest. As explained previously, there are four categories for self-classified

offshorability (the left-most column) and five for externally-coded offshorability (the right-most

column). To put our inferred measure of offshorability (the middle column) on an equal footing,

we expanded the ratings from the simple “yes, no” classification discussed earlier (offshorable or

not) to six categories, as follows (with sample shares in parentheses):




                                                                                                  29
                1: some face-to-face contact, remote delivery impossible (43.1%)
                2: no face-to-face contact, remote delivery impossible (7.2%)
                3: some face-to-face contact, some remote delivery possible, but with a lot of quality
                   deterioration (21.3%)
                4: no face-to-face contact, some remote delivery possible, but with a lot of quality
                   deterioration (0.8%)
                5: some face-to-face contact, some remote delivery possible, with little or no quality
                   deterioration (23.0%)
                6: no face-to-face contact, some remote delivery possible, with little or no quality
                   deterioration (4.4%)


        With only a few exceptions (e.g., unionization, licensure, and some of the industry

dummies), the three estimated models look different. For example, while the two models

explaining survey respondents’ answers agree that the most educated workers tend to be in the

most offshorable jobs, the model for externally-coded offshorability does not.22 The coefficients

of experience look superficially similar in the three models,23 but the quadratic terms show that

the estimated functional relationships are quite different. So are the coefficients of sex, race, and

routinizability. The most consistent findings across the three models are that unionization and

licensing reduce offshorability substantially.

        Clearly, such disparate results mean that much more work is necessary before we can say

anything econometrically about the determinants of offshorability at the individual level. But

Table 10 does underscore a point made earlier: that the three different measures of offshorability

measure different things. So maybe we should not expect the three estimated models to have

similar coefficients in any case. As suggested earlier, if forced to choose, we would select the

external coders’ ratings as the most reliable indicators of offshorability.




22
     Blinder (2009b) also found a weak positive relationship between education and offshorability.
23
     Job tenure was not significant.

     5. Empirical models of the effects of offshorability

    We now turn from the determinants of offshorability to its effects. For example, do more

offshorable jobs pay lower wages, ceteris paribus? Are the people holding such jobs experience

subject to more frequent layoffs?

    Offshorability and wages

    Starting with wages, we present estimated coefficients (and standard errors) from three

standard log-wage equations in Table 11, adding a set of from three to five offshorability

dummies to each regression. In each case, the offshorability dummies are ordered so that higher

numbers connote greater offshorability, and the omitted category is the least offshorable. In




                                                                                                32
estimating these wage regressions, we dropped cases in which respondents were unable to report

a current wage because they were not currently employed (roughly 8% of the sample).

     In terms of the impact of offshorability on wages (top panel of the table), the results across

the three different measures are consistent only in one respect: With one trivial (and

insignificant) exception, they agree that the least offshorable jobs (the omitted category) pay the

lowest wages, ceteris paribus. This finding is surprising once you realize that the regression

controls for the usual determinants of wages—including education, experience, unionization, job

tenure, and even whether or not the job’s tasks are mostly routine. By contrast Blinder (2009b),

studying occupations rather than individuals, found that the most offshorable occupations carried

a sizable wage penalty.

     Beyond that, however, the estimated effects of offshorability on wages, while mostly

statistically significant,24 display no consistent pattern across the three regression models. Using

self-classified offshorability, the most offshorable jobs are estimated to pay the highest wages.

With inferred offshorability, the dummies display an erratic up-down-up pattern. And with

externally-coded offshorability, the relationship is hill-shaped: The highest wages are paid to

workers in the three middle categories. Overall, there is no clear “sign” to the effect of

offshorability on wages.




24
  The F-statistics for omitting the offshorability dummies are, respectively, 10.4, 14.7, and 8.1 in the three
regressions.

     Most of the remaining coefficients in Table 11 are unremarkable, extremely consistent

across specifications, and also insensitive to whether the offshoring dummies are included or

excluded (not shown in the table). Just a few aspects of these otherwise-standard wage equations

are worth noting:

        Our survey gathered a direct measure of work experience, rather than relying on the usual

         proxy based on age and schooling; and we used that measure in the regressions reported

         in Table 11.

        The survey also recorded each respondent’s tenure on his or her current job, which gets

         independent estimated effects on wages that are similar in magnitude to those of general

         experience.25

        Routine jobs, as defined earlier, are estimated to pay about 16-17% lower wages than

         non-routine jobs--a large effect, equivalent to almost three years more schooling.

        Licensed jobs are estimated to pay 14-16% higher wages than unlicensed jobs, another

         large effect.26

        Across the four main geographical regions, wages appear to be about 11-12% higher in

         the West. The other three regions look about the same.

     Offshorability and layoffs

     Since offshorability is often associated with job insecurity, our final empirical question is

whether people in more offshorable jobs are more susceptible to layoffs. To look into this issue,

we developed a simple probit model using characteristics of both the worker and the job to

predict the answer to the following survey question: “Have you lost a job at any time in the last


25
   Remember, however, that one more year of experience on the current job increments both “experience” and “job
tenure” by one. So, roughly speaking, one year of experience on the present job is worth two years of previous
experience.
26
   Kleiner and Krueger (2008) also found that licensing has a strong positive effect on wages.

                                                                                                              35
three years?” This question is admittedly imperfect, as respondents may have changed jobs (and

thus changed job characteristics) during the three-year period. But short of collecting an entire

three-year work history, it is the best we can do. It also has the advantage of being comparable

with studies of data from the Displaced Workers Survey, which also cover three-year periods (cf.

Farber (2009)).

     Table 12 displays the estimates, once again using our three alternative measures of

offshorability.27 The individual offshorability dummies are never statistically significant; the

highest p-value is about 0.1. Nor do the groups of offshorability dummies come close to

statistical significance in any of the models, according to the relevant χ2 tests.28 However, the

point estimates do display a consistent pattern: The highest layoff probabilities seem to occur

somewhere near the middle of the offshorability spectrum, not at either extreme.

     A few of the other coefficients are interesting. Race and sex dummies are not significant in

the layoff model, which may be surprising.29 General work experience actually has a modest

positive effect on the probability of layoff, which is certainly surprising. But tenure on the

current job has a strong negative effect, as would be expected.30 The “high education” dummy

indicates respondents with at least some college; they are, naturally, less likely to have

experienced a layoff. So are people who work for non-profits. Interestingly, people in licensed

jobs are considerable less likely to have been laid off, while people in routinizable jobs are a bit

more likely (though not significantly so).




27
   Each regression also includes a constant and occupation and industry dummies. Very few of these dummies are
significant. The most notable exception is that people in sales are significantly more likely to have experienced a
layoff.
28
   The p-values of the three χ2 tests are 0.83, 0.59, and 0.33.
29
   Blacks are more likely to experience layoffs, but the coefficients are not significant.
30
   The quadratic functional form implies that this effect troughs at about 23.5 years of job tenure, and then turns
upward.

        As a quick summary of both Tables 11 and 12, we would say that offshorability has pretty

minor estimated effects on either wages or layoff probabilities.

        6. Summary

        We have examined several ways to use conventional survey techniques to assess the

offshorability of the jobs that American workers held in 2008. All of our measures agree that

roughly 25% of U.S. jobs are potentially offshorable. When reduced to binary indicators of

whether a person’s job is offshorable or not, our three preferred measures of offshorability agree

between 70% and 80% of the time. Furthermore, subject to a great deal of uncertainty owing to

the fact that there is no objective standard of comparison,31 we judge that professional coders

provide the most accurate assessments of offshorability. This is very good news since it implies

that, e.g., the Census Bureau could collect data on offshorability on a routine basis without

adding a single question to the CPS.

        In terms of empirical findings, offshorability appears to be particularly prevalent in

production work and in office and administrative jobs. By industry group, it is most common in

manufacturing, finance and insurance, information services, and professional and technical

services. More educated workers appear to hold somewhat more offshorable jobs. But

differences in offshorability by race, sex, age, and geographic region are all minor. In estimated

multivariate econometric models, offshorability does not appear to have consistent systematic

effects on either wages or the probability of layoff. When offshorability is treated as the

dependent variable, its econometric determinants are quite sensitive to how offshorability is

measured. However, union members and people in licensed positions are always less likely to

hold offshorable jobs; and, perhaps surprisingly, routine work is no more likely to be offshorable

than other work.
31
     However, there is high inter-coder reliability.
