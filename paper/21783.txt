                                         ABSTRACT

Insurance plan design has important implications for consumer welfare. In this paper, we model
insurance design in the Medicare prescription drug coverage market and show that strategic
private insurer incentives impose a fiscal externality on the traditional Medicare program. We
document that plans covering medical expenses have more generous drug coverage than plans
that are only responsible for prescription drug spending, which translates into higher drug
utilization by enrollees. The effect is driven by drugs that reduce medical expenditure and treat
chronic conditions. Our equilibrium model of plan design endogenizes plan characteristics and
accounts for selection; the model estimates confirm that differential incentives to internalize
medical care offsets can explain disparities across plans. Counterfactuals show that strategic
insurer incentives are as important as selection in determining endogenous plan characteristics.

1    Introduction

The welfare generated by private health insurance critically depends on the structure of benefit packages offered by

insurers. More generous benefits provide increased enrollee risk protection but are costly to the risk-bearing insurer.

Increasing generosity mechanically increases plan expenditures and, more important from a welfare perspective, in-

creases the likelihood of moral hazard and adverse selection. An optimal insurance plan must balance these gains

from risk protection against inefficiencies due to asymmetric information; a large theoretical and empirical literature

in economics analyzes these issues.

    Less well-studied are insurers’ strategic responses to other incentives that shape plan design. In this paper, we

focus on a potentially important friction in the equilibrium determination of insurer plan characteristics. Patient care

often spans different treatment modalities (e.g inpatient, office visits, outpatient surgery, specialist care, pharmaceu-

ticals), and coverage for one type of care may interact and spill over to other services, creating the potential for an

externality (Goldman and Philipson (2007); McGuire (2011); Goldman, Joyce and Zheng (2007)). We focus on a

classic example: a substantial body of evidence shows that more generous pharmaceutical coverage increases drug

adherence, preventing future inpatient utilization. Unless insurers are responsible for coverage across linked treatment

modalities, they will have limited incentives to internalize this externality in their benefit design decisions. The welfare

impact of these benefit design decisions are potentially large, as the level and composition of consumption of health

care services depend on insurer benefit design. We model plan design and estimate the impact of this externality by

studying the mandated separation of covered benefits categories for private insurers providing services in the United

States Medicare system in Medicare Part D.

    The Medicare Part D program provides prescription drug coverage to beneficiaries through private plans that

are publicly financed. In 2015, over 39 million Medicare beneficiaries signed up for a Part D plan, accounting for

$137 billion in drug spending. Under the Medicare Part D program, there are two major categories of drug plans:

stand-alone prescription drug plans (PDPs) and Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug (MA-PD) plans. Stand-alone

PDPs are mandated to cover only pharmaceutical expenditures, while MA-PD plans cover both drug and medical

expenditures. These differences imply that the two types of plans face different benefit design incentives. Stand-alone

PDPs have an incentive to minimize drug expenditures, ignoring the impact on medical spending, while MA-PD plans

have an incentive to minimize overall medical and drug expenditures taking externalities from drug consumption to

medical care utilization into account. As a result, MA-PD plans have an incentive to provide more generous coverage

for drugs – particularly for those drugs for which increased adherence reduces medical expenditures.

    Our primary data source is the rich Medicare Part D prescription drug event data. We observe every prescription

fill for the years 2006-2009 for a random 10% sample of all Medicare eligibles. These data contain information

on the specific drug filled, retail price, enrollee out-of-pocket cost (OOPC), and fill date for over 123 million drug


                                                             2
claim events. We supplement these data with information on beneficiary and plan characteristics. The beneficiary

data contain information on enrollee demographics and the plan enrollment detail. The plan data contain detailed

information on the premiums and benefit design (e.g., which drugs are on each benefit tier and the coinsurance/co-

payment structures of each tier).

    We begin our empirical analysis by comparing the benefit designs of PDP and MA-PD plans. The comparison is

challenging because there are over 35,000 unique pharmaceutical products for which plans need to determine cost-

sharing, and plans generally employ a complex nonlinear cost-sharing design. Over our sample period, the Part D

standard benefit package included a deductible, an initial coverage region where enrollee cost-sharing is limited, the

donut hole where the enrollee is responsible for 100% of the cost of their drugs, and finally the catastrophic region

where the enrollee is responsible for only a small fraction of drug cost. Using the detailed prescription level data with

over 123 million claims, we estimate that MA-PD plan enrollees on average pay between 11 percent less out-of-pocket

on average for the identical bundle of drugs in the donut hole. The differences across plan type are larger for sicker

enrollees. Furthermore, consistent with externalities playing a key role, the out-of-pocket price differentials are largely

driven by drugs that have been explicitly identified as having large medical care offsets and treat chronic conditions

like asthma, diabetes, and high cholesterol. We then examine enrollees’ behavioral response to these price differentials

and calculate that they lead to MA-PD spending $99 per enrollee more on prescriptions than their PDP counterparts.

    We then turn to our main empirical exercise: specifying and estimating the structural parameters of an oligopoly

model of premium and benefit design choice. In order to capture insurer incentives, we model both consumer plan

choice and insurer benefit design. Importantly, our model allows for drug expenditures and preferences to vary across

consumers, and captures the extent to which differences in generosity by plan type can be rationalized by consumer

demand and selection. We also allow strategic insurer incentives to vary by plan type. The model recovers cost

and demand side parameters, enabling us to understand the economic rationale behind increased prescription drug

benefit generosity in MA-PD plans. Consistent with previous work, the demand side estimates imply that consumer

responsiveness to plan generosity when choosing plans is modest. The model parameters imply that the increased

generosity of MA-PD plans is driven by both asymmetric information and insurer cost side incentives. Consistent

with importance of offsets, MA-PD plans find it less costly to increase generosity than their stand-alone counterparts.

    Using the model and parameter estimates, we measure the impact of various economic forces on benefit design,

including the effect of plans internalizing the externalities generated by offsets. We find substantial medical care

offsets in MA-PD plans: a $1 increase in prescription drug spending reduces non-drug expenditure by approximately

27 cents.1 If stand-alone PDPs are forced to account for this externality in their premiums and benefit design behavior,
    1 These offsets of medical care costs are viewed as sufficiently important to be included in government budget forecasts of health care expendi-

tures, and are consistent with previous estimates. This estimate aligns with previous work by Chandra, Gruber and McKnight (2010), who examine
offsets using demand-side consumption. We cannot employ a similar strategy because we do not observe medical claims for enrollees in MA-PD
plans.




                                                                         3
they would increase insurer drug spending by 8%. Critically, we show that adverse selection also has an impact on

benefit design: absent selection, insurer drug spending would increase by an additional 7%. Based on these estimates,

we find that stand-alone Part D plans impose a $378 million externality on traditional Medicare each year. In contrast

to a large literature focused on the dead-weight loss due to moral hazard and over-consumption of medical services,

our paper finds evidence of potential under-consumption, but shows that insurers will internalize offsets if incentivized

to do so.

    In addition to explicitly modeling incentives to internalize offsets, our model allows for both asymmetric informa-

tion and behavioral biases. Specifically, we account for selection and screening incentives (Geruso, Layton and Prinz

(2016); Carey (2017); Lavetti and Simon (2014)) and moral hazard (Finkelstein, Einav and Polyakova (2016)). We

also explore the impact of behavioral biases including inertia (Ho, Hogan and Scott Morton (2015); Polyakova (2016)),

and explore the impact of choice frictions and the under-utilization of cost-effective care (Abaluck and Gruber (2011);

Ketcham et al. (2012)) and Manning et al. (1987), Brot-Goldberg et al. (2017)). Critically, our modeling approach ac-

counts for imperfect competition among insurers (Decarolis, Polyakova and Ryan (2015)) and extends existing models

that endogenize prices but hold product characteristics fixed (Handel (2013); Lustig (2010); Starc (2015); Town and

Liu (2003); Tebaldi (2017); Ericson and Starc (2015)). By incorporating all of these features, we can explore the impli-

cations of endogenous product benefit design in the Medicare Part D market, discuss policy-relevant counterfactuals,

and provide a framework for future researchers.

    Our work also expands on the recent literature examining insurer competition in private Medicare markets (e.g.

Decarolis, Polyakova and Ryan (2015); Curto et al. (2015)); more broadly, we contribute to a recent and growing

literature on endogenous product design (see Fan (2013) as well as Crawford (2012) for a review).2 The paper is

organized as follows. Section 2 describes the market, and Section 3 presents the reduced form estimations. Section 4

describes and estimates our model of firm behavior. Section 5 presents counterfactual exercises that put the magnitude

of our effect in context, and Section 6 concludes.



2     Empirical Setting and Data

In this section, we describe the role of private insurers within Medicare, which provides health insurance to the elderly

in the United States.3 Private insurers play an important role in administering benefits; as a result, our setting is a

data rich – if institutionally complex – laboratory in which to explore endogenous product design. Medicare Parts A

and B cover inpatient and outpatient services, respectively. Medicare Advantage (Part C) and Part D are administered
    2 Fan (2013) is the closest to our setting, as she explores continuous quality attributes. See also Draganska, Mazzeo and Seim (2009); Eizenberg

(2014); Sweeting (2010); Wollman (2016).
    3 Medicare also provides health insurance coverage for the disabled and those with End Stage Renal Disease. We do not focus on those popula-

tions in this paper.




                                                                         4
by private insurers. Medicare Advantage is an alternative to traditional Medicare under Parts A and B, and Medicare

Part D covers prescription drugs. Under both Medicare Advantage and Part D, Medicare beneficiaries are given

information on the plan’s premiums and benefit design and can select into any of the available plans in the area;

competitive pressures should motivate insurers to offer low premium and cost-efficient products.


2.1     Private Plans and Medicare

Medicare Part C, the first broad private insurance option available to Medicare beneficiaries, was created under the

Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act in 1982. Over its history, the program has gone by a variety of names (see

McGuire, Newhouse and Sinaiko (2011) for a comprehensive history), and is currently known as Medicare Advantage.

Medicare Advantage plans give Medicare beneficiaries the option to forego traditional Medicare and enroll in a private

insurance plan for their health care benefits. MA plans are attractive because they typically offer more generous

coverage. For each beneficiary that it enrolls, the plan receives a risk-adjusted, per-capita payment from the Centers

for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The plans also earn revenue from premiums paid directly by enrollees.4

The program’s popularity has waxed and waned over time, coinciding with the generosity of federal subsidy. As of

2009, the last year of our sample, 24% of all Medicare beneficiaries and 23% of Part D beneficiaries were enrolled in

a Medicare Advantage plan.5 There is significant geographic and demographic heterogeneity in the popularity of MA-

PD plans: MA-PD plans are typically more attractive to middle and lower income as well as healthier beneficiaries

within a market. Finally, the typical MA market is concentrated. In 2008, the largest four carriers had 45% of total

MA enrollment.6

      Premiums and benefit generosity in MA are determined through the plan’s “bid” (the dollar amount the plan

estimates will cover Part A and B benefits for a beneficiary in average health) and the county-level benchmark. If the

plan’s bid is above the benchmark, the plan’s payment from the government is the benchmark plus the premium, which

is the difference between the bid and the benchmark. If the plan’s bid is below the benchmark, the plan’s payment

is their bid plus 75% of the difference between the bid and the benchmark. The plan must use the payment between

the bid and the benchmark (the “rebate”) to fund benefit enhancement for enrollees. Benefit enhancements include

reductions in medical care cost-sharing, provision of added, non-Medicare benefits such as dental coverage, increased
    4 During our sample period, there were two types of MA plans – those with Part D coverage bundled in (MA-PD) and those that do not cover

pharmaceuticals. MA-PD plans receive an additional Part D subsidy from the government and a premium payment from the enrollee. In 2009, the
vast majority of MA plan beneficiaries (82%) were enrollees in a MA-PD plan.
    5 During our entire sample period, from 2007-2009, approximately 1 in 4 beneficiaries was enrolled in a MA-PD plan. Enrollment rates have

continued to grow post-Affordable Care Act (ACA).
    6 The MA program is important from a policy perspective due to its sheer size in terms of enrollees and budget impact, but despite its popularity

among beneficiaries, the MA program has always been controversial. There is substantial debate about the level of spending in MA as compared to
traditional Medicare; cherry-picking by MA plans could lead to over payment by the federal government or skew benefit design to attract favorable
risks (Brown et al. (2014); Carey (2017)). Furthermore, a more recent literature argues that a substantial portion of the private gains from the MA
program accrue to insurers, though the exact magnitude is a matter of debate (see Cabral, Geruso and Mahoney (2014); Curto et al. (2015); Duggan,
Starc and Vabson (2016)). By contrast, a number of papers highlight the potential for better medical management under MA (Afendulis et al.
(2011)). There is also evidence that the benefits of Medicare Advantage may spill over to traditional Medicare beneficiaries (Baicker, Chernew and
Robbins (2013)).



                                                                         5
generosity of the drug benefit, and reduction of additional premiums. The payments made to the plan are ultimately

risk-adjusted based on the expected average cost of the plan’s enrollment. MA-PD plans also submit a separate bid for

the Part D component and the payments that flow from that bid follow the Part D rules discussed below.

    The Medicare Part D program, enacted under the Medicare Modernization Act in 2003, was introduced in 2006.

Medicare beneficiaries can enroll in a private insurance plan that provides prescription drug coverage. For most

Medicare beneficiaries, there are two ways to obtain Part D coverage. They can enroll in a stand-alone plan (PDP)

that only covers prescription drugs or they can enroll in a MA-PD plan. Typically, enrollees in PDPs receive their

medical coverage from traditional Medicare. Outside of the direct impact on plan enrollment, the PDP plans have little

incentive to consider the influence of their benefit design decisions on enrollee medical care utilization. Part D is also

heavily subsidized and because of this subsidy it is financially beneficial for most Medicare beneficiaries to enroll in

some form of drug coverage.

    The program requires insurers to provide coverage at least as generous as the standard benefit, which has a nonlin-

ear structure in which the beneficiary pays differing out-of-pocket costs depending on the phase of the benefit design.

The deductible in 2008 was $275, followed by 25% cost-sharing in the initial coverage region (ICR) up to $2510 of

expenditure, followed by the infamous donut hole phase where the enrollee incurs the entire cost of drug expenditures

and, finally, catastrophic coverage where the enrollee faces a 5% coinsurance rate. Despite the large number of plan

offerings typically available, markets are typically concentrated. Over 50% of Part D beneficiaries enroll in plans

offered by three carriers.

    While the strict regulation of Part D plans creates a minimum standard for plans, PDP and MA-PD plans can

provide more generous coverage than the minimum. In fact, the majority of plans in our sample offer coverage more

generous than the standard benefit. The majority of these plans eliminate the deductible, and nearly one quarter of

MA-PD plans had some form of donut hole coverage in 2006.7 In addition to providing coverage that is at least

actuarially equivalent to the standard benefit, plans must cover all or substantially all drugs within six protected drugs

classes and two or more drugs in another 150 categories. The set of PDP plans available depends on which of the 34

regions an enrollee lives in, while the set of MA-PD plans available depends on the county of residence.

    Like MA plans, Part D plan premiums and government payments are determined through plan bids. The premium

subsidy, paid by CMS, is also calculated using a formula that averages over plan bids. Premiums are calculated as the

difference between the bid and the subsidy paid by CMS. To mitigate adverse selection, CMS employs a three-pillar

risk equalization system within Medicare Part D. First, the government provides individual reinsurance during the

catastrophic phase of the standard benefit, covering 80% of drug expenditure after an individual has incurred substan-

tial drug costs. Second, risk adjustment attempts to equalize insurer profitability across beneficiaries by increasing
   7 By contrast, only 6% of PDP plans had donut coverage in 2006. The donut hole is being phased out as a part of the ACA. See Hoadley et al.

(2014) for additional details.




                                                                      6
subsidies for sicker enrollees. Despite this, there may still be selection conditional on the risk adjustment (Brown et al.

(2014); Carey (2017)). Third, risk corridors provide down-side protection against plan-level losses and cap plan-level

profit margins. Finally, CMS provides additional subsidies to a subset of beneficiaries through the low-income subsidy

(LIS) program.8

      To summarize, during our sample period, a senior eligible for Medicare had multiple private insurance choices.

They could opt out of traditional Medicare and into a Medicare Advantage plan and the private Medicare Advantage

insurer would be responsible for all medical spending. The federal government would pay the insurer a fixed subsidy

payment per month for both the medical and prescription drug portion of the plan benefit; enrollees may be required to

pay a premium as well. By contrast, the beneficiary could instead remain in traditional fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare

and choose to augment Medicare Parts A and B with a Part D plan. The private Part D insurer would cover drug

expenditure, while the Medicare program would cover non-drug medical spending directly, including hospitalizations

and physician services. The federal government would pay the insurer a fixed subsidy payment per month for the

prescription drug benefit; enrollees are required to pay a premium as well. Private insurers in Medicare Advantage

have an incentive to take any offsets into account; in this paper, we focus on the behavior of MA-PD plans relative

to stand-alone PDPs. As our discussion highlights, the institutional setting in which plans compete for both Medicare

Advantage and Part D are complex. Our empirical analysis, in particular our structural demand and supply framework,

accounts for this complexity.


2.2     Pharmaceutical Benefits Design and Medicare Care Offsets

An underlying premise of our analysis is that increased pharmaceutical cost-sharing leads to reductions in prescription

drug consumption and that decrease in drug consumption leads to an increase in medical care utilization. In this

subsection, we review the existing evidence.9 Numerous studies have documented the presence of medical care offsets

as related to changes in drug benefit design and the importance of considering these offsets in optimal insurance design

(Goldman and Philipson (2007); McGuire (2011); Goldman, Joyce and Zheng (2007)). The evidence for meaningful

offsets spans a variety of settings including employer-sponsored insurance (Gaynor, Li and Vogt (2007)), the Medicare
    8 LIS eligibles comprise 28% of the total Part D population. They receive a subsidy equivalent to the region specific LIS benchmark and can

enroll in any plan. If they enroll in a plan with a premium below the benchmark, they must pay the difference between that benchmark and premium
but they still receive the benefit of the subsidized cost-sharing. Importantly, plans that offer premiums below the LIS threshold are eligible for
randomized auto-enrollment of LIS beneficiaries. Previous research has highlighted that the presence of the LIS subsidy can distort plan bidding
incentives (Decarolis (2015); Decarolis, Polyakova and Ryan (2015)).
    9 A long literature, including the RAND health insurance experiment (Manning et al. (1987)), has shown that increased cost-sharing causally leads

to a reduction in the consumption of pharmaceuticals. More recent evidence indicates that these reductions in consumption affect both high- and low-
value services (Brot-Goldberg et al. (2017); Baicker and Goldman (2011); Maciejewski, Farley, Parker and Wansink (2010); Maciejewski, Bryson,
Perkins, Blough, Cunningham, Fortney, Krein, Stroupe, Sharp and Liu (2010)). Within the Medicare Part D setting, multiple papers (including
this one) have exploited the non-linear benefit structure to measure the behavioral response to cost-sharing (Abaluck, Gruber and Swanson (2015);
Einav, Finkelstein and Schrimpf (2015); Finkelstein, Einav and Polyakova (2016); Dalton, Gowrisankaran and Town (2015)). This literature
finds that increased cost-sharing reduces drug consumption and that cost-sharing in the donut hole is especially salient to consumers. Dalton,
Gowrisankaran and Town (2015) find enrollees reduce the number of prescriptions filled by 21% upon entering the coverage gap. Furthermore,
there is evidence that the introduction of the Part D program is associated with reduced hospital admissions in the Medicare population (Afendulis
et al. (2011)).



                                                                         7
population (Chandra, Gruber and McKnight (2010) and specifically in the Medicare Part D program (McWilliams,

Zaslavsky and Huskamp (2011)). The Congressional Budget Office, based on a survey of the literature, assumes that

a 1% increase in drug consumption reduces non-drug medical consumption by 0.2% (CBO (2012)). Cost-sharing can

lead to sub-optimal consumption because of discrepancies between private willingness to pay and social marginal cost

for a variety of reasons. There may be asymmetric information about the value of treatment (Manning et al. (1987))

or misalignment across multiple technologies (Ellis, Jiang and Manning (2015); Goldman and Philipson (2007)) or

payers (see Cabral and Mahoney (2014)). Underutilization of drugs may also be “due to mistakes or behavior biases,”

referred to in the literature as behavioral hazard (Baicker, Mullainathan and Schwartzstein (2015)).10 In sum, there is a

large, robust literature documenting that among health care consumers in general and Medicare enrollees specifically,

drug adherence is negatively impacted by increased cost-sharing. Furthermore, this reduction in adherence leads to an

increased likelihood of utilization of non-pharmaceutical medical care.


2.3     Insurer Incentives and Benefit Design

In this subsection, we provide the conditions under which MA-PD plans have an incentive to offer more generous

plan benefits than their stand-alone PDP counterparts. Our framework here is similar to Goldman and Philipson

(2007) and McGuire (2011). Consider a model in which insurers choose the premium, p, and enrollee pharmaceutical

cost-sharing, xD . In order to focus attention on drug benefits, we hold constant MA-PD medical care cost-sharing.

Premiums and drug plan generosity (which affects plan costs, enrollment and selection) are chosen in order to max-

imize static profits, taking the subsidy setting rules and, for the MA-PD plans, medical care costs, as given. We first

describe endogenous benefit design for a stand-alone prescription drug plan, then expand the analysis to take into

account differential incentives faced by MA-PD plans. Variable profits for a stand-alone PDP are given by:


                                                     ΠPDP = p + z − cD (xD ) s(p, xD )B,
                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                (1)


where p is the premium, z is the federal subsidy, cD (xD ) is the average insurer cost of providing pharmaceuticals to

consumers given benefit design xD , B is the size of the relevant Medicare population, and s(p, xD ) is the plan’s market

share, which is a function of all plans premiums and cost-sharing decisions. Insurers collect premiums and subsidies

and pay out claims for each Medicare beneficiary they enroll (“enrollee”). Insurer costs are a function of endogenous
                                              ∂ cD              ∂s
plan characteristics. We assume that          ∂ xD
                                                     < 0 and   ∂ xD
                                                                      < 0. As enrollee cost-sharing increases, the plan’s cost decreases

because there is a mechanical relationship between cost-sharing and plan cost. Costs can also decrease in xD because
   10 Within the context of the Part D program, the behavioral bias most frequently explored is myopia (Abaluck, Gruber and Swanson 2015, Dalton,

Gowrisankaran and Town 2015). Ex ante, consumers may be naive or sophisticated about the potential for underutilization due to information
issues, behavioral biases, or both. A sophisticated consumer will demand an insurance contract that corrects for this underutilization of high-value
services to the extent that they value reduced spending or improved health, creating a market for value-based insurance designs (Ellison (2006);

of both moral hazard and adverse selection. Share is decreasing in out of pocket costs as consumers prefer plans with

less cost-sharing. The first order conditions for any product characteristic is given by:


                                                                     ∂s   ∂ cD
                                                       p + z − cD        −      s(p, xD ) = 0.                                   (2)
                                                                     ∂ xD ∂ xD

    As with any consumer good, insurers must trade off margins and market share. In addition, the presence of

asymmetric information in the form of adverse selection and moral hazard implies that all insurers must consider how

product characteristics affect their costs.

    Medicare Advantage plans face a different set of incentives than stand-alone PDP plans. Consider the choice to

increase the generosity of a prescription drug plan. The PDP knows that this will directly increase costs, as they bear

a higher percentage of a fixed drug expenditure. In addition, higher generosity plans may attract sicker consumers

(adverse selection) and induce enrollees to spend more (moral hazard).11 MA-PD plans will also take these factors

into account; in addition, a MA-PD plan must consider the impact that drug expenditure has on overall medical

expenditure. If there are offsets, increased drug expenditures lead to reduced (non-drug) medical expenditures. More

formally, we can write the profit for the MA-PD as


                                                ΠMA = p + z − cD (xD ) − cM (xD ) s(p, xD )B.
                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                 (3)


    Holding the medical benefit structure fixed, average total costs for a MA-PD are the sum of drug and (non-drug)

medical costs: cD (xD ) + cM (xD ). MA-PD plans may differ from PDPs in their cost-sharing arrangements if there are

offsets between drug benefit generosity and medical costs. This is easily seen by examining the first-order conditions

with respect to xD :


                                                                  ∂s     ∂ cD ∂ cM
                                      p + z − cD (xD ) − cM (xD )    D
                                                                       − ( D + D )s(p, xD ) = 0.                                 (4)
                                                                  ∂x      ∂x   ∂x

    In the presence of offsets           ∂ xD

                                                              can be written as the offset (how a dollar of drug expenditure reduces

medical expenditure) multiplied by the demand response (how increased plan generosity changes drug expenditure).

Comparing the first-order conditions in equations 2 and 4, it is clear that the MA plan faces different incentives

when designing their drug benefits. Specifically, they have an incentive to internalize the impact of changes in drug

plan generosity on medical care utilization and, all else equal, offer a more generous benefit design; estimating the

magnitude of this incentive and the subsequent welfare implications is the focus of the remainder of the paper.
  11 In   this simple framework, we do not allow for premiums to affect plan selection.

2.4      Data

Our primary data are the rich Medicare Part D prescription drug event data. We observe every prescription fill for the

years 2006-2009 for a random 10% sample of all Medicare eligibles. For much of our analysis, we aggregate these

data to the enrollee-year level. We supplement these data with information on beneficiary and plan characteristics and

merge in MA subsidy payment levels and county and metropolitan demographic information.

      We begin the construction of our analytic sample by capturing all beneficiaries that were enrolled in a PDP or

MA-PD plan between 2007 and 2009. This gives us 7,597,476 enrollee/year observations. We exclude any enrollees

who receive low-income subsidies and are subject to lower cost-sharing.12 This restriction leaves us with 4,802,000

enrollee-year observations. We then drop any enrollees for whom we do not have claims in 2006 to control for previous

consumption, leaving us with 3,534,965 enrollee/year observations for our analytical data set.

      Summary statistics are presented in Table 1. In the full sample, the average enrollee is 77 years old, 62% are female

and 90% are white. Average total annual expenditure is $1763. There is substantial heterogeneity in enrollee annual

drug spending, as highlighted in Figure A.2, which plots a histogram of total spending in both MA-PD and standalone

PDP plans in 2008.13 While we observe rich data on drug spending, we do not observe non-prescription medical

claims for MA-PD enrollees; an important goal of the structural analysis is to compensate for this data limitation by

inferring the level of medical expenditures and, importantly, the offset from insurer benefit design decisions.14



3      Reduced Form Evidence

We begin our empirical analysis by examining whether the differential benefit design incentives described above

translate into realized differential benefit designs between PDP and MA-PD plans. We estimate the parameters of the

claims-level OLS regression equation given by:



                                            Log(OOPCcd jt ) = αd + τt + β 1(MA jt ) + εcd jt ,                                                  (5)


where OOPCcd jt is out-of-pocket price per day supplied in prescription claim c for drug d in plan j and year t. The

parameters αd and τt are drug and year fixed effects. The drug fixed effects are at the National Drug Code (NDC)

level, which capture all of the variation related to the detailed product and package (i.e. 20mg of Lipitor).

      Table 2 presents the results. In the first specification, we include drug and year fixed effects. In the second, we
   12 While we drop LIS enrollees for our main analysis, we run numerous robustness analyses to test the sensitivity of our findings to supply-side

responses to the presence of the LIS population.
   13 There are a couple observations to highlight: first, as expected, there is excess mass at the initial coverage limit, as highlighted by Einav,

Finkelstein and Schrimpf (2015). Second, enrollees in MA-PD plans spend substantially less on prescription drugs than PDP enrollees. We control
for this observed heterogeneity by controlling for lagged consumption in both our reduced form results and consumer demand system. To do this,
we create five consumer types corresponding to the five quintiles of their 2006 spending. Total consumption in the first group averages $895 per
year for 2007-2009, while yearly spending in the top quintile averages $3503.
   14 Given that CMS encrypts the beneficiary identification variable, linking the CMS pharmacy claims to MA claims is not currently feasible.

control for drug, year and the phase of the prescription drug benefit, as insurers can alter enrollee cost-sharing given

the benefit structure or the benefit structure itself. The results show a consistent pattern. For MA-PD plans, enrollees

face an OOPC per days supply that is 4-7% lower, holding the drug (NDC) constant.15 Table A.7 shows that the plan’s

cost per day supplied for a given drug is equal across plan types; negotiated prices are not systematically higher or

lower for MA-PD plans and do not explain our empirical results.

    We also estimate equation 5 for different samples based on the type of drug. In Figure A.3, we show that the

differential cost-sharing results are larger for specific drug classes likely to have large medical care offsets.16 We

find statistically larger effects among drugs used to treat diabetes, asthma, and hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol). In

Panel B of Table 2, we present the equivalent regression results. Enrollee OOPC per days supply in MA-PD plans

is approximately 10% lower for asthma drugs, diabetes drugs, and cholesterol drugs. The results for hypertension

(high blood pressure) are more mixed. In Figure A.4, we show that this is due to heterogeneity across types of

hypertensives. For the most cost-effective, recommended initial therapy (non-beta blockers, NICE (2011)), the effect

is in the expected direction. Finally, to examine how these OOPC differences manifest across the benefit phases, we

estimate Equation 5 restricting the sample to deductible and ICR claims and donut hole claims. Panel C of Table 2

shows that the OOPC differences are most pronounced in the donut hole. Going forward, we will focus on enrollee
   15 In the appendix, we show some evidence that enrollees in MA-PD plans are more likely to fill 90-day prescriptions, which likely contributes

to increased adherence; the estimates imply that 1.4% more prescriptions are 90-day fills under MA-PD plans, making the effect small, but still
indicative of differential strategies by plan type. In unreported regressions, we find that the OOPC cost for hyperlipidemia drugs in MA-PD plans is
12-15% lower than in PDP plans, consistent with lower out-of-pocket costs for drugs for chronic conditions.
   16 Specifically, we targeted by value-based insurance designs in the commercial insurance market (Chernew, Rosen and Fendrick (2007);

Gowrisankaran et al. (2013)).



                                                                        11
costs in the initial coverage range – which composes the bulk of fills and represents the effective marginal price for

most enrollees – and in the donut hole – where we observe substantial variation and which is especially salient to

enrollees.

    Table 3 aggregates to plan level characteristics. The first row shows that PDP plans are slightly more likely to have

a deductible than MA plans (though the difference is not statistically significant). The next two rows show that the

average costs – per prescription or per day supplied – are significantly lower in MA plans. However, the substantial

difference in costs per day conflates lower costs for identical drugs and a different mix of drugs among MA and PDP

enrollees. The latter is especially likely to be important, as MA enrollees tend to be healthier on average and may take

lower cost drugs. Therefore, we characterize plans by a drug premium pDjmt and a cost-sharing schedule xDjmt . Each

element of the vector is defined as a weighted average of enrollee OOPC per days supply using national consumption

weights, as defined below.

    To create each plan design variable, we construct an average price per days supply for each product d in each

levels of consumption, we average the days supply by drug-year combination to create qdt . The weighting allows us

to construct a measure of enrollee OOPC that does not depend on enrollee behavior:


                                                                 Phase

    Table 3 also describes summary statistics for each of these variables. Cost-sharing is lower in MA-PD plans,

especially in the donut hole, where the average enrollee OOPC per days supply is 11% lower ($1.71 versus $1.93 for

PDP plans). Figure 1 shows the vast majority of stand-alone enrollees do not have any gap coverage, while over half of

MA-PD enrollees have at least some gap coverage by the end of our sample. Furthermore, we show in Appendix Table

A.1 that it is costly for MA-PD firms to increase the generosity of their drug benefit using our enrollee sample. Once

we account for the average consumption bundle, MA-PD plans also have lower cost-sharing in the initial coverage

phase (46 cents versus 50 cents) and lower premiums. These differences are smaller than those that do not correct for

the composition of drugs consumed, but also indicate that MA-PD plans are likely to be more generous and have flatter

cost-sharing schedules than their PDP counterparts. Figure 2 summarizes the results of differences between PDP and

MA-PD plans in their out-of-pocket prices. The left panel depicts the standard benefit, and the right panel shows the

mean structure by plan types. The figure shows that differences in OOPC are larger for sicker enrollees, for whom

offsets are likely larger in magnitude. An enrollee in the lowest spending quintile would face OOPC 1.5% lower in the

average MA-PD plan; for an enrollee in the highest spending quintile, the difference is 8.6%.

   Armed with evidence of meaningful out-of-pocket price differentials between PDP and MA-PD plans, we turn

attention to describing the behavioral response by consumers. There are several challenges to estimating the demand

response including the potential for enrollee selection and the role of dynamic consumption decisions given the nonlin-

ear structure of the benefit design. We address these challenges using the approaches outlined in Einav, Finkelstein and

Schrimpf (2015) and Finkelstein, Einav and Polyakova (2016) and Dalton, Gowrisankaran and Town (2015). Einav,

Finkelstein and Schrimpf (2015) use bunching at the kink to measure the behavioral response to cost sharing. Dalton,

Gowrisankaran and Town (2015) show that given the nonlinear benefit structure they face, Part D enrollees’ prescrip-

tion drug filling behavior is not consistent with standard models of dynamic drug consumption; the authors estimate a

dynamic model of consumer price salience that explains this behavior.

    Two plots summarize the behavioral response of consumers. The first describes bunching at the kink, similar to

Einav, Finkelstein and Schrimpf (2015), which focuses on the extensive margin (any fill in the last month of the year).

The left panel of Figure 3 shows a consistent pattern across plans, with a similar quantity response in stand-alone

and MA-PD plans; the empirical pattern implies a larger elasticity among MA-PD consumers, who face a smaller

price increase. To examine the differential response to hitting the donut hole, we focus on a sub-sample of enrollees

who start a week with total drug spending between $2000 and $2510 following Dalton, Gowrisankaran and Town

(2015).18 We plot weekly spending, which captures both intensive and extensive margin substitution, as a function

of total spending relative the location of the donut hole. The right panel of Figure 3 shows that consumers reduce

overall consumption as they approach the donut hole; furthermore, there is a discontinuous drop in consumption upon

entering the donut hole.

    Both approaches show that consumers respond to higher cost sharing by reducing drug consumption. In the

appendix, we calculate elasticities using the methods described in Einav, Finkelstein and Schrimpf (2015) and Dalton,

Gowrisankaran and Town (2015) and the variation describe above. We estimate elasticities between -0.53 among

stand-alone consumers and -0.79 (Dalton, Gowrisankaran and Town (2015) approach), consistent with the Einav,

Finkelstein and Schrimpf (2015) approach.19

    Given that consumers respond to OOPC, we expect plan design to affect consumption. The reduced form esti-

mates show that OOPC is 5-7% lower on average in MA-PD plans, with larger differences among drugs for asthma,

diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Given the elasticities we measure, our results imply an increase in drug
   18 We focus on the period starting on the last Sunday of March and ending on the second to last Sunday of July. The logic behind this sample

selection criterion is that the shock that results in the enrollee entering the donut hole should not change the enrollee’s expectation about the
likelihood of entering into the donut hole during the year. That likelihood is very close to one.
   19 We calculate similar differences between predicted and actual probabilities of purchase in December.

consumption of 6%, with larger impacts among high offset drugs; our reduced form results imply an additional $99

of drug spending in MA-PD plans.20 Using the Congressional Budget Office estimates of offsets (a 1% increase in

drug consumption reduces non-drug medical consumption by 0.2%), the increase in drug consumption leads to a 1.2%

reduction in medical spending. Given that our results are concentrated in high offset drugs, we expect the true effect

to be larger in magnitude. Of course, MA-PD insurers have additional tools to increase consumption; for example,

Table A.7 shows suggestive evidence of additional use of 90 day fills in MA-PD plans, which may improve medication

adherence. In the appendix, we show that the causal effect of MA-PD enrollment is to both decrease overall out-of-

pocket expenditure and increase total drug expenditure, as well as the fraction of expenditure paid for by insurers.21

The effect is larger in magnitude (13%) but not statistically different from the effect that would be predicted by price

differences alone. Taken together, the results in this section show a consistent pattern. MA-PD plans are designed in

ways that reduce enrollee cost-sharing and, to a lesser extent, increase drug consumption. The effect is concentrated

in drugs likely to generate large offsets. We next examine the incentives MA carriers face to internalize offsets using

a model of insurer benefit design.



4     An Oligopoly Model of Premiums and Benefit Design

In this section, we describe our empirical model of equilibrium insurer benefit design and outline our estimation

strategy. We estimate the structural parameters of the model in order to (1) decompose demand and cost side rationales

for MA-PD plans to offer more generous drug coverage; (2) provide estimates of the implied externality of increased

drug coverage and the magnitude of the offset; and (3) perform policy counterfactuals. Our model is simple enough

to be tractable yet rich enough to capture the complexity of equilibrium insurer behavior when setting premiums and

benefits. We describe the empirical model, then describe our demand specification and parameter estimates, and then
  20 A 7% decrease in OOPC and an elasticity of -0.79 implies a 5.6% increase in consumption; average consumption (taken from Table 1 is

$1762.78 per year.
  21 This causal effect would not be detected via an ordinary least squares regression, which is likely to be contaminated by selection.

4.1         Empirical Model

Our empirical model builds on the framework described in Section 2.3; however, several institutional complexities

require modifying the illustrative model. Following Decarolis, Polyakova and Ryan (2015), we explicitly incorporate

plan bidding and the risk stabilization programs. We assume that the expected profits for stand-alone PDPs are a

selection. A jmt represents the set of consumers who purchase good j which yields share s jmt . As described in Section

2, the insurer collects premiums and subsidies and pays out claims for each Medicare beneficiary it enrolls. We

decompose individual costs into two additive components such that cD       D                      D       D

first component varies with plan benefits (either because of moral hazard or adverse selection or both) that may not

be fully captured in risk-adjustment. The idiosyncratic term, ηi jmt , is realized after all the plan’s premium and benefit

design decisions.

cM     D
 jmt (xmt , r̄ jt ) is the plans expected medical cost as a function of prescription drug benefits and mean Part D risk

score. Similar to stand-alone PDPs, MA-PD plans must submit bids for medical coverage, incur costs that depend

on individual and plan characteristics, and receive risk-adjusted subsidies. Unlike stand-alone plans, we observe

separate bids for the drug and medical portions of MA benefits. Moreover, product characteristics affect MA-PD costs

in two additional ways. First, drug plan characteristics could lead to selection that increases or decreases medical

costs. Second, prescription offsets imply that drug plan characteristics could increase or decrease prescription drug

expenditure, which could, in turn, increase or decrease medical expenditure. Because MA subsidies were generous

during our time period, many plans have zero premiums; these plans may include “rebates” to enrollees, which can be

used to provide additional services or reduce Part B premiums (which are required even for consumers in MA plans).25

    Our formulation of firm profits captures the bidding mechanism, risk corridors, and risk adjustment. However,

four assumptions deserve additional attention. First, we focus on the coinsurance schedule, as directly modeling

formulary placement of every drug is computationally unfeasible. Second, we assume that plans do not account for
  24 There are separate subsidies for the non-drug component of MA-PD plans that vary at the market level; we incorporate these explicitly.

Therefore, higher generosity due to more generous subsidies will not imply offsets. We abstract from MA rebates, which should increase the
value of plans, but relax this assumption in Table A.12. We also estimate similar parameters when restricting to subsamples of plans for which the
minimum standard regulation does not bind.
  25 We include these net premium reductions directly in the definition of bM ; the consumer pays a composite premium equal to bM + pD . We
                                                                            jmt                                                    jmt     jmt
can allow the value of the rebate to be reduced by 25% in accordance with CMS bidding rules, which require that the government share in the
savings of MA plans that bid below the benchmark. Table A.12 shows that this will not affect our estimates of the key parameters of interest.


                                                                         18
their impact on the benchmark when submitting bids. Given the large number of plans, we believe this is a reasonable

assumption. Third, we initially assume that insurers set optimal strategies ignoring cross-elasticities between plans in

different sectors (for example, increasing the bid of Humana’s PDP plan decreases the enrollment of Humana’s MA

plan) and then explore extensions to the model that incorporate multi-product firms.26 Finally, we note that we need

not impose an assumption of optimal pricing for PDP plans; we will never use the first-order condition with respect to

drug premiums, though we will utilize the optimality of MA bids to infer costs (similar to Curto et al. (2015)). We do

not observe medical claims for Medicare Advantage plans because the federal government does not collect these data

for researchers, and private proprietary data cannot be linked to our administrative data.27


4.2      Plan Choice

The first step in our analysis is to estimate consumer preferences over plans. We flexibly estimate PDP and MA-PD

demand using a nested logit model that allows preference parameters to vary with observed health status, which we can

measure using our detailed claims data. A consumer’s choice set is defined at the county-level and a product is a county

specific insurance contract. While Part D insurers have identical offerings within the 34 large PDP regions, MA-PD

plans can choose which counties to enter within a region. Medicare assigns both contract IDs and plan IDs. In MA-PD

plans, the contract ID is typically specific to a geographic market; in stand-alone plans, the contract ID is typically

national and the plan ID within a contract ID specific to the geographic market. As is standard in the literature, a MA-

PD product is defined as a unique Medicare contract ID. Following a number of papers (Lustig (2010); Nosal (2011)),

if there is more than one MA plan within a contract-county combination, we use the premium of the lowest numbered

plan among MA-PD plan. A stand-alone PDP plan is defined as a Medicare contract ID-county combination; we

average cost-sharing parameters within a county and the individual’s OOPC are based on their market. Assuming

one Medicare plan ID per county within a contract, this is equivalent to defining the product at the Medicare contract

ID-plan ID combination.

      While firms select xDjmt , consumers care about their expected out-of-pocket costs for enrollment in plan j, OOPCi jmt .

OOPCi jmt is a nonlinear, individual specific function of xDjmt . We construct OOPCi jmt by developing a function that

maps total drug spending into out-of-pocket costs, taking insurer cost-sharing, consumer consumption, and the struc-

ture of the standard benefit as given. For example, a consumer ending the year in the initial coverage phase will have

OOPCi jmt equal to the deductible (if any) and the number of days supplied in the initial coverage phase multiplied by
  26 Finally, we note that assumptions about drug premium setting are especially important as previous research has highlighted that the presence

of the LIS subsidy can distort plan bidding incentives (Decarolis (2015); Decarolis, Polyakova and Ryan (2015)). In Section 4.3.4, we test the
robustness of our estimates to each these assumptions.
  27 The first order condition with respect to bids provides no information about the relationship between generosity and costs assuming that for

small changes in generosity, the optimal drug premium is unchanged. In counterfactual exercises, we will allow firms to reprice and product
characteristics to adjust simultaneously.




                                                                      19
 ICR .28 The relationship between the structure of Part D benefit, insurer choice variables, and OOPC is described in
Pjmt

Figure 2: the first panel describes the standard benefit, the second panel describes how the insurer choice variables

captured by xDjmt map into OOPCi jmt and differences across plan types. This formulation implies that market shares

are a function of insurer choice variables because insurer choice variables affect consumer OOPC.

    In our baseline specification, we divide the sample into five types of consumers based on quintiles of 2006 total

drug spending. In each quintile q, consumer utility for plan j (which can be either a PDP or a MA-PD plan) in market

m at time t is given by:


                                  uq jmt = ξq j + αqp pDjmt + αqx OOPCq jmt + ξq jmt + ζig + (1 − σq )εi jmt ,                                 (12)


where ξq j are time-invariant, vertical plan characteristics (i.e., plan fixed effects) that vary across consumer types, pDjmt

is the drug premium, OOPCq jmt = f (xDjmt ) is a function of the average OOPC per days supply as is defined above,

ξq jmt represents time varying shocks to unobservable vertical plan characteristics, ζqg is common to all products in

nest g and has a distribution function that depends on σq with 0 ≤ σg < 1. Beneficiaries are assumed to choose the

plan that yields the highest utility. We assume three nests in this specification: PDP plans, MA-PD plans and the

outside good. We do not directly model the impact of MA-PD non-drug premiums on consumer choice in MA-PD

plans. The vast majority of plans have zero (non-drug) premiums, and some rebate a portion of the Part B premium,

reducing salience to consumers and making measurement difficult.29 As is standard in differentiated product demand

systems, unobserved plan characteristics are captured by ξq jmt . The outside good consists of both no drug coverage

and any coverage not associated with a stand-alone PDP or MA plan (such as an employer-sponsored plan). We

assume that εi jmt is distributed extreme value and thus ζqg + (1 − σq )εi jmt is also distributed extreme value. We allow

plan unobserved quality, premium and OOPC coefficients, and the dissimilarity term to vary by consumer type. In

mathematical terms, ξq j , αqp , and αqx are all indexed by q, implying that preferences over the time-invariant features of

plans (plan fixed effects), premiums, and generosity are all allowed to vary by consumer type.30

    In order to capture firm incentives, we must identify the causal impact of premiums and OOPC on plan enrollment.

Our estimates will be biased if ξq jmt is correlated with premiums or product characteristics that influence OOPC. We

address this issue via a two-pronged approach. First, we include product fixed effects, ξq j , that are allowed to vary

with consumer type: the unobserved product characteristic is the deviation from the plan mean for the quintile in

question. Second, we instrument for the premium, OOPC, and the inside share. Following the logic of the reduced

form identification strategy described in the appendix, the instrument for the inside share is the urban dummy interacted

with an MA-PD dummy, which captures the fact that MA-PD plans are more popular in urban counties. As is common

in this setting, we also use Hausman-style instruments: the average premiums and OOPC in all other markets.

    The demand specifications reflect several additional modeling choices. Critically, a number of recent papers (Er-

icson (2014); Heiss et al. (2016); Ho, Hogan and Scott Morton (2015); Miller and Yeo (2014); Polyakova (2016); Wu

(2016)) have documented “stickiness” in plan choice over time. Following Decarolis, Polyakova and Ryan (2015),

we take a reduced form approach to modeling inertia and include plan vintage in the utility function in our preferred

specification; they show that their approach corresponds to “an explicit structural model of inattention and choice”

(Hortascu, Madanizadeh and Puller (2015)). Because we are not explicitly interested in the effect of switching costs

on premiums or benefit design, we do not develop a dynamic model of premium setting or benefit design.31 We allow

for nests containing MA-PD plans, stand-alone PDPs, and the outside option but do not allow for behavioral responses

to average OOPC per days supply to factor into the calculation.32 We do not directly model the impact of the LIS

policy on plan behavior, though we also examine the magnitude of this potential distortions in the robustness checks

subsection and find that our conclusions are robust to the LIS incentives. Finally, while we allow the dissimilarity

term, time-invariant plan quality, and premium and OOPC coefficients to vary by consumer type, the nested logit error

term, ζig + (1 − σq )εi jt , is the only source of unobserved consumer heterogeneity in the model. However, in robustness

analyses, we allow for unobserved consumer heterogeneity; our main findings are not sensitive to allowing for more

flexible patterns of substitution.


4.2.1    Selection

Our model explicitly accounts for selection of enrollees into plans. Advantageous selection into Medicare Advantage

on the extensive margin is accounted for by the fixed effects, which vary by quintile. More importantly, when setting

plan characteristics, the insurer may also be concerned that a more generous drug plan will attract sicker enrollees on

the margin. In order to address potential selection with respect to plan characteristics, we allow for preferences and

drug costs to vary flexibly by consumer type (defined as quintiles of the 2006 drug spending distribution). As premiums
   31 Table A.11 replicates the reduced form results in Ho, Hogan and Scott Morton (2015) that suggest an “invest then harvest” strategy of premium

setting. However, we also show that plan generosity, measured by insurer drug spending, does not exhibit the same pattern. As a result, we do not
believe modeling dynamic insurer behavior in our setting is critical for understanding endogenous plan design.
   32 Put differently, there is no selection on moral hazard and the relationship between PICR , PDonut , and OOPC
                                                                                           jmt    jmt             q jtm is purely mechanical; therefore,

                                                                          21
or generosity changes, plans attract a different mix of enrollees (across quintiles), which accommodates the potential

for selection. If a plan becomes more generous and that disproportionately attracts higher cost enrollees because of

demand heterogeneity, increased costs will be reflected (through a greater weighting of higher cost quintiles) in H D     33
                                                                                                                    jmt .

    Given the literature and reduced form estimates in Table A.3, which show that a MA-PD and consumer type dum-

mies account for a substantial amount of variation in insurer expenditure, our approach accounts for nearly all of

the heterogeneity in drug costs that could be observed or predicted by the insurer. Einav, Finkelstein and Schrimpf

(2015) find a raw monthly correlation of drug consumption of 0.5; Hsu et al. (2009) argue that “approaches that in-

clude information on prior-year drug use or costs perform markedly better than the current Medicare risk-adjustment

approaches.”34 Furthermore, our flexible demand estimates explicitly allow heterogeneity in preferences to be cor-

related with heterogeneity in costs. Our model does not explicitly accommodate selection with respect to formulary

design (Carey (2017); Lavetti and Simon (2014)), but we will show that our results are robust to allowing for more

heterogeneity by defining finer consumer types and allowing for unobserved consumer heterogeneity.35


4.2.2    Demand Parameter Estimates

The results of the demand specifications for each of the five consumer groups are in Table 4. Panel A describes base-

line results that do not account for plan vintage. While we allow the utility parameters to vary across drug spending

quintiles, we do not find meaningful heterogeneity in the premium or OOPC coefficients. The premium coefficient is

negative and significant in all specifications, sicker consumers are slightly less price sensitive than healthier consumers,

consistent with adverse selection with respect to generosity. The OOPC coefficient is much smaller in magnitude than

the premium coefficient, consistent with the results in Abaluck and Gruber (2011) and becomes attenuated among

sicker consumers. We note OOPC is observed with error and its coefficient estimate may be attenuated; while differ-

ences across consumer groups may reflect differential preferences, they could also reflect larger measurement error

among higher spending enrollees.36

    Own premium elasticities are quite sensible and range from -4.6 to -5.7, depending on (observed) consumer type.

This is consistent with the results in Decarolis, Polyakova and Ryan (2015); our estimates for stand-alone plans range

from -5 to -6.3. Finally, across all groups, the nested logit dissimilarity parameter indicates that MA-PD (stand-alone)

plans are much closer substitutes for other MA-PD (stand-alone) plans than stand-alone (MA-PD) plans.

    Panel B describes our preferred estimates, which account for the impact of plan vintage. While the premium
   33 We also implicitly allow changes in drug premiums to alter the risk pool the firm attracts through deviations from the average claim within a

consumer type, though this will not affect our empirical implementation.
   34 Furthermore, the degree of selection conditional on risk adjustment in these market is a matter of debate; see Newhouse et al. (2015); Brown

et al. (2014). Our specification allows for consumer heterogeneity in preferences by including flexible plan fixed effects that can vary by consumer
type, which implicitly allows for differential selection into plans based on consumer type.
   35 For example, we explore deciles of 2006 total drug spending, conditioning on demographics, or considering only high offset drugs.
   36 The estimated difference in the parameters suggests that consumers are naive about under-consumption that may lead to future adverse medical

events or financial costs. They do not demand more generous plans as a commitment device.

elasticities and the relative preference for lower OOPC are similar in magnitude, there are two key differences to

highlight. First, we estimate a smaller nesting parameter, indicating greater substitution within nests. Second, the

effect of plan vintage differs with consumer characteristics. Consistent with Ho, Hogan and Scott Morton (2015), we

find that consumers with relatively low claims are unlikely to switch. In addition, we find that the sickest consumers

are even less likely to switch, perhaps due to strong brand preferences. This enrollee inertia implies that, if lower

drug prices is an investment in reducing future enrollee hospitalizations, plans are likely to earn a return from that

investment. Heterogeneity in the degree of inertia is critical for understanding differences in plan incentives, as we

describe below.


4.3     Endogenous Plan Design

To understand the role of medical cost offsets in plan design and to perform counterfactuals, we model insurer behavior,

taking our demand estimates as given. In order to estimate the key parameters of interest, we must first construct plan

level measures of expected medical and drug costs. We first estimate cM
                                                                      jmt by utilizing the fact that we observe separate

bids (and, therefore premiums) and subsidies for the medical and drug spending components of MA plans; we calculate

these medical costs “offline” separately for each plan and assume that they are known to the firm in the rest of the

supply side estimation. We impute medical costs for MA-PD enrollees (for whom medical claims are not observed)

by inverting the plan’s first-order condition with respect to the MA bid, assuming firms bid optimally given premium

elasticities, bids, subsidies, and observed market shares, as in Curto et al. (2015). Formally, for MA-PD plans,

                                                                                              ∂ sq jmt −1

             q jmt , subsidies zqt , shares s jqmt are allowed to vary with consumer type. For this calculation, we average

costs across quintiles and assume consumers view drug and medical premiums equivalently. We further assume that

the expectation of the deviations of medical costs from the average is zero: medical bids do not affect selection among

MA-PD plans and we do not explicitly model non-drug benefit design except through the determination of the rebates.

We calculate subsidies using the formula provided by CMS, averaging 74.5% of bids. We estimate average margins

of 14%, similar in magnitude to those obtained by Curto et al. (2015).

      Table 5 lists the variables used in our estimating equations and categorizes them as either data, implied objects

from the demand estimation, or parameters to be estimated. Prices, subsidies, market shares, and realized costs are
   37 For the supply side model, we assume that firms optimize each plan’s characteristics, rather than optimizing over their entire portfolio. This

is a simplification due to data availability: we only observe encrypted Medicare contract and plan identifiers in the drug event data. To minimize
the potential bias, we treat the stand-alone PDP contract IDs as the unit of analysis in the supply side estimation. Given high correlation within
nests in the demand system (e.g., a consumer substituting away from a stand-alone PDP is most likely to choose another stand-alone PDP offered
by a different firm), we believe it is unlikely that a consumer will substitute between the MA-PD and PDP plans within a single firm; therefore, this
assumption seems fairly reasonable. The above expression assumes that the minimum benefits constraint is not binding.

more generous, because of asymmetric information or the absence of offsets, the less willing the firm is to increase

generosity. Figure A.5 illustrates the basic logic of our identification argument using average values of the derivatives

of shares with respect to premiums and OOPC.40


4.3.1    Estimation and Selection

We parametrize insurer drug costs as a linear function of OOPC jmt scaled by an average effect across plans θ1 plus

a plan-specific deviation ψ jmt : cDjmt = (θ1 + ψ jmt ) OOPC jmt + ω D             D
                                                                     jmt , where ω jmt captures all the exogenous features

of the plan that affect its drug costs. Medical costs are similarly scaled by a constant effect across plans: cM
                                                                                                               jmt =

                jmt . This parameterization yields                      ∂ OOPC jmt   = θ1 + θ2 1(MA jmt ) + ψ jmt and the profit function can be

written as:                                                                                                                               !

   38 This allows us to abstract from plan selection and allow for “medical management” on the part of MA-PD plans. While we observe point-of-sale

drug costs, we do not observe any rebates negotiated by payers, which are unlikely to affect generosity on the margin. A full model of bargaining
between manufacturers and pharmacy benefit managers is outside the scope of this paper.
   39 For example, consider a $1 increase in the ICR cost. For an enrollee with total drug spending below the deductible, the derivative is zero. For

an enrollee above the initial coverage limit, the derivative is also zero (though this enrollee will reach the limit earlier in the year). In the ICR,
the derivative is equal to the days supply less the days supply required to hit the deductible (the deductible divided by the average retail price).
We do not consider cases in which a (small) change in the phase-specific costs per day supplied would push an enrollee into the next phase of the
benefit design as this effect complicates the analysis substantially and is of second order relevance to the analysis. Furthermore, we do not allow
the enrollee to forecast a behavior response to changes in the phase-level average enrollee costs per days supply.
   40 On the x-axis, we plot different values of the derivative of interest, denoted by θ , while on the y-axis, we plot insurer spending. The results are

slightly different across different phases, but illustrate that the smaller in absolute value θ is, the more the plan spends on drugs.

lowering insurer costs more than one-for-one. If there are offsets and drug demand slopes down, higher OOPC

will increase non-drug medical costs. That is, with adverse selection and/or moral hazard, θ1 < −1. The presence

4.3.2   Supply Side Parameter Estimates

Before presenting our preferred model estimates, we estimate θ assuming that is is constant across all plans. The

estimates are in Table 6. We estimate two sets of parameters: the first set is based on the demand estimates without

vintage effects and the second set uses the demand parameters with vintage effects. The estimates in column 1 imply

that the average Part D plan would save $99.73 per member by increasing OOPC by $100. The estimates using the

vintage effects specification imply a smaller impact of an increase in OOPC. In columns 2 and 4 we allow θ to vary

between PDP and MA-PD plans. Specifically, we parameterize θ j = θ1 + θ2 × 1(MA j ). The impact of increasing

generosity in a MA-PD plan is simply the sum of the two coefficients.42

    The results in column 2 and 4 show that the relationship between plan generosity and insurer costs is economically

statistically different across different types of plans. The impact of increasing generosity is smaller in magnitude for
                                                                                                                           ∂ cDjmt         ∂ cM

the assumption that asymmetric information – including selection along the intensive margin – is constant across plan

types, θ2 measures the cost offset effect. Absent cost offsets, our results would imply substantial intensive margin

advantageous selection among MA-PD plans (increased drug benefit generosity leads to lower average costs, or the

marginal enrollee is much healthier than the average). We find this interpretation implausible and argue that our results

indicate a fraction of the MA-PD insurer’s drug cost is offset by reductions in insurer spending in other areas.


4.3.3     Implied Offsets

Our estimates quantify how changes in cost-sharing arrangements affect insurers’ cost structure. By combining our

estimates with estimates of the observed behavioral response to enrollee cost-sharing, we can calculate the implied

offsets and the impact of counterfactual policies. We take estimates of the behavioral response to cost-sharing from

Einav, Finkelstein and Schrimpf (2015), who estimate a dynamic model of drug consumption.43 Consider a small

enrollee out-of-pocket cost decrease. The price decrease will increase insurer drug costs by an amount equal to the

drug point-of-sale price less enrollee cost for the marginal units, and the price difference times all of the infra-marginal

units. We know from the supply side estimation that the increase in insurer costs associated with lowering enrollee
                                                                                                   ∂ cM

OOPC is smaller for MA-PD plans than stand-alone PDP plans. That is,                               ∂ xDjmt
                                                                                                             > 0 . We can infer the increase in

                                                        jmt , thus the derivative of MA-PD costs with respect to the cost-sharing schedule can be written

    For a 1% uniform decrease in cost-sharing in all benefit phases, we calculate the implied difference in insurer costs

for MA-PD plans as (omitting subscripts for simplicity):

which gives the difference in the change in insurer costs between MA-PD plans and stand-alone PDP plans. The

implied drug cost is simply the point-of-sale cost less implied offsets. This quantity must be equal to the change in

quantity times the difference in the drug cost per day, denoted by cPDP , and a shadow drug cost that incorporates

directly from Einav, Finkelstein and Schrimpf (2015), and use the average empirical value of cPDP ($2.20). We find

cMA = $1.61. Put differently, the “discount” implied by offsets is 59 cents per day supplied, or 27%. The offset

we calculate is very close to previous estimates (see CBO (2012) for a synthesis of the literature using demand side

variation) and obtained using supply side variation.


4.3.4    Robustness

In this section, we test the robustness of the model to assumptions along two key dimensions. First, we explore the

impact and modeling of regulatory constraints. Second, we explore the robustness of our results to alternative demand

specifications.

    Section 2 highlighted a number of regulatory features of the Part D market – including distortions created by the

LIS subsidy – that may affect firm incentives. Decarolis, Polyakova and Ryan (2015) account for this possibility in their

analysis and we following their approach by restricting attention to those contracts that bid above the LIS benchmark

amount in the majority of regions in which they operate. We re-estimate the supply side parameters, assuming that

these remaining contracts will not be distorted by the structure of the LIS subsidy. This restriction leaves fewer

contracts available to estimate the parameters. Nevertheless, the results (presented in Table A.12) are qualitatively

similar to our main specification, indicating that our basic results hold even allowing for the LIS distortion. Similarly,

in the bottom panel of Table A.12, we restrict attention to “enhanced” plans that are unlikely to be constrained by

minimum plan generosity requirements; again, the results are quantitatively similar.46
  44 The shadow drug cost only takes insurer medical costs cM into account and is therefore strictly higher than the “true” shadow cost. This has

important implications for welfare, as discussed in Glazer and McGuire (2013).
  45 For this calculation, we use the average value of enrollee out-of-pocket cost per day supplied and the formula described above, evaluated at

average consumption.
  46 We define a plan as “enhanced” if it has a supplemental premium in at least half of all markets in which it operates. This accounts for 7% of




                                                                       28
    Our current approach relies on plan fixed effects and identifies sensitivity to price and OOPC using cross market

variation. In order to address the role of selection in the determination of contract characteristics more directly, we

model plan choice as a function of contract characteristics. In these specifications, we include premiums, OOPC, and

dummies for deductible and donut hole coverage as the observable characteristics.47 Consistent with previous results,

we find evidence of selection with respect to donut hole coverage in Table A.9: consumers with higher 2006 drug

consumption (our measure of severity) have a higher preference for donut hole coverage. We re-estimate our supply

side parameters using variation from only the ICR price in Table A.12, which eliminates any concerns about selection

with respect to donut hole coverage. Consistent with selection being driven by coverage in the donut hole, we do

not see evidence of adverse selection when we restrict attention to the ICR price. However, the differential effect for

MA-PD plans (θ2 ) is quite similar to our main specifications.48 Because of the flexibility of our demand system, we

believe our baseline approach removes the confounding unobservables that would bias parameter estimates and that

we accurately capture plan incentives for choosing plan characteristics in our setting.49

    Our current approach also models heterogeneity in demand across observable, but not unobservable consumer

characteristics. We argue that, given both the empirical literature and reduced form results, we include most of the

variation across consumers that is predictable to insurers. However, a more flexible demand system may better capture

the patterns of substitution in the data. In Table A.10, we report estimates that allow for a mixture of consumer types,

similar to Berry and Jia (2010). The results are qualitatively similar to our main estimates, though they imply slightly

less price sensitivity among high spenders; we also find evidence that a subset of these consumers are fairly insensitive

to both premiums and OOPC. In Table A.12, we show that our supply side estimates are not sensitive the inclusion of

additional consumer heterogeneity.


4.3.5    Extensions

In this section, we show how our framework can be extended to incorporate additional contractual richness and answer

other key questions of economic and policy importance. In the main empirical exercise, we model insurer choice of

composite measures of plan generosity. We further show that our estimates of consumer preferences are not sensitive

to the exact definition of product characteristics and are in line with previous estimates. Other product characteristics
all stand-alone plans. The analysis omitting LIS plans serves as an additional robustness check along this dimension as plans not eligible for LIS
enrollment are also likely to be more generous than the minimum actuarial standard. These two subsets overlap substantially.
   47 The results in Table 4 imply that sicker consumers are slightly less sensitive to both premiums and OOPC. One concern is that the last result

could be driven by increased OOPC measurement error among sicker consumers and that could have broader implications for our base estimates. In
order to address this, we examine the sensitivity of our supply side estimates to differences in preferences over plan generosity of sicker consumers.
In unreported specifications, we find that increasing the plan generosity elasticity of sicker consumers affects our mean estimate of θ1 , but not
the principal parameter of interest, the interaction with the MA-PD plan dummy (θ2 ). This finding is consistent with a greater degree of adverse
selection but no difference in offsets across severity levels. Finally, we can also estimate our results assuming that firms return the entire rebate to
enrollees and find qualitatively similar results. These results are available from the authors upon request.
   48 In unreported regressions, we also estimate our model with the two cost-sharing parameters directly. While the results are qualitatively similar,

we note that the tariffs are highly correlated, leading to noisier coefficients. Finally, while differential reinsurance and risk corridors may have a
small effect on our results, we believe their impact is directionally ambiguous (Medpac (2015b)).
   49 Finally, we can also estimate our results assuming that firms return the entire rebate to enrollees and find qualitatively similar results.




                                                                          29
may be important to both consumers and policymakers; however, our framework is flexible enough to model additional

plan features.

      For example, we are interested in modeling different generosity among high offset drugs directly. We proceed in

three steps. First, we define xD
                               mtd , the vector of plan generosity specific to a given drug class d. Second, we assume

that consumption of the drug of interest is evenly timed throughout the year in proportion to overall spending, which
               ∂ OOPCq jmt                             ∂ OOPCq jmt
implies that      ∂ xDjmtd
                             will be proportional to      ∂ xDjmt
                                                                   ,   scaled by the difference in phase-specific prices for the focal

drug and all drugs. Finally, we assume that consumer preferences over generosity are not drug class specific; if one

wanted to relax this assumption, they would need to separately estimate demand taking the new product characteristic

into account.

      Table A.13 displays our estimates of θ2 by drug class. Across drug classes with large offsets, we estimate higher

values of θ2 , ranging from 0.36 for hypertension (consistent with MA-PD offering less generous coverage on the

whole in the reduced form) to 0.58 for cholesterol and diabetes drugs. While the estimates are somewhat noisy, the

estimates for asthma, cholesterol, and diabetes are all larger in magnitude than our main estimate of 0.39, indicating

that heterogeneity across drug classes is important in our setting. Our estimates are also closely linked to the reduced

form estimates in Figure A.3, highlighting the variation in the data that allows us to estimate the key parameters of

interest.

      Our framework can be used to further explore endogenous product design in the context of selection and can

help researchers model firm behavior and measure welfare in an “endogenous contracts framework” (Geruso and

Layton (2018)). Thus, we build on an existing literature that considers premium setting conditional on fixed plan

characteristics (Handel (2013); Lustig (2010); Starc (2015); Town and Liu (2003); Tebaldi (2017); Ericson and Starc

(2015)). Future work should explore the impact of supply side regulation, including premium and contract regulation,

within the context of a rich model that does not require fixed insurance contracts.



5      Counterfactuals
In this section, we aim to answer three sets of questions with our model and parameter estimates. First, how would

stand-alone plans design drug benefits if they took externalities into account? Second, how large is the effect relative

to distortions due to adverse selection? Third, how would different subsidy policies affect equilibrium premiums and

benefit design?


5.1     The Effect of Internalizing Externalities

To quantify the importance of the offset, we first consider how PDP plans would adjust plan benefit design if they were

forced to account for non-drug medical costs in the same way as their counterparts in the MA program. Mechanically,

                                                                       30
we set θPDP = θ̂MA and then resolve for a new Nash equilibrium conditional on θ . In the counterfactual equilibrium,

we allow drug costs to the insurer, cDjmt , and premiums to adjust to account for the new incentives.50 In our baseline

scenario, the average MA-PD plan has lower premiums (because of generous subsidies) than the average PDP plan,

which have average premiums of $407 per year. By contrast, the average MA-PD plan spends almost $75 dollars more

per year on drugs ($1285 versus $1211).

    In the top panel of Table 7, we report the results of a simulation in which premiums are not allowed to adjust, but

PDP plans internalize the offset. In the counterfactual, we see that the average PDP plan would spend 7% more on

prescription drugs if they took the entire medical offset into account. In addition, we note that MA-PD plans increase

drug spending: plan generosity is a strategic complement, and there is no implicit trade-off between higher generosity

and higher premiums. Next we report the results of a counterfactual exercise in which insurers are allowed to adjust

both drug spending and premiums. Here, PDP plans increase drug spending by roughly the same amount, but also

increase their premiums by 10% given the additional drug costs.

    The counterfactual benefit design choices have important implications for both enrollees and government budgets.

Critically, the increase in spending on prescription drugs leads to a fiscal savings for the Medicare program through

lower medical expenditures. Our counterfactuals show that stand-alone PDP plans would spend $80 more per year if

they took medical expenditure into account, implying an offset of $21.60 per enrollee per year. Multiplying $21.60

by 17.5 million, the number of stand-alone PDP enrollees in 2008, we find that PDP plans impose an externality of

$378 million per year; based on our bootstrapped estimates, the confidence interval for our estimate ranges from $325

million per year to $431 million per year.51

    We also calculate a measure of consumer surplus (CS) that assumes the parameters of the plan utility function we
  50 We solve for drug costs, rather than phase-specific average out-of-pocket costs, for three reasons. First, drug costs enter into the plan’s first order
condition directly. Second, from a policy perspective, we are primarily interested in impact of different incentives on drug spending. Mechanically,
costs change to fit the model in which the elasticity is taken as given and consumption increases as the cost-sharing schedule changes. Finally,
given the monotonic relationship between the insurer’s choice variables and both OOPC and drug spending, it suffices to solve for the equilibrium
outcome. The first panel of Table 7 presents the baseline results.
   51 We would obtain a similar estimate if we used the implied additional spending by PDP plans in Table 7. By contrast, MedPAC (Medpac

(2015a)) estimates that spending on an equivalent enrollee in a MA-PD plan is approximately 2% higher than traditional Medicare. The average
total Medicare spending was approximately $10,000 per enrollee in 2008 ($200 of additional spending in MA); the externality due to offsets does
not, on its own, imply greater efficiency in MA-PD plans. However, the externality provides evidence of a potential channel through which MA-PD
plans can obtain efficiency gains.
   By contrast, McWilliams et al. (2016) find that the much-discussed Medicare Shared Savings Program led to an aggregate $238 million spending
reduction in the early years; our larger results indicate the potential power of incentive alignment in equilibrium. Our results illustrate the value
of insurer incentive alignment in the Medicare Advantage program and the potential of more efficient benefit design by private insurers, who may
align benefit design more efficiently than the federal government (see also Finkelstein, Einav and Polyakova (2016)). To give additional context,
the changes in MA over-payments due to risk adjustment policies measured in Brown et al. (2014) are approximately $317, or about twice as
large as our causal increase in drug spending. Furthermore, Table A.5 shows that it would be costly for the government to achieve the increased
drug consumption generated by MA-PD plans using a flat cost-sharing subsidy alone; this calculation highlights the advantage of nimbler private
insurers. However, there is no reason that the profit maximization incentives of MA-PD plans necessarily align with any social welfare criterion.
Therefore, another natural policy intervention would be to better align consumer plan choices with value (from a societal perspective, including any
externalities on the traditional Medicare program). Mechanically, we implement this by setting the coefficient on OOPC in the demand system equal
to the coefficient on premiums, such that consumers treat a $1 increase in premiums equal to a $1 increase in OOPC. The results are in the final two
columns of the top panel of Table A.6. If consumers were more "sophisticated" about the potential for underutilization, plans would increase their
generosity. MA-PD plans would spend 5.6% more on prescription drugs, while PDP plans would spend 10.4% more. This increased spending by
standalone PDP plans is less than the amount that fully internalizes the fiscal externality, yet shows that public policies that align consumer demand
or the structure of subsidies with providing value will incentivize insurers to offer contracts that reduce costs or increase health.




                                                                            31
estimate represent primitive preferences. In the counterfactual in which insurers cannot adjust their prices, consumers

like more generous plans and are made better off; the effect is slightly larger than the fiscal savings to the Medicare

program. However, when plans are allowed to adjust their premiums, they raise prices (though by less than the

increase in benefit generosity). Given that consumers dislike premium increases more than they like more generous

plans, enrollees are made slightly worse off.


5.2      The Relative Importance of Strategic Incentives and Adverse Selection

We find that strategic incentives created by offsets drive benefit design in the prescription drug insurance market. Yet

a long literature, dating back to the theoretical contributions of Rothschild and Stiglitz (1976), argues that adverse

selection should have a significant impact on benefit design. To better understand the magnitude of strategic incentives

and selection, we estimate a counterfactual in which we eliminate selection on the intensive margin. We set θ1 =-1 in

addition to internalizing the externality as in the previous counterfactual. As discussed in the previous section, absent

asymmetric information or offsets, we expect a one-for-one relationship between insurer expenditure and enrollee

costs. In the counterfactual, all plans face incentives to internalize offsets, but we have eliminated baseline adverse

selection (along with any moral hazard) among stand-alone PDPs.

      The results are presented in the second panel of Table 7 and show that MA-PD plans would become more generous

absent selection. The magnitude of the effect is the same order of magnitude as the effect of strategic incentives in the

previous counterfactual, though the effects are smaller if premiums are allow to adjust. Stand-alone PDPs also become

more generous: they now spend 13% more on prescription drugs. Given the counterfactual estimates, we conclude

that strategic incentives due to benefit integration are as important as selection in driving market outcomes.52

      We perform two additional counterfactuals to explore the extent to which other features of the institutional envi-

ronment drive benefit design. First, we estimate our main counterfactual using our baseline demand estimates, which

do not account for plan vintage and imply substantially less adverse selection. In this counterfactual, stand-alone PDPs

are much more generous than in our preferred estimates. This implies that accounting for inertia is critical and that

selection – in addition to strategic incentives – plays an important role in benefit design.

      Finally, we explore the effect of imperfect competition on benefit design and premium setting. We estimate a

counterfactual in which plans are constrained to pay out 80% of the premiums they collect in (drug) claims, known as

a (binding) minimum loss ratio regulation. The regulation (enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act) is essentially

a blunt tool that caps insurer profits and reduces incentives to price strategically. If stand-alone PDPs account for

medical expenditure under this pricing rule, they become more generous, consistent with previous results. However,

MA-PD plans actually become substantially less generous – largely because they cannot cross-subsidize prescription
  52 This finding is consistent with Starc (2015), which finds that strategic firm incentives, rather than adverse selection, drive firm behavior (in that
instance, premiums) and margins in a similar setting.

drug expenditure. As a result, enrollees in MA-PD plans are actually made slightly worse off despite lower premiums,

whereas enrollees in stand-alone PDPs are made substantially better off.


5.3         Alternative Subsidy Policies

The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission has recommended that Medicare significantly lower the amount of rein-

surance paid in the catastrophic phase from 80% to 20% while increasing the premium subsidy to maintain the overall

generosity level of government subsidies (Medpac (2016)). We use our model to simulate the impact of this policy in

equilibrium. This counterfactual policy also illustrates the key mechanisms of selection and strategic incentives. The

commission notes that while the change could exacerbate the incentives created by selection, it also creates incentives

for insurers to reduce costs. We expect policies that exacerbate adverse selection to lead to less generous insurance

plans in equilibrium; mechanically, we re-solve for firm incentives and endogenous plan characteristics under the

alternative subsidy structure.

      The results are in Table 7. Consistent with selection driving plan design, plans are much less generous absent

reinsurance: stand-alone PDPs spend 12-15% less on prescription drugs under the alternative policy. Consistent with

strategic incentives driving plan design, the effect is muted for MA-PD plans, which spend 6-9% less on prescription

drugs. Consistent with previous counterfactual results, selection and strategic incentives are equally important deter-

minants of plan characteristics. The policy harms consumers and is costly to the federal government, as consumers

consume fewer drugs, leading to additional medical expenditure.53

      In the appendix, we explore additional counterfactual policies, including those aimed at increasing generosity by

covering a fraction of the plan’s cost. These results highlight the importance of taking strategic insurer incentives into

account when designing policy; insurers will optimize in the face of consumer demand and government regulation.



6       Conclusion
This paper examines how health insurers set premiums and design benefits in equilibrium. We build on empirical

literatures that estimate structural models of insurer decisions and model endogenous product characteristics to show

how cost-side incentives affect insurance benefit design. We examine these issues in the Medicare Advantage and Part

D markets and show that differences in incentives across plan types drive the generosity of the benefits.

      MA-PD plans offer more generous prescription drug plans than their stand-alone counterparts; this increased

generosity is concentrated in those drug categories with large offsets. Our model of firm behavior highlights the

mechanisms that drive this differential: MA-PD plans have an incentive to internalize the effect of medical care
    53 Wehold upstream prices fixed in this simulation; insurers may be incentivized to negotiate additional discounts from manufacturers under the
alternative subsidy structure.




                                                                       34
offsets. By measuring firm incentives, we are able to calculate the size of the implied offset. Our estimate of an

approximately 27% offset is similar in magnitude to demand-side estimates in the literature (Chandra, Gruber and

McKnight (2010); Gaynor, Li and Vogt (2007)). The counterfactuals show how policy changes can increase plan

incentives to help enrollees internalize offsets and explore the impact of alternative subsidies.

   Much of the empirical work on health insurance markets has focused on premium setting. Our model extends

this logic from premium setting (Handel (2013); Starc (2015); Town and Liu (2003); Tebaldi (2017); Ericson and

Starc (2015); Decarolis, Polyakova and Ryan (2015)) to incorporate endogenous plan design. Strategic incentives

meaningfully affect plan features, which in turn impact both health and health care costs. As a result, government

policy plays an important and understudied role in determining how market forces will affect health care utilization

and consumer welfare in the Medicare program.

capture underlying contract characteristics and consumer risk.54 In our second and third specifications, we also control

for demographic characteristics (age, race, and gender), which capture part of the observable risk. In our final, most

conservative specifications, we also control for historical county-level FFS spending, which proxies for county level

variation in medical services, including drugs, that might be driven by differences in patient preferences, medical care

infrastructure and the physician culture (see Finkelstein, Gentzkow and Williams (2016)).

cost advantage in the provision of their drug benefits and differential costs are not a likely source of the benefit design

differential.


A.2      Behavioral Response and Elasticity Estimates

In order to estimate elasticities using the approach described in Dalton, Gowrisankaran and Town (2015), we estimate

parameters from the following regression i:


                         Yit = FEi + λ1 1{2400 < Spendit ≤ Donutt } + λs 1{Spendit > Donut} + υit ,                                      (17)


    where Yit is the weekly drug spending for individual i in week t, FEi is an individual fixed effect, Spendit is the

total drug spending in that year at the beginning of week t for individual i, Donut is the dollar value of the initiation of

the coverage gap phase of the benefit package in that year, and υit is an i.i.d. error term. The individual fixed effects

control for individual selection into the donut hole. Identification is driven by variation in the timing of entering

the donut hole controlling for mean individual characteristics. Given our sample selection, λs coefficient measures

the mean price impact of transitioning into the donut hole phase. We estimate this equation separately for PDP and

MA-PD enrollees.

    The parameter estimates from are presented in Table A.2. Consistent with our reduced form analysis, OOPC

increase as consumers enter the donut hole: the average price increase by 15% for consumers in stand-alone PDPs and

13% for consumers in MA-PD plans. Consistent with the results presented in Figure 3, the parameter estimates show

that upon entering the donut hole, PDP enrollees drop their spending an average of 10%. In contrast, MA-PD enrollees

reduce their spending by 14% upon entering the donut hole; the larger response reflects both a great extensive margin

demand elasticity and a shift to lower cost drugs.56 Comparing these estimates to the estimates of the differences in

OOPC between PDP and MA-PD plans implies a donut hole elasticity ranging from -0.53 (stand-alone plans) to -0.79

(MA-PD plans).
  55 Table  A.8 shows that these differences translate into lower OOPC for consumers.
  56 There  are two points to note here. First, we argue below that MA-PD enrollment leads to a causal increase in average consumption. Second,
we find no evidence of an increased drop in consumption upon entering the donut hole among high offset drugs. Exploring heterogeneity in this
effect is an interesting direction for future work.

A.3       Total Spending

Our goal is to estimate the causal impact of MA-PD enrollment on total drug consumption, insurer, and enrollee drug

costs. However, a naive estimate will be contaminated by selection, as MA-PD enrollees are likely healthier than

non-MA enrollees. Therefore, on average, MA-PD enrollees will have lower drug expenditure than their counterparts

in stand-alone PDPs for reasons other than plan design. This is likely to be true even once we control for a rich set of

individual characteristics.

    Following a series of papers (Afendulis, Chernew and Kessler (2013); Cabral, Geruso and Mahoney (2014); Dug-

gan, Starc and Vabson (2016)), we rely on a statutory discontinuity in MA-PD plan reimbursement to identify the

causal impact of MA-PD enrollment. For counties with relatively low fee-for-service (FFS) spending, payment is set

equal to a floor. Beginning in 2003, differential floors were set for urban and rural counties – approximately two-thirds

of counties are floor counties. Higher reimbursement in urban counties led to more plan entry and higher MA penetra-

tion rates (Duggan, Starc and Vabson (2016)). The evidence strongly indicates that this variation in MA penetration

rates is driven by the differential MA subsidies and is not correlated with individual health risk or other demand side

factors. Furthermore, because an urban county is somewhat arbitrarily defined as one with 250,000 or more in metro

population, it is natural to focus the analysis on comparable counties near each side of the threshold. Consumers in

urban floor counties close to the threshold are more likely to be enrolled in MA-PD plans than consumers in sim-

ilar rural floor counties just to the right of the urban threshold.57 In our reduced form analysis, we use the county

urban/rural status as an instrument in a linear instrumental variable specification; our empirical strategy is a fuzzy

regression discontinuity approach.

    The variation we use in our IV specifications is highlighted in Figure A.1, which plots the probability of MA-PD
  57 We   will also use urban status to predict the inside share of MA-PD plans in the plan choice models.

enrollment as a function of population. This figure depicts a binscatter plot with twenty population bins. We control

for consumer demographics, including risk type, as well annual mean county-level FFS spending and plot the average

probability of MA-PD enrollment. We fit quadratic curves on either side of the 250,000 population cutoff. We see

a dramatic change in the probability of MA-PD enrollment just to the right of the discontinuity. We implement our

identification strategy using an instrument variables framework. Specifically, we estimate:

                                yit jm = Xmt β1 + Xit2 β2 + β3 1(MA) + g1 (popmt ) + µit j ,                       (18)

where β3 is the coefficient of interest, and Xmt     it

spectively. In all specifications, we control flexibly for metro area population. The dependent variables of interest,

yit jm , are total drug spending, consumer OOPC, and insured costs, where j represents a plan. We hypothesize that

insured spending is causally higher in MA-PD plans, and consumer out-of-pocket costs lower. These relationships are

due directly to plan design on the part of insurers; the overall impact of these changes on total expenditure is more

ambiguous, as it depends on the size of the behavioral response, but likely to be positive as well.

   To explore the impact of MA enrollment on consumption, we focus on the 2007-2009 time period. In all specifica-

tions, we control for the consumer quintile of 2006 drug spending, calculated at the national level. In our second and

third specifications, we also control for demographic characteristics (age, race, and gender), which capture part of the

observable risk. In our final, most conservative specifications, we also control for historical county-level FFS spend-

ing, which proxies for county level variation in medical services, including drugs, that might be driven by differences


                                                            45
in patient preferences, medical care infrastructure and the physician culture (see Finkelstein, Gentzkow and Williams

(2016)). We focus the analysis on consumers living in counties with associated metro populations between 100,000

and 400,000.

    Table A.3 reports the results of OLS regressions of total expenditure, OOPC, and insurer spending. These results

are likely biased because of adverse selection into PDP plans – we report them in order to provide a benchmark to

the IV estimates. In the bottom panel, we examine the impact on total expenditure. The first column, which controls

only for year and the quintile of 2006 spending, shows that the average MA-PD enrollee has lower drug expenditures:

total spending on drugs is $252 less than their counterparts in stand-alone PDP plans. The average total expenditure

for this sub-sample is $1697, indicating that MA enrollees have 15% lower drug spending than PDP enrollees. This

lower expenditure is associated with savings in the form of out-of-pocket costs to consumers (a reduction of $178)

and somewhat smaller reductions for insurers ($74 per enrollee per year). The next two columns, which include

demographic characteristics and county-level FFS spending, show that the effect is not attenuated by the inclusion of

additional controls.

    We use changes in MA reimbursement as an instrument for MA-PD coverage. In the first panel of Table A.3, we

present the results of the first stage regressions that control for metro population using a cubic spline with knots in

increments of 100,000 starting at 150,000. In all specifications, we find that Medicare eligibles in our dataset are 16-

17% more likely to enroll in a MA-PD plan if they live in an urban county. Given an average MA market share of 25%

within our sub-sample, this represents a large shift.58 By exploring what happens to consumers who are exogenously

shifted into MA-PD plans, we can isolate the impact of plan design on consumption.

    The second panel of Table A.3 shows the estimated impact of MA-PD enrollment on insurer drug costs. Once we

account for differential selection, MA-PD plans spend much more on drugs than stand-alone PDPs. The estimate of

$514 in column 4 is approximately half of average insurer spending across all plans ($1031 per enrollee per year).

This estimate is more attenuated in the final column (albeit not statistically different from the estimates in column

4), which includes historical, county-level FFS costs as an additional control. Here the estimates indicate that MA-

PD plans spend $388 more per year than stand-alone PDPs for an equivalent enrollee. As expected, historical FFS

spending influences drug consumption: Finkelstein, Gentzkow and Williams (2016) find that approximately half of all

variation in spending is due to place-specific supply factors. The following panels describe the impact of additional

insurer spending on consumers. The third panel shows that a consumer enrolled in MA can expect to spend $265 less

per year on drugs, holding health risk constant. Consumer spending does not fall one-for-one with the increase in

insurer spending, implying that the reduction in average out-of-pocket costs for consumers increases consumption, as

confirmed in the final panel. In our preferred estimates, the causal impact of MA-PD enrollment is somewhat noisy,

but implies a $122 increase in drug consumption. On a base of $1697 of drug spending per year, this represents a 7%
  58 Furthermore,   our instrument has a great deal of predictive power. The partial F-stat in the final specification is 509.02.

increase in spending. Total drug consumption increases despite a drop in consumer spending.

    We hypothesize that the underlying mechanism driving an increase in drug consumption from MA enrollment is

differences in MA-PD plan design intended to internalize the impact of offsets on non-drug medical spending. In

support of this hypothesis, we show that the effect of MA enrollment on drug consumption is driven entirely by drugs

believed to have large offsets a priori. We explore the total enrollee level of consumption of “Category 1” drugs, as

classified by Chandra, Gruber and McKnight (2010). If these drugs are not taken when prescribed, a serious event,

such as a hospitalization, is significantly more likely to occur within the next six months.59

    Table A.4 describes these results. About 40% of average expenditure ($648.11) is concentrated in these Category

1 drugs. Consistent with previous specifications, the OLS results are biased downward due to advantageous selection

into MA-PD plans. However, the IV specifications in columns 3-6 show a consistent pattern: MA-PD enrollees

consume proportionally more of these “Category 1” drugs, due in large part to greater insurer expenditure. MA-PD

enrollment leads to an additional $156 in total spending on these drugs; on a base of $648, this amounts to a 24%

increase, versus 7% for total drug consumption. Put differently, all of the increased total expenditure in MA-PD plans

is concentrated in these large offset drugs. Total expenditure in this category increases by $156, while overall total

expenditure increases by $122, implying that MA-PD plans do not spend more on drugs that are unlikely to have large

offsets.



B      Additional Counterfactuals

Next, we consider budget neutral policies that attempt to internalize the externality generated by the PDP plans.60 Our

presumption is that CMS would like to increase drug consumption by PDP enrollees in order to both improve enrollee

well-being and to reduce medical care costs. A natural policy to consider is a plan benefit generosity subsidy where

CMS would cover some of the plan’s cost to increasing cost-sharing coverage. In order for this cost-sharing subsidy to
  59 Category   1 drugs are “acute care drugs are those that, if not taken, will increase the probability of an adverse health event within a month or
two.” These drugs comprise approximately 40% of total drug spending. Category 2 contains “chronic care medications are designed to treat more
persistent conditions that, if not treated, will result in a potentially adverse health event within the year (examples include analgesics, antivirals,
ACE inhibitors, medications, beta-blockers, hypertension drugs, statins, and glaucoma medications).” Category 3 are “medications that, while
necessary to improve patients’ quality of life, will not result in an adverse health event if not taken, because they provide symptom relief as opposed
to affecting the underlying disease process (examples are acne medications, antihistamines, motion sickness medications, cold remedies, relief of
pain drugs).”

differential selection effects, as described in Lavetti and Simon (2014). Drug lists for each category were compiled using lists from drugs.com. Res-
piratory tract drugs include drugs used to treat asthma and COPD. For drugs with multiple uses, the drug was only included under its primary usage
(e.g. etanercept is sometimes used to treat Alzheimer’s Disease, but is much more commonly used for autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid
arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, plaque psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis. Thus, it is not included on the list of Alzheimer’s drugs).

McGuire (2013).

be budget neutral, CMS must also decrease the current premium subsidy, which will likely increase premiums faced

by consumers. The impact of such a change depends on how consumers evaluate plans with greater generosity but

higher premiums. While it is natural to consider the consumer surplus impact of these policies, such a calculation

requires interpreting the utility parameters in the neoclassical context, which, given our earlier findings, is probably

inappropriate. For this reason, we refrain from making consumer surplus statements here.

    Consider a uniform cost-sharing subsidy for PDP plans, as shown in Table A.5. Mechanically, a subsidy alters

both p jt and OOPC jt if it is budget neutral and there is full pass-through; we can write the alternative premium and

out-of-pocket costs as a function of the change in OOPC due to a change in the benefit generosity and the offset, which
              ∂q        0
is given by   ∂ x (c − c ).   For a small change in x (omitting subscripts for simplicity):

                                                                          ∂ OOPC
                                                   OOPC0 = OOPC +                ,
                                                                             ∂x

                                                             ∂ OOPC ∂ q
                                                  p0 = p +         − (c − c0 ).
                                                                ∂x  ∂x

In this formulation, the offset savings are passed through completely to the consumer in the form of lower premiums,

but the reduced premium subsidy is passed through to consumers in the form of higher premiums as well.61

    A 1% cost-sharing subsidy would increase consumption by 7.2 days supply based on the behavioral elasticities

in column 2. The implied offset, in column 3, is $3.54.62 However, the cost-sharing subsidy applies to all of the

infra-marginal units as well, and the total reduction in OOPC is $10.15. Subtracting the offsets, this implies that

premiums would have to increase by $6.61 for the policy to be budget neutral. By contrast, the federal government

could eliminate cost-sharing in the donut hole, as the ACA does. Using the calculations in Einav, Finkelstein and

Schrimpf (2015), this would increase drug consumption by 8%, generating offsets amounting to $52.54 per consumer.

However, this policy is also expensive: while it reduces OOPC by $356 per consumer, this reduction comes at a cost

net of offsets of $303. Therefore, if the policy is to be budget neutral, premiums will have to rise dramatically.63

    Furthermore, these policies reduce the market share of PDP plans. Consumers do not value the increased gen-

erosity at its full cost, as reflected in the measured decision utility; they prefer plans with lower premiums and higher

cost-sharing. Therefore, we conclude that it will be difficult for the government to implement broad based changes

to the Part D program aimed at reducing externalities that are budget neutral. This includes the recent Part D En-

hanced Medication Therapy Management (MTM) Model, which incentivizes stand-alone plans to reduce Parts A and

B spending among their enrollees. The actual financial incentives associated with this program are quite small. If

plans reduce Parts A and B spending by 2% (about $200 in 2008), they are eligible for a $2 per member per month
  61 This gives us an upper bound of the potential welfare gain.
  62 This is calculated as the additional spending multiplied by the 22% figure described above.
  63 Exacerbating this is the fact that MA-PD plans become more generous in equilibrium, decreasing OOPC to consumers by $97 per year. We

note that the ACA policy is not budget neutral.

increase in their benchmark payment. Because firms only receive approximately one-tenth of the savings, they are

unlikely to be incentivized to internalize the externality created by offsets. Furthermore, we note that a PDP plan that

fully internalized the externality would only spend an additional $153 per enrollee per year. Given our calculations,

this would lead to savings in Parts A and B of about $30. We find that a policy that provides a $12.75 per member

per month increase in the benchmark payment (and reduces Parts A and B spending by 0.3%) internalizes the exter-

nality, and would increase MA-PD enrollment by 3.4 percentage points. Furthermore, we note that a $153 increase is

likely to represent the firms’ entire profit margins, based on a 15% profit margin and the estimates in Ho, Hogan and

Scott Morton (2015).

   It is costly for the Medicare program to implement a budget neutral policy for two reasons: consumers are not

sophisticated with respect to potential underutilization and most implementable policies fail to target marginal con-

sumption, effectively leading to expensive OOPC reductions on infra-marginal units. These results are consistent with

a model in which private insurers can better target and subsidize underutilized, high-value care. For example, while

the cost-sharing subsidy we describe is uniform, applying to all drugs, private MA-PD insurers can implement more

sophisticated contracts that better target increased utilization. We see evidence of this in our reduced form results;

Figure A.3 shows that MA-PD plans have lower out-of-pocket costs for exactly those drugs likely to generate the

largest offsets. While they increase the complexity of insurance contracts and may exacerbate plan choice frictions,

targeted subsidies are more likely to be cost-effective. Therefore, it may be more reasonable to encourage MA-PD

enrollment; based on our estimates in Table 4, we believe this can be done in a cost-effective way. For example, rather

than closing the donut hole, the federal government could increase MA benchmarks by $312 per year, plus the $23 in

implied offsets. This would increase MA-PD market share by 7.4%.

Notes: Table presents OLS regression models, where outcome variable is consumer out-of-pocket costs. The
unit of observation is an enrollee-year for the 2007-2009 period. The original data are obtained from a 10%
sample of CMS prescription drug event files, aggregated to the enrollee-year level. We include year-level
indicators and indicators for the quintile of 2006 spending (consumer types) in all specifications. In some
specifications, we also control for 5-yr average per capita Medicare FFS spending and demographic controls
for age categories, race, and gender. Standard errors are clustered at the contract level and are presented in
parentheses. Statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels are denoted by *, **, and ***
respectively.
