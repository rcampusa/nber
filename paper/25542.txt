Fully Closed: Individual Responses to Realized Gains and Losses
Steffen Meyer and Michaela Pagel
NBER Working Paper No. 25542
February 2019
JEL No. D14,D90,G41

                                           ABSTRACT

We use transaction-level data of portfolio trades and holdings linked to checking, savings, and
settlement account transactions and balances to explore how individuals respond to realized
capital gains and losses. We exploit plausibly exogenous sales due to mutual fund liquidations for
identification. Specifically, we estimate the marginal propensity to reinvest out of one dollar
received from a forced liquidation, when the investor either achieved a gain or a loss relative to
his or her initial investment. Theoretically, if individuals held optimized portfolios, the marginal
propensity to reinvest out of forced sales should be 100%. Individuals should just reinvest all of
their liquidity immediately into a fund with similar characteristics. Empirically, individuals
reinvest 83% on average if the forced sale resulted in a gain, but only 40% in the event of a loss.
If individuals do not reinvest, they keep a share of their newly found liquidity in cash, save it, or
consume it. Such differential treatment of gains and losses is inconsistent with active rebalancing
or tax considerations, but consistent with mental accounting and the idea that individuals treat
realized losses differently than paper losses. We thus provide evidence for realization utility and
effects (Barberis and Xiong, 2012; Imas, 2016) and that individuals do not appear to learn
rationally from experiences in the stock market (Malmendier and Nagel, 2011; Koudijs and Voth,
2016).

1     Introduction
Standard economic theory predicts that uctuations in stock prices should aect households' savings


and consumption decisions; after all, stock and mutual fund holdings represent a signicant portion


of household nancial wealth  comparable to the stock of housing wealth.        At the same time,


stocks and mutual funds are very liquid, much more so than housing wealth, and can be easily


monetized any time when individuals adjust consumption or other liquidity needs arise. Therefore,


standard economic theory predicts that individuals should respond to changes in the value of their


stockholdings independent of whether those holdings are liquidated, if transaction costs and tax


considerations are negligible.


    But there are also economic theories such as Barberis et al. (2001), Barberis and Xiong (2012),


and Pagel (2018) that postulate how uctuations in stock prices may elicit direct utility ows and


be a source of emotional stress making investors reluctant to liquidate for consumption, rebalance


optimally, or even invest in the rst place. Moreover, there are a number of experimental studies


such as Imas (2016), Thaler and Johnson (1990), and Kuhnen (2015) that analyze how subjects


change their preferences in response to gains and losses as well as studies using using observational


data and other personal experiences (Malmendier and Nagel, 2011; Koudijs and Voth, 2016; Kaus-


tia and KnÃ¼pfer, 2008; Coval and Shumway, 2005). Nevertheless, clean empirical evidence using


observational data about how individuals respond to realized and large capital gains and losses and


how those experiences shape their preferences to invest into stocks and mutual funds is scarce.


    Clearly, estimating the marginal propensity to reinvest or consume out of stock price changes


or liquidations is dicult.      Aggregate uctuations in stock prices are endogenous with respect


to other macroeconomic conditions, such as income growth and consumer condence. Therefore,


the relationship between aggregate investment, consumption, and stock price uctuations will be


overestimated due to common shocks. Common shocks are arguably less problematic when utilizing


individual-level data and abnormal returns as in Baker et al. (2006) and Maggio et al. (2017). This


way, one could sensibly estimate the marginal propensity to invest or consume out of unrealized


capital gains or irregular dividends. However, if one were to look at realized capital gains, there




                                                   2
are obvious endogeneity problems. When individuals decide to liquidate stockholdings, they do so


endogenously because they decide to rebalance or consume.


   To investigate the eect of capital gains and losses on individual investor reinvestment, savings,


and consumption, we use a unique panel dataset on the daily trading of 113,031 retail investors in


Germany spanning more than 10 years. We precisely measure each individual's daily activity by his


or her log on and trading behavior as well as his or her balances and transactions in checking, savings,


and settlement accounts. To estimate the causal eect of realized capital gains and losses, we utilize


mutual fund liquidations. Mutual fund liquidations are arguably independent of individual retail


investor characteristics and thus constitute an exogenous source of forced sales.       For the period


from 2006 to 2016, we obtain and use the International Securities Identication Number (ISIN)


and dates of 3,306 mutual fund closures. Not all of our individuals are aected by all of the fund


closures; therefore, our sample of forced sale events equals 2,228 cases.


   We nd that individuals reinvest  on average  approximately 70% of their funds within a


few days and up to a month after a forced sale event.        Furthermore, the reinvestment share is


approximately 83% for gains but only 40% for losses. These ndings are not consistent with the


idea that individuals hold optimized portfolios, actively rebalance, or optimize their taxes.         If


individuals held optimized portfolios at the time of the fund closure, they would reinvest 100% of


their newly found liquidity in a fund with similar characteristics. If individuals held suboptimal


portfolios because of transaction costs or tax considerations, they might use the forced sale event


as an opportunity to rebalance and not reinvest 100% of their funds. However, in that case, they


should always reinvest a loss at a higher rate than a gain. After all, losses should not be aected


by tax considerations and, moreover, losses should not cause a rebalancing away from the initial


amount of the closing fund's holdings or stock holdings in general.


   Our main ndings can be easily observed in the raw data. Figure 1 shows the distribution of the


share of funds individuals reinvest within 30 days after the forced sale event separately in response to


a gain or a loss relative to their initial investment. The graphs clearly indicate that some individuals


do not reinvest any funds and that individuals are much less likely to reinvest in response to a loss.


Furthermore, Figure 2 shows the share of funds individuals reinvest within 30 days after the forced




                                                   3
sale event relative to the simple arithmetic return of their individual fund investment. This gure


also indicates that individuals are much less likely to reinvest when the investment resulted in a


loss. Instead of showing all observations, Figure 3 shows averages in bins of the arithmetic returns


and standard deviation bars. One can clearly observe a statistically signicant discontinuity at and


below the fund return rate of 0%, i.e., the fund being a losing versus a winning investment.


   We estimate the eects of forced liquidations on reinvestment using a simple cross-sectional


approach. The cross-sectional approach treats the mutual fund liquidations as exogenous shocks


and estimates the average response to it.     We can complement the identication approach with


controls for time and each liquidation, i.e., month-by-year and fund (ISIN) xed eects and nd that


our results are robust to dierent econometric specications and controls. To further understand


whether the experience of being forced out of an investment at a gain versus a loss aects individuals'


preferences, i.e., risk aversion, or beliefs about their ability to invest in stocks, is dicult.   We


nd evidence for both channels by showing that risk-taking at the internal margin is aected, i.e.,


individuals invest less into securities with a high risk rating (as determined by German regulations),


but also showing that individuals are less likely to reinvest into funds as an asset class and more


likely to stay disinvested in the stock market as a whole. Arguably it is not the retail investors'


faults that a given fund closes at a loss. We thus conclude that individuals do not appear to learn


rationally from the experience of forced losses in the stock market.


   It has to be kept in mind that we estimate a treatment eect on a randomly selected sample of


German clients of an online bank who hold a portfolio, trade at least once per year, and happen to


be invested in a mutual fund that closes out on them. We carefully address three potential concerns


about this eect. (1) The announcement of the fund closure may aect individual decisions to sell


prior to the fund closure.   While we outline several reasons to think that most individuals miss


the closure announcement, we address this concern by controlling for the individual holding period


fund returns to account for the factor that may aect their decision to sell. We also instrument


the amount of the liquidation and whether it is a loss by the amount invested at time of the


announcement and whether the investment was trading as a loss at announcement. (2) The decision


to reinvest may be aected by omitted variables that also aect the return of the fund investment




                                                  4
or overall portfolio, e.g., economic sentiment. We address this concern by including month-by-year


xed eects as well as the market or individual portfolio returns over the fund investment or 3


and 12 months prior to the closing of the fund. (3) Individuals that choose to hold on to a losing


investment may be dierent from individuals choosing to hold a winning investment.             While we


do not think that individuals have the skill to predict whether a fund will lose or win, we may


estimate dierent eects for individuals holding a losing versus a winning fund. However,  all of


our individuals  hold both losing and winning funds. Therefore, if the liquidation is exogenous to


them, the gain or loss is exogenous too. Furthermore, we show that, on observables, the losing group


does not dier from the winning group. Additionally, we can control for a dummy of holding a losing


fund to account for all time-invariant (un)observable characteristics of holding a winner versus a


loser. Finally, we can also run a regression discontinuity design which compares individuals near


the threshold of a fund return rate of 0%, i.e., the fund being a losing versus a winning investment.


   We argue that we provide empirical evidence for the theoretical framework developed in Barberis


and Xiong (2012) where the authors explain the disposition eect through a utility function in which


individuals narrowly frame utility over individual stock's sales or realizations. Because individuals


dislike realizing losses more so than they like realizing gains, the utility specication explains the


disposition eect. Our empirical nding of a reverse disposition eect (Chang et al., 2016) after


forced realizations provides evidence for the modeling assumptions put forward in Barberis and


Xiong (2012) in the sense that our ndings indicate that realizations matter in causing utility ows.


Furthermore, that our investors are subject to the disposition eect (Odean, 1998), and thus treat


unrealized capital gains and losses very dierently, has been documented by Koestner et al. (2017).


   By showing that an individual's propensity to reinvest appears to be aected by losses, we


also provide new empirical evidence from observational data relating to a large but mostly exper-


imental literature on how prior losses aect subsequent risk-taking.       The literature has analyzed


risk-taking in response to losses in a variety of settings, including choices over lotteries in laboratory


experiments (Thaler and Johnson, 1990), trading decisions of experienced market-makers (Coval


and Shumway, 2005), and IPO investors (Kaustia and KnÃ¼pfer, 2008; Anagol et al., 2015). This


research has produced contradictory results: some studies nd that individuals become more risk-




                                                    5
seeking following losses (Andrade and Iyer, 2009; Langer and Weber, 2008; Coval and Shumway,


2005), while other studies nd that they become more risk-averse (Shiv et al., 2005; Liu et al.,


2010). Imas (2016) reconciles this evidence by arguing that individuals become more risk averse


only after realized losses but not after paper losses (the realization eect). Our results are unique


in providing clean evidence from consequential investment decisions in the eld, and can thus be


seen as additional empirical support for the realization eect.


   Our ndings are related to the literature on experiential learning and how personal experiences


aect beliefs and preferences, such as Malmendier and Nagel (2011), Anagol et al. (2015), and


Andersen and Nielsen (2011). The way individuals react to gains versus losses suggests that they are


learning about their own ability from a bad experience, such as being forced out of an investment at


a loss. Furthermore, they appear to become more risk averse in response as documented in Koudijs


and Voth (2016). Related to our ndings, Choi et al. (2009) show that individuals save less in their


401(k)s after their portfolio returns were relatively bad or had high variance and Strahilevitz et al.


(2011) show that brokerage investors tend to repurchase individual stocks they previously sold for


a gain while shunning individual stocks they previously sold for a loss.


   Gaining an understanding of individual learning and preferences for investing in stocks and


funds is important for long-standing puzzles in household nance such as the stock market-non-


participation puzzle. In the context of stock market participation, we thus provide empirical ev-


idence using observational data for the mechanism in Kuhnen (2015) that individuals learn less


rationally from losses in stock market investments because they form more pessimistic beliefs. Our


ndings are also consistent with the empirical observation in Frydman et al. (2015) that individuals


do not display disposition eects because they may not close mental accounts when they reinvest


again quickly. After all, for our mutual fund liquidations, no equivalent reinvestment exists. Fur-


thermore, two recent papers, Briggs et al. (2015) and Andersen and Nielsen (2011), estimate the


marginal propensity to invest in stocks using administrative data and large wealth shocks but focus


on rst-time participants. In contrast to these two papers, we focus on stock-market participants'


marginal propensities to reinvest out of forced liquidations and look at potential stock market exit


in response to losses.




                                                  6
    Finally, by showing that individuals do not rebalance in due course after forced sales, we conclude


that they do not appear to hold optimized portfolios following Kaustia and Rantapuska (2012), who


show that individuals do not reinvest cash ows brought about by irregular dividends and tender


oer proceeds, and providing evidence for investor inattention and inertia following Bilias et al.


(2010), Alvarez et al. (2012), Bonaparte and Cooper (2011), Calvet et al. (2009a,b), Karlsson et al.


(2009), Brunnermeier and Nagel (2008), Agnew et al. (2003), Dahlquist and Martinez (2013), and


Mitchell et al. (2006).   As shown by Chien et al. (2012), Reis (2006), and Gabaix and Laibson


(2002), such inattention matters in the aggregate.




2     Data and Summary Statistics
Our data set stems from one of the largest online banks in Germany.          The data contains daily


information on logins (from 2012 onwards), trades, and portfolio holdings of approximately 112,072


customers as well as all balances and transactions of each investor's accounts at the online bank


from 2003 to 2016. We keep only private investors that reside in Germany. Moreover, in online


banks, silent attribution is a common phenomenon, as usually there is no charge for having an


account. Therefore, in order to not analyze accounts of investors who stopped trading, we require


that individuals execute at least 1 trade per year. In turn, we have data on a random 7% sample


of the bank's customer base.     Beyond all self-directed trades and holdings, we obtain data on


customer demographics such as gender, age, and occupation as well as detailed information on


traded securities such as asset class, risk class, issuer, and issue date of a security from Lipper in


Datastream. An advantage of our data set is that we can exclude quasi-automatic trades, such as


savings plan transactions. Additionally, trading decisions in our sample are not moderated by any


inuence from third parties, such as nancial advisers.


    Our sample is not representative of the German population as a whole; less than half of Germans


invest in stocks, either directly or indirectly. However, our sample is representative of self-directed


retail investors in Germany and more generally of individuals in Germany holding an investment


portfolio at a major bank. The average age of investors is 54 and the median age is 53. 14% of our




                                                   7
sample is female and 86% is male. Brokerage clients are generally expected (Cole et al., 2014) and


found to be more sophisticated than the overall population (Dorn and Huberman, 2005). The same


is true for our sample: 9% of our investors hold a doctoral degree, which is higher than average in


the German population (1.1%, German Federal Bureau of Statistics, 2008).


   Investors own portfolios that are worth 72,181    Â¿, on average.   These descriptive statistics are


comparable to those reported by household nance studies using US data (Barber and Odean,


2000).   In addition, we compare average portfolio values to ocial statistics in Germany.       The


Deutsche Bundesbank (2013) reports the average portfolio value of a German stock market investor


to be around 48,000  Â¿.    This value seems comparable to the average we observe in our sample


when we restrict our data to the years up until 2013. The average portfolio value is then 55,854   Â¿.
Additionally, we compare portfolio holdings to self-reported gross annual household income for


those investors who self-reported income data. Since income is reported in several ranges, we use


the midpoint of each range as a proxy for investor income. The mean ratio of the average portfolio


value (over the entire sample period) to annual income is 1.3. For comparison, the ratio of total


nancial assets to gross household income in the German population is about 1.1 (German Federal


Bureau of Statistics, 2008; Bundesbank, 2013).


   We observe 3,606 fund closures roughly evenly distributed between 2006 and 2016 as can be


seen in Figure 4. The information on fund closures was obtained from the Bundesverband Invest-


ment und Asset Management e.       V. (BVI). The BVI is the point of contact for politicians and


supervisory authorities on all issues related to the German Capital Investment Code (Kapitalan-


lagegesetzbuch, KAGB), and it represents the interests of the German fund industry at the national


and international level.



                                    [Insert Figure 4 about here]



   Table 1 shows detailed summary statistics for our forced sale events including the holding periods


before closure, the purchase and sale share prices, and the average value and return of the forced


sales.



                                    [Insert Table 1 about here]



                                                 8
   The SPIVA US Scorecard 2017 documents that over a 15-year period, 58% (48%) of equity


(xed income) funds were merged or liquidated and states that the main reason is continued poor


performance. Brown and Goetzmann (1995), the forerunners of mutual fund termination studies,


found that US mutual fund disappearance is a function of lagged relative returns, relative fund size,


fund expenses, and fund age. Bu and Lacey (2009) argue that the importance of returns depends


on the age and style of the fund and also show that expenses, turnover, the S&P 500, and the


short-term interest rate matter for mutual fund closures.    Evans (2006) shows that total returns


are more important than risk-adjusted returns in explaining mutual fund termination. When we


perform a kitchen-sink regression in a linear probability model of mutual fund closures, we nd that


returns and size decrease the probability to close a fund but overall fund closures are not explained


well by observables. After all, mutual funds are fairly diversied and thus mostly determined by


market conditions and there is no clear evidence for manager skill (refer to Carhart, 1997, among


many other studies).   In any case, for identication, it matters whether investors can choose to


invest in to-be-closed funds endogenously. We feel that is unrealistic and thus consider liquidations


as plausibly exogenous.


   Tables 2 and 3 show detailed summary statistics for all funds that did not close or closed


respectively including returns.   It can be seen that the closed funds did not necessarily perform


much worse than the remaining universe of funds. In fact, in the raw return numbers, there does


not appear to be a clear pattern in terms of the decision to keep a fund open and none of the


statistics are signicantly dierent except fund size.   To make the comparison as appropriate as


possible, we compare the return and size statistics to a matched sample of funds by asset class and


regional focus. Overall, the size of the fund appears a more important factor for the sample of our


closed funds than their performance. We conrm this nding in a kitchen-sink linear probability


regression of a dummy for fund closure on all our observed fund characteristics.



                                  [Insert Tables 2 and 3 about here]



   Of those 3,606 fund closures, we observe 2,228 forced sales, i.e., individuals aected by the


mutual fund closures. Most forced sales happen in 2007 but we also observe many in 2008, 2013,




                                                  9
and 2015, as can be seen in Figure 5.



                                           [Insert Figure 5 about here]



   Table 4 shows detailed summary statistics for our universe of investors relative to those aected


by the fund closures, i.e., holding funds that were closed, and relative to those aected by the


fund closures and ultimately forced to sell.            It can be seen that the three samples of investors


look very similar in terms of demographics and income as well as trading behavior and portfolio


characteristics.

                                            [Insert Table 4 about here]



   Furthermore, Table 5 shows detailed summary statistics for our investors that were forced to


sell a fund at a gain at or a loss.        It can be seen that the two samples of investors look similar.


Individuals appear to be less active traders if they are forced out of a fund at a loss because their


average holding period is longer and they have less of a disposition to sell both winners and losers.


However, it is important to note that all individuals hold  both  winning and losing funds. To


make that clear the table shows the sum of all paper and realized gains as well as losses at the time


of sale (when individuals pay attention to their portfolios), and those are large for both groups of


investors. The same holds true for the average number of paper and realized gains and losses in


individuals' portfolios at the time of their sales.



                                            [Insert Table 5 about here]



   Figure 6 shows the average amounts of all fund liquidations per year. We can see that the average


amounts are quite substantial ranging from 6,000             Â¿ to 10,000Â¿.      Clearly, the fund liquidation do


not represent a wealth shock, but they are quite substantial liquidation shocks.



                                           [Insert Figure 6 about here]



   The average reimbursement is at 7,452Â¿ with a median of 4,027Â¿. We have 6 observations with
liquidation amounts of more than 100,000Â¿, where the 99th percentile is at 60,000Â¿. We drop these

  1 Note   that, for the average number of securities held by investors, we assume that all funds hold 100 securities.

6 outliers to mitigate outlier issues. That said, all our results hold for the full sample of observed


liquidations.


   Furthermore, Figure 7 shows all sales in the period before the fund closures. We do not nd


heightened sales activity at the announcement dates of the fund closures or a run-up before the


fund closures. Funds that are domiciled in Luxembourg, which is 58% of our closed fund sample,


have to announce their closure at least 1 month in advance in their semi-annual report. German


funds, comprising 34% of our closed fund sample, have to announce the closure at least 6 months


in advance in their semi-annual annual report. Note that we see the funds arrive in the individual


settlement accounts and when the sales booking date is on or after the closure date, we consider


the sale a forced sale. Otherwise we consider it a voluntary or deliberate sale. Depending on the


time and day of week of the fund closure as well as the speed of the clearinghouse, the funds arrive


on the closure day or up to a few days later in individual settlement accounts.



                                     [Insert Figure 7 about here]



   In contrast to the announcement of the fund closure, the actual fund closure is unlikely to be


missed by individuals because they receive a sales receipt by email and mail that they are supposed


to notice as the sales receipt is relevant for tax purposes. Figure 8 displays a scan of a sales receipt.


One can see that the purchase price (AusfÃ¼hrungswert), the sales price (Kurswert), and the absolute


capital gain or loss in this case (VerÃ¤uÃ¿erungsverlust) are clearly indicated. It is thus fairly salient


to the individuals if they lost money and how much.

3       Methodology

Specications
We consider two approaches, one conditional cross-sectional regression and one unconditional


panel regression. The conditional cross-sectional regression is specied as follows:



                                           i              i
                                        âYj,t,t+Ï = Î± + Î²Fj,t + ÏJj + Î³my t + ij,t                                                 (1)



            i
where    âYj,t,t+Ï   is the sum of the outcome variable of interest for investor                         i   at the time of the

                                                                               i
forced sale event     j    on day   t   to   t + Ï, Î±   is an intercept,      Fj,t   is the currency amount of the forced


sale aecting investor       i   who invested in fund          j   at time   t, Jj   are fund (ISIN) xed eects for each


liquidation event     j,   and   myt     are time controls, i.e., month-by-year xed eects. We consider two


bandwidths     Ï:   5 or 30 days since the day that the money arrives in individual's accounts. Because


the forced sale is exogenous to individual investors, other control variables are not necessary but


may increase precision.


The unconditional panel regression is specied as follows:



                                    i              i       i
                                 âYj,t,t+Ï = Î± + Î²Fj,t + Î·Sj,t + ÏJj + Î³my t + ij,t                                                (2)



            i
where    âYj,t,t+Ï , Î±, Jj ,     and    myt   are specied as above for any fund              j   and time      t.   Furthermore,

 i                                                                                                                          i
Fj,t   is the currency amount of the forced sale of fund                j    aecting investor    i   at time   t    and   Sj,t   is the


currency amount of any other sale of fund                j   by investor    i at time t.   In this specication, we consider


all individuals who at some point held the aected funds and all of their liquidations rather than


only the forced ones.


We adjust standard errors for heteroskedasticity. Alternatively, we can cluster standard errors at


the month-by-year or ISIN level. However, we do not think that standard errors are uncorrelated


across time or ISINs and thus consider robust standard errors more appropriate.




                                                                   12
Outcome variables
When investors make a trade or a position gets liquidated, then there occurs a transfer to the set-


tlement account (Verrechnungskonto). The settlement account is an account dedicated for making


trades and automatically opened when individuals open a portfolio. It pays some interest and is


federally insured. We thus consider the following primary outcome variable: (1) net transfers to


the portfolio through purchases or sales of securities, i.e., reinvestment; (2) the risk class of each


bought security as the outcome variable or the reinvested funds times their risk class; (3) a dummy


for the rst reinvestment going into a mutual fund as opposed to other security classes, a dummy


for not reinvesting at all within 30 days, or a dummy for being invested into equity at all 6 months


after the forced sale event; 4) the currency amount that the settlement balance is increased after


30 days, i.e., the money staying in the settlement account; (5) net transfers to the savings account


at the bank, i.e., savings; (6) the increases or decreases in the currency amount of all accounts, i.e.,


all net inows or outows out of the bank. All the variables are transfers or balance increases or


decreases and thus ow variables.




4    Results

4.1 Main results
Table 6 shows the estimation results for the conditional cross-sectional regression design, i.e., Equa-


tion 1.   Here, we simply regress the share of liquidity that is reinvested in the 30 days after the


forced sale event on the individual liquidation amount for just the 2,222 cases where individuals


get back their investments (excluding the 6 outliers). The coecient simply represents the average


share of funds that individuals reinvest out of the forced sales. In the rst column of Table 6, we


only include a regression constant, whereas in columns 2 and 3, we also include month-by-year and


fund or ISIN xed eects.     In turn, while we display robust standard errors in columns 1 to 3,


column 4 displays standard errors that are clustered at the month-by-year level.



                                     [Insert Table 6 about here]




                                                  13
   We nd that, on average, individuals reinvest 70% of their newly found liquidity within 30


days and this result is robust to the inclusion of controls or clustering standard errors instead of


correcting for heteroskedasticity. Note that, the column showing the results for clustered standard


errors displays fewer observations as all singleton observations, that would have single clusters, are


dropped.


   Furthermore, Table 6 shows the same regression specication results for the share of liquidity


reinvested but including an interaction with a dummy of whether individuals realized a loss relative


to their initial investment at the point of the forced sale. Again, we show our results for dierent


sets of controls and calculations of standard errors. It can be seen that individuals are much more


likely to reinvest a gain than a loss. Strikingly, in the baseline specication, the reinvestment share


is approximately 83% for gains but only 40% for losses and this result is robust across specications.


   We now turn to the unconditional panel regression to compare all individuals who invested


in the aected funds and sold deliberately or were forced to sell in one specication.         The panel


estimation results paint a picture similar to the simple cross-sectional results. Individuals reinvest


approximately 70% on average after 30 days, and they reinvest less if they sell voluntarily before


or after the announcement of the forced sale event. This makes sense because individuals liquidate


voluntarily when they decide to rebalance or consume part of their funds. We again report results


including dierent sets of controls and calculated standard errors which can be found in Table 7.



                                      [Insert Table 7 about here]



   Moreover, if individuals are forced to liquidate at a loss, they reinvest only half of their newly


found liquidity relative to their reinvestment if they are forced to liquidate at a gain. If they liquidate


deliberately after the announcement, our results are driven by very few observations because we do


not have many individuals liquidating during the announcement period, which is only one month


for Luxembourg funds that comprise the majority of our sample.             When we look at deliberate


liquidations before the announcement, our results in some specications show that individuals also


reinvest less in response to a loss. Of course, however, their baseline reinvestment is much smaller.


The results with loss interactions can also be found in Table 7.




                                                    14
   We thus nd less reinvestment and therefore less risk taking at the external margin in response


to forced sales at a loss. We can also look at the internal margin of risk taking and ask whether


individuals not only reinvest less into stocks or bonds, but also whether they reinvest in a lower


or higher risk class. For almost all securities in our sample, we observe the ocially established


risk classication going from 1 (for instance, savings accounts) to 5 (for instance, stocks, options,


and futures). We simply run the same specication but use the rst reinvestment value times the


risk class as the outcome variable and the liquidation value times the risk class (most funds have


risk classes of 3 or 4) as the regressor. Results can be found in Table 8 and line up nicely and are


internally consistent as well as in accordance with our previous results. Individuals take less risks,


on the internal and external margins, after losses. Furthermore, we run a linear probability model


to estimate the likelihood that individuals reinvest into funds as an asset class or the likelihood that


individuals do not reinvest any liquidity at all after 30 days. The results can be found in Table 8


and also line up nicely with our previous results. Individuals are less likely to reinvest into funds


after a loss and more likely to not reinvest at all.


                                     [Insert Table 8 about here]


   Furthermore, we can specically look at stock market participation. When we use a dummy of


whether individuals are invested in equities at all 6 months after the forced sale as the outcome


variable, we nd that the experience of being forced out of a losing fund causes a 3.62% reduction


in the likelihood of participating in the stock market.


   Table 9 shows the estimation results for other potential destinations of the individual funds:


First, we observe the balance in the settlement account to estimate the share of liquidity that stays


in the settlement account. Second, we also observe all transfers into savings accounts that we net


out, i.e., if an individual transfers money in and out of the savings account within 30 days that is


a net transfer of 0. Third, we can look at all transfers out of the bank minus all transfers into the


bank to understand whether the funds leave the bank.


                                     [Insert Table 9 about here]


   When individuals sell deliberately before the funds' closure announcements, they tend to reinvest



                                                  15
a smaller share of their liquidity immediately. Presumably, this is because they decided to rebalance


or consume part of their funds. In line with this presumption, we see some transfers into savings


accounts and some transfers out of the bank as well as some liquidity simply remaining in the


settlement account. Overall, however, our results appear to be noisy. After all we cannot earmark


a   Â¿ to make conclusive statements about what individuals do with their funds.
     The results for deliberate sales after the announcement look very similar to the sales before the


announcement though our estimates are noisier for the few trades we see after the announcement


of the fund closures. We thus do not nd consistently signicant dierences for the deliberate sales


pre- and post-announcement; neither do we nd additional sales activity around the announcement


date nor a large run-up in sales before the closing date in Figure 7. Both of these ndings make us


believe that most individuals miss the announcement of the fund closure that is only reported in


the half-year investment prospectus.




4.2 Robustness
We nd consistent eects throughout specications and sample splits that line up sensibly for


individuals who are forced to sell versus those that sell before versus after the announcement of the


fund closure.   The simple cross-sectional specication basically conducts an experiment in which


2,228 individuals are chosen at some point in time to receive their investment back. In the simple


cross-sectional specication, we thus identify a pure cross-sectional eect of individuals receiving


more versus less funds back.     In the specication with fund xed eects, within each fund, we


identify o of individuals trading at a loss versus a gain.   On the other hand, the unconditional


cross-sectional regression identies the eect by also comparing individuals investing in the same


fund and selling deliberately or being forced to sell, again conditional on having invested into the


same funds. We now address a number of concerns and present robustness checks. The results of


all robustness checks can be found in Table 10.



                                     [Insert Table 10 about here]




                                                  16
Transfers to other brokerage accounts


In principle, it could be the case that individuals transfer their funds to a dierent brokerage


account.   However, we do not observe large or signicant coecients on the variable measuring


outows out of the bank in Table 9. Furthermore, we can look at customers who are agged as


clients without other banking relationships by the online bank. For these clients, the eect is even


more pronounced.




Reasons for 2017 fund closures


While our results may be specic to the year 2007 because many of our forced sale events happen in


that year, it is important to note that the nancial crisis did not hit before the end of 2008. In that


sense, our results are unlikely to be aected by the nancial crisis. Furthermore, we include month-


by-year xed eects in our regressions and thus do not identify o of individuals being forced out


of funds in year 2007 versus other years. Finally, in our preferred specication, we control for fund


xed eects and thus identify o of individuals being invested in the same fund, say one that closes


in 2007, and selling deliberately versus not as well as at a gain versus a loss. Furthermore, the fund


xed eects control for the closure date and thus eectively for all market or other contemporaneous


conditions at the time of the fund closure.


   Most of the forced sales in 2007 are due to the closures of a few funds that the customers


of this particular bank were invested in. These funds closed because a large German investment


bank shut down an arm of its operations that white-labeled funds for our online bank.           These


white-labeled funds were marketed by our bank to its clients.        Thus, most of the variation in


our sample is generated by fund closures that are not due to the closure of small niche funds or


underperformance. In any case, while we acknowledge that underperformance is probably a main


driver of fund closures, we do not think individuals would choose to invest into a fund because they


expect it to underperform and then close, which is our identifying assumption.




                                                  17
Selection into holding a closing fund


We estimate an average treatment eects of the population under consideration, a randomly selected


sample of German retail clients of an online bank who hold a portfolio, trade at least once per


year, and chose to invest in a fund that happens to close.     Individuals could select into keeping


(i.e., to be eventually forced out) or selling the fund either before or after the announcement of


the closure. While we argue that most individuals do not notice the fund closure announcement


(because it is only reported in the fund report, the pre- and post-announcement individuals behave


not signicantly dierent, and there is no sales activity around the announcement date or before


the closure date), we still want to control for this selection to ensure our treatment is exogenous


conditional on the controls. When we compare individual characteristics of our overall sample versus


our aected sample, we do not nd relevant dierences. This can be seen in Table 4. Additionally,


we can simply control for each individual's fund return over his or her holding period of the fund.


The holding period return is the only fund characteristic that may aect individual behavior and


is observable to both the individual and the econometrician, which makes our treatment exogenous


conditional on the controls. Our results are unaected by that and can be found in Table 10.




Selection into holding a winning or losing fund


Moreover, individuals holding the aected funds may select into keeping (i.e., to be eventually


forced out) a winning or losing fund such that the eect for individuals holding a losing fund


may be dierent than for those holding a winning fund.        We can include a dummy indicating


that individuals hold a to-be-closed loser in our specication.    The dummy for holding a losing


versus holding a winning fund that is to be closed also controls for all time-invariant observable or


unobservable characteristics of individuals holding a losing fund versus individuals holding a winning


fund (results can also be found in Table 10). However, in our data, both groups of individuals, those


getting closed out of losing funds as well as those getting closed out of winning funds, hold both


winners and losers. Given that we argue that our sample of closed funds are chosen exogenously to


individual investor characteristics, if we pick a fund that happens to be a loser for some individuals


and a winner for others and both of these groups hold winners and losers, the assignment into being



                                                 18
closed out at a loss is exogenous and the loss coecient can be given a causal interpretation.


   As can be seen in Table 5, the groups of investors being forced out at a gain versus a loss do


not dier substantially in most dimensions. Most importantly, individuals forced out at a loss do


not have substantially less risky portfolios or trade in less risky securities generally, which would


explain their hesitation to reinvest a loss. Moreover, both groups of individuals hold winning and


losing funds as described.   While the group holding losing funds tends to have a longer holding


period, they do not buy or sell substantially less than individuals holding the winning funds and


while they have a lower propensity to sell winners and a higher propensity to hold losers, overall


their holdings of paper winners and losers are similar (as captured by the variables called sum


of paper and realized winners/losers at all sale dates). Furthermore, when we run a kitchen-sink


regression of the dummy for being closed out at a loss on all our other observables, we only nd the


holding period to be statistically signicant, which, given the number of regressors, could represent


estimation error.   Furthermore, note that our preferred specication with fund xed eects does


not compare the groups of individuals holding any losing or winning funds but rather compares


individuals having invested into the same fund at dierent points in time.


   Finally, we may worry that individuals react dierently to the announcement of the fund closure


depending on holding a loser or a winner. To the extent that the decision to hold a loser versus a


winner is not aected by the announcement of the fund closure, which we address by controlling for


the loser dummy or individual fund returns over their holding period, our treatment is exogenous.


Furthermore, we can address all concerns about behavior after the fund closure announcement by


using the amount invested in the fund at announcement and a loss at announcement as instruments


for the liquidation amount and loss at closure indicator.




Regression discontinuity design


As an alternative econometric specication, we could consider a type of regression discontinuity


(RD) design by only comparing individuals who happen to have a slightly positive arithmetic


return at the time of the forced sale to individuals with a slightly negative return. Restricting the


sample to individuals with arithmetic returns in the range of plus or minus 10%, and rerunning




                                                 19
specication 2 with those 7,998 observations, month-by-year, and ISIN xed eects, we nd that


individuals reinvest 81% in response to a forced liquidation with a loss interaction coecient of


-22% which is signicant at the 5% level.            This simple RD design thus conrms our results and


lends additional credibility to the causal interpretation of the loss coecient.




Time-varying omitted variables


We argue that the liquidation event is exogenous to the retail investors that happen to invest into


that fund. We think that it is unlikely retail investors would deliberately choose to invest into a


certain fund because they expect it to be closing. Moreover, we think that the liquidation amount, as


determined by the initial investment in the fund, is unrelated to the fact that the fund later happens


to close. However, the return of the initial investment is potentially jointly determined by market


factors that also determine whether individuals want to reinvest at a higher or lower rate at the time


of the fund closure. Thus, while the initial investment and the closure date is exogenous, the return


of the initial investment may be subject to an omitted variables problem that also determines an


individual's propensity to reinvest (for instance, sentiment or market conditions). When we control


for fund xed eects in the unconditional cross-sectional regression, we also eectively control for


the time and market as well as all other contemporaneous conditions at the time of the fund closures.


Moreover, the month-by-year xed eects control for all time-varying macroeconomic trends such


as market sentiment. Still, we can additionally control for the market return, in the past 3 or 12


months, and obtain the same result, as well as control for the individual portfolio returns, in the


past 3 or 12 months, and obtain the same result.
                                                           2

   The econometric application has the following features: (1) there is cross-sectional variation in


the experimental implementation, i.e., individuals are aected to varying degrees or not at all; (2)


the relevant variables are available at a high frequency over a long period before and after each


experiment; and (3) there exist potential time-varying confounds, but they must be assumed to


change smoothly across the date of the experiment. We address the latter two concerns by using


transaction-level data that is measurement-error free with homogeneous time bands around each

  2 The   performance of the individuals' portfolios is calculated following Bhattacharya et al. (2012).

event. Moreover, we are interested in relatively short-run eects, from the day of the announcement


to approximately one month after, we use many events rather than just one, and we exibly control


for time using calendar xed eects. For these reasons, we are not concerned about other time-


varying confounds.


   Theoretically, our framework can be interpreted as good as a local randomized experiment


solving selection concerns by randomly assigning subjects to control and treatment status.          The


running variable is time itself, which, cannot be randomly assigned. However, we can safely argue


that the forced sale date is randomly assigned to our investors as it is not chosen with individual-


level investor characteristics in mind. Thus, whether a given investor at a given date is aected


by a forced sale event can be thought of as good as random.          Nevertheless, covariates that are


discontinuous in time, such as year and month eects can be included as controls and to improve


precision (Lee and Lemieuxa, 2010).


   Estimates may be aected if the time-series properties of the data are ignored, for instance in


the presence of autoregressive processes.    Whenever a potential liquidation of funds itself would


cause further liquidations, our estimates may be biased upward.        While such autoregression is a


potential concern in many applications, it is not a concern here.       After all, there are no wealth


eects associated with the liquidation or the act of reinvesting the liquid funds (the wealth eects


from potential fee payments can safely be seen as very small).         Finally, one may worry about


strategic behaviors around the threshold.      Clearly, using time as an assignment variable makes


such tests logically irrelevant. However, one may worry about a type of sorting when individuals


change their behavior to avoid the treatment, in our setting, by selling before the forced sell, which is


announced either one month (for funds domiciled in Luxembourg) or six months (for funds domiciled


in Germany) in advance. However, those individuals are automatically excluded from the simple


cross-sectional analysis because they are not actually forced to sell. Furthermore, as we discussed,


we do not observe sorting or bunching of sales near the announcement or forced liquidation date


and the voluntary sales before and after the announcement of the fund closure look similar.

5    Mechanisms and implications

5.1 Tax considerations and rebalancing
In Germany, capital gains were un-taxed before 2009 and since 2009 are un-taxed until individuals


reach their initial allowance (FreibetrÃ¤ge). The initial allowances are 801 Â¿ for singles and 1.602Â¿
for married couples. Individuals can specify their main brokerage such that the capital gains tax will


not be subtracted unless the initial sum is exceeded (Freistellungsauftrag) and we observe customers


agged by the bank as main customers who have set up the Freistellungsauftrag. For stocks and


funds that were bought before the 1st of January 2009, capital gains are still tax-free. For these


funds, any capital gains will remain tax free until the end of 2017 and tax free up until 100,000   Â¿
from January 2018 on. When capital gains are taxed, the tax is the same rate as dividends and


interest payments and it is subtracted at the source. Thus, in the event of a taxed capital gains


realization, the funds that arrive in the settlement account are already after tax funds. Since 2009,


the capital gains tax (Abgeltungssteuer) is 25% plus solidary addition (SolidaritÃ¤tszuschlag) (5.5%


of the capital gains tax) and church tax (Kirchensteuer) (8 or 9% of the capital gains tax) which


amounts to approximately 28% in total.      In contrast, capital losses are carried over and applied


to following capital gains at the source.   Thus, if capital losses are realized before capital gains,


then the capital gains tax will be automatically lowered by the realized losses. In summary, for all


practical purposes, the capital gains are either un-taxed or the tax is taken at the source, and all


reimbursements individuals receive are after-tax funds.


    Our results on gains and losses are not consistent with tax considerations as a reason for why


individuals do not hold optimally rebalanced portfolios before the forced sale event, which would


imply that they would not optimally reinvest 100% of their liquidation. If this were the case, then


capital losses should be reinvested at a higher rate than capital gains. While there exists a capital


gains tax and capital losses are carried over, individuals should be incentivized to harvest losses


because Germany does not have a wash sale rule.        While individuals could, in principle, harvest


losses, casual observation of online media suggests that this behavior is not common. In any case,


because no wash sale rule exists, it cannot explain the lack of reinvestment of losses.




                                                  22
   Transaction costs are not very high for the online bank under consideration but they are positive.


In particular, one trade costs a basis of 4.90Â¿ plus 0.25% of the order price times volume, a minimum
      Â¿ and a maximum of 59.90Â¿. Additionally, the exchanges charge a small fee ranging from
of 9.90


0.0015% with a minimum of 1.50Â¿ and to 0.0025% with a minimum of 2.50Â¿. While in a standard


model, such fees would not majorly discourage an agent to rebalance optimally (Briggs et al.,


2015), it may cause some insucient rebalancing when individuals hold very small portfolios or


are averse to paying fees. These transaction costs may be a reason why individuals do not hold


optimally rebalanced portfolios before the forced sale event, which would imply that they would


not optimally reinvest 100% of their liquidation. However, individuals do not appear to actively


rebalance in the right direction.    If they would take the forced liquidation as an opportunity to


actively rebalance, potentially because they held a suboptimal portfolio initially due to transaction


costs, then they should reinvest the funds of a losing investment at a higher rate than those of


a winning investment.     If individuals rebalance at the stocks versus bonds level rather than the


individual fund level, then the individual portfolio performance should matter for rebalancing.


   To address rebalancing and tax considerations, we can control for the individual fund return and


the individual portfolio returns over the fund investment or over the past 3 and 12 months. After


all, rebalancing needs as well as tax considerations should be determined by the fund or overall


portfolio return of the individual. Our results are unaected by that and can be found in Table 10.




5.2 Inattention
We know from the existing literature that investors are inattentive and we observe quite substantial


inertia, i.e., money staying in the settlement account especially in the rst 5 days after the forced


sale. A natural question is whether individuals notice the announcement and/or the forced sale.


Because the deliberate sales we observe before and after the closure announcement look very similar,


we believe that most individuals miss the closure announcement. Furthermore, we do not observe


heightened selling activity around the date of the announcement and only a small run-up in sales


prior to the announcement (approximately one tenth of the number of sales at the date of closure)


in Figure 7.



                                                   23
    After deciding to close the fund, the investment company has to report to the supervisory


authority and responsible reserve bank. In turn, the closure is announced in the electronic federal


gazette, the Bundesanzeiger, as well as in the semi-annual report to inform investors.                     More


specically, the company has to adhere to a notice period of 1 or 6 months after it informed the


investors in writing via the semi-annual investment report. We believe that many investors ignore


all fund reports and thus miss the closure announcement.               However, upon the liquidation of the


fund, the investor receives a sales receipt by email or mail as the one displayed in Figure 7. This


sales receipt is much less likely to remain unnoticed as it also states the tax implications as well as


whether the investor experienced a capital gain or loss.


    Even if investors are inattentive, such inattention cannot explain our results because investors


have to choose to be more inattentive in the event of a loss than a gain. Therefore, investors must


know whether they incurred a loss or a gain in the rst place.




5.3 Mental accounting, realization utility, and eects
As an alternative theoretical explanation, we consider mental accounting. Clearly, the transfer of


money from the fund to the settlement account caused individuals to treat it dierently especially


when it represents a loss as opposed to a gain. We thus provide evidence for mental accounting, as


the transfer between accounts matters, even though the money is theoretically fungible (abstracting


from the transaction costs).       Thaler (1985) and Shefrin and Thaler (1988) were pioneering the


mental accounting literature and some other empirical evidence exists (Milkman and Beshears,


2009; Feldman, 2010; Choi et al., 2009; Abeler and Marklein, 2008; Human and Barenstein, 2005;


Karle et al., 2011).


    We also think that investors may take the liquidation as an exogenous reason to close their


mental investment account, which leads them to not engage in the disposition eect (Odean, 1998).


That our investors are subject to the disposition eect, and thus treat unrealized capital gains


and losses very dierently, has been documented by Koestner et al. (2017).
                                                                                         3 We argue that these

   3 In our sample of 113,031 German investors over the period 2003 to 2016, we nd an attenuated but still positive
and strongly signicant disposition to sell winning mutual funds. Chang et al. (2016) use the data from Odean (1998)
consisting of g 73,558 US households from January 1991 to November 1996 and document a reverse disposition eect


                                                        24
empirical observations provide evidence for the theoretical framework developed in Barberis and


Xiong (2012) who explain the disposition eect via a utility function in which individuals narrowly


frame utility over individual stock's sales or realizations. Because individuals dislike realizing losses


more than they like realizing gains, the utility specication explains the disposition eect. What we


observe is a reverse disposition eect after forced realizations and in a sense this is fully consistent


with the modeling assumptions put forward in Barberis and Xiong (2012). After all, Barberis and


Xiong (2012) postulate that liquidations or sales cause utility ows, and even though they do not


specify a change in risk aversion in response, that would be a natural next step. Our ndings are


also consistent with the empirical observation in Frydman et al. (2017) that individuals do not


display disposition eects because they may not close mental accounts when they reinvest again


quickly. After all, for our mutual fund liquidations, no equivalent reinvestment exists.


   Whether losses increase or decrease risk-taking has been analyzed in a variety of settings, includ-


ing choices over lotteries in laboratory experiments (Thaler and Johnson, 1990), trading decisions


of experienced market-makers (Coval and Shumway, 2005), IPO investors (Kaustia and KnÃ¼pfer,


2008; Anagol et al., 2015), and individuals receiving inheritances (Andersen et al., 2018).         This


research has produced contradictory results: some studies nd that individuals become more risk-


seeking following losses (Andrade and Iyer, 2009; Langer and Weber, 2008; Coval and Shumway,


2005), while other studies nd that they become more risk-averse (Shiv et al., 2005; Liu et al.,


2010). Imas (2016) reconciles this evidence by arguing that individuals become more risk averse


only after realized losses but not after paper losses (the realization eect).


   Imas (2016) develops a theoretical framework of dynamic cumulative prospect theory with men-


tal accounting.    After a paper loss, the mental account of prior outcomes remains open and the


loss is evaluated jointly with the outcome, causing the individual to take on more risk to recover


from it. A realized loss closes the associated mental account and resets the reference point. Closing


the mental account in the red causes the individual to be sensitized to the prospect of further


losses, leading him or her to take on less risk. In contrast, after a realized gain, the investor is not


sensitized, resulting in the prediction that realized gains should result in more reinvestment than

for delegated investments such as mutual funds.


                                                   25
realized losses. Imas (2016) presents evidence for this framework in a series of lab experiments. Our


results are unique in providing clean evidence from consequential investment decisions in the eld,


and our evidence can thus be seen as strong empirical support for the realization eect. Another


recent study analyzing risk-taking after realizations in the laboratory is Merkle et al. (2018), who


replicate the ndings in Imas (2016) for positively skewed lotteries and physical transfers of money.




5.4 Experiential learning
Our ndings are related to the literature on experiential learning and how personal experiences


shape preferences, such as Anagol et al. (2015), Andersen et al. (2018), and Kaustia and KnÃ¼pfer


(2008).   When individuals get forced out of a fund they have a bad experience, especially when


the fund investment is a loser.   Individuals may learn from this experience about their ability


to invest into the stock market. Such experiential learning is likely to be relevant for the stock-


market non-participation puzzle and the low portfolio shares we observe empirically (which has


been puzzling economists, Campbell, 2006). Furthermore, individuals appear to become more risk


averse in response to losses as documented in Koudijs and Voth (2016) and Malmendier and Nagel


(2011). In the context of stock market participation, Kuhnen (2015) nd that individuals learn less


rationally from losses in stock market investments because they form more pessimistic beliefs.


   In terms of the time to response, when we look at the reinvestment after 5 versus 30 days, we


do not nd large dierences. Thus, it is not simply be a matter of an initial shock but persistent


learning which is also indicated by our result that individuals are more likely to exit the stock


market. To further understand how irrational learning from bad experiences in the stock market


aects individuals, we split the sample in a variety of ways to understand for which demographic


and other individual characteristics, such as income and nancial sophistication, the eects of bad


experiences are most pronounced. We do not nd signicantly dierent results when we split by


portfolio size, size of the initial investment, or length of the banking relationship, which may be


measures of nancial sophistication. We nd that the eect is more pronounced for female investors,


who constitute approximately 14% of our sample, as well as customers who are agged by the online


bank as clients without other banking relationships.



                                                 26
6     Conclusion
Using a large sample of transaction-level data on all asset holdings, trades, balances, spending, and


income from a German retail bank, this paper explores how the individual propensity to reinvest


responds to realized capital gains and losses.    Our identication strategy exploits mutual fund


closures, which are arguably exogenous to retail investors. We nd that individuals reinvest a large


part of their newly found liquidity immediately. However, even after a month, a portion of that


newly found liquidity remains uninvested because individuals leave it untouched or transfer some


of it into savings accounts. These ndings suggest that individuals do not hold perfectly optimized


portfolios and are partially inert.


    Furthermore, individuals behave very dierently if a loss is realized instead of a gain relative


to their initial investment. If a gain is realized, individuals reinvest almost 83% of their funds. If,


however, a loss is realized, then individuals only reinvest 40% of their funds and tend to transfer


more into savings accounts.    This dierential treatment of gains and losses is inconsistent with


active rebalancing or tax considerations, but it is consistent with mental accounting, realization


utility, and the so-called realization eect (Imas, 2016). Furthermore, we provide particularly clean


evidence relating to the literature on experiential learning (Malmendier and Nagel, 2011; Koudijs


and Voth, 2016; Kuhnen, 2015) that individuals do not appear to learn rationally from experiences


in the stock market.

Notes: Risk class of portfolio (the risk classication is established by German regulation going from 1 (for
instance, savings accounts) to 5 (for instance, stocks, options, and futures)) refers to the overall portfolio
and risk class of trades to the traded securities and is value weighted. The propensity to realize winning
and losing funds is calculated as in Odean (1998).
