This note links the commodity bundling literature with the literature on the private provision of
public goods. We discuss the potential profitability of bundling strategies for both private firms
and charitable organizations. Even in the absence of consumption complementarities, we show
important cases when private and public goods should be bundled. For example, both a
monopolist and a charity can profit from bundling the goods they provide. Linking sales to
charitable contributions can also be beneficial for for-profit firms as it alleviates price-
competition. Beyond providing a theoretical framework for understanding the incentive
properties of bundling private and public goods, the study lends insights into the debate on the
efficacy of corporate social responsibility.

1       Introduction

Milton Friedman (1970) set off a firestorm when he likened corporate social responsibility
to “pure and unadulterated socialism.” From this came the mantra from Friedmanites
that “the business of business is business.” In the four decades since, the debate over the
nature and extent of the social responsibilities of business has become heated and complex.
Within academic circles, several areas of study have been launched in response to Friedman’s
arguments, including a vast literature that explores the relationship between corporate social
performance and financial performance. By and large, the empirical results emanating from
this line of research are far from conclusive. While some studies find a positive relationship
between social and financial performance (e.g., Waddock and Graves, 1997), others report
no or even a negative relationship (e.g., Wright and Ferris, 1997; McWilliams and Siegel,
2001).1

At roughly the same time, a vibrant literature in industrial organization was emerging
that examined the properties of commodity bundling. An early contribution was due to
Friedman’s colleague, George Stigler (1962), who showed that it is potentially profitable for
a monopolist selling two goods to bundle them by requiring a buyer to purchase both in order
to get either. This line of research has proliferated with several seminal advances, showing
the rationale for tying arrangements. For example, Adams and Yellen (1976) formally
examine the multiproduct monopoly decision with independent demands.2 Schmalensee
(1982) considers the decision of a single-product monopolist who can bundle its product with
a competitive produced good. In both of these settings, bundling enhances the profitability
of the monopolist as it allows them to engage in price discrimination. Nalebuff (2004)
examines the effect of bundling in an oligopolistic setting and shows an alternate reason for
such strategies - bundling is a particularly effective strategy for deterring entry.

Although Friedman and Stigler were noted close friends going as far back as their graduate
school days at the University of Chicago, the literature has yet to marry these two lines of

     For a good overview of this literature we refer the interested reader to McWilliams et al. (2006) who
summarize the results from more than a dozen papers exploring the link between CSR and firm performance.

     Adams and Yellen (1976) rely upon a series of examples to show that bundling can enhance the profitabil-
ity of a multi-product monopolist. They do not, however, provide a general characterization of conditions
under which bundling is an optimal strategy. Schmalensee (1984) extends the Adams and Yellen model to
examine the optimality of bundling under the assumption that reservation values follow a bivariate normal
distribution. McAfee et al. (1989) further extend this line of work and show that bundling is an optimal
strategy whenever reservation values for the various goods are independently distributed.

scholarship.3 This gap in the literature is surprising as it is not difficult to find examples of
consumption goods that are bundled with charitable donations. Of course, it is not difficult
to find examples of consumption goods that are bundled with charitable donations. For
example, profits from certain iPods, T-shirts, and other items with the (RED) label go to
the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and malaria. Products with the pink breast cancer
awareness logo are widespread and reach from products like t-shirts and other visible and
durable goods, to fruit juices. Alternately, many firms elect to adopt “green” production
processes or fair-trade practices that raise costs but provide external benefits in the form
of improved air quality or living standards for farmers in developing countries.

Yet it is not only for profit firms that engage in such practices. Many non-profit orga-
nizations sell products to augment charitable revenues or offer potential donors gifts for
contributions exceeding some pre-determined threshold. For example, the World Wildlife
Fund sells items ranging from duffel bags and day packs to t-shirts, hats, and jackets on its
website. And other organizations such as the Public Broadcast System offer products such
as coffee mugs and CD collections during on-air fundraising efforts as a “gift” to donors
who contribute more than some pre-determined amount.

In this note, we explore the potential profitability of bundling strategies for both private
firms and charitable organizations. We begin by modeling the decision problem of a single-
good monopolist who can link with a charity to offer a bundled product for which revenues
are split between the two parties. Following the existing literature on bundling, we assume
that values for the public and private goods are independently distributed. Consonant with
prior work (see, e.g., Adams and Yellen, 1976; Schmalensee, 1984; McAfee et al., 1989), we
first show that a profit-maximizing monopolist will either (i) sell only a single (unbundled)
good only or (ii) simultaneously offer both the unbundled good and a second variety of
their product which bundles the good with a charitable contribution. As in prior work,
the intuition underlying the decision to bundle with a charity is straightforward. Linking
purchases with charitable donations allows the monopolist to attract new customers and
engage in price discrimination by offering differentiated products.

We next derive conditions under which it is optimal for the monopolist to offer both the

unbundled and bundled varieties of their product. Specifically, we show that bundling can
increase the monopolist’s profits whenever the elasticity of demand for consumers with a
high value for the public good is more than twice the average price elasticity at the standard
monopoly price.     The intuition underlying this result can be gleaned from the following
stylized example.   Consider a market with only two types of consumers: some with high
value of the private good and no valuation for the public good and others with a sufficiently
smaller value for the private good and a positive valuation for the public good.         If the
composition of types is such that the standard monopolist would serve only those with a
high value for the private good, it is possible for the monopolist to attract the low type
consumers by offering a bundled good that sells for a higher price - a portion of which is
designated for charity.

We then extend the model to consider the effect of bundling on price competition amongst
two firms. Within this context, we first demonstrate that any equilibrium of the pricing
game yields positive profits for both firms provided that they each designate a different share
of total proceeds for charity. Intuitively, bundling serves to differentiate the firms’ products
and therefore relaxes price competition.     We then endogenize the bundling decision and
examine the share of proceeds each firm will designate for charity. In doing so, we show
that there exists a subgame perfect equilibrium in which one firm provides only the private
good while the other elects to bundle their good with charity.

In some regards, our study is similar in spirit to Besley and Ghatak (2007) who explore the
feasibility and desirability of corporate social responsibility and show that such strategies
are consistent with profit-maximization in competitive markets. However, our study differs
from Besley and Ghatak (2007) along a number of important dimensions. First, Besley and
Ghatak (2007) focus solely on the bundling decision of firms engaged in price competition.
Our study examines this decision for both a single-good monopolist and firms engaged
in price competition.     Second, Besley and Ghatak (2007) model firms as simultaneously
announcing prices and an associated level of public good provision (or mission strategy).
In our framework, we consider a sequential game whereby firms first select what share of
proceeds will be designated for charity and then, based upon the observed shares, a price
to charge for their product.    Finally, Besley and Ghatak (2007) consider only two types
of consumers - those who are caring and value the public good and those who are neutral
and have zero value for the public good. Our model allows for the more general case of a


                                               3
continuum of types and assumes that continuous distributions of values for both the public
and private goods.4

Beyond providing a theoretical framework for understanding the incentive properties of
bundling private and public goods, our study lends insights into the debate on the efficacy
of corporate social responsibility.          Importantly, our study can be used to reconcile the
disparate empirical results regarding the profitability of corporate social responsibility and
highlights that not all actions driven by a desire to provide a ‘social good.’ For example,
while many would consider a Whole Foods donation of 5% of a store’s total sales to a
non-profit organization as corporate social responsibility, our model suggests that such an
activity is necessary for rather than at odds with profit maximization.5

Moreover, our study advances a growing literature exploring the response of consumers
to charity-linked products (see, e.g., Popkowski Leszczyc and Rothkopf, 2010; Elfenbein
and McManus, 2010; McManus and Bennet, 2011) or products produced using fair-trade
standards and/or “green” technologies (see, e.g., Loureiro and Lotade, 2005; Kotchen, 2006;
Kotchen and Moore, 2007; Hiscox and Smyth, 2011). Although this literature is ubiquitous
in showing that consumers are willing to pay more for such products, it provides little
guidance as to why a profit-maximizing firm would elect to offer such goods. Our study
explicitly addresses this issue and suggests a new rationale for the proliferation of charity-
linked and/or “green” products in the marketplace.



2     Theory of Bundling

We follow the basic setup by Adams and Yellen (1976). A private good is produced at
constant marginal costs c. Potential buyers are interested in at most one unit of the product,
   4
     More closely related to our study, Pecorino (2016) investigates motivations of linking charitable donations
to firms profits. Differently from our setting, he models a portion of profits not revenues going to charity.
For positive fixed costs of production, he shows that it may be profitable for a firm to choose to sell the
bundle instead of the pure private good. Our approach differs from his by not relying on positive fixed costs
and instead demonstrating that product differentiation provides a motive for bundling.
   5
     One need look no further than the following comment from CEO John Mackey to see that such motives
are a key driver of Whole Foods actions. “While our stores select worthwhile organizations to support,
they also tend to focus on groups that have large membership lists, which are contacted and encouraged
to shop our store that day to support the organization. This usually brings hundreds of new or lapsed
customers into our stores, many of whom then become regular shoppers. So a 5% Day not only allows us to
support worthwhile causes, but is an excellent marketing strategy that has benefited Whole Foods investors
immensely,” (Mackey, 2005).

the reservation price being denoted by v. Additionally, agents as having a value for a public
good, the (constant) marginal value being denoted by h ∈ [0, 1). Throughout the paper
we assume that the budget constraint of the consumers is not binding. We can therefore
describe each consumer as a pair (v, h).

It serves beneficial to denote the distribution of h by F (h), where we assume that its density
F 0 (h) > 0. For any given h, we can characterize the distribution of private values by defining
a demand function D(p|h) as only consumers with v ≥ p will purchase a standard private
good. We assume that that for all h, D0 (p|h)+pD00 (p|h) < 0. As F 0 (h) captures the number
of consumers for a given h, D(0|h) is normalized to 1.

To set up the subsequent discussion, it is useful to analyze individuals decisions when two
varieties are offered, described by (p0 , d0 ) and (p1 , d1 ), where pi is the price demanded for
the private good and di is the amount per sold unit going to charity. Without loss of
generality, we assume that d1 ≥ d0 ≥ 0.

In this case, a consumer of type (v, h) has three options: (i) to buy bundle (p0 , d0 ), (ii) to
buy bundle (p1 , d1 ), or (iii) to buy none of them. Consumers will consider buying bundle 1
instead of bundle 0 if and only if

                                                                      p1 − p0
                         p1 − hd1 ≤ p0 − hd0           ⇔   h ≥ ĥ =
                                                                      d1 − d0

We immediately obtain that no consumer buys product 1 if p1 − p0 ≥ d1 − d0 , and that
no demand for product 0 results if p1 < p0 . That is, the high-price bundle must be linked
with a larger donation, with the difference in donations (d1 − d0 ) being larger than the price
difference (p1 − p0 ).

Consumers with h > ĥ (h ≤ ĥ) will buy the bundle i = 1 (i = 0) if


                            v − pt + hdt ≥ 0           ⇔   v ≥ pt − hdt


Essentially, the link with charitable donations reduces the effective price to the consumers
the more, the larger their valuation of the public good is. Demand for the respective bundles
is therefore given by:                 Z   1
                                D1 =           D(p1 − hd1 |h)dF (h)
                                        ĥ




                                                   5
and                                         Z       ĥ
                                     D0 =                D(p0 − hd0 |h)dF (h)
                                                0

where ĥ = (p1 − p0 )/(d1 − d0 ). The consumption decisions are illustrated in Figure 1.



2.1   Monopolist linking up with charity


We first study a profit-motivated monopolist who considers linking up with a charity. We
restrict the bundling decision to a binary choice d ∈ {0, d} with d > 0. That is, besides
offering a product without charitable contributions at p0 with revenues p0 going to the
monopolist (d0 = 0), a bundle with d1 = d > 0 might be offered at p1 with revenues split
between charity (d) and monopolist (p1 − d).

As a baseline, we consider the standard monopolist’s setting without bundling. Here, the
monopolist chooses the price p by maximizing
                                                                 Z   1
                                     M
                                 Π       = max(p − c)                    D(p|h)dF (h)
                                            p                    0


such that the first order condition is given by
                      Z    1                                         Z   1
                               D(p|h)dF (h) + (p − c)                        D0 (p|h)dF (h) = 0   (1)
                       0                                             0


We denote the optimal monopoly price by pM and the corresponding profit by ΠM .

As a first step, we show that the monopolist will always provide one variety of the good
without bundling with charity, i.e. d0 = 0.

Proposition 1 A profit-oriented monopolist will always provide one variety of the good
that is not bundled with charitable donations.


Proof: Assume to the contrary, that the monopolist offers his product only as a bundle
(p, d) = (p1 , d1 ). Then consider an additional variety of the good at a price p0 = p1 − ĥd
(0 < ĥ < 1) that is not linked to charity (d0 = 0). With this, the demand for the (p1 , d1 )
bundle would be unaffected for h > ĥ, while the demand for the good at price p̂0 would




                                                             6
replace the demand for the bundle for all h ≤ ĥ. The profits would thereby increase as

                Z    ĥ                                                        Z   ĥ
 (p1 − d − c)             D(p1 − hd|h)dF (h) < (p1 − d − c)                             D(p0 |h)dF (h) < (p0 − c)D(p̂)F (ĥ)
                 0                                                             0




We now explore when introducing a bundle that links the private good with charitable
donations is indeed profitable. When introducing the bundle (in addition to selling the
product alone), the profit to the monopolist is given by


                              Π(p0 , p1 , d1 ) =(p0 − c)D0 + (p1 − d − c)D1
                                                         Z ĥ
                                               =(p0 − c)      D(p0 |h)dF (h)
                                                          0
                                                                Z 1
                                                 + (p1 − d − c)      D(p1 − hd|h)dF (h)
                                                                          ĥ



In order to derive a sufficient condition for profit increases due to bundling, we assume
that the monopolist offers the good at p0 = pM and additionally provides a bundle at price
p1 = p0 + ĥd (0 < ĥ ≤ 1). This bundle is constructed such that demand for h < ĥ still
goes to the unbundled variety at price p0 = pM whereas consumers with h > ĥ consume
the bundled variety. We consider the resulting profit as a function of ĥ, denoted by Π̂(ĥ).
Obviously Π̂(1) = ΠM . We now consider the profit change for a marginal decrease in ĥ
from ĥ = 1. The profit change is given by


       Π̂(ĥ) − Π̂(1)
                                    Z     1                                                            Z   1

We therefore obtain:

with Π̂0 (1) = 0 and

                       00
                   Π̂ (1) = − 2dD(pM |1)F 0 (1) − d(pM − c)D0 (pM |1)F 0 (1)                (2)


It is therefore obvious that profits increase above the (unbundled) monopolist’s profit ΠM
      00
if Π̂ (1) > 0.

                                                                         00
Rearranging (2) and using the first order condition (1), we see that Π̂ (1) > 0 is equivalent
to:

                            −D0 (pM |1)        − D0 (pM |h)dF (h)
                                                 R
                                            1

                            2D(pM |1)    p −c      D(pM |h)dF (h)

This condition states that the introduction of a bundle is beneficial if the price elasticity of
demand for agents with large h (at h = 1) is sufficiently larger than the price elasticity of
demand across all consumers:
                                                 R 0 M
                     −D0 (pM |1)
                       M           ηh=1      M −R D (p |h)dF (h)
                   p             =      >η=p
                     2D(pM |1)       2            D(pM |h)dF (h)

where η is the overall price elasticity of demand and ηh=1 is the price elasticity at h = 1.
If the price elasticity of demand for agents with large h is more than twice as large than
the overall price elasticity of demand, a monopolist can therefore benefit from bundling.
Intuitively, for highly elastic demand for high h-consumers, the monopolist would want
to choose a smaller price to gain additional consumers. By introducing the bundle, the
monopolist can differentiate prices such that low h-consumers still face a large price and
consumers with h > ĥ effectively face a smaller price as they consume the bundle.

In this case, both charity and monopolists benefit from introducing a second variety of
the product which links consumption with charitable donations. The former benefits from
increasing revenues, the latter from increasing donations.

We summarize these results in the following proposition:

Proposition 2 Bundling with a charity can be beneficial to a monopolist. In particular,
offering a bundle in addition to selling the good increases profits if the elasticity of demand
from high h consumers is more than twice than the average price elasticity at the standard
monopolist’s price.


                                               8
The monopolist can therefore potentially increase revenues beyond only selling the product
additionally offering a product/charity bundle. The charity also benefits from these bundles
as they gain revenues that (due to the linear structure of the public good) would not result
in a voluntary giving setting. Such benefits cannot occur, however, if demand is independent
of h. In this case, the monopolist would not desire to differentiate prices between consumers
with different preferences h towards the public good. Instead, the monopolist’s price pM
proves optimal.



2.2   Price competition in a Duopoly


While the previous section dealt with the case of a monopolistic provider of the private good,
we now turn to a situation in which there is price competition for selling the private good.
For simplicity, we consider the case of the duopoly. Here, it is well-known that Bertrand
competition leads to prices being set at marginal cost (which in our case of constant marginal
costs leads to zero profit). We now demonstrate another reason why bundling a private with
public good can be beneficial for for-profit firms: it generally relaxes the price competition.

We use the same model as above, but consider two simplifying settings. In the first, we
assume that private demand does not depend on h, i.e. D(p|h) = D(p) for all h and,
additionally a uniform distribution of h types. Second, we allow the demand to be correlated
with h, but assume h ∈ {0, h̄}, that is, consumers either do not care for the public good or
their marginal utility is at one specific positive level.

We assume that two firms A and B offer bundles (pA , dA ) and (pB , dB ), respectively; where
again di ∈ {0, d}. We assume the following sequence of the game:


   1. Firms choose the extent of bundling (dA and dB ).

   2. Firms engage in price competition (pA and pB ).


A few words are in order to discuss this timeline. An alternative would be to have firms
choose the amount of charitable donations and the price simultaneously (e.g., Besley and
Ghatak, 2007). However, many firms that provide some charitable donations or provide
public goods with parts of their revenues, first have to establish their brand (i.e., di ) and



                                                9
then later engage in price competition.6



2.2.1    Case 1: Private demand uncorrelated with preferences for public good


We first consider the case in which demand is independent of the valuation of the public
good, i.e., D(p|h) = D(p) for all h and assume h to be uniform, i.e. F (h) = h. In this case,
bundling could not be optimal for a monopolist (see above). We will see that bundling still
persists in the market.

The case of dA = dB = 0 corresponds to the standard Bertrand competition case and yields
the wellknown result of pA = pB = c with both firms earning zero profits. Similarly, if
dA = dB = d, each firm can secure all the demand by slightly underpricing its competitor.
Both firms would do so as long as prices cover the costs plus donations, i.e. if pi > c + d.
The equilibrium is therefore given by pA = pB = c + d.

Positive profits therefore can only prevail if dA 6= dB . We now consider this case and define
d1 = d and d0 = 0. As before, we denote the corresponding prices by p0 and p1 and let
ĥ = (p1 − p0 )/d if p1 > p0 and p1 − d ≤ p0 , ĥ = 0 if p1 ≤ p0 and ĥ = 1 if p1 − d > p0 − d.

The respective profits are given by

                                                   Z    ĥ
                               Π0 =(p0 − c)     D(p0 )dF (h)                                            (4)
                                                    0
                                                Z 1
                               Π1 =(p1 − d − c)     D(p1 − hd)dF (h)                                    (5)
                                                             ĥ


such that demand and profits change continuously with price changes.

This leads to the following (necessary) first order conditions:



                                   Z    ĥ                             Z   ĥ
                        ∂Π0
                     0=     =                D(p0 )dF (h) + (p0 − c)            D0 (p0 )dF (h)
                        ∂p0         0                                  0
                                             1
                                   − (p0 − c) D(p0 )F 0 (ĥ)                                            (6)
                                             d
   6
     An alternative assumption would be that bundling firms promise to give a percentage of their proceeds
to charity. While this would slightly complicate the exposition, the qualitative results are not affected by
this assumption.

                                         d

The first two terms in (6) and (7) reflect the pricing decisions for monopolists who serve
potential consumers with h < ĥ or h > ĥ, respectively. In addition, both firms take into
account that an increase in the price loses consumers along the h-margin. This third term
therefore reflects the price competition between the two firms.

Note that, for the assumed uniform distribution of h, the second order condition is auto-
matically satisfied when the first order condition holds with equality.7

Maximization of (4) and (5) directly leads to the existence of a price-equilibrium in which
both firms make positive profits:

Proposition 3 If firms have chosen to bundle their products with charitable contributions,
there is a unique price equilibrium. It yields positive profits for both of firms as long as
dA 6= dB . If dA = dB , the only equilibrium is given at pA = pB = dA + c = dB + c and gives
zero profits to both firms.


The proof is given in the Appendix. Proposition 3 shows that differentiating products by
linking them to a different extent to charitable contributions alleviates the price competition
such that positive payoffs result in duopoly. We therefore immediately arrive at the following
result:

Proposition 4 Any subgame perfect equilibrium is characterized by one firm in the first
stage choosing only to provide the private good min[dA , dB ] = 0, while the other chooses to
bundle at a level d = max[dA , dB ], before both firms engage in price competition that yields
positive profits for both.


The proof is again given in the Appendix. Proposition 4 shows that it is optimal for firms
to alleviate price competition by bundling with a charity. However, for the case of two
   7
     For more general distributions, the first-order condition may not be sufficient. In equilibrium, however,
interior solutions 0 < ĥ < 1 are also guaranteed: firms cannot compete down to zero profits (p0 = p1 − d = c)
as firm 0 could then increase its price without losing all consumers. However, if p0 > c, firm 1 can also set
a price to make positive profit. However, the assumption of a uniform distribution simplifies the further
explorations of equilibria as it guarantees the reaction functions given by (6) and (7) to be continuous. In
fact, relaxing the assumption of uniformly distributed h not problematic as long as reaction functions stay
continuous.


                                                     11
competing firms, only one will bundle such that our theory predicts that not all firms will
provide charitable contributions.

It is interesting to see what firm will arrive at larger profits in equilibrium. We show that:

Proposition 5 The firm which does bundle at a level d makes less profits than the firm
which does not link sales to charitable donations.


Given Proposition 5 it becomes obvious that a firm will particularly benefit if its competitor
bundles with the charity. As such, we predict from our model that (i) firms can be expected
to bundle with charity, but (ii) firms providing such a bundle will make less profits than
those selling solely the private good.



2.2.2   Case 2: Discrete h types


The derivations so far relied on a continuous distribution the public good valuation by
consumers (F 0 (h) > 0 for all h). However, it may seem reasonable that clusters in such
valuations exist. We therefore finally turn to a case where h can only take discrete values:
some consumers do not care for the public good (h = 0) while others have a positive
valuation (h = h̄) with 0 < h̄ < 1, i.e. consumer types are given by h ∈ {0, h̄}. Again we
allow firms to bundle either at level d or not to bundle at all. To simplify notation, we
denote the demand functions for h = 0 consumers by D0 (p) = D(p|0) and or h = h̄ types
by D1 (p) = D(p|h̄), again normalized to D0 (0) = D1 (0) = 1. The number of of potential
consumers with h = 0 is denoted by α0 , the number of h = h̄ consumers by α1 .

Similar to the last section, if both firms choose not to connect to charitable donation
(dA = dB = 0), both will sell the product at p = pA = pB = c by Bertrand competition.
By the same argument, if both firms choose to connect to d > 0, both will sell the bundle
at pA = pB = c + d. In this section, we therefore focus on deriving conditions under which
a separating equilibrium exists. As before, we denote firm 0 as the firm selling the product
without any donation (d0 = 0) and firm 1 as the firm selling the product with d1 = d > 0,
prices denoted by p0 and p1 respectively.

The difference to the last section is that a marginal price change does not only marginally
change the consumer base of a firm by marginally affecting the cutoff value ĥ; rather it may


                                              12
lead to a discrete change. This happens at p1 − p0 = h̄d, where consumers of type h = h̄
switch between both firms, as well as at p1 − p0 where consumers of type h = 0 switch. In
the separating equilibrium outcome, obviously, firm 0 only serves consumers type h = 0,
while firm 1 serves consumers of type h = h̄ > 0. With this notation, it proves beneficial to
define


                                     P0∗ = arg max(p − c)D0 (p)                                                       (8)

                                     P1∗ = arg max(p − c − d)D1 (p − hd)                                              (9)
                                                    p


as the monopoly prices for firm 0 (P0∗ ) selling only to consumers who don’t care for the public
good, and for firm 1 selling only to consumers who care (P1∗ ). Note that this immediately
implies that P0∗ ≥ c and P1∗ ≥ c + d. To avoid trivial cases, we assume that P0∗ > c and
P1∗ > c + d.

With these preliminaries, we arrive at the following proposition:

Proposition 6 A separating equilibrium exists if and only if all of the following conditions
are satisfied:


  (i) P1∗ − h̄d < P0∗ < P1∗ ,

 (ii) α0 (P0∗ − c)D0 (P0∗ ) ≥ maxp0 ≤P ∗ −h̄d (p0 − c)(α0 D0 (p0 ) + α1 D1 (p0 )),
                                               1


(iii) α1 (P1∗ − c − d)D1 (P1∗ − h̄d) ≥ maxp1 ≤P0∗ (p1 − c − d)(α0 D0 (p1 ) + α1 D1 (p1 − h̄d))


It is given by one firm choosing not to bundle and to offer the product at p0 = P0∗ , and the
other firm bundling and pricing at p1 = P1∗ .


One can show that – as long as condition (i) in Proposition 6 is satisfied – optimization in
(iii) yields p1 = P0∗ .8

The formal proof of Proposition 6 is given in the Appendix. The intuition, however, is
straightforward. In a separating equilibrium, for both firms a marginal change of price must
   8
     For this consider the first-order conditions for maximizing the right-hand side (iii) in p1 = P0∗ < P1∗ :
α0 ((P0∗ − d − c)D00 (P0∗ ) + D0 (P0∗ ))α1 ((P0∗ − d − c)D10 (P0∗ − h̄d)) + D1 (P0∗ − h̄d)) = −α0 dD00 (P0∗ ) + α1 ((P0∗ −
d − c)D10 (P0∗ − h̄d)) + D1 (P0∗ − h̄d)) > 0, where we used the first-order condition for maximization of profits
of firm 0, and the concavity of the profit function of firm 1.



                                                           13
not improve profits. This implies pricing at monopoly prices and that 0 < p1 − p0 < h̄d as
otherwise a marginal change would discretely increase the sales of one charity by stealing
consumers from the other firm. Additionally, no charity can have an incentive to discretely
change its price to a level to steal (all) consumers from the other firm. To steal the market
share from its competitor, a firm would need to lower its price and thereby give up some
profits from its original consumer base. This loss of profits must be larger than the profit
gain from the new consumers. This immediately leads to conditions (ii) and (iii).

For example, condition (iii) is automatically satisfied if P0∗ − d < c, i.e. if firm one would
run into losses if trying to attract consumers of h = 0 type. In this case, condition (ii)
essentially boils down to having a sufficiently small consumer base at h = h̄, i.e. α1 /α0
needs to be sufficiently small. In general, however, if P0∗ − d > c, condition (iii) generates a
lower bound for α1 /α0 .

Also note that – with Proposition 6 – we also obtain the following result:

Proposition 7 When D0 (p) = D1 (p), no separating equilibrium can exist.


That is, private demand cannot be uncorrelated with preference for public good. The
separation result in Section 2.2.1 was therefore driven by the assumption of a continuous
h-type distribution.

In order to further illustrate the conditions for a separating equilibrium, we consider linear
demand functions: let D0 (p) = 1 − β0 p, D1 (p) = 1 − β1 p. It is straightforward to derive the
monopoly prices:

                                       1 + β0 c
                                 P0∗ =                                                     (10)
                                         2β0
                                       1 + β1 c + β1 d(1 + h̄)
                                 P1∗ =                                                     (11)
                                                2β1

such that
                                            1 + β1 c + β1 d(1 − h̄)
                              P1∗ − h̄d =
                                                     2β1
Simple algebra shows that condition (i) of Proposition 6 is equivalent to

which puts a lower and upper bound on d. Note that this condition can only be satisfied
if β1 > β0 which corresponds to Proposition 7. We first derive a sufficient condition for
condition (ii) of Proposition 6: the right hand-side of condition (ii) is maximized in p0 =
P1∗ − h̄d if9
                                   α1          1 + β0 c − 2β0 (P1∗ − h̄d)

                                   α0                 (1 − h̄)dβ1

Then, evaluated at p0 = P1∗ − h̄d, condition (ii) holds if


    α0 (P0∗ − c)(1 − β0 P0∗ ) ≥ (P1∗ − h̄d − c)(α0 (1 − β0 (P1∗ − h̄d)) + α1 (1 − β1 (P1∗ − h̄d)))


which is equivalent to

                α1         (P ∗ − c)(1 − β0 P0∗ ) − (P1∗ − h̄d − c)(1 − β0 (P1∗ − h̄d))
                   ≤ γ̂2 := 0                                                           .                       (13)
                α0                     (P1∗ − h̄d − c)(1 − β1 (P1∗ − h̄d))

As such, a sufficient condition for (ii) to hold is given by:

                                             α1
                                                ≤ γ̂ = min{γ̂1 , γ̂2 }
                                             α0

Similarly, condition (iii) is equivalent to:

        α1                       max{0, P0∗ − d − c} max{0, 1 − β1 P0∗ }
           ≥ γ̃ :=                                                                       .                      (14)
        α0         (P1∗ − d − c)(1 − β1 (P1∗ − h̄d)) − (P0∗ − d − c)(1 − β1 (P0∗ − h̄d))

Note that condition (14) is automatically satisfied if β1 P0∗ ≥ 1, i.e. when demand from h̄
consumers at price P0∗ is zero, and if P0∗ − d − c ≤ 0 in which case losses would result. Using
the latter case, we obtain that for

separating equilibria will exist if α1 /α0 is sufficiently small and therefore satisfies condition
(ii).

To further illustrate the conditions for existence of separating equilibria, we consider a
specific parameter setting.

      Consider the first-order condition at p0 = P1∗ − h̄d. It is positive if (P1∗ − h̄d − c)(α0 D00 (P1∗ − h̄d) +
α1 D10 (P1∗ − h̄d)) + (α0 D0 (P1∗ − h̄d) + α1 D1 (P1∗ − h̄d)) = α0 [(P1∗ − h̄d − c)D00 (P1∗ − h̄d) + D0 (P1∗ − h̄d)] +
α1 [(1 − h̄)dD10 (P1∗ − h̄d))] ≥ 0.

Example 1 Let β0 = 1, β1 = 2, c = 0. We further fix h̄ and α1 /α0 = γ and derive
conditions on d which support separating equilibria.

Condition (i) is equivalent to

                                       1             1
                                             <d<                                           (15)
                                   2(1 + h̄)     2(1 − h̄)

Condition (iii) is automatically satisfied as D1 (P0∗ ) = 0. Simple algebra shows that γ̂1 > γ̂2
and that γ < γ̂2 is sufficient for condition (ii) to hold. This is equivalent to

                                               1 − 2γ
                                     d≤                                                    (16)
                                          2(1 − ĥ)(1 + 2γ)

Intuitively, a smaller d means that firm 0 has to reduce its price more in order to gain access
to type h̄ consumers. Hence, if d is sufficiently small, this reduction is not worthwhile as it
substantially reduces the profits from its original h = 0 consumer base.

Combining (15) and (16), we obtain the following range for d in which bundling leads to a
separating equilibrium:

                                  1             1      1 − 2γ
                                        <d<                                                (17)
                              2(1 + h̄)     2(1 − h̄) (1 + 2γ)

For separating equilibria to exist, it is therefore necessary that


                                            2γ < h̄.


That is, the less h̄ consumers are interested in the public good (i.e. the smaller h̄), the less
they are differentiated from h = 0 consumers. Thus, the firm that does not bundle would
have a larger incentive to reduce the price to also obtain those h̄ consumers, unless their
number is also very small. Conversely, if h̄ is large, it is more likely that a bundling level d
exists for which separation occurs. However, the existence of separating equilibrium always
requires γ < 1/2.

3    Conclusions

This note links the commodity bundling literature with the literature on the private provi-
sion of public goods. We have developed a model in the spirit of Adams of Yellen (1976)
to explore the potential profitability of bundling strategies for both private firms and char-
itable organizations. We begin by showing that under certain conditions, a single-good
monopolist can increase profits by selling both unbundled and bundled versions of their
product. Intuitively, the ability to link purchases with charitable contributions allows the
monopolist to differentiate their product and attract new customers.

Our analysis also considers the effect of bundling on price competition amongst two firms.
Here we show that any equilibrium of the pricing game yields positive profits for both firms
provided they bundle at different levels. Intuitively, bundling provides a way for firms to
differentiate their product and therefore relaxes price competition. Moreover, we show that,
in such cases, there exists a subgame-perfect equilibrium in which only one of the two firms
elects to bundle.

In doing so, our study sheds new light light on the debate regarding the efficacy of corporate
social responsibility. Importantly, our study highlights that not all such actions are driven
by a desire to provide a ”social good”. Rather our model suggests a profit motive for such
actions. In this regard, we view CSR as a strategy perfectly consonant with the mantra of
Friedmanites that “the business of business is business.” In many instances, bundling with
charities are necessary for rather than at odds with profit maximization.

We can envision several distinct directions for future work. First, theoretically we have
focused on the demand side but one could add important insights by focusing on the supply
side, and modeling how selection of workers and worker effort correlate with firms’ use of
CSR. A second branch of related work could tie such a model to a field experiment that
identifies the key parameters using randomization in a manner that permits a counterfactual
analysis of the welfare effects of CSR. Whole outside of the scope of our study, we hope to
use another occasion for such an exercise.

A     Appendix

Proof of Proposition 3

Maximization of (4) and (5) directly give the reaction functions of the two firms, i.e. p0 =
P0 (p1 ) and p1 = P1 (p0 ). It is obvious that c < P0 (p1 ) < p1 for p1 −d > c and c < P1 (p0 )−d <
p0 for p0 > c, since otherwise zero profits would occur for firm 0 and 1, respectively. As a
consequence, we have limp1 ↓c P0 (p1 ) = c and limp0 ↓c P1 (p0 ) = c + d. For p0 ↓ c, we therefore
obtain limp0 ↓c P0 (P1 (p0 )) − p0 = P0 (c + d) − c > 0. Here, P0 (c + d) − c follows as firm 0
can make a profit with a fraction of consumers by choosing p0 > c. For sufficiently large
p0 , however, we obtain P1 (p0 ) < p0 as then firm 1 would serve the whole market. Here,
P0 (P1 (p0 )) − p0 < 0. Continuity of the profit and reaction functions therefore immediately
imply the existence of a pD               D       D                       D        D
                          0 with P0 (P1 (p0 )) = p0 which, together with p1 = P1 (p0 ), forms

a price equilibrium. Since c < P0 (p1 ) < p1 and c + d < P1 (p0 ) < p0 + d, both firms face
positive demand and profits (0 < ĥ < 1).

We now prove the uniqueness of the price equilibrium. For this, we first show that for
each fixed ĥ, there exist unique p0 and p1 that satisfy the first order conditions (6) and
(7), respectively. For this, we partially differentiate (6) with respect to p0 , while keeping ĥ
constant to obtain
                            Z   ĥ                              Z   ĥ
                                       0
                        2            D (p0 )dF (h) + (p0 − c)            D00 (p0 )dF (h)
                            0                                   0
                                                      1
                         − [D(p0 ) + (p0 − c)D0 (p0 )] F 0 (ĥ)
                           |           {z            }d
                                             >0

                         <0

which shows that for a given ĥ there can be only one p0 satisfying (6). Hereby, D(p0 ) +
(p0 − c)D0 (p0 ) > 0 follows from (6). It follows that (p1 − P0 (p1 ))/d must be monotonic in
p1 : if not, two different p1 would exist that lead to the same ĥ (and the same P0 (p1 )) in
contradiction to the shown uniqueness. In fact, (p1 − P0 (p1 ))/d is increasing since it takes
value (p1 − P0 (p1 ))/d = 0 at p1 = c.




                                                     20
Similarly, we differentiate (7) with respect to p1 , while keeping ĥ constant to obtain
                    Z   1                                                       Z   1

                    ĥ                                                           ĥ
                                                           1     0
                 − [D(p1 − ĥd) + (p1 − d − c)D (p1 − ĥd)] F 0 (ĥ)
                   |                  {z                  }d
                                          >[D(p̂)+(p0 −c)D0 (p̂)]>0

                 <0

where p̂ = p0 = p1 − ĥd. Therefore, for any given ĥ there can be only one p1 satisfying (7).
In fact, (P1 (p0 ) − p0 )/d must be monotonic in p0 : if not, then two different p0 would lead
to the same ĥ in contradiction to the proven uniqueness. Furthermore, (P1 (p0 ) − p0 )/d is
decreasing in p0 as it takes value (P1 (p0 ) − p0 )/d = 1 at p0 = c .

Now consider an intersection of the reaction functions P1 (p0 ) and P0 (p1 ), say in (pD    D
                                                                                       0 , p1 ),

leading to ĥD . From above, we know that P1 (p0 ) − p0 is strictly decreasing in p0 while
p1 − P0 (p1 ) strictly increases in p1 . As a consequence the reaction functions are separated
by the iso-ĥ-line through (pD    D
                             0 , p1 ) such that no other intersection can exist. 


Proof of Proposition 4:

Follows immediately from Proposition 3

Proof of Proposition 5: We show that Π0 (0, d) > Π1 (0, d), i.e. the firm who links with
public good provision to a larger extent generates less profits.

Using the first-order conditions (6) and (7), we know that

where in the last line we used the assumption D00 < 0. We therefore have to show that




                                                               21

                   Z ĥ                          Z    ĥ
                 =      D(p0 )dF (h) + (p0 − c)            D0 (p0 )dF (h)
                    0                             0
                          1
                = (p0 − c) D(p̂)F 0 (ĥ)
                          d
                              1
                > (p1 − d − c) D(p̂)F 0 (ĥ)
                              d
                  Z 1                                 Z 1
                =     D(p1 − hd)dF (h) + (p1 − d − c)     D0 (p1 − hd)dF (h)
                   ĥ                                  ĥ
                  Z 1                             Z 1
                ≥     D(p1 − hd)dF (h) + (p0 − c)     D0 (p1 − hd)dF (h)
                    ĥ                                       ĥ

                ≥ [D(p1 − ĥd) + (p0 − c)D0 (p1 − ĥd)][1 − F (ĥ)]

                = [D(p̂) + (p0 − c)D0 (p̂)][1 − F (ĥ)]

which with [D(p̂) + (p0 − d0 − c)D0 (p̂)] > 0 immediately implies F (ĥ) ≥ 0.5 and therefore
completes the proof. 

Proof of Proposition 6:

If we condition conditions (i), (ii), and (iii) hold, a separating outcome results as no incen-
tives to deviate are possible. They are therefore sufficient.

To show that conditions (ii) and (iii) are necessary for the existence a separating equilibrium,
assume that prices p0 and p1 form a separating equilibrium. If pi 6= Pi∗ , firms could deviate
to optimize profits from their own consumers. If (ii) would not hold, firm 0 would have an
incentive to deviate from its price to attract h̄ type consumers. Similarly, (iii) is necessary
to prevent firm 1 from deviating from its monopoly price in order to attract consumers of
type h = 0. Furthermore, (ii) immediately implies P1∗ − h̄d < P0∗ and (iii) immediately
implies P1∗ > P0∗ such that condition (i) is also a necessary condition. 

Proof of Proposition 7: Suppose D0 (p) = D1 (p) = D(p). Then, P0∗ and P1∗ are given by
following two first order conditions:




                                 D(P0∗ ) + (P0∗ − c)D0 (P0∗ ) = 0                          (18)



                                               22
                       D(P1∗ − h̄d) + (P1∗ − c − d)D0 (P1∗ − h̄d) = 0                   (19)


We rewrite 19 as follows

          D(P1∗ − h̄d) + (P1∗ − h̄d − c)D0 (P1∗ − h̄d) − (1 − h̄)dD0 (P1∗ − h̄d) = 0.   (20)

Replacing P1∗ − hd by p0 in 20, we obtain:

                       D(p0 ) + (p0 − c)D0 (p0 ) = (1 − h̄)dD0 (p0 ) < 0                (21)

and therefore p0 = P1∗ − h̄d > P0∗ . This contradicts the necessary condition (i) for the
existence of an separating outcome. 
