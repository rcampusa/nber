                                               ABSTRACT

Within-industry differences in measured plant-level productivity are large. A large literature has been
devoted to explaining the causes and consequences of these differences. In the U.S. Census Bureau's
manufacturing data, the Bureau imputes for missing values using methods known to result in underestimation
of variability and potential bias in multivariate inferences. We present an alternative strategy for handling
the missing data based on multiple imputation via sequences of classification and regression trees.
We use our imputations and the Bureau's imputations to estimate within-industry productivity dispersions.
The results suggest that there is more within-industry productivity dispersion than previous research
has indicated. We also estimate relationships between productivity and market structure and between
output prices, capital, and the probability of plant exit (controlling for productivity) based on the improved
imputations. For some estimands, we find substantially different results than those based on the Census
Bureau's imputations.

1       Introduction

Within-industry differences in plant-level productivity are large. Averaging
across all U.S. manufacturing industries, Syverson (2004b) finds that plants
at the 90th percentile of the productivity distribution are nearly twice as
productive as plants at the 10th percentile. Explaining the causes and con-
sequences of these productivity differences are currently among the most
important research agendas in industrial organization. Existing explana-
tions include management practices, the quality of labor and capital inputs,
information technology, product substitutability, competition, research & de-
velopment, international trade, and regulation (Syverson (2011)). Within-
industry productivity differences also have implications for several other areas
of economics, including trade, labor, and macroeconomics (Bartelsman and
Doms (2000), Syverson (2011)).
    In this paper, we explore an explanation for (measured) productivity dis-
persion which has largely been ignored in the economics literature: imputed
data. Nearly all economic surveys suffer from item nonresponse, i.e., respon-
dents answer some questions but not others. Most statistical agencies impute
for the missing values before making data available for secondary analyses.
The manner of imputation can strongly impact secondary analyses of the
completed data (Little and Rubin (2002)).1 We investigate the impacts of
    1
    See Kaplan and Schulhofer-Wohl (2010) for a recent example of how
imputed data affected policymakers’ assessment of the effect of labor mobility
on unemployment in the U.S.


                                       3
imputation using the U.S. Census Bureau’s Census of Manufactures (CM)
which supports much of the empirical research on plant-level productivity.
Although the CM represents the best available data for studying U.S. plant-
level total factor productivity, imputations for nonresponse comprise a large
percentage of the data; in fact, we show that this percentage is far higher
than what is reported in the existing literature. For example, in 2007 the
imputation rates for total value of shipments, cost of electricity and cost of
materials inputs in the average 6-digit NAICS industry are, respectively, 27%,
37%, and 42%.2 The missing data pattern in the CM is non-monotone —
e.g., variable X is missing for some plants and Y is observed, while for other
plants X is observed and Y is missing. Therefore the percentage of plants
with missing data for some key variable is even higher than the imputation
rate for any given variable.
   The Census Bureau imputes for missing data using a variety of methods,
including ratio imputation and conditional mean imputation. The Bureau’s
primary goal is to facilitate point estimation of industry aggregates; however,
several of the Bureau’s imputation methods are not appropriate for multivari-
ate regression analysis of microdata — such as estimating plant-level total
factor productivity — because these methods can distort covariances and
correlations between variables and lead to underestimates of standard errors
   2
    In calculating these imputation rates, following most researchers who use
the CM data, we exclude so-called administrative records (AR) cases. These
AR plants, which each have fewer than 5 employees, account for about a
third of the total number of plants in the CM.


                                      4
(Schafer and Graham (2002) and Little and Rubin (2002)). We find that
functions of key variables in the completed data show evidence of attenua-
tion and under-estimation of variability. Further, the impacts of imputations
are not limited to a few industries and are not mitigated by using statistics
that are robust to outliers. The imputations are pervasive, affecting many
industries that have been studied previously.
   Ex ante it is not obvious how imputed data will affect estimates of produc-
tivity dispersion. Total factor productivity is a ratio of output over inputs.
The Census Bureau’s imputations tend to decrease dispersion in both the
numerator (output) and the denominator (inputs). Therefore imputed data
could explain some of the existing estimates of measured TFP dispersion, or
they could leave more dispersion to be explained.
   What can be done about this imputed data? One solution, popular among
economists, is to drop observations with imputed values, and only analyze
the plants with complete (non-imputed) data.3 Unfortunately, it is well-
known that in general, complete case analysis — i.e, using only the plants
with no missing or imputed data — sacrifices efficiency and can lead to
biased parameter estimates.4 Even if complete case analysis does not create
   3
    See, for example, Foster, Haltiwanger, and Syverson (2008).
   4
    Complete cases can lead to biased parameter estimates unless the miss-
ingness mechanism is Missing Completely At Random (MCAR) (Little and
Rubin (2002)). Missingness is MCAR if the probability that the data is miss-
ing does not depend on the values of the missing data or the values of the
observed data. We find that smaller plants in the CM are more likely to have
missing data. Thus the missingness in the CM is not MCAR.



                                      5
a selection bias for some sample, given the large percentage of missing data
in the CM, the efficiency loss from using complete cases would also be large.
Hence, complete-cases is not a trustworthy solution.
   As an alternative to these strategies, we create completed datasets via
multiple imputation (Rubin (1987), Reiter and Raghunathan (2007)).5 We
replace the Census Bureau’s imputations in the CM data with multiple im-
putations using sequences of classification and regression trees (CART), as
recently developed by Burgette and Reiter (2010). We describe the method
in detail in section 4. Here we provide some intuition for how it improves
on the Census Bureau’s imputation methods. First, the Bureau’s condi-
tional mean and average ratio methods put the imputed values on regression
lines, thus underestimating the true variability in the data. In contrast, the
CART method is designed to approximate the conditional distributions of
the variables being imputed. Unlike most of the Census Bureau’s imputa-
tion methods, the CART method works well for skewed distributions like
those in the manufacturing data. It also handles nonmonotone missingness
patterns, which are a common feature of economic data. Finally, the CART
method flexibly and automatically determines which of the available vari-
ables are useful predictors in the imputation model, and flexibly includes
interactions and non-linear relationships.
   Using the Census Bureau-imputed data, we estimate within-industry pro-
   5
    See Little and Rubin (2002) for discussion of the benefits of multiple
imputation over some of the methods the Census Bureau uses in the CM,
such as average ratio imputation and conditional mean imputation.

                                      6
ductivity dispersion for several relatively homogeneous industries that have
been studied previously. Then we replace the Census Bureau’s imputations
with multiple imputations using the CART method, and we re-estimate
within-industry productivity dispersion for the same industries. Our results
suggest that there may actually be more within-industry productivity dis-
persion than the existing literature suggests.
   These results have implications for counterfactual policy experiments such
as those suggested in Hsieh and Klenow (2009) and for cross-country compar-
isons of allocative efficiency (e.g., Bartelsman, Haltiwanger, and Scarpetta
(2008)). If there is more within-industry productivity dispersion in U.S. man-
ufacturing than previous research suggests, productivity losses from misallo-
cation in other countries may not be as large as Hsieh and Klenow (2009)
suggests. On the other hand, the extent of distortions and misallocation in
U.S. manufacturing may be greater than the existing literature suggests.
   We also investigate how imputed data affects some key empirical rela-
tionships between productivity and other economic variables. First, follow-
ing Foster, Haltiwanger, and Syverson (2008), we estimate the probability
of plant exit conditional on plant-level prices, capital stocks, and plant-level
productivity. When we use the Census Bureau’s imputations, we reproduce
FHS’s result that (conditional on plant-level productivity and capital stocks)
plant-level prices are associated with significant decreases in exit probabil-
ities. However, when we estimate the same regression using only plants
with non-imputed price and quantity data, the price coefficient is attenuated


                                       7
and no longer statistically significant. The Census Bureau’s imputations ap-
pear to create an artificially strong relationship between exit and plant-level
prices, conditional on productivity and capital stocks. When we replace the
Bureau’s imputations with multiply-imputed CART data, the coefficient on
prices is also attenuated and statistically insignificant.
   In a second example, following Syverson (2004a), we regress local market-
level productivity and size moments on a measure of demand density for the
ready-mix concrete industry. Using the Census Bureau’s imputations, we
largely confirm Syverson’s results. However, when we replace the Census
Bureau’s imputations with multiply-imputed data using CART, the demand
density coefficients are significantly affected, and in some cases the sign is
reversed.
   Our results should be of interest beyond the community of researchers who
study plant-level productivity and its causes and consequences. Plant-level
U.S. Census manufacturing data has been used to study a variety of other
topics, including why firms export (Bernard and Jensen (2004)), the effects
of environmental regulation on manufacturing plants (Becker and Henderson
(2001) and Greenestone (2002)), product switching (Bernard, Redding, and
Schott (2010)), industry agglomeration (Ellison, Glaeser, and Kerr (2010)),
and firm structure and plant exit (Bernard and Jensen (2007)), just to name
a few examples. Given the documented deficiencies of imputation techniques
like those used by the Census Bureau, the differential results suggest that
improved imputation procedures like the one presented here would benefit


                                       8
users of these data or many other economic datasets containing imputed
data.
    The next section describes how we estimate plant-level productivity. Sec-
tion 3 describes the data and how the Census Bureau’s imputations affect
ratios of key variables in the data. Section 4 describes the sequential CART
multiple imputation method. Section 5 describes our sample selection strat-
egy and how we choose variables for the imputation model. Section 6 shows
how the imputations affect estimates of productivity dispersion and some key
empirical relationships between productivity and other variables. Section 7
presents validity checks of our imputations. Section 8 concludes.



2       Plant-level Productivity Estimation

Conceptually, total-factor productivity (TFP) is how much output is pro-
duced from a given level of all measurable inputs. Plants with higher TFP
produce more output from the same level of inputs, or the same output with
lower levels of inputs. Syverson (2011) reviews several ways of estimating
plant-level TFP and the measurement issues inherent in each approach. We
use a popular method: we use industry cost shares to estimate a production
function. Specifically, for each industry, we assume that the technology of
every plant within an industry can be approximated by a 4-factor Cobb-
Douglas production function. We calculate two measures of TFP for plant i
in a given year. First, we calculate TFP based on the quantity of the plant’s


                                      9
physical output:


             T F P Qi = lnQi − βk lnKi − βl lnLi − βe lnEi − βm lnMi        (1)


where Qi is the quantity of physical output of plant i, Ki is the capital stock,
Li is labor, Ei is energy, Mi is materials, and the βs are the respective output
elasticities for each input. We also calculate a TFP measure based on the
plant’s revenues:


           T T F Pi = ln(Pi Qi ) − βk lnKi − βl lnLi − βe lnEi − βm lnMi    (2)


where Pi Qi is the total value of the plant’s output.6 We describe the variable
construction in more detail in the appendix.
   This method of estimating productivity has well-known deficiences (see,
e.g., Griliches and Mairesse (1995)). Previous research (e.g., Van Biesebroeck
(2004)) has analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of various other methods
of estimating productivity. For example, proxy methods (Olley and Pakes
(1996), Levinsohn and Petrin (2003), Wooldridge (2009)) address the well-
known endogeneity issue (Marschak and Andrews (1944)) and do not impose
constant returns to scale. However, our main goal in this paper is to show
how different methods of imputing for missing data affect widely-used esti-
mates of plant-level productivity dispersion and key empirical relationships
between productivity and other variables. Using cost-shares to estimate the
   6
       FHS call this measure “Traditional TFP.”

parameters in equations 1 and 2 is the approach used in some of the most
influential research in the productivity literature.7 Thus this choice facili-
tates comparisons with the existing literature on plant-level productivity. To
the extent that other methods of estimating production functions are more
sensitive to imputed data, the resulting productivity estimates may also be
more sensitive to imputed data.



3       The Impact of Imputed Data in the Census

        of Manufactures

The quinquennial Census of Manufactures (CM) includes data on roughly
300,000 manufacturing plants. The data for the smallest plants — about a
third of the sample — is entirely imputed. Following most researchers who
use the CM, we exclude these so-called administrative records plants from
all of our analysis.
    Over the years, the CM has been plagued by item non-response, and
the Census Bureau has created imputations for this missing data. However,
until the 2002 census, it was difficult to identify which, if any, items for a
given plant were imputed due to item nonresponse, because item-level flags
were not made available. Previous researchers developed several clever ways
    7
    For example, Bailey, Hulten, and Campbell (1992), Syverson (2004b),
Syverson (2004a), and Foster, Haltiwanger, and Syverson (2008), all use this
approach. Hsieh and Klenow (2009) also use cost shares, although they
estimate two-factor value-added production functions.


                                     11
to identify some of the imputed values.8 However, the item-level flags that
became available in the 2002 Census show that a much higher percentage of
observations are imputed than are identified by these methods.
   Table 1 presents the means and standard deviations of the within-industry
imputation rates for key variables for all 6-digit NAICS industries (the most
detailed level of industry classification) from the 2002 and 2007 Censuses. It
is clear that high percentages of data are imputed. For example, in both 2002
and 2007, for the average industry about 27% of the data on the total value of
shipments are imputed. For some other key variables, the mean imputation
rate is even higher. There is also significant variation in the imputation rates
across industries. For example, an industry that is one standard deviation
above the mean cost of materials imputation rate would have roughly 52% of
its materials data imputed in 2007. Note that these are imputation rates for a
given variable, and the missingness pattern in the CM data is nonmonotone.
In a multivariate analysis — such as estimating total factor productivity —
the percentage of plants that have imputed data for some variable is usually
larger than the percentage of plants that have missing data for any given
variable.
   The Census Bureau uses a variety of methods to impute for missing data,
including conditional mean imputation and industry average ratio imputa-
tion. The industry average ratio method imputes for missing values of vari-
   8
    See for example, Dunne (1998), Foster, Haltiwanger, and Syverson
(2008), Roberts and Supina (1996), and Roberts and Supina (2000).

able Y by multiplying the observed value of variable X by an industry average
ratio:
                                             Y
                                Yiimp = Xi                                    (3)
                                             X

where Yiimp is the imputed value of Y for plant i, Xi is the observed value of
                           Y                            Y
                             
X for the same plant, and X    , is an average ratio of X for plant i’s industry.
Thus all the imputed values for Y lie on a regression line running through
                                                               Y
the origin, where the slope is the industry average ratio      X
                                                                 .   Estimates of
the variance of Y conditional on X using data imputed this way understate
the true conditional variance. The same is true for the conditional mean
imputation method.
   Furthermore, these methods can introduce bias into estimated relation-
ships between variables. To see this, suppose that we use the industry average
ratio method to impute for Y conditional on X, but in the true (unobserved)
data Z is a strong predictor for Y even after conditioning on X. Then sup-
pose we regress Y (including the imputed values of Y ) on X and Z. The
coefficient on Z will be attenuated, because the imputed values of Y incor-
rectly generate conditional independencies in a subset of observations.9 The
same logic applies to conditional mean imputation if an important predictor
is omitted from the imputation model.
   To get some sense of how the Census Bureau’s imputations are affecting
the relationships between key variables in the CM data, we compute the
   9
   Note that in this case the ratio imputation method introduces measure-
ment error (in Y ) that is correlated with the explanatory variable Z.

                                                    )

where IQR(Z) is the interquartile range of Z, Ximp represents imputed cases
for the variable X, T V SimpX are the corresponding observations for the total
value of shipments (which may be either imputed or observed), Xobs are
observed cases for the variable X, and T V Sobs are the corresponding TVS
observations. A ratio less than one is evidence that there is less dispersion in
the ratio X/T V S in the imputed data than there is in the observed data. We
compute these ratios for several inputs: capital, production worker hours, the
cost of materials, the cost of electricity, and the cost of fuels. Table 2 presents
the ratio of IQRs for the industries at the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles
of the industry distributions. The results suggest that the Census Bureau’s
imputations tend to reduce the amount of within-industry variation in the
ratios of key variables, in some cases quite drastically. In both years, for
most industries, and for all of these key input variables, when a variable X
is imputed, there is much less variation in the X/T V S ratio than there is
when X is observed. Since total factor productivity essentially measures the
relationship between output and these inputs, it seems likely that estimates of
productivity dispersion will be affected by the Census Bureau’s imputations.

4        Multiple Imputation using Classification and

         Regression Trees

Given the evidence of the impact of imputed data in table 2 and the de-
ficiences of the Census Bureau’s imputation methods, we replace the Bu-
reau’s imputations with multiple imputations created via sequential regres-
sion trees, as developed by Burgette and Reiter (2010).10 Before describing
the details of the CART method, we provide some intuition for how it im-
proves on the Census Bureau’s imputation methods. First, as noted above,
the Bureau’s conditional mean and average ratio methods put the imputed
values on regression lines, thus underestimating the true variability in the
data. In contrast, the CART method is designed to approximate the con-
ditional distributions of the variables being imputed. Second, some of the
Bureau’s imputation methods use very simple models, conditioning on a
single variable. As noted above, this can introduce bias in estimates of re-
lationships between the imputed variable and other variables. The CART
method is designed to avoid this problem by potentially conditioning on any
available variables (as well as interactions of those variables). The CART
method has also been shown to perform well in the related problem of gen-
erating synthetic data (Reiter (2005), Drechler and Reiter (2011), and Wang
and Reiter (2012)). This suggests that the CART method is also likely to

                                    15
produce reasonable imputations for missing data in the CM.
   Classification and regression trees (CART) approximate the conditional
distribution of a single variable using multiple predictors (see Breiman, Fried-
man, Olshen, and Stone (1984), Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman (2009), and
Ripley (2009)). Intuitively, the procedure is designed to classify units (in our
application, manufacturing plants) into relatively homogeneous groups. One
can think of the algorithm as building a tree from the ground up, where the
leaves of the tree contain sets of similar plants. Suppose, for example, we are
building an imputation model for plant output, and suppose that we have
only one potential predictor: employment. In the each stage of the tree-
building process, the goal is to use employment to divide the plants into two
subgroups that are more homogeneous in plant output than the group that is
being divided. The CART algorithm searches through all the observed values
of employment for the threshold such that the variance of output within the
two subgroups (above and below the employment threshold), is reduced the
most. This split results in the first two branches in the tree — plants with
employment values below the threshold are put in one branch, and those
above the threshold are put in the other branch. The process continues re-
cursively on each branch of the tree until the “leaves” contain some minimum
number of plants or until the leaves all meet some criteria for homogeneity.
   Of course, in general there will be many potential predictors available.
In the general case, at each stage of the tree-building process, the algorithm
searches over all observed values (within a given branch) of all the predictors


                                      16
for the split which most reduces the variance of output in that branch. Once
the tree for output is built, imputations for output are created by taking
draws from the output observations in the appropriate leaves of the tree.
Thus imputations for missing output for plant i are drawn from observed
output values of plants that are similar to i. A separate tree is built for each
variable in the dataset, and the entire process is repeated multiple times to
create multiple imputations for each missing value.
   We now describe the procedure in more detail. We run the imputation
process separately for each industry. We begin the process in any industry
by deleting (making missing) any Census Bureau imputations identified by
the item-level edit/impute flags and filling in initial guesses for these missing
data to create completed datasets for the industry; see Burgette and Reiter
(2010) for an explanation of how to obtain initial guesses. Then, we order
the variables in terms of increasing percentages of missing data. For the first
variable in this ordering with missing data, say Y1 , we fit the tree of Y1 on all
other variables, say Y−1 , so that each leaf contains at least k records; call this
tree Y (1) . We use k = 5, which is a default specification in many applications
of CART, to provide sufficient accuracy and reasonably fast running time.
We grow Y (1) by finding the splits that successively minimize the variance of
Y1 in the leaves. We cease splitting any particular leaf when the variance in
that leaf is less than 0.00001 times the variance in the marginal distribution
of Y1 or when we cannot ensure at least k records in each child leaf. For any
plant with missing data, we trace down the branches of Y (1) until we find


                                        17
that plant’s terminal leaf. Let Lw be the wth terminal leaf in Y (1) , and let
  (1)
YLw be the nLw values of Y1 in leaf Lw . For all records whose terminal leaf
                                                                    (1)
is Lw , we generate replacement values of Yij by drawing from YLw using the
Bayesian bootstrap (Rubin (1981)). Repeating the Bayesian bootstrap for
each leaf of Y (1) results in an initial set of plausible values.
     We next move to the second variable in the ordering with missing data,
say Y2 . We fit the tree of Y2 on all other variables, which we call Y (2) , using
the newly completed values of Y1 . We run observations down Y (2) to create
plausible values for Y2 . The process continues for each Yi in the ordering,
each time using the newly imputed values of Y−i to fit the tree and in locating
leaves. We then cycle through this process ten times to help move the trees
away from the initial starting values. The end result is one completed dataset.
We repeat this entire process 20 times to generate 20 completed datasets.
By cycling through the process ten times between completed datasets, we
minimize dependence between the completed datasets.11



5        Sample Selection and Imputation Model

In order to directly investigate the impact of imputation on estimates of
plant-level productivity dispersion, we select a few detailed industries. Our
industry selections are motivated by two factors. First, we want to choose
    11
    This independence allows us to use Rubin’s (1987) combining formulas
to estimate the impact of imputed data on our standard errors, which we
cannot do with the Census Bureau’s single imputations.


                                        18
industries that have been studied previously, to facilitate comparision with
the existing literature on plant-level productivity. Second, we want to select
industries that are relatively homogeneous. In industries that are relatively
homogeneous, plants with missing data are likely to be relatively similar to
plants with complete data. Thus for homogeneous industries we would think
that the Census Bureau’s relatively simple imputation methods would have a
better chance of preserving the relationships in the data between productivity
and other variables.
   To satisfy both of our criteria we select the manufacturing industries stud-
ied in Foster, Haltiwanger, and Syverson (2008): boxes, white pan bread,
carbon black, coffee, ready-mix concrete, hardwood flooring, motor gasoline,
ice, plywood, and sugar.12 According to FHS, “Producers of these prod-
ucts make outputs that are among the most physically homogeneous in the
manufacturing sector.” For all of these industries except concrete, in at least
one year we have data on the values and physical quantities of the products
the plants produce.13 This allows us to construct plant-level prices and to
ensure that the plants in our sample are specializing in the same product
or products. We describe our sample selection procedure in detail in the
appendix.
  12
     Some of these industries have also been studied previously by Roberts
and Supina (1996), Roberts and Supina (2000), and Davis, Grim, and Halti-
wanger (2008).
  13
     For two of the industries — motor gasoline and ice manufacturing —
we also have consistent measures of product-level physical quantities in both
2002 and 2007.


                                      19
   Table 3 shows the sample size and imputation rates for key variables
for each of our selected industries. Except for the concrete industry, the
imputation rates in our sample are significantly lower than in the average
manufacturing industry. However, the imputation rate for physical quantity
of product shipped, at 45%, is substantially higher than the rates for the
other variables. In the ready-mix concrete industry, for most variables the
imputation rates are close to the manufacturing average. As noted above,
the missingness pattern in the CM data is nonmonotone, and measuring
TFP requires using combinations of all of the variables in table 3. Thus
the percentage of plants with missing/imputed data for at least one of the
variables is higher than the imputation rate for any given variable. In the
next section we describe the sequential CART method, which we use to create
multiple imputations to replace each of the Census Bureau’s imputations.
   What variables should be included in the imputation model? Little and
Rubin (2002) and Schafer and Graham (2002) provide guidance on this point
for multiple imputation methods in general. Essentially, the imputer should
include as input to the imputation procedure any available variable he thinks
is not independent of the other variables, including any variable that will be
used in the subsequent analysis. For any given “dependent” variable, the
CART procedure only splits on predictors that are useful for characteriz-
ing the conditional distribution of that variable. Since we want to analyze
total factor productivity, we include any variable in the CM that is used
to calcuate TFP, as well as variables that we expect to be useful predic-


                                     20
tors of these variables. These considerations lead us to include a rich set of
variables as inputs to the CART procedure. For each industry in table 3
except concrete, the potential predictors for each tree include — whenever
the variable is not the dependent variable — the value of product shipments,
the physical quantity of product shipments, the book value of assets, the
cost of purchased electricity, the cost of fuels, the total cost of materials,
the number of production workers, production worker hours, total salaries
and wages, production worker wages, the total value of shipments, and the
number of non-production workers. Since we also plan to analyze the rela-
tionship between plant-level productivity and plant survival, we also include
as a potential predictor an indicator for whether or not the plant exited be-
tween 2002 and 2007. For the ready-mix concrete industry, we have a larger
sample size and slightly different set of available variables, so we build a
somewhat different imputation model. We describe the variable selection for
the concrete industry in section 6.2.



6    Results

Table 4 presents within-industry productivity and price dispersion statistics
for the industry-years for which we are able to calculate them. For each
measure — TTFP, TFPQ, and prices — we compute the ratio of the 75th
percentile to the 25th percentile. Columns 1, 3, and 5 present these statistics
calculated from the Bureau-completed data, which includes both the non-


                                        21
imputed data and the Census Bureau’s imputations for missing data. Like
FHS, we find more within-industry dispersion in the physical quantity-based
productivity measure, TFPQ, than in the revenue-based measure. With the
exception of boxes and plywood, product prices in the Bureau-completed
data are also less dispersed than either measure of productivity — this is
also consistent with FHS’s findings.
   Columns 2, 4, and 6 of table 4 present estimates of within-industry pro-
ductivity and price dispersion based on datasets completed with the se-
quential CART method. We compute each statistic separately from each
of our 20 completed datasets, and report the means of the 20 estimates.
Comparing columns 1 and 2, for every industry except bread there is more
within-industry TTFP dispersion in the CART-completed data than in the
Bureau-completed data, and in some industries, there is much more disper-
sion. Comparing TFPQ (columns 3 and 4) and prices (columns 5 and 6), the
differences between the CART-completed data and the Bureau-completed
data are even larger. For the average industry-year in our sample, TFPQ
dispersion is 30% higher in the CART-completed data and price dispersion
is 46% higher.
   The impact of imputed data also varies substantially across industries.
TFPQ and prices for plywood are impacted the most, perhaps because of
the relatively small sample size, and the relatively heterogeneous products
the industry produces (compared to the other industries in our sample).
Productivity and price dispersion estimates for the gasoline industry seem to


                                       22
be the least affected by imputed data, perhaps because the primary products
are quite homogeneous.
   How do the dispersion measures in the Bureau-completed data and the
CART-completed data compare to dispersion measures in the non-imputed
data? To answer this question we calculate productivity and price dispersion
statistics for the subset of plants in our sample that have no imputed data.14
For each industry-year statistic in table 4, we compute the ratio of that
statistic in the non-imputed data over the same statistic calculated from the
Bureau-completed data. A ratio greater than 1 indicates that there is more
dispersion in the non-imputed data than in the completed data. For TTFP,
on average there is slightly less dispersion in the non-imputed data than in
the Bureau-completed data — the average ratio is 0.96 — although there is
some industry-year variation in this ratio. For the average industry-year, the
75-25 TFPQ ratio is 14% larger and the price dispersion is 22% greater in
the non-imputed data than in the Bureau-completed data. Thus, on average
the TFPQ and price dispersion measures in the non-imputed data lie about
half way between the dispersion estimates from the Bureau-completed data
and the CART-completed data.
  14
     For the productivity statistics, these are plants that have non-imputed
data for all the variables required to calculate productivity. For the price
statistics, we only required that the plants have non-imputed product quan-
tity and product value data. Only about 43% of the plants in our sample
in have fully-observed (non-imputed) data for productivity, and about 62%
have non-imputed data for product quantity and value data. Thus the ef-
ficiency losses from using only complete cases in this sample could be quite
large.

                                     23
   If our CART imputation models are correct,15 these results suggest that in
addition to the (substantial) efficiency losses that would result from complete-
cases analysis, using only complete cases would also create a sample selection
bias. Smaller plants are more likely to have missing data, so the apparent
sample selection bias may be the result of correlations between size, produc-
tivity and prices.
   The lower degree of price dispersion in the Bureau-completed data is
not surprising given what we know about the Census Bureau’s imputation
methods. Although the Bureau uses a variety of imputation methods and
models for some variables, for the product physical quantity data, it primarily
uses the industry average ratio method. This method imputes for missing
quantity data by multiplying the value of the product shipments (for the
same plant) by an industry average ratio of product quantity to product
value. This implicitly assumes that all plants with imputed physical quantity
data for a given product sell the product for the same price. Given the
degree of within-industry price dispersion we see in the non-imputed data,
this imputation method is at least part of the reason price dispersion is
significantly lower in the Bureau-completed data. Since small plants are
more likely to have missing data than larger plants, plugging in industry
averages could underestimate dispersion even further than if their were no
relationship between plant size and missingness.
   The method of imputing for missing data clearly affects estimates of
  15
       We check the validity of the CART imputation models in section 7.


                                      24
within-industry productivity and price dispersion. But do imputations affect
key empirical relationships between productivity and other variables? In the
next subsections we show that they do.


6.1    Productivity, Prices and Plant Survival

Foster, Haltiwanger, and Syverson (2008) build on an important theoretical
and empirical literature analyzing and documenting the connection between
producers’ productivity and survival and its affect on industry aggregates
(Jovanovic (1982), Ericson and Pakes (1995), Melitz (2003), and Bartelsman
and Doms (2000)). One of FHS’s contributions is to separately measure the
effects of productivity and prices on plant survival. Specificallly, they find
that, controlling for physical productivity (TFPQ) and plant capital stock,
plants with higher output prices are less likely to exit. FHS interpret the
price coefficient as a demand effect.
   FHS use data from the Censuses of Manufactures for 1977-1997, and
it is difficult to identify imputed data for these years. Here we attempt to
replicate FHS’s results using the 2002 and 2007 CM data, so that we can take
advantage of the item-level impute flags to identify imputed data. To the
extent possible we use FHS’s sample selection strategy. The main difference is
that we exclude concrete plants, since the Census Bureau stopped collecting
physical quantity data for this industry in 1992.16 Following FHS, we use
  16
    We describe our industry definitions and sample selection strategy in
detail in the appendix.


                                        25
probit regressions to estimate the probability that a plant exits between 2002
and 2007, conditional on the plant’s productivity, output price, and capital
stock.17
   Table 5 presents the results of the probit regression run on different sam-
ples. All the regressions include industry fixed effects (not reported). Column
1 shows the results from the Bureau-completed data. Like FHS, we find that
a higher capital stock, higher productivity, and higher prices are associated
with a statistically significantly lower probability of exit.18 Column 2 re-
ports the results when we run the same regression on only the plants with
imputed product physical quantity data. The coefficient on physical pro-
ductivity is 36% larger in magnitude, and the coefficient on prices is almost
3 times larger in magnitude compared to column 1. Column 3 shows the
results when we repeat the same regression on the sample of plants with ob-
served (non-imputed) product physical quantity data. Compared to column
2 the coefficient on physical TFP is about 40% smaller in magnitude, the
price coefficient is about 80% smaller, and neither coefficient is statistically
significant. The Census Bureau’s imputations seem to strongly affect the es-
timated relationship between prices and the probability of exit, conditional
on plant-level productivity and capital stock.
  17
     The exit rate in our estimation sample is 18.4%, which is quite similar
to the average exit rate of 19.6% in FHS’s sample.
  18
     FHS also estimate a probit, but report the marginal effects. For com-
parison, our estimated marginal effects for physical TFP, prices, and capital
(evaluated at the sample mean) are, respectively, -0.099, -0.092, and -0.042.
These are similar to FHS’s estimates.


                                      26
   Column 4 of table 5 shows the results of the same probit regression run on
the CART-completed dataset. We estimate each probit separately on each of
the 20 CART datasets and report the means for each coefficient. We compute
the standard errors using Rubin’s (1987) combining formula. The coefficients
on physical TFP and capital are still significant, but the price coefficient is
no longer significant. The relationship between plant-level prices and plant
survival, conditional on physical productivity and capital, does not seem to
be as strong as the Bureau-completed data suggests.


6.2    Another Concrete Example: Productivity and Mar-

       ket Structure

The ready-mix concrete industry has been studied by a number of economists
— Syverson (2008) reviews some of this research. Perhaps most notably,
Syverson (2004a) uses data from the 1982-1992 Censuses of Manufactures
to study the industry. Because ready-mix concrete is subject to high trans-
port costs, the industry’s output markets are geographically segmented. The
product is also relatively homogeneous. Syverson takes advantage of these
features of the industry to assess the impact of market-level demand shocks
on market structure and market-level moments of the productivity distribu-
tion. Here we attempt to replicate some of Syverson’s findings using the 2002
and 2007 Censuses, and we assess the impact of imputation on the results.
   Following Syverson, we use the Bureau of Economic Analysis’s component



                                      27
economic area (CEA) as our market definition, and we select producers in
markets with at least 5 concrete plants. For each plant-year observation
we calculate traditional TFP as in equation 2. For each market-year, we
calculate the median TFP, the interquartile range (IQR) of TFP, output-
weighted mean TFP, the 10th percentile of TFP, the log of average plant
output, and Syverson’s measure of concrete demand density — construction
sector employment per square mile.19 Table A3 in the appendix presents
descriptive statistics for our sample, computed from the Bureau-completed
data.20
   We regress each market-year moment of productivity or output on the log
of market demand density. Table 6 presents estimates and heteroskedasticity-
robust standard errors for the coefficient on demand density. Columns 1
and 2 show the results of two specifications run on the Bureau-completed
data. With the exception of the output-weighted mean TFP regression, the
magnitudes of the coefficients are roughly the same as Syverson’s results and
the sign pattern is the same: within-market TFP dispersion is negatively
associated with demand density, and median TFP, 10th percentile TFP, and
average output are positively associated with demand density. The demand
  19
    We describe the variable construction in more detail in the appendix.
  20
    Compared to Syverson’s sample, in the average market we have about
3 more plants with TFP data, and the interquartile range of the number
of plants per market is exactly the same. In our sample there is more
across-market variation in within-market TFP dispersion, median TFP, and
weighted mean TFP, less variation in the 10th percentile of TFP and demand
density, and about the same variation in average output.



                                     28
density coefficient is statistically significant at the 5% or 1% level in the latter
three regressions.
   The across-market output and TFP variation that we see in table A3
and the results in the first two columns of table 6 suggest that market-level
demand density is a useful predictor of plant size and productivity. Accord-
ingly, in addition to the input and output variables included as potential
predictors in the imputation models for the other industries, for the concrete
industry we include demand density as a potential predictor in the impu-
tation model. On the other hand, we do not observe plant-level physical
quantities of output for the concrete industry, so we cannot include them as
potential predictors in the imputation model.
   We create 20 CART-completed datasets for the concrete industry and
run the regressions separately on each dataset. Columns 3 and 4 of table
6 show the means of the 20 estimates for each regression. We combine the
heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors from each of the 20 regressions us-
ing the combining formulas in Rubin (1987). The imputations have a strong
impact on some of the results. The demand density coefficients are now much
larger in the TFP dispersion regressions and 10th percentile of TFP regres-
sions, and the coefficients are now statistically significant in the former. In
the median TFP regressions, the demand density coefficient changes sign and
increases in magnitude.
   Why do the imputations affect the results in this way? It turns out
that in the concrete industry, demand density is correlated with the market-


                                        29
level imputation rate: in a regression of log demand density on the market-
level fraction of concrete TFP data that is imputed, the coefficient on the
imputation rate is −0.51. Markets with lower levels of demand density have
higher percentages of imputed concrete data in the CM. Since the Census
Bureau’s imputation methods tend to affect the overall distribution of TFP
we see in the observed data, these imputations also affect the estimated
relationships between market-level TFP and demand density.



7    Validity Checks

Intuition and the statistical literature on imputation suggest that the CART
method should do a better job of capturing the joint distribution of the
data than, for example the Census Bureau’s industry average ratio method.
However, it is still possible that the CART imputations are distorting the
joint distribution of the variables in our data in a way that leads to biased
estimates of productivity dispersion or the regression coefficients in tables 5
or 6. To check the validity of our imputation models for the analyses above,
we use posterior predictive checks (He, Zaslavsky, Harrington, Catalano, and
Landrum (2010)). Intuitively, we use the CART method to create many pairs
of datasets, where the first dataset in each pair includes imputed and non-
imputed data, while the second dataset is (almost) entirely imputed. Then
we re-estimate the regressions and productivity dispersion statistics on each
dataset. If, for example, the regression coefficient of interest is consistently


                                      30
higher in the almost entirely imputed datasets, then this is evidence that
the imputation model may be leading to upward-biased estimates of that
coefficient.
   We now provide a formal description of the validity checks. Following
Burgette and Reiter (2010), suppose that the n by k data matrix Y is ar-
ranged so that Y = (Yp |Yc ), where Yp are the p partially observed columns of
Y and Yc are the remaining k − p columns that are completely observed. Let
Yobs denote the set of observed elements in Y , and let Ymis denote the set of
missing elements. For each industry, we use the CART method to create 500
pairs of datasets. The first dataset in each pair is a completed dataset, in
which we create imputations for each element of Ymis . To create the second
dataset in each pair, we replace every element of Yp , including elements that
were not imputed in the original data. To do this, we take draws from the
predictive distribution of Yp conditional on Yc using the tree fitted to create
the first dataset in the pair. Let the second dataset in each pair be called
the predicted datasets. We then estimate the parameter of interest — the
within-industry productivity or price dispersion or a regression coefficient —
separately on each dataset. For each of the 500 pairs of datasets, we compute
the differences between the parameter estimates from the completed dataset
and those from the predicted dataset. Finally, for each parameter θj , we




                                      31
compute a two-sided posterior predictive P-value:

               500                         500
       2       X                           X
 Pj =     min{     I(θimp,ij − θpred,ij ),
                     b         b               I(θbpred,ij − θbimp,ij )} (5)
      500      i=1                         i=1


where I(x) equals one if x > 0 and equals zero otherwise. Here, θbimp,ij is
the estimate of parameter θj — a regression coefficient or within-industry
dispersion measure — from the ith completed dataset, and θbpred,ij is the
estimate from the ith predicted dataset. If the predicted data come from
the same distribution as the completed data, we would expect θbimp,ij to be
higher than θbpred,ij for about half the dataset pairs and lower than θbpred,ij
in the other half. A small Pj indicates that the θbpred,i consistently differs
from θbimp,i in one direction. This would suggest that the imputation model
does not adequately capture the relationships in the data, and thus estimates
based on the imputed data may be biased.
   We calculate P for each measure of productivity and price dispersion
in table 4 and for the regressions presented in tables 5 and 6For 24 of the
33 dispersion moments estimated in table 4, the associated P probabilities
are greater than 0.05, and 20 of them are greater than 0.10.21 In the few
cases where there is evidence of a bias, the biases tend to be small. For
example, the traditional TFP dispersion for the boxes industries tends to
be only about 5 percentage points higher in the predicted data than in the
completed data, and there is no evidence of bias in the physical TFP or price
  21
       We provide the full set of P values in table A4 in the appendix.

dispersion statistics for the boxes industry.
   For the exit probits in table 5, the P probabilities associated with the
coefficients on physical TFP, prices, and capital are, respectively, 0.24, 0.24,
and 0.06. Thus we find no evidence that the CART imputations are leading
to biased estimates of the coefficients that are most affected by the imputa-
tion method — the coefficients on physical TFP and prices. Together this
evidence suggests that the CART model generates plausible data with respect
to most of the estimated relationships represented in tables 4 and 5.
   In table 6, for the regressions with productivity dispersion as the de-
pendent variable, the validity checks provide no evidence that the CART
imputations lead to a bias in the demand density coefficients.22 In the other
regressions in table 6, the validity checks suggest there is a positive bias in
the demand density coefficients. However, in the median TFP and weighted-
mean TFP regressions, this bias works against finding that the imputation
method matters. In the median TFP regressions, we find negative, statisti-
cally significant coefficients in the CART data despite evidence of a positive
bias.
  22
   We report the P values for the regressions in 6 in table A5 in the ap-
pendix.

8     Conclusions and Suggestions for Further Re-

      search

Much of the literature on plant-level productivity uses the Census Bureau’s
Census of Manufactures (CM). A surprisingly large percentage of the CM
data is imputed. Our results suggest that these imputations have an eco-
nomically significant effect on estimates of within-industry productivity dis-
persion as well as relationships between productivity and other important
economic variables.
    Using classification and regression trees (CART), we provide a new set of
multiple imputations that seek to better preserve the joint distribution of key
variables in the data and thus provide more accurate estimates of plant-level
productivity dispersion and the relationships between productivity and other
economic variables. The estimates of within-industry TFP dispersion using
CART-completed data are often significantly higher than estimates based on
the Census Bureau-completed data. These results suggest that there is more
within-industry productivity dispersion than the previous literature suggests.
We also find that estimated relationships between productivity and demand
density, and between prices, capital, and plant survival are not robust to
replacing Bureau-imputed data with CART-imputed data.
    In addition to demand density, prices, and capital stocks, the existing
literature provides a variety of explanations for measured within-industry
productivity differences, including heterogeneity in management practices,


                                      34
the quality of labor inputs, information technology, research and develop-
ment, international trade, and regulation. These variables are not part of
the Census Bureau’s imputation models for the CM. Most existing research
using Census Bureau manufacturing data was unable to identify much of the
imputed data. This suggests that many existing estimates of the relation-
ships between U.S. manufacturing productivity and other key variables may
be biased.
   Our findings also have broader implications. Although imputation for
missing data is a well-developed field in statistics, economists have ignored
many of its findings. Complete-cases analysis is known to lead to biased
parameter estimates except under restrictive assumptions (Little and Rubin
(2002)), but economists still routinely drop imputed data from their samples
without correcting for sample selection bias. The goals of statistical agencies
that collect microdata and publish aggregate statistics are typically different
from the goals of economists and other researchers who use the microdata the
agencies collect. As a result, statistical agencies’ imputations for missing data
are often not suitable for multivariate microeconometric analysis. In the past,
it was difficult to identify imputed data in many economic microdatasets.
Fortunately, in recent years, the U.S. Census Bureau and other agencies have
made it easier identify imputations in their microdata. Our results suggest
that using this information and improved imputation procedures like the one
presented here would benefit users of these datasets as well as consumers of
their research.

Appendices
In this online appendix we provide detailed descriptions of the sample se-
lection strategy, variable construction, and method for identifying imputed
data for the analyses in the main text. We also provide descriptive statistics
(table A3) for the concrete sample, and P-values (tables A4 and A5) for the
validity checks described in the main text.



A     Sample Selection

This section provides detailed descriptions of our sample selection strategy.
For the industries analyzed in tables 4-6, to the extent possible we follow the
sample selection strategy of Foster, Haltiwanger, and Syverson (2008). We
select industries that produce products for which the Census of Manufactures
collects physical quantities of products. For industries for which physical
quantity data is collected in both 2002 and 2007, we also require that the
data is collected for the same products in both years. We exclude all plants
flagged as Administrative Records (AR) cases, since virtually all of the data
for these plants is imputed. Following FHS, we also limit the sample to plants
for which at least 50% of the plant’s revenue is from the product or products
that we use the define the plant’s industry. As described in FHS, the Census
Bureau uses balancing codes to correct for cases where the sum of the values
of the plant’s products do not sum to the value that the plant reports as it’s


                                      48
total value of shipments. Following FHS, we exclude these balancing records
when we calculate the plant’s specialization. One way in which our sample
selection strategy differs from FHS is in how we deal with imputed data. We
use the item-level edit/impute flags to identify imputed data, but we include
these plants in our sample. FHS delete plants with data that they identify as
imputed. They attempt to identify imputed data by finding plants for which
certain ratios are the same as the within-industry-year mode of that ratio.
They use the ratios of materials costs over payroll (i.e., salaries and wages),
total value of shipments (TVS) over payroll, and product physical quantity
over payroll to identify imputed items. This method does not identify most
of the data that are imputed in the 2002 and 2007 CM data.
   We define our industries as follows.
Boxes manufacturing plants in 2002 produce one or more of the follow-
ing 12 products: corrugated shipping containers for food and beverages
(NAICS product code 3222110111), corrugated carryout boxes for retail
food (3222110114), corrugated shipping containers for paper and allied prod-
ucts (3222110221), corrugated shipping containers for metal products, ma-
chinery, equipment (3222110341), corrugated shipping containers for electri-
cal machinery, equipment (3222110345), corrugated shipping containers for
glass, clay, and stone products (3222110431), corrugated shipping contain-
ers for chemicals and drugs, including paints,varnishes, cosmetics, and soaps
(3222110433), corrugated shipping containers for lumber and wood prod-
ucts, including (3222110435), corrugated shipping containers for all other


                                      49
end uses (3222110437), corrugated paperboard in sheets and rolls, lined and
unlined (3222110551), corrugated solid fiber containers (3222110661), and
corrugated and solid fiber pallets, pads, and partitions (3222110665). The
physical quantity measure for boxes is thousands of square feet.
   Bread plants produce white pan bread, not frozen (NAICSPC 3118121111)
and/or frozen white pan bread (3118121121). White pan bread is measured
in thousands of pounds.
   Carbon black plants products carbon black (NAICSPC 3251820100),
which is measured in thousands of pounds.
   Coffee manufacturing plants produce whole bean roasted coffee (3119201111),
ground roasted coffee (3119201211), or ground roasted coffee mixtures (3119201331),
all of which are measured in thousands of pounds.
   Concrete manufacturing plants in our sample produce ready-mix con-
crete (3273200100). The Census of Manufactures last collected physical
quantity data for this product in 1992. However, the CM does still col-
lect product-level value of shipments data for concrete plants. The concrete
plants in our sample are highly specialized, with over 90% of the revenue of
each plant coming from ready-mix concrete shipments.
   Hardwood flooring plants in our sample produce hardwood oak flooring
(3219187111), hardwood oak parquetry flooring(3219187121), other hard-
wood oak flooring (3219187131), and/or hardwood maple flooring (3219187141).
The physical measure is thousands of board feet.
   Gasoline plants in our sample produce motor gasoline (3241101121) in


                                    50
2002. In 2007, this product is disaggregated into regular grade motor gaso-
line (3241101122), mid-premium grade motor gasoline (3241101123), and
premium grade motor gasoline (3241101124). The physical measure in both
years is thousands of barrels.
    Ice plants produce manufactured can or block ice (3121130111) or man-
ufactured cubed, crushed, or other processed ice (3121130121) in 2002. In
2007 these two products are classified as one product: manufactured ice,
(cubed, crushed, etc.), including can or block (3121130100). The physical
measure in both years is short tons.
    Plywood manufacturing plants in our sample produce hardwood ply-
wood, veneer core (3212113111), hardwood plywood, particleboard core (3212113221),
hardwood plywood, medium density fiberboard core (3212113231), and/or
hardwood plywood, other core (3212113291). Plywood is measured in thou-
sands of square feet.
    Sugar manufacturing plants in our sample produce raw cane sugar (3113110111),
which is measured in short tons.



B       Variable Construction

This section provides detailed descriptions of the variables we use in the main
text.
    For physical output, we use the physical quantity shipped for that prod-
uct. For plants in our sample that produce more than one of the products that


                                       51
define our industries, following Foster, Haltiwanger, and Syverson (2008), we
aggregate the physical quantities for those products.
   We compute prices by dividing the total product value (i.e., the reported
revenue from the given product or products) by the physical quantity for
that product.
   For the “traditional TFP” measure, our output measure is the plant’s
total value of shipments deflated by the shipments deflator for the corre-
sponding industry from the NBER Productivity Database.
   Energy is the sum of the cost of fuels and the cost of purchased electricity.
For materials, we use the total cost of intermediate inputs less energy costs.
To construct real values for these inputs, we deflate the nominal measures by
the energy and materials deflators for the corresponding industry deflators
from the NBER Productivity Database.
   We measure labor in production-worker-equivalent hours: Li = SWi ∗
P Hi /W Wi , where SW are total salaries and wages, P H are production
worker hours, and W W are production worker wages.
   The 2002 and 2007 Censuses of Manufactures have data on the plant’s
total book value of assets. We construct real capital stocks by deflating
the nominal book values to 2002 levels using sector-specific deflators from
the Bureau of Economic Analysis, using the procedure described in Foster,
Haltiwanger, and Krizan (2001).
   To estimate output elasticities, we use industry-level cost shares. For
labor, energy, and materials, we using the industry-level costs for the corre-


                                      52
sponding industry-year from the NBER Productivity Database. To construct
capital costs, we multiply the industry-level capital stocks for equipment and
structures in the NBER Productivity Database by the corresponding 3-digit
NAICS sector-level rental rates for capital equipment and structures. The
capital rental rates are from unpublished data used to construct the Bureau
of Labor Statistics’ multifactor productivity index.
    We construct the market-level demand density variable used in table 6
just as described in Syverson (2004a). Concrete demand density within a
market is defined as construction sector employment per square mile. We
use the Bureau of Economic Analysis’s Component Economic Areas (CEA)
in 2007 as the market definition. We obtain county-level construction sector
employment from the Census Bureau’s 2002 and 2007 County Business Pat-
terns published data, and county-level areas from the Census Bureau’s City
County Data Book. For each year, 2002 and 2007, we compute the average
construction sector employment per square mile within each CEA. In the
regressions presented table 6 we use the natural log of this measure.



C     Identifying Imputed Data

In this section we describe how we identify an element in the data matrix
as imputed or not. As part of its edit and imputation process, the Census
Bureau sets item-level edit/impute flags for the most important variables in
the Census of Manufactures. We use the item’s edit/impute flag variables to


                                     53
determine whether or not an item was imputed. We define an observation as
imputed if it meets the criteria below based on the edit/impute flags.
   Each edit/impute flag consists of two or three characters. The first char-
acter is either a blank, indicating that the item was not reported on the
survey form, or an ‘R’, indicating that it was reported. The second and (if
applicable) third characters take one of 22 values. Table A1 list the 22 codes
(including blank) and the names of each code. Table A2 briefly describes
when each code is set. Each variable has a corresponding edit/impute flag
with some combination of these codes. For example, if total value of ship-
ments (TVS) for a particular plant is reported on the survey form and not
edited or imputed, then the edit/impute flag for TVS for that plant will be
’R ’, indicating that the TVS value in the final dataset was reported on the
survey form and was not edited or imputed. The third column of table A1
shows the Census Bureau categorization of each of these codes as either im-
puted or non-imputed. For example, if a data item is corrected by a Census
Bureau analyst (code C), that item is not considered to be imputed.
   In general, we define an item as imputed if the second or third character
in its edit/impute flag is in the “imputed” category. We make an exception to
this rule for the capital stock variables. In many cases the edit/impute flags
for capital variables — total book values of assets beginning of year (TAB)
and end of year (TAE)–and capital expenditures (TCE) are set to ‘ K’. The
blank first character means that the item was not reported on the survey
form. The K supposedly means that the sum of a set of detail items do not


                                     54
balance to a total, so the detail items are changed proportionally to correct
the imbalance. In the case of capital stock variables, TAB plus TCE should
sum to TAE minus depreciation. However, in 2002 we find that for many
plants the flags indicate that none of these capital variables was reported on
the survey form and all of them were “raked.” Since it is impossible to adjust
to a total that was not reported, we treat these items as imputed.
   The Census Bureau uses different imputation methods for different vari-
ables. For example, the “industry average” ratio method is used frequently
for the energy input cost variables (cost of fuels, cost of purchased electric-
ity), and almost all of the imputations for the product-level product quantity
shipped (PQS) data are created with this method. On the other hand, for
total value of shipments and the total cost of materials, the “Beta (Cold Deck
Statistical)” method is the most common method. Note that although the
edit/impute flags tell us what general method was used to impute each data
element, for most variables we still do not know exactly how each element
was imputed. For example, if the edit/impute flag for a plant’s cost of pur-
chased electricity is set to ‘ V’, we know that the plant’s electricity costs are
set to the industry average by ratio imputation, but we do not know what
the denominator of the ratio is. Similarly, a flag set to ‘ B’ (“Cold Deck Sta-
tistical”) means that the item was imputed using a regression model based
on historical data. However, in general we do not know what sample was
used for this regression or even what explanatory variables are in the regres-
sion model. One exception to this rule are the imputations for the product


                                       55
quantity variable (PQS). For this variable, almost all of the imputations are
constructed by multiplying the plant’s product value shipped (PV) by an
industry average ratio of product quantity over product value.

Edit/Impute Action           Occurs when...

Administrative (A)           the item is imputed by direct substitution of corresponding
                             administrative data (for the same establishment/record).

Cold Deck Statistical (B)    the item is imputed from a statistical
                             (regression/beta) model based on historic data.

Analyst Corrected (C)        the reported value fails an edit, and an analyst directly
                             corrects the (reported or imputed) value.

Model (Donor) Record (D)     the item is imputed using hot deck methods.

High/Low (E)                 the item is imputed by direct substitution of value
                             near (high or low) endpoints of imputation range.

Goldplated (G)               the reported value for the item is ”protected” from any
                             changes by the edit. The value of a goldplated item is not
                             changed by the editing system, even if the item fails one or
                             more edits. In general, the goldplate flag is set by an analyst.

Historic (H)                 the item is imputed by ratio imputation using
                             historic data for the same establishment (for
                             example, prior year data imputation in Manufacturing)

Subject Matter Rule (J)      the item is imputed using a subject matter defined
                             rule (e.g. y=1/2x).

Raked (K)                       the sum of a set of detail items do not balance to the total.
                                The details are then changed proportionally to correct the
                                imbalance. This preserves the basic distribution of the
                                details.

Logical (L)                     the item’s imputation value is defined by an additive
                                mathematical relationship (e.g., obtaining a missing
                                detail item by subtraction).

Midpoint (M)                    the item is imputed by direct substitution of
                                midpoint of imputation range.

Rounded (N)                     the reported value is replaced by its original value divided
                                by 1000.

Restore Reported Data (O)       the reported value fails an edit. Either an analyst
                                interactively restores the originally reported value of an edit
                                (set by the interactive update system) or the ratio module
                                later “imputes” originally reported data for an item which
                                was imputed in the previous edit pass.

Prior Year Administrative (P)   the item is imputed by ratio imputation using
                                corresponding administrative data from prior year
                                (for same establishment).

Direct Substitution (S)         the item is imputed by direct substitution of another
                                item’s value (from within the same questionnaire.)

Trim-and-Adjusted (T)       the item was imputed using the Trim-and Adjust
                            balancing algorithm (balance module default).

Unable to Impute (U)        the reported item is blank or fails an edit, and the system
                            cannot successfully substitute a statistically reasonable
                            value for the original data.

Industry Average (V)        the item is imputed by ratio imputation using an
                            industry average.

Warm Deck Statistical (W)   the item is imputed from a statistical
                            (regression/beta) model based on current data.

Unusable (X)                the sum of a set of detail items cannot be balanced to the
                            total because none of the scripted solutions achieved a
                            balance.

Acceptable Zero (Z)         the reported value for an item is zero, and the item has
                            passed a presence (zero/blank) test. This often occurs with
                            part time reporters (e.g., births, deaths, idles). The zero
                            value will not be changed, even if it fails one or more edits.

The table shows P probabilities (see equation 5 in the main text)
for traditional TFP, physical TFP, and price dispersion measures
by industry-year. A probability close to zero is evidence
that the CART imputation model distorts the joint distribution
of the data for that industry-year such that the given
dispersion estimate may be biased.

The table shows P probabilities (see equation 5 in main text)
for checks of the validity of the CART imputations model
for a regression of market-level moments of concrete
productivity or output on concrete market demand density.
A probability close to zero is evidence that the CART
imputations are distorting the joint distributions in a way
that leads to biased estimates of the demand density
coefficient.
