                                             ABSTRACT

This study estimates the effect of deployment location and length on the risk of developing PTSD,
relative to what it would be from the normal military operations. We use a random sample of activity-duty
enlisted personnel serving between 2001 and 2006. We identify PTSD cases from TRICARE medical
records and link deployment information from Contingent Tracking System. Comparing to those in
other duties around the world, deployment to Iraq/Afghanistan increases the odds of developing PTSD
substantially, with the largest effect observed for the Navy (OR=9.06, p<0.01) and the smallest effect
for the Air Force (OR=1.25, p<0.01). A deployment longer than 180 days increases the odds of PTSD
by 1.11 times to 2.84 times, depending on the service, compared to a tour under 120 days. For Army
and Navy, a deployment to Iraq/Afghanistan further exacerbates the adverse effect of tour length. Our
research identifies the extent of PTSD across services and quantifies the risks associated with OEF/OIF
deployment intensity. Further research is needed for effective monitoring and preventive measures
of PTSD on the active duty population.

Introduction

       Recent research suggests that the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, also known as Operation

Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), pose substantial mental health

challenges to U.S. military service members and mental health systems (Hoge, Castro et al. 2004;

Hoge, Auchterlonie et al. 2006; Erbes, Westermeyer et al. 2007; Rosenheck and Fontana 2007; Seal,

Bertenthal et al. 2007; Tanielian and Jaycox 2008). Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), in

particular, has risen steadily, with heavy combat typically being cited as a leading cause of PTSD

(Helzer, Robins et al. 1987; CDC 1988; The Iowa Persian Gulf Study Group 1997; Prigerson,

Maciejewski et al. 2002; Kang, Natelson et al. 2003; Hoge, Castro et al. 2004). A recent

comprehensive review of the literature by Rand found a wide range of PTSD rates among those

serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, with estimates ranging from 4% to 45%, depending on the samples

and how PTSD was measured (Tanielian and Jaycox 2008). Many studies used anonymous survey

responses from convenience samples of Army soldiers who were deployed in either Iraq or

Afghanistan from 2003 to 2005 (Helzer, Robins et al. 1987; Hoge, Castro et al. 2004; Grieger, Cozza

et al. 2006; Vasterling, Proctor et al. 2006; Erbes, Westermeyer et al. 2007). Some analyzed the

mental health issues using post-deployment health assessment surveys collected by the Mental

Health Advisory Team (MHAT), which measured PTSD by primary-care PTSD screening questions

(U.S. Army 2003; U.S. Army 2005; Hoge, Auchterlonie et al. 2006; U.S. Army 2006; U.S. Army 2006;

Shen, Arkes et al. 2009), while a few used actual medical records from the VA health care system.

       With the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) going into its 8th year and with a planned surge

of forces in Afghanistan, it is critical to evaluate the prevalence of PTSD among the active duty

population and how the deployment intensity in OEF/OIF affect the mental health readiness of the

Armed Forces. While previous studies have provided important information on PTSD in the

current operations, they have several shortcomings. First, the previous studies have been descriptive



                                                                                                     3
analyses except for a study analyzing UK solders and one focusing on the US Navy (Rona, Fear et al.

2007; Shen, Arkes et al. 2009). Second, most studies focus on just the Army and Marine Corps. Yet

the rates of PTSD among those deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan could be different across services

because of different types of assignments, and such differences are important to identify in

evaluating total force readiness. Third, most studies used convenience samples on those returning

from OEF/OIF, without a comparable control group of personnel who were not deployed under

OEF/OIF. Thus, while these studies indicate the frequency of PTSD for those deployed under

OEF/OIF, they cannot speak to the effect of being deployed under OEF/OIF relative to their risk

of PTSD under other military operations. Fourth, studies using surveys often had to rely on

screening questions (such as PCL-DSM IV), which are typically short and simple to administer but

likely miss some cases of PTSD and misdiagnose PTSD in other cases (Kimerling, Ouimette et al.

2006; Ramchand, Karney et al. 2008). Finally, previous studies focus on the effect of the

deployment location (i.e, Iraq or Afghanistan) with little attention paid to the duration of

deployment or the cumulative effect of multiple deployments on the PTSD occurrence. However,

deployment duration and frequency are equally important deployment dimensions to consider when

designing the optimal deployment strategy.

        In this study, we address the shortcomings of the previous literature with a random sample

based on all active duty enlisted personnel serving between 2001 and 2006. We merge data on PTSD

diagnoses from the TRICARE medical records and deployment records from the Contingency

Tracking System. We then examine the effects of OEF/OIF deployment intensity for enlisted

personnel separately for the four services (Army, Marines, Navy, and Air Force). We analyze two

dimensions of deployment intensity: location and duration. Specifically, we address the following

research questions:

    1. What are the rates of PTSD among all active duty enlisted personnel and how do the rates



                                                                                                     4
       differ by service and deployment location?

   2. How do deployment location and length of deployment affect the probability of being

       diagnosed with PTSD?

   3. Is there an interactive effect between a deployment’s length and location? In particular, do

       longer deployments to Iraq or Afghanistan exacerbate the risk of PTSD?




Data and Methods

       Methods Overview. Our sample is based on all individuals who were active duty enlisted

service members of the US Armed Forces between 2001 and 2006. The outcome of interest is

whether the individual was diagnosed with PTSD within the TRICARE system. We first use a

descriptive analysis to compare the rate of PTSD among different branches of the Armed Services

by deployment location. We then estimate two multivariate models using logistic regressions to

assess the effect of deployment intensity (location, duration) under OEF/OIF on the rate of PTSD.

These regression models address the policy question of how much an Iraq/Afghanistan (or other

OEF/OIF) deployment increases the risk of developing PTSD relative to the risk military personnel

would have had if they had not been deployed to OEF/OIF missions. We estimate our models

separately for each service (Army, Air Force, Marines, and Navy). We provide more details on the

model specifications below.

       Data and Sample. We use a random sample of activity-duty enlisted personnel serving

between 2001 and 2006 because the GWOT started in 2001 and 2006 is the year for which the latest

data are available. We combine several data sources from TRICARE and the Defense Manpower

Data Center (DMDC) to form the basis of our analysis. First, we identify the active duty personnel

population and obtain demographic and service information (such as age, gender, race, rank) from



                                                                                                     5
the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS). Second, depending on where

PTSD was diagnosed (military treatment facility or TRICARE civilian provider) and whether it was

identified from inpatient or outpatient claims, we identify the date that PTSD was first diagnosed

and related health information from the following sources: the Standard Inpatient Data Record, the

Standard Ambulatory Data Record, and the TRICARE Encounter Data. Third, we obtain

OEF/OIF deployment characteristics and military occupational specialty (MOS) codes between

2001 and 2006 from the Contingency Tracking System (CTS). The CTS Deployment Files were used

to track personnel involved in contingency operations and report all personnel who have been

deployed in support of the Global War on Terror (GWOT) since September 11, 2001. CTS data

contain information on deployment location, start and end dates of the deployment. A person

would have multiple sets of deployment records in CTS if he were deployed multiple times during

the study period. The study received expedited IRB approval.

       Each observation in our data represents unique enlisted personnel. Based on the TRICARE

medical records and monthly DEERS records, we first identify all personnel who were diagnosed

with PTSD and take their demographic and rank information from DEERS the month they were

diagnosed. Next, for the remaining active duty population (those without PTSD), we randomly

select a month from each individual’s monthly DEERS records for their demographic and rank

information. We then draw a 25 percent random sample of this population from each service

(regardless of whether they used TRICARE services). At the end, our data consist of 678,227

unique enlisted personnel from all services. This represents a 25% random sample of the active

population without PTSD and 100% of the PTSD population. We weight all of our comparisons

and empirical models to reflect this sampling scheme so our estimated numbers are representative of

all personnel from each service. For all personnel in our sample, we extract complete deployment

information from CTS.



                                                                                                     6
        Outcome measures. The dependent variable in our analysis is whether an enlisted person

was diagnosed with PTSD anytime between 2001 and 2006 (i.e., if the ICD-9 code of the principal

diagnosis is 309.81)(American Psychiatric Association 2000).

        Statistical Models. After an initial set of descriptive analyses for raw comparisons of PTSD

rates for different types of deployments across services, we conduct regression models in order to

control for relevant factors. Because our outcome is binary, we estimate logistic regression models.

In the primary models, we focus on deployment characteristics of the last deployment. For

example, if a person was included in the analytical sample on March 2004 and his/her most recent

deployment prior to this date was July 2003, we would use deployment information from the July

2003 deployment in this set of models. Our key variables of interest in Model 1 are the deployment

location and duration (details below). In Model 2, we estimate an interaction effect between

deployment duration and deployment location (in particular, Iraq and Afghanistan) to test whether

longer deployments as a result of OIF and OEF magnifies the effect of such a deployment on the

probability of being diagnosed with PTSD.

        As a sensitivity analysis on the location effect, we also estimate a model based on all past

deployments’ locations, since PTSD is not necessarily triggered by the last deployment and often

emerges after a long delay. Specifically, if a person was included in the sample on March 2004, we

identify the locations for all deployments between 2001 and March 2004. The key variable of

interest in this sensitivity model is whether a person was ever deployed to a given location (details

below). In all models, we control for service and demographic characteristics as explained below.




                                                                                                        7
         Explanatory variables. There are three categories of variables that we include in the

models: deployment characteristics, service characteristics, and demographic information. Summary

statistics of these measures are presented in Table 1. We describe here the different types of

variables.

      We classify three categories of deployment locations: not deployed under OEF or OIF (the

reference group), deployed to Iraq/Afghanistan, deployed on other OEF/OIF missions (such as

Kuwait, Quatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey).1 For the duration of the last deployment, we classify the

deployment length into three categories: short if the length of the last deployment is less than 120

days (the reference group), medium if the length of last deployment is between 120 and 180 days,

and long if the duration is greater than 180 days. In the sensitivity analysis, we define four mutually

exclusive categories of all past deployment location indicators: ever deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan

(but not other locations), ever deployed on other OEF/OIF missions, ever deployed to

Iraq/Afghanistan as well as other OEF/OIF missions, and never deployed on any OEF/OIF

mission (the reference group).

         For service characteristics, we include rank and military occupation specialty (MOS)

categories. Studies have shown that soldiers in combat divisions and those in medical service tend to

have different rates of PTSD than non-combat specialties (Martin 2007; Tanielian and Jaycox 2008).

We categorize military occupational specialty codes into the following categories: Combat arms

(reference group), combat support, combat service support, aviation, medical, and other MOS.2

         To control for demographic characteristics, we include the following demographic

     1 We do not define more detailed location categories because sample size would be too small for the finer
categorization.
     2 The four service branches use different sets of military occupation codes. The Army and Marine Corps use a
Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) code, while a system of Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSC) is used in the Air
Force. The Navy uses a system of naval ratings and designators along with the Naval Enlisted Classification (NEC)
system. For some service branches, some of the categories are merged due to small numbers of observations in the
individual categories and some categories are missing (for example, Marines and Air Force do not have medical MOS)



                                                                                                                     8
information in the models: gender, race (with White as the reference group, African-American,

Hispanic, Asian, and other races), marital status (single or married), and age. Lastly, we include year

indicators to control for possible macro trends in PTSD rate in the general active duty population.



Results

        Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics of the sample by service branches. We focus our

discussion on the deployment characteristics. The majority of the active duty personnel were not

deployed under OEF/OIF: the percentages range from 61.5% in Air Force to 78% in Army.

However, while not shown, this rate did vary by year as increasing numbers of Army and Marine

Corps personnel were deployed under OEF/OIF in later years. Not surprisingly, the service with

the highest share of its enlisted members sent to Iraq/Afghanistan is the Army (11.3%), follow by

the Marines (8.6%). The Navy and Air Force appear to serve a more supporting role, with 35% and

33%, respectively, of their enlisted population being sent on OEF/OIF missions other than

Iraq/Afghanistan. Among those deployed, large proportions of Army and Marine Corps personnel

had been deployed more than 180 days in their most recent deployment prior to being included in

the sample (58% and 48%, respectively), whereas 65% of deployed Air Force personnel had a tour

length under 120 days. The next set of summary statistics report the proportions of those ever

deployed under OEF/OIF who were ever deployed to a given location since September 11, 2001.

We categorize the past deployment location indicators into three mutually exclusive categories to

allow for easier comparison (i.e., the three rows add up to 100%). With the Army, for example, 31%

of solders ever deployed under OEF/OIF were sent to Iraq/Afghanistan (but not on other

OEF/OIF missions), 45% were sent on other OEF/OIF missions, and the remaining 24% have

been to Iraq/Afghanistan as well as other OEF/OIF missions. The rest of Table 1 provides

summary statistics of service and demographic characteristics, which are representative of the US



                                                                                                      9
Armed Forces active duty population.

        Table 2 reports the proportion of the active duty population who were diagnosed with

PTSD for each service. The first row presents the PTSD percentage for the entire active duty

population, regardless of their deployment status, and ranges from 0. 6% for Air Force to 1.4% for

Army. The next set reports the PTSD rate by the last deployment location. People deployed to

Iraq/Afghanistan had much higher rates of being diagnosed with PTSD compared to those not

deployed under OEF or OIF (4.4% vs. 0.6% for the Army, 3.5% vs. 0.5% for the Marines, 6.5% vs.

0.5% for the Navy, and 1.3% vs. 0.6% for the Air Force; p<0.01 for statistical tests of all of these

differences). Army and Marine Corps personnel deployed to other OEF/OIF missions also have

higher rates of PTSD compared to those not deployed under OEF/OIF (3.8% for Army, 2.3% for

Marines), but the opposite is the case for the Navy and Air Force. Among those deployed under

OEF/OIF, the PTSD rate increases as the tour length increases. With the Army, for example, the

proportion of enlisted personnel who were later diagnosed with PTSD is 2.9% among those with a

short tour length (1-120 days), and the rate increases to 3. 5% in the medium length category (120-

180 days) and to 4.8% for long tours (>180 days). We observe similar, but not as stark, patterns for

the other three services.

        The last set of statistics in Table 2 reports the PTSD rate by whether a person was ever

deployed to a given location. With the Army, the proportion of people ever deployed to

Iraq/Afghanistan (but not other OEF/OIF missions) who were diagnosed with PTSD is 3.5%. The

number is slightly lower for those who were deployed elsewhere except for Iraq/Afghanistan

(3.4%). The rate of PTSD is even higher (6.2%) for those who have been to Iraq/Afghanistan, as

well as other OEF/OIF missions. We observe similar pattern for the other three branches.

        The raw proportions of personnel being diagnosed with PTSD shown in Table 2 provide a

good comparison across services of the prevalence of PTSD based on types of deployments. We



                                                                                                       10
next report, in Table 3, the logistic regression results that compare, across services, the effect of the

OEF/OIF deployment on the risk of developing PTSD relative to the risk enlisted personnel would

have had in the more typical military missions around the world. We present the results in terms of

odds ratios and focus only on the effect of deployment characteristics in Table 3 (the complete

regression results for Model 1 are included in the Appendix). The top panel of Table 3 reports the

main effect of the last deployment’s location and duration. With the Army, the first row indicates

that the odds of being diagnosed with PTSD is 3.96 times higher among those deployed to

Iraq/Afghanistan compared to those not deployed under OEF/OIF (p<0.01). Being deployed on

other OEF/OIF missions also increases the odds of PTSD by the same magnitude (OR=3.97,

p<0.01).

        The effects of being deployed to Iraq/Afghanistan and on other OEF/OIF missions are

comparable for the Marines, as it increases the odds of developing PTSD by 4.57 and 3.51 times

(p<0.01 for both), respectively. For the Navy, being deployed to Iraq/Afghanistan also carries a

very high risk of developing PTSD (OR=9.06, p<0.01) compared to those not deployed under

OEF/OIF. Iraq/Afghanistan missions appear to have the smallest impact for Air Force, as the

odds of developing PTSD among those deployed to Iraq/Afghanistan is only 1.25 times higher than

those not deployed (p<0.05). For the Navy and Air Force, the risk of being deployed on other

OEF/OIF missions is actually lower than for those not deployed on an OEF/OIF mission

(OR=0.54 and 0.44, respectively, both p<0.01).

        Model 1 also shows that the tour length matters. Compared to those who have a short tour

length (<120 days), Army soldiers whose last deployment was between 120-180 days are 1.18 times

more likely to get PTSD (p<0.01) and those whose last deployment was more than 180 days have an

odds ratio of 1.62 (p<0.01). Similar adverse effects of longer tours are observed for the Navy and

Air Force. For the Marine Corps, the duration effect only shows up if they have been deployed



                                                                                                        11
more than 180 days (OR=1.11, p<0.10). It is worth noting that the adverse effects of deployment

location and length are present even after we control for MOS, and not surprisingly, those in

combat arms specialty (the reference group) have the highest odds of developing PTSD (Appendix).

       For Model 2, presented in the lower panel of Table 3, we add an interaction effect between

the Iraq/Afghanistan location and the tour duration variables to test whether long tour exacerbate

the effects of deployments to these two countries. For the Army, the 1.53 odds ratio on the long

duration variable itself now indicates that those whose OEF/OIF deployment to locations other

than Iraq/Afghanistan lasted more than 180 days are 1.53 times more likely to be diagnosed with

PTSD than those whose last tour to those locations were under 120 days. The odds ratio on the

Iraq/Afghanistan indicator now essentially compares the rate of PTSD between those deployed to

Iraq/Afghanistan under 120 days and those not deployed to OEF/OIF missions. Even with a short

tour, deployment to Iraq still results in an odds ratio of 3.70 (p<0.01). The same applies to the

Marine Corps and Navy, but the Air Force still has a smaller effect of an Iraq/Afghanistan

deployment. The key variables are the last two rows. Among soldiers whose last deployment was to

Iraq/Afghanistan, those that lasted more than 180 days had a 1.15 times higher risk of developing

PTSD (p<0.10) compared to those with a short (less than 120-day) deployment, which is in addition

to the main Iraq/Afghanistan effect of 3.96). For the Army, a medium-length deployment had no

additional effect on the risk of developing PTSD. We observe additive effects for the Navy (OR

for the interactive terms on medium and long duration are 2.50 and 2.47, respectively, p<0.01), but

not for Marines or Air Force.

       As a sensitivity analysis, we estimate Model 3, which captures whether the individual was

ever deployed to a given location. The results in Table 4 are similar to Model 1 (where we only

OEF/OIF ranges from 1.85 times for the Air Force to 10.34 times for the Navy (p<0.01 for all

services). The highest odds belong to those who were deployed to Iraq/Afghanistan as well as other

OEF/OIF locations (essentially, deployed at least twice): the odds ratio of developing PTSD ranges

from 1.92 for the Air Force to 9.65 for the Navy (p<0.01 for all services) compared to those never

sent on an OEF/OIF missions.

       In another sensitivity analysis, we address the empirical issue that the year variables could be

highly correlated with the -OEF/OIF missions, thus causing multicollinearity and perhaps leading to

an underestimation of the deployment effect on the risk of developing PTSD. Thus we estimated

models that excluded the year dummies, and the estimated effects of an Iraq/Afghanistan

deployment on the risk of developing PTSD were about 10-15 percent higher than our main

models.



Comments

       In this study, we link deployment information and TRICARE health records to examine the

relationship between deployment intensity and PTSD. We find that the percentage of PTSD

diagnoses among the active duty population varies by service, but are all below one percent among

those not deployed on OEF/OIF missions. But, those deployed to Iraq/Afghanistan have a much

higher probability of developing PTSD, with the percentages ranging from 1.3% for the Air Force

to 6.5% for the Navy. Those deployed on other OEF/OIF missions, on the other hand, have

higher PTSD rates relative to those not deployed on such missions only for the Army and Marines.

       While those comparisons describe the actual rates of PTSD across the services for different

types of deployments, our regression models further explore how the deployment location and

duration affect the risk of developing PTSD, relative to what it would have been in other typical

world-wide missions of the U.S. military. A deployment to Iraq/Afghanistan increases the odds of



                                                                                                     13
developing PTSD substantially, with the largest effect observed for the Navy (OR=9.06) and the

smallest effect for the Air Force (OR=1.25). The tour length also matters, as a deployment lasting

longer than 180 days increases the odds of PTSD by 1.11 times to 2.84 times, depending on the

service, compared to a short tour. Furthermore, for the Army and Navy, a deployment to

Iraq/Afghanistan further exacerbates the adverse effect of tour length. The sizable adverse effect of

deployment location persists when we considered all past deployments, not just the previous

deployment.

        Our overall rates of PTSD are much lower than previously reported based on surveys or on

VA data (Ramchand, Karney et al. 2008). There are several important factors that contribute to the

differences. First, our sample is active duty personnel who are still deemed fit to serve in the

military, whereas people who show up in the VA health care system are those who had left the

military because they have serious physical or mental health problems that prevent them from

continuing to serve. Second, compared to PTSD rates reported in anonymous surveys, which lack

clinical details in the screening questions, our PTSD rates are based on clinical diagnoses. The

enlisted person may be more willing to admit to PTSD symptoms, even if they were mild, on an

anonymous survey than they would to military health officials. Third, for people who have the

desire to continue serving (and thus stay within the TRICARE system), the stigma of PTSD often

prevents them from seeking care when needed since this information would then go on the service

person’s record.

        It is also important to keep in mind the following limitations of this study. First, even

though we were able to include military occupational specialty categories, we do not have details on

the specific assignments. The lack of details on assignments might contribute to the lower odds

ratios we observe among Navy and Air Force personnel who were deployed to OEF/OIF locations




                                                                                                     14
that are not in Iraq or Afghanistan.3 Second, since our intention is to look at the prevalence of

PTSD among the population of personnel who are still in service, we most likely miss severe cases

of PTSD since those would show up in the VA system unless they were first diagnosed inside the

TRICARE system.

         With these caveats in mind, there are several important policy implications from our

findings. While the adverse effects of Iraq/Afghanistan deployments across all services is expected,

it might be surprising that such deployments cause the highest PTSD rates for the Navy. This might

be due to many sailors deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan being what the military calls Individual

Augmentees (IA), who are those deployed individually or in a small group to assist Army and

Marines. The IAs are subject to additional stress as they are thrust into an unfamiliar environment

away from their parent command. It may be important to train these personnel for not just the

additional physical skills but also mental health readiness for such assignments. In addition, the

adverse effect of tour length is observed across all services—and for the Air Force, longer durations

are more likely to lead to PTSD than being deployed in Afghanistan/Iraq. While a recommendation

of the optimal tour length for each branch is beyond the scope of this study, our findings do suggest

that efforts to keep OEF/OIF deployments to reasonable lengths could help reduce PTSD rates.

         Given the continuing nature of the Global War on Terror, it is unavoidable that many

enlisted personnel will be subjected to multiple deployments to OEF/OIF locations. We can expect

thousands of new cases of PTSD, and it is imperative to monitor these soldiers’ mental health. The

DoD has begun to address this issue by introducing the Post-Deployment Health Reassessment

(PDHRA, DD2900) in March 2005, and mandates the completion of this re-assessment at 90-180

days after a deployment (US Department of Defense 2008). However, our data show that almost 75
    3 For example, in the Navy the reference group is mostly people on routine shipboard operation (although they
might also be on their shore rotation). Personal communications with the sailors reveal that the living condition on ship
is usually horrendous, and a ground OIF assignment in places like Quatar or Kuwait might actually be better compared
to life on ship.



                                                                                                                      15
percent of the PTSD population in our sample did not get diagnosed with PTSD until 200 days after

their last deployment—the average lapse between the last deployment and the first diagnosis of

PTSD is 291 days. Further research effort should look into the extent of the effect due to repeated

deployments and explore how effective PDHRA is in identifying PTSD cases, as well as more

effective monitoring methods beyond the 180 day mandated surveys.

        PTSD leads to a host of long-term family and workplace problems and is often comorbid

with other psychiatric and physical disorders. Our research identifies the extent of the PTSD

problem within the active duty population and highlights how certain enlisted personnel, based on

their deployment characteristics, are at higher risks of developing this disorder. Further research

into preventive measures and effective treatments of PTSD on the active duty population, especially

the higher risk groups, needs to remain a focus within the Department of Defense. In addition,

while PTSD remains the focus of media attention, other mental health illness such as depression and

substance abuse have higher prevalence in the active duty population, and are just as costly to the

individuals, military health system, and the society. A comprehensive analysis of other mental health

illness would help the evaluation of total force readiness.
