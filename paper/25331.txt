                                          ABSTRACT

Societal norms about gender roles contribute to the economic disadvantages facing women in
many developing countries. This paper evaluates a school-based intervention in India that
engaged adolescents in classroom discussions about gender equality for two and a half years with
the goal of eroding their support for restrictive gender norms. Using a randomized controlled
trial, we find that the program made attitudes 0.18 standard deviations more supportive of gender
equality, or, equivalently, converted 16% of participants' regressive views. In addition, self-
reported behavior became more aligned with progressive gender norms, particularly among boys.
The effects observed in the short run were still present two years after the program had ended.

1    Introduction
    Gender inequality exists in every society but is especially severe in many developing
countries: Women and girls have fewer educational opportunities, less autonomy over mar-
riage and fertility, and more restrictions on labor force participation (Duflo, 2012; Jayachan-
dran, 2015). Many of these gender gaps are stagnant despite economic progress, suggesting
that economic development on its own is unlikely to close them.
    Recent work has drawn economists’ attention to the importance of cultural norms in
perpetuating gender gaps (Alesina et al., 2013; Bertrand et al., 2015). Studies suggest
that even centuries-old norms might be amenable to change. For example, reserved seats
for female politicians reduce gender-biased attitudes in India (Beaman et al., 2009), and
television programming can change fertility preferences (Jensen and Oster, 2009; La Ferrara
et al., 2012). These findings are part of a broader literature on how people’s preferences are
shaped (Becker and Mulligan, 1997; Bowles, 1998).
    In this paper, we focus on a direct attempt to reshape gender attitudes through discus-
sion and persuasion. We evaluate a school-based program in the state of Haryana, India,
for seventh to tenth graders. The program centered around classroom discussions about
gender equality in secondary schools, with a 45-minute session held every three weeks for
two and a half school years. The sessions taught facts and endorsed gender equality and,
as importantly, prompted students to reflect on their own and society’s views. Discussion
topics included gender stereotypes, gender roles at home, girls’ education, women’s employ-
ment outside the home, and harassment. A few sessions taught communication skills to help
students convey their views to others and be able to, say, persuade their parents to permit
them to marry at a later age. The program’s messaging combined a human-rights case for
gender equity with pragmatic reasons to value women, such as their economic contributions.
    The intervention was designed and implemented by Breakthrough, a non-profit orga-
nization with extensive experience in gender-equality programming. The Government of
Haryana allowed Breakthrough to conduct the classes in schools as part of the regular school
day. The government was interested in eroding some of the restrictive gender norms in its
society, and schools offer governments a powerful platform to shape the next generation’s
views. The reason for targeting secondary school students specifically is that adolescence is
a critical time in the development of morality and formation of identity, when people are
young enough to still have malleable attitudes but mature enough to reflect on complex


                                              1
moral questions (Kohlberg, 1976; Markus and Nurius, 1986).1
       As context, gender inequality is pronounced in India. While boys and girls start sec-
ondary school at the same rate, only 0.80 girls enroll in tertiary schooling for every boy
(World Bank, 2011). Early marriage and childbearing are common, and many women have
limited agency and physical mobility and face barriers to labor force participation (Field
et al., 2010; Klasen and Pieters, 2015; Afridi et al., 2018; Calvi, 2020). India’s sex ratio
among children age 0 to 6 years is 1.09 boys per girl, reflective of the widespread practice
of sex-selective abortion; Haryana’s sex ratio of 1.20 is the most male-skewed among Indian
states (Sen, 1990; Jha et al., 2006; Govt. of India, 2011).
       We implement a randomized controlled trial across 314 government secondary schools
in four districts of Haryana, with data collected from roughly 14,000 students. We measure
effects a few months after the program ended and again two years later when the students
are, on average, 17 years old.
       We focus primarily on how the program changed participants’ gender attitudes, that is,
their views about what is right and wrong or desirable and undesirable, such as whether it
is wrong for women to work outside the home and whether it would be good to have more
women in politics. A second outcome is girls’ aspirations for their education and career;
for this outcome, we hypothesize an effect only on girls. Our third primary outcome is
self-reported behaviors influenced by gender norms. It will only be once the participants
become older that we can assess impacts on major outcomes they have control over, such
as their employment and childbearing. Nonetheless, we view effects on self-reported day-
to-day behaviors as adolescents to be informative about whether reshaping gender attitudes
translates into behavior change. We focus on behaviors that adolescents likely have some
say over, such as chores done at home and interaction with opposite-gender peers. Even for
these actions, parents’ views will be a moderating factor; a girl’s parents might deny her
request that her burden of household chores be reduced, for example. Another reason that
attitude change might be insufficient for behavior change (even in the long run) is a desire
to conform to social norms. A boy who now believes that he should help out with chores
might feel that the social sanctions for doing so would be too costly.2
   1
     There were also practical reasons for targeting adolescents rather than younger students. The govern-
ment was less comfortable with younger children discussing possibly sensitive topics like sexual harassment.
Also, the government was interested in effects on “hard” outcomes such as higher education and female
employment; with younger participants, there would be a longer delay until these outcomes were realized.
   2
     We examine perceptions of social norms as a secondary outcome.



                                                     2
    We find that the intervention made gender attitudes more progressive by 0.18 standard
deviations in the short run (three years after baseline). The measure of attitudes is an index
that aggregates several survey responses about support for gender equality. The effect size
is equivalent to 16% of the cases in which a student held a gender-regressive view being
converted to support for gender equality. We find a similarly large effect on attitudes in the
medium run (five years after baseline).
    The intervention also affected self-reported gender-related behaviors.         An index of
gender-equal behaviors increased by 0.20 to 0.23 standard deviations, in both the short
run and medium run. However, there was no effect on girls’ educational and professional
aspirations, which were quite high to begin with. We find a marginally significant effect on
a revealed preference measure of girls’ educational intentions included in the second end-
line, namely completing a college scholarship application, but no effect on boys’ and girls’
likelihood of signing a public petition to end the dowry system.
    We examine heterogeneity of the treatment effects by two pre-specified characteristics,
the parents’ gender attitudes and the student’s gender. We find no evidence of heterogeneity
based on parents’ attitudes, but we find important differences in treatment effects between
boys and girls. At the first endline, the effect size on attitudes is similar for boys and girls,
but by the second endline, the effect is larger for boys. In addition, behavior change is more
pronounced for boys in both the short and medium run. For example, boys report doing
more chores, but girls do not report doing fewer, and boys have a larger increase in how
much they encourage their older sisters to pursue college. With chores, the smaller effect
for girls can be explained by the asymmetry in the outcome; greater gender equality means
that girls seek a lower burden, which might not be granted, while boys can voluntarily help
out more. But the fact that we also see heterogeneity by gender in support given to sisters
suggests a broader phenomenon of girls facing more external constraints on their behavior.
This pattern highlights that, because behavior change requires not just a desire but also
an ability to change, the very fact of boys’ and men’s greater power in society makes it
important to include them in interventions aimed at increasing girls’ and women’s power.
    A key concern with self-reported outcomes such as attitudes is social desirability bias.
In our case, the specific concern is an experimenter demand effect, i.e., more social desir-
ability bias in the treatment group. People who participated in a program that explicitly
tried to increase their support for gender equality might disingenuously express more gender-
progressive views to present themselves in a good light to the surveyors. To address this,


                                               3
we make innovative use of the Marlowe-Crowne social desirability scale, a survey module
developed by social psychologists that measures a person’s propensity to give socially desir-
able answers (Crowne and Marlowe, 1960). The module, which we included on the baseline
survey, asks respondents if they have several too-good-to-be-true traits such as never being
jealous of another person’s good fortune and always being a good listener.
       We find that respondents with a high propensity for social desirability bias express more
support for gender equality overall for the sample, but importantly, this pattern is not more
true for the treatment group than the control group. In other words, the positive treatment
effect on self-reported attitudes and behavior is similar in magnitude for respondents with a
low and high propensity for social desirability bias.3 We view this analysis as an important
check on the validity of our results, and think that this approach could be useful in a wide
array of studies in which experimenter demand is a concern. The method allows one to test
for bias for all outcomes (e.g., attitudes about dowry, women’s work, sexual harassment), so
it complements techniques such as list experiments and revealed-preference measures, which
often must focus on a narrower set of outcomes due to logistical costs.
       Our study contributes to the literature on endogenous preferences, specifically on the
formation of gender-related preferences.4 Besides political quotas (Beaman et al., 2009) and
television (Jensen and Oster, 2009; La Ferrara et al., 2012), other factors that have been
shown to make attitudes more gender-progressive include mothers’ employment (Fernandez
et al., 2004), having daughters or sisters (Washington, 2008; Healy and Malhotra, 2013),
serving with women in the military (Dahl et al., 2018), having teachers who hold weaker
gender stereotypes (Carlana, 2019), and having female role models (Porter and Serra, 2019).
       Unlike most of the studies above on endogenous gender preferences, our research ex-
amines an intervention that intentionally changed preferences. It thus also sits within the
literature on persuasion, or communication expressly designed to change preferences or be-
liefs (DellaVigna and Gentzkow, 2010). Much of the persuasion literature focuses on ways
to influence consumer or political preferences. Closer to our work are studies on attitude
change about intimate partner violence (Gupta et al., 2013; Abramsky et al., 2014; Pulerwitz
et al., 2015; Green et al., 2020), racial minorities (Donovan and Leivers, 1993), immigrants
   3
      The fact that fade-out of the effect on attitudes differs for boys and girls offers further suggestive evidence
that the results are not driven by experimenter demand. Experimenter demand effects that change over time
differentially by gender are possible, but seem unlikely.
    4
      Recent work has also studied the formation of preferences toward different castes and toward children
from poorer families in India (Lowe, 2020; Rao, 2019), Muslims in the United Kingdom (Alrababa’h et al.,
2019), and racial minorities in the US (Carrell et al., 2019), among other topics.

(Hopkins et al., 2019; Grigorieff et al., 2020), and women in STEM (Moss-Racusin et al.,
2018), as well as studies that shift people’s perceptions of social norms about gender or about
ethnic discrimination and violence (Bursztyn et al., 2020; Aloud et al., 2020; Paluck, 2009).
Our study is also related to Cantoni et al. (2017), which finds that Chinese students taught
with textbooks designed to convey pro-Communist messages express more pro-government
views and skepticism of free markets when they are adults.
    We also add to the rapidly growing literature on educational/training interventions
aimed at increasing girls’ and women’s agency and opportunities in developing countries.
Related work includes Bandiera et al. (2020) on female empowerment and livelihood training
in Uganda, Buchmann et al. (2018) on empowerment training and financial incentives to
delay marriage in Bangladesh, Ashraf et al. (2020) on negotiation skills training for girls
in Zambia, Edmonds et al. (2019) on life skills training for girls in India, and McKelway
(2020) on self-efficacy training in India. While most of these interventions focus primarily
on imparting human capital – either traditional skills or positive psychological traits – to
women and girls, the central (though not exclusive) aim of the intervention we evaluate is to
influence participants’ preferences, specifically their attitudes about restrictive gender roles.
Our study is also relatively unusual in the literature on women’s empowerment in that it
focuses on both boys and girls.


2     Description of intervention
    The project emerged from the Government of Haryana’s interest in testing policies to
narrow gender gaps. Breakthrough, a gender human rights organization that had developed
other social change campaigns, designed an intervention aimed at influencing adolescent
boys’ and girls’ views related to gender norms, and implemented it in government schools,
with the government’s permission.
    The participants in the program were the cohorts in grades 7 and 8 in the academic year
2014-15 when the program launched. It ran from April 2014 to October 2016, so one cohort
participated in the program in grades 7, 8 and half of 9, and the other cohort participated in
grades 8, 9 and half of 10. Grades 7 to 10 have high enrollment and low dropout in Haryana,
so the program could reach a large share of the underlying age cohorts and have limited
attrition due to school dropout (significant dropout occurs after grade 10) (DISE, 2011).
    The objective of the program, which was named Taaron ki Toli, or Legion of Stars, was to
create awareness of gender-based discrimination, change dominant gendered perceptions and


                                               5
promote gender-equitable attitudes, raise girls’ aspirations, and provide tools to participants
to translate attitude change and greater aspirations into behavior change. By changing
fundamental gender attitudes, the program aimed to ultimately influence a wide range of
behaviors related to female education, mobility, work, marriage and fertility, for both female
participants and male participants’ female family members (e.g., their future wives).
       The program emphasized both human rights and pragmatic (i.e., instrumental) reasons
for giving girls and women more opportunities. For example, it conveyed that equal oppor-
tunity for education is a universal human right. The hypothesis is that this rights-based
message would increase how much participants value girls having access to higher education;
a boy would get disutility from seeing his sister denied the same chance to attend college
that he has. As an example of a pragmatic argument for girls’ education, the intervention
informed participants that outcomes for children improve when their mother is more edu-
cated. The hypothesis is that this information causes belief updating; girls want to stay in
school longer, and both boys and girls will want to educate their daughters down the road.
       To ensure that the intervention would be widely accepted, Breakthrough engaged with
multiple stakeholders at the state, district, and sub-district levels, gathering input from
various education officials, school principals, and teachers as they developed the program.
This helped them design a program that might ultimately be integrated into the standard
school curriculum.5
       The program featured classroom sessions, each 45 minutes long, led by a Breakthrough
facilitator. The regular teacher was welcome to stay for the sessions or leave the classroom
and have a break. There were a total of 27 sessions spread over two and half years.6 Break-
through hired 15 facilitators, 13 of whom were male, to cover the 150 treatment schools.
The facilitator visited each school roughly once every three weeks. Other elements of the
program included a one-time training for one teacher per school, optional youth clubs, and
school-wide activities such as street theater performances held about once a year.7
   5
      Scale-up options include hiring special-purpose teachers to lead the sessions, each of whom covers multiple
schools; having regular school teachers deliver the lessons; incorporating some of the content into textbooks;
or continuing to have NGOs implement the program. The Government of Punjab plans to roll out the
program to all of its upper primary schools in 2021, to be taught by regular teachers as part of the “moral
science” curriculum.
    6
      The program’s total dosage was 20 hours, or about 23 hours adding in the school-wide assemblies. As
comparisons, the negotiation program for girls in Zambia studied by Ashraf et al. (2020) consisted of six two-
hour sessions (12 hours total); the safe space groups in Bangladesh evaluated by Buchmann et al. (2018) met
for about 200 hours total over six months; and the empowerment and livelihood clubs in Uganda evaluated
by Bandiera et al. (2020) were open five afternoons per week for two years (over 500 hours).
    7
      The curriculum described was delivered to the two study cohorts, finishing in the middle of the 2016-7


                                                       6
     The classroom sessions were discussion-based, with more student participation than is
typical in secondary schools classes. Perhaps for this reason, and also because having a
dynamic teaching style was one of the hiring criteria for facilitators, student reaction to the
program was generally very positive. To complement the in-class material and encourage
further reflection, the facilitators gave out some homework assignments such as writing stories
and recording observations, and they encouraged students to talk to their family members
about what they were learning. The sessions did not displace one specific subject like math
or history; they crowded out a roughly even mix of material in other subjects. While the
program could have harmed other learning by displacing instructional time, it is also possible
that the discuss-and-debate style strengthened students’ critical thinking and speaking skills,
conferring value to them beyond the gender focus.
     Discussion topics for the sessions included gender identity, values, aspirations, gender
roles and stereotypes, and recognition and tolerance of discrimination. For example, one ses-
sion focused on household chores. Students broke out into groups and listed whether males
or females did various chores in their households. They then reconvened and discussed the
answers. When the pattern emerged that women and girls did most of the chores, the facil-
itator asked why that was and whether it was fair. The class discussed why women cook at
home, but men are cooks in restaurants, with the latter role earning more status in society.
A few of the sessions aimed to impart skills such as public speaking, communication between
the genders, and leadership, which could enable gender-equitable attitudes to translate into
behavioral change. For instance, girls might be able to negotiate greater independence with
their parents, leading to more freedom of movement in the short run and greater occupa-
tional choice in the long run. Through this curriculum, students explored gender identity
and stereotypes, gained a better understanding of gender inequities and their consequences,
understood their rights, and were encouraged to communicate and act on what they had
learned. To map this to standard concepts used by economists, the intervention aimed
to change students’ preferences (i.e., their moral views on gender inequality); their factual
beliefs (e.g., greater realization that restricting women’s employment leaves money on the
school year. Breakthrough received additional funding and resumed activities in 59 of the 150 treatment
schools in 2017-18, offering an extra module to the younger of our two study cohorts. This added 0.2 years
of dosage on average (59/150 * 52% of sample in younger cohort * 1 year), or 2.1 additional sessions per
participant. Breakthrough also initiated the full curriculum with new cohorts, 2 to 5 years younger than
our study cohorts, in these schools. We do not expect spillovers from these younger children to our study
participants to have added much dosage, especially since most of the older cohort had switched to a new
school for grade 11 by then. We became aware of these additional activities in 2019.

3       Study design and data
3.1       Experimental design
        We designed and implemented a randomized evaluation of the gender attitude change
program using a sample of 314 government schools across Sonipat, Panipat, Rohtak, and
Jhajjar districts in the state of Haryana, India.8 The randomization unit is the school.
        The sample size of 314 schools was chosen to be able to measure the short- and medium-
run effects of the program on gender attitudes, aspirations, and behavior, as well as long-term
effects on educational attainment, occupational choice, marriage, and fertility that might
emerge up to ten years after the program ended. There were 607 government-run secondary
schools that offered grades 6 through 10 across the four districts. We first restricted attention
to the 346 schools that officially enrolled at least 40 students in grades 6 and 7 combined,
and then eliminated schools with low actual enrollment based on a preliminary visit. In
cases where a village had more than one government secondary school, we chose at most one
for the sample, to minimize the possibility of spillovers. Of the 314 schools, 59 enroll only
girls, 40 enroll only boys, and the remaining 215 are co-ed. The schools have an average
enrollment of about 80 students per grade (DISE, 2011).
        We randomly selected 150 of the sample schools to be in the treatment group; the
remaining 164 serve as control schools. Figure 1 shows the four study districts and the schools
assigned to the treatment and control groups. The randomization was stratified by district,
co-ed status of the school, school size, and distance to the district headquarters. Table 1
reports baseline characteristics of schools by treatment status. The first panel confirms that
the two samples are balanced on various school characteristics such as urban/rural, number
of male and female students, and number of teachers.

3.2       Enrollment of study participants and baseline data collection
        The baseline survey was conducted between August 2013 and January 2014, covering
14,809 students. The data collection was conducted by the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty
    8
    These districts were the government’s priority districts for addressing gender inequality based on their
skewed sex ratios. The 2011 child sex ratio was 1.25 in Sonipat, 1.19 in Panipat, 1.22 in Rohtak, and 1.28
in Jhajjar. These districts do not necessarily have more male-biased preferences than the rest of Haryana,
or the rest of north India, but their low fertility rate (they are near New Delhi) means that son preference
translates into a higher rate of sex-selective abortions to ensure having a son (Jayachandran, 2017).

       To select students for the sample, we visited the sample schools and distributed parental
consent forms to all 6th and 7th graders who were present.9 There was a high rate of parental
consent; 84% of forms were returned. The rate of returned consent forms does not vary by
gender or by village-level proxies for gender norms, namely the child sex ratio and female
employment rate from the 2011 Census. Anecdotally, lack of consent was usually due to the
student losing or forgetting the form.10
       We randomly chose students to enroll from among those whose parent gave consent and
who personally assented to participate, with a target of 45 students per school, stratified by
gender and grade with a ratio of 3:2:2:2 for Female 6th:Male 6th:Female 7th:Male 7th. We
included more girls because more girls than boys are enrolled in government schools, and
we sampled more grade 6 girls than grade 7 girls because we expected lower attrition for
younger grades.11 To be in the study, the student also needed to be at school on the baseline
survey day. The 35-minute-long baseline survey took place on the school premises.
       We mistakenly omitted one school from the baseline survey. This school was randomized
into the treatment group, and the intervention was conducted in it. We collected endline
data in the school and include it in the analysis, imputing baseline variables with the gender-
specific sample average for the district.12
       To understand how parental attitudes influence program impacts, one parent of a ran-
dom 40% subsample of the surveyed students participated in a short survey at the student’s
home (N = 6, 022); we selected at random whether to interview the father or mother. Budget
constraints are why we visited only 40% of households and surveyed one parent per house-
hold. We construct a gender attitude index for the parent based on nine attitude questions
asked of the parents, which we use in heterogeneity analyses.
       Table 1 summarizes baseline characteristics of the sample. The boys and girls were about
12 years old, on average. Religious and caste variables line up with the overall demographics

     These students would be in grades 7 and 8 in spring 2014 when the program began. The school year
begins in April.
  10
     Parents had to consent to their child participating in the study, but the program was added to treatment
schools by the government, who did not offer parents a way to opt out. The classes were not held on a fixed
day, so keeping a child home to avoid the classes would not have been straightforward. Anecdotally, parental
complaints about the program to schools and the education department were negligible.
  11
     Parents are more likely to send their sons than daughters to private schools. Because wealthier families
use private schools, the boys in government schools are, thus, from poorer families than the girls, on average.
  12
     We distributed consent forms to students present during a school visit just before the endline survey and
then randomly chose sample students from among those with parental consent who assented to participate.

for these districts, as reported in the Census (Govt. of India, 2011); the participants are
predominantly Hindu. Mothers’ average age was 36 years and fathers’, 41 years. There is
a high illiteracy rate for mothers, reflecting the low level of female schooling in the parents’
generation. A small proportion (29%) of mothers work outside the home, which is consistent
with low female labor force participation rates in India. Baseline variables are balanced
between the treatment and control groups. An F-test of joint significance fails to reject
balance between the study arms.
       The baseline survey also measured the respondent’s propensity to give socially desirable
responses. We administered the Marlowe-Crowne module, designed by social psychologists
to measure a person’s concern for social approval (Crowne and Marlowe, 1960). We used a
13-item validated version of the module (Reynolds, 1982). The questions, which are listed
in the data appendix, ask the respondent whether he or she has certain almost saintly
personality traits. While it is possible some people are saintly, the module uses traits that
are too extreme for most people to hold (e.g., “I am never irritated by people who ask favors
of me”). We use respondents’ social desirability score (i.e., the count of very positive traits
they say they have) to investigate whether the treatment effects we estimate are biased
upward by experimenter demand effects.

3.3      Endline data collection
       We conducted a first endline survey shortly after the program ended, or about three
years after the baseline survey. We then conducted a second endline two years later.
       Data collection for the first endline survey occurred between November 2016 and April
2017. We resurveyed 13,943 of the 14,809 students surveyed at baseline, which corresponds
to an attrition rate of 5.8%. The endline sample also includes an additional 44 students from
the sample school that we mistakenly did not survey at baseline, yielding a total sample for
the first endline of 13,987 students.
       Appendix Table 1 shows that sample attrition does not differ significantly between the
treatment and control groups. In addition, attrition in the treatment versus control group
is not differential by baseline variables, except for a small association with baseline behavior
conditional on the other baseline outcomes.13 Most respondents (76%) were surveyed at
  13
    For the sample overall, girls’ aspirations are negatively correlated with attrition; girls with high aspi-
rations were more likely to still be enrolled in school, which made them easier to track. Appendix Table
2 details the reasons for attrition, which include permanent or long-term migration, death or poor health,
refusal to participate by the student or parent, not being available at the time of their appointment, and our
inability to track the respondent.


                                                     10
school. Several students had moved to a different school, either in the same or a different
village, or dropped out of school. These students were surveyed at home (24% of respon-
dents). If the student had moved to another village that was far from the survey districts,
we conducted a truncated phone survey (0.1% of respondents).14
       We conducted a second endline survey more than two years after the intervention had
ended, from January to July 2019, when the students were finishing or had just finished
grades 11 and 12 (if they had not repeated a grade). The survey was conducted in students’
homes, rather than at schools; the highest grade offered in most of the sample schools was
grade 10, so the participants were scattered across various schools (or had dropped out).
We conducted truncated phone surveys for those who had moved (3% of respondents). The
attrition rate is 7.9%, and attrition is not significantly correlated with treatment status or
correlated with baseline characteristics differentially by treatment status. The sample size
for the second endline is 13,685 individuals.

3.4      Primary outcomes: Attitudes, aspirations, and behavior
       We pre-specified three primary outcomes for the first endline: gender attitudes, girls’
aspirations, and self-reported gender-related behavior.15
       We combine responses to 18 gender attitude questions into a variance-weighted index,
following Anderson (2008). The specific variables and procedure for constructing the index
were pre-specified (see the data appendix for more details). We measure gender attitudes
through direct questions about female and male roles and rights (e.g., whether women should
work outside the home, the appropriate age of marriage for girls). We also measure attitudes
via questions about a vignette about investing in a son’s or daughter’s education.
       Gender attitudes are balanced between the treatment and control group at baseline (see
Table 1).16 They are also quite regressive. For example, about 80% of boys and 60% of girls
  14
     Appendix Table 1 shows that treatment status is not significantly correlated with the survey location
for the endline. Appendix Table 3 summarizes participants’ schooling status at endline: 82% were enrolled
in the same school as baseline, 8% had dropped out of school, and the remainder had changed schools. The
table also reports that 87% of the treatment group were aware of the program activities.
  15
     The pre-analysis plan (PaP) for the first endline survey was posted to the AEA RCT Registry at the
beginning of endline data collection in November 2016. It specified the primary outcomes and how they would
be constructed, the secondary outcomes, heterogeneity analyses, and the procedure for choosing control
variables. The PaP for the second endline was posted in December 2018 and specified similar information.
The two PaPs and a four-page document listing and explaining the deviations we made are available at
bit.ly/PaP4RAGA.
  16
     The gender attitudes module at baseline was shorter than the endline module. The baseline attitude
index aggregates nine variables.



                                                    11
believe that a woman’s most important role is being a good homemaker. The pattern that
girls are less likely than boys to endorse gender-discriminatory positions is seen for each of
the attitude questions (see Appendix Table 4).
    We measure girls’ aspirations with a variance-weighted index combining 5 questions
about educational and career aspirations. We also collected data on boys’ aspirations and
note that aspirations are quite similar for boys and girls at baseline.
    Arguably the most challenging outcome to measure was self-reported behavior. We
focused on behaviors that are influenced by gender attitudes and norms and that we expected
adolescents to have some say over. We construct an index of 6 questions, asked of both
boys and girls. Most of these questions are coded the same way for boys and girls (e.g.,
being supportive of sisters’ career aspirations, level of interaction with the opposite gender),
whereas household chores is coded so that, for girls, more gender-equal behavior is to do
fewer chores whereas, for boys, it is to do more. We also included some questions applicable
to only girls (e.g., mobility), which we do not include in the main index but examine in
auxiliary analyses.
    For the second endline, we again pre-specified gender attitudes, girls’ aspirations, and
behavior as primary outcomes. We construct the attitudes index identically between the first
and second endlines, using the same questions and weights (which are based on the first end-
line data). This makes the magnitude of the effect directly comparable across the two waves.
For aspirations and behavior, we updated the modules, as the relevant questions changed as
the sample grew older, so we construct the variance-weighted indices independently for the
two endlines.
    We included two additional primary outcomes in the second endline. The first is a
revealed-preference measure of girls’ aspirations for or expectation of attending college. We
set up a girls’ scholarship program for college expenses and use as an outcome whether
respondents filled out and mailed in the application, which we gave to them at the end of
the survey visit. The second is a revealed-preference measure of attitudes, more specifically,
willingness to publicly espouse a feminist position. We informed respondents about a petition
to end the dowry system, with the names of signatories to be published in the local newspaper
(through an advertisement we placed). Students were given a toll-free phone number to call
to add their name to the petition. We use signing the petition as an outcome.




                                              12
4       Empirical specification and results
       The intervention is hypothesized to make participants’ attitudes less discriminatory
against females, raise girls’ aspirations, and increase gender-equitable behavior. This section
describes the estimation strategy used to test these hypotheses and then presents the results.

4.1      Specification
       We estimate the following ordinary least squares regression, with one observation per
student:
                           Yij = β0 + β1 T reatedj + β2 Yij0 + β3 Xij + ij                         (1)

Yij is the outcome variable measured at endline for student i in school j. T reatedj is a binary
variable that equals 1 if the school was assigned to the treatment group, and 0 otherwise.
Thus, β1 represents the average effect of the intervention on the outcome. The outcomes are
constructed so that a higher value represents more gender progressiveness, so the hypothesis
is β1 > 0.
       We control for Yij0 , the baseline analogue of the outcome. The vector Xij comprises
other control variables. In our basic specification, these are grade-gender and district-gender
fixed effects and the school-gender mean of Yij0 . When the outcome is an index, we also
include a missing flag for each component of the index.17 We also estimate an enhanced
specification that controls for additional baseline student, parent, and school characteristics
chosen using LASSO following Belloni et al. (2014). Appendix Table 5 lists the extra control
variables selected for each outcome and the larger set of variables from which the LASSO
procedure chose them. We allow the error term, ij , to be clustered at the school level.
       We also test for heterogeneous treatment effects along pre-specified dimensions: parents’
attitudes and student gender at the first endline, and just student gender at the second
endline. Given the parsimonious set of primary outcomes and heterogeneity analyses, we do
not adjust the statistical inference for multiple hypothesis testing.

4.2      Short-run results
       We now present results from the first endline survey, which was conducted one to six
months after the intervention ended.
  17
    If an observation has a missing value for a component of the index, we construct the index using the
remaining non-missing variables. When the baseline outcome Yij0 is missing, we impute its value with the
the district-gender mean; we include a flag for these imputed observations in the specification.


                                                  13
4.2.1     Effects on primary outcomes
       Table 2 reports the short-run effects of the intervention on gender attitudes, girls’ aspi-
rations, and behavior using the basic specification.
       We find that the intervention made gender attitudes more progressive: Column 1 shows
that students in treatment schools have a 0.18 standard deviation higher attitude index than
those in control schools (p < 0.01). Appendix Table 6 reports the effects for each of the 17
variables that comprise the index.
       The coefficient is very similar (0.17) when the LASSO-selected extended controls are
included, as shown in Appendix Table 7. Because our results are similar with or without
the extended controls, subsequent tables only present results without the extended control
variables. To account for the possibility that attrition is endogenous to treatment, we also
estimate Lee bounds on the treatment effects (Lee, 2009). The attrition-adjusted lower
bound on the point estimate is 0.16, as shown in Appendix Table 8.
       One benchmark for the effect size is that endline gender attitudes are 0.50 standard
deviations higher for girls than boys in the control group, as reported in Appendix Table 9.
Thus, the treatment effect is 36% as large as the status quo gender gap in attitudes. Also, a
one standard deviation increase in parent gender attitudes is associated with student gender
attitudes being 0.05 standard deviations higher; the treatment effect is much larger than
this.18
       Another way to express the effect size is as a ‘persuasion rate’ (DellaVigna and Gentzkow,
2010). We find that the intervention converted 15.5% of gender-regressive views into sup-
port for gender equality. This persuasion rate is calculated by stacking all of the variables
included in the attitudes index, which are coded as binary values. In the treatment group,
on average 29.9% of views are gender-regressive, compared to 35.4% in the control group.
       Turning to our second outcome, Table 2 shows that the program did not affect girls’
aspirations. The average effect is 0.03 standard deviations and not significantly different
from zero. Even though there likely will be a sizable gender gap in college completion and
employment under the status quo (extrapolating from the cohorts ten to twenty years older
than the sample), there is not a large gender gap in aspirations even without the intervention;
girls’ starting point of high aspirations might explain the lack of an effect on this outcome.
  18
    In Dhar et al. (2018), we present an arguably better version of this parental attitudes benchmark, using
indices constructed from the same set of questions for parents and students and collected at baseline for both
groups. A one standard deviation increase in a parent’s attitudes is then associated with a 0.11 standard
deviation increase in the child’s attitudes.


                                                     14
    The third primary outcome is self-reported behaviors influenced by gender attitudes.
As reported in column 3 of Table 2, behavior became more aligned with gender-progressive
norms by 0.20 standard deviations (p < 0.01). The effect size for behavior is robust to
including an extended set of control variables and has tight Lee bounds.

4.2.2   Assessing bias due to experimenter demand effects
    A key concern is that participating in the program might have made salient what the
socially desirable responses to our survey questions were without changing actual views. The
treatment group participated in a program that made them more aware that many outsiders
to their community regard support for gender equality as a laudable or ‘correct’ view to
hold.
    To investigate whether experimenter demand effects are upward biasing the estimated
program impacts, we construct a social desirability score for each respondent. The score is
based on responses on the Marlowe-Crowne module administered at baseline and measures
a person’s general tendency to give socially desirable answers. We test for heterogeneous
treatment effects based on the social desirability score. The worrisome pattern would be if
the treatment effects were driven by students with a high propensity to disingenuously give
socially desirable answers and vanished for those with a low such tendency.
    As shown in Table 3, the main effect of having a below-median social desirability score
on gender attitudes is negative and significant, suggesting some upward shading of responses
overall for the sample. We view this pattern as reassuring, a validation that the score
seems to capture the propensity to shade responses. Importantly, there is no more of this
shading up in the treatment group than the control group; the interaction term is small and
insignificant. In other words, the treatment effect remains large and significant when we
focus on the subsample with lower susceptibility to experimenter demand effects. We see a
similar pattern for gender-related behavior. Interestingly, for girls’ aspirations, where there
is no average treatment effect, there appears to be a positive “effect” just for girls with a
strong desire for social approval.

4.2.3   Heterogeneous treatment effects
    There are many reasons the program could have had different effects on boys and girls.
Girls might have felt more invested in the program’s messages, or the ideas presented and
discussed could have been more eye-opening for boys, for example. As reported in column
1 of Table 4, we find the effect of the program on attitudes is not statistically different for

                                              15
boys and girls. (The point estimates suggest a perhaps somewhat smaller effect for girls.)
       The fact that girls started out with more progressive attitudes than boys raises the
question of whether the estimated heterogeneity by gender is entangled with heterogeneity
by initial attitudes. As shown in Appendix Table 10, the patterns of gender heterogeneity
are similar when we simultaneously allow for heterogeneity by baseline attitudes.19
       For behavior, we find that the program had a significantly smaller impact for girls than
boys (interaction coefficient of -0.13, p < 0.01), although the net effect for girls is still positive
and significant. One interpretation of this finding is that boys and girls can adopt gender-
equal attitudes with relatively equal ease, but girls face more constraints on translating their
attitudes into behavior.
       The second dimension of heterogeneity that we pre-specified was parental attitudes.
Here we use the subsample for which we surveyed one of the parents at baseline, measuring
his or her gender attitudes. A priori it is possible the program could have had either larger
or smaller effects for students whose home environment is more conservative. Columns 3
to 5 of Table 4 show no significant differential effects by parents’ gender attitudes. For
both attitudes and behavior, the point estimates for the interaction coefficients are small
compared to the main effects, while the point estimates are suggestive that the program
may have raised aspirations among girls from more gender-progressive families. Overall,
there is very little evidence that parental support for gender equality either facilitates or
hinders the average success of the intervention.20

4.2.4     Effects on attitude and behavior subindices
       In the appendix, we break down the primary outcomes into thematic sub-indices to
show which specific attitudes and behaviors the intervention affected. Appendix Table 12
shows that the program had the strongest effects on attitudes about employment and gender
roles, followed by education attitudes. The effect on gender-equitable fertility attitudes
is statistically significant but small (0.02 standard deviations), which is possibly due to
the intervention sessions having quite limited discussion about fertility. Appendix Table
13 examines behavior sub-indices. The intervention generated more interaction with the
  19
     The gender heterogeneity analysis is also robust to correcting for the gap in economic status between girls
and boys in government schools, which is due to boys’ higher rate of attending private schools as discussed
in footnote 11. See Appendix Table 11, which controls for several wealth proxies in parallel to gender.
  20
     We also tested for heterogeneity based on several factors that seminar audiences frequently asked about.
We find no heterogeneous effects by whether the school was co-ed, facilitator gender, siblings’ sex composition,
the sex ratio in the village, or the female employment rate in the village.



                                                      16
opposite sex, improved support for female relatives’ ambitions, and made effort on household
chores more gender-equal. Among girls, it also led to greater mobility (e.g., walking to school
alone) but had no impact on decision-making power.

4.2.5    Effects on secondary outcomes
      We examine perceptions of social norms as a secondary outcome. While the program
only directly reached 100 to 200 adolescents per village, participants might have started
regarding pro-equality views as more mainstream and, thus, updated their belief about how
common those views were in their community.21 We examine parallel questions about (1)
personally holding a positive gender attitude, (2) believing one’s community has a positive
gender norm in that domain, and (3) personally holding the positive attitude and believing
the community will not oppose you if you act on it. We thus assess both how perceived
social norms change and how much participants view social norms as preventing them from
acting on their progressive attitudes.
      The intervention made personal attitudes about female employment more progressive
by 13 percentage points (Table 5, column 1). It also increased by 5 percentage points the
perception that others in the community hold that gender-progressive view (column 2), which
is consistent with other findings that signals from institutions (Breakthrough in this case)
can be effective in changing subjective perceptions of norms (Tankard and Paluck, 2016). In
addition, the treatment group is more likely to hold a progressive attitude and believe society
will be supportive (column 3); many of those who changed their attitudes do not expect the
community norm to stand in their way of acting as they wish. However, the estimate in
column 3 is smaller by 6 percentage points than the effect on simply holding that attitude in
column 1: Some students whose own attitude changed think that restrictive cultural norms
will hinder them from acting on it. Columns 4 to 6 show a similar pattern for norms about
women leaving home to attend college.
      We also examine school performance as a secondary outcome to rule out the concern
that the program hurt achievement in subjects like math and Hindi by taking away some of
their instructional time. We find no impact on school performance, as shown in Appendix
Table 14. The administrative exam-score data we use are aggregated at the school-grade
level, so we cannot estimate results separately by gender. However, girls generally perform
better than boys in secondary school, so especially in light of their high aspirations to attend
 21
   Recent evidence from India and Saudi Arabia suggests that people overestimate their community’s
opposition to female employment (Bernhardt et al., 2018; Bursztyn et al., 2020).


                                               17
college, improving girls’ school performance was not one of the expected impacts of the
program.
       Results for the three other pre-specified secondary outcomes (described in more detail in
the data appendix) are reported in Table 6. First, we find that the program improved girls’
self-esteem. Second, we find a small increase in awareness of gender discrimination; status-
quo awareness is already high. Third, we find no impact on two implicit association tests
(IATs), each of which was administered to about 3,000 respondents.22 One IAT measured
how respondents associate girls’ and boys’ faces with positive and negative words. The
other, originally developed by Beaman et al. (2009), associates men’s and women’s faces with
market labor or domestic work. Because of challenges administering the IATs at baseline
(13% of responses were invalidated because the completion time was too fast or slow), we
did not make the IAT a key focus for the endline.23

4.3      Medium-run results
       We next discuss results from the second endline survey, conducted 2 to 2.5 years after
the program ended.

4.3.1     Effects on primary outcomes
       We continue to find a large and significant effect on gender attitudes in the second
endline, as reported in column 1 of Table 7. The attitudes index is constructed identically to
the first endline’s index, so the 0.18 effect sizes in both endlines are directly comparable.24
The coefficient is robust to adding extended controls to the regression (Appendix Table 7)
and using Lee bounds (Appendix Table 8).
       While experimenter demand effects are somewhat less of a concern in the second endline
because the intervention is further in the past, it is still important to investigate this potential
confound. Using the same approach as earlier, we find that having a low propensity to want
to give socially desirable answers is not associated with having a smaller treatment effect.
  22
     At baseline, we administered an IAT to 50% of the sample, and in the first endline we re-administered
an IAT to this subsample, with half receiving each version of the IAT. Some endline IAT observations are
missing due to technical problems with the laptops used.
  23
     Another concern with IATs is that they measure not only personal attitudes but also awareness of shared
cultural stereotypes. Thus, a program that discusses stereotypes could lead to a “worse” IAT score (Arkes
and Tetlock, 2004).
  24
     The control group mean of 0.003 in the second endline indicates that, absent the intervention, average
attitudes changed very little between the endlines; the variable is normalized to have a mean of 0 in the
control group for the first endline.



                                                    18
That is, the coefficient on the interaction of T reated and having a low social desirability
score is small and statistically insignificant, as shown in Appendix Table 15.
       We continue to find no effect on girls’ stated aspirations (Table 7, column 2). It is
possible an effect on this outcome could have emerged between the endlines, for example if
girls’ aspirations in the control group became more tempered over time.
       Meanwhile, as in the short run, there is a sizable (0.23 standard deviations) and statis-
tically significant effect on self-reported behavior, pooled for boys and girls. Note that we
updated the elements in the behavior index between the two endlines, so the effect size is
not as directly comparable over time as the effect on attitudes is.
       We next examine treatment effects on two revealed-preference outcomes. The first
measure is applying for a college scholarship (for girls). The theory of change for this outcome
is that the program made girls’ desire to attend college more intense (higher aspirations) or
enabled them to persuade their parents to support their goal (expected behavior, conditional
on aspirations). We find that the intervention led to a marginally significant increase in the
application rate of 3.1 percentage points, or 8% (Table 7, column 4). When the extended
set of controls is added, the coefficient remains relatively similar, but the p-value increases
to 0.12 (see Appendix Table 7).
       The intervention could have affected scholarship applications either by strengthening
girls’ resolve to go to college or by enabling them to secure their parents’ support. That is, it
could have changed their preferences or relaxed a constraint. We conduct some exploratory
heterogeneity analysis (which was not pre-specified) to further probe this. First, we find that
scholarship take-up is significantly higher for girls who had higher aspirations at baseline, as
reported in Table 8, column 1. The total effect is close to four times as high among those
with above-median aspirations compared to those with below-median aspirations (column
2). Second, scholarship applications are significantly higher among the 80% of girls who,
at baseline, said they had talked with their parents about their education goals (column
3).25 Thus, the program seems to have increased girls’ intention to go to college by raising
already-high aspirations and convincing already-engaged parents to support their daughter’s
goals, rather than by converting girls and families who started out lower on these dimensions.
       Our final primary outcome is signing a public petition to end the dowry system. The
intervention might have either made participants more opposed to the dowry system (attitude
  25
    Aspirations and discussing goals with parents are positively correlated, so column 4 puts them together,
and the larger effect seems to load somewhat more onto the discussing goals variable.



                                                    19
change) or reduced the cost to them of expressing their attitude (change in perceived social
sanctions). In the control group, 15% of respondents called to add their names to the petition,
and this rate is not significantly higher in the treatment group, as shown in Table 7, column
5.26 This null result stands in contrast to the positive effect on self-reported opposition
to dowry we observe. One interpretation is that the self-reported attitude is disingenuous.
Another is that students worried about repercussions in their family or community from
a public statement of their view, and the intervention did not lower this perceived cost
(enough).

4.3.2     Heterogeneous effects by gender
       We next examine heterogeneous effects by gender for the medium-run outcomes, with
the results reported in Table 9. While there was no significant difference in attitude change
between boys and girls in the short run, two years later there is. The medium-run effect size
for boys is 0.25 (column 1), even larger than the short-run effect size: There is no fade-out
for boys. The negative interaction term for females implies that the net effect for girls is 0.12
standard deviations. While this effect is still statistically significant (p < 0.01), it is about
75% of the short-run effect size for girls. We do not have a ready explanation for this gender
gap in persistence — fade-out only among girls — but view the pattern as interesting and
worthy of future research.
       Self-reported behavior change continues to be larger for boys than girls in the medium
run. Our interpretation of this pattern in the short run was that girls were more constrained
by external factors in translating attitudes to behavior, but now another contributing factor
is that attitude change is less sustained for them. We find no significant heterogeneity by
gender in the treatment effect on signing the dowry petition.

4.3.3     Effects on secondary outcomes
       We re-examine perceived social norms as a secondary outcome, with the results reported
in the bottom panel of Table 5. We continue to find that the treatment group views the
community as more supportive of female employment, but there is no longer an effect on
perceived norms about female education. In addition, we continue to see a positive effect on
  26
     Ideally the measure would have had a higher mean in the control group; the estimated effect size on
self-reported attitudes corresponds to a large (42%) increase in the likelihood of signing. The requirement
of needing to phone in may have been an impediment to signing. We chose not to have respondents sign in
the presence of the surveyor, as that variant could still be susceptible to experimenter demand effects, which
would defeat the purpose of adding this outcome.

girls’ self-esteem. This result is reported in Table 10, along with results for the remaining
secondary outcomes.
    The third secondary outcome is an index of girls’ education outcomes. It is based on
school enrollment, studying a STEM subject, taking classes to obtain extra skills (e.g., com-
puter, English), and taking after-school tutoring for exam preparation. We see a marginally
significant increase of 0.06 standard deviations in the index (Table 10, column 2).
    We also added a set of questions on aspirations related to age of marriage and son
preference. We find a statistically significant change of 0.05 standard deviations in an index
of these marriage and fertility aspirations, in the direction of more gender progressiveness
(column 3).
    The final two secondary outcomes are related to sexual harassment. We asked girls
about the harassment they experienced, and find that the intervention increased their re-
ported harassment (column 4). While we cannot disentangle whether this is due to actual
experiences or reporting, we speculate that the intervention made girls more aware of ha-
rassment or destigmatized victimization, so they recognized and reported it at a higher rate.
Finally, we measured boys’ self-reported engagement in sexual harassment and assault. Be-
cause of concern about underreporting, we used an item count (or list) experiment, with
one group receiving an extra item that asked them if the following statement is true: “In
the past year, I have passed dirty comments about a girl; made dirty gestures in a girl’s
presence, or inappropriately touched or groped a girl.” We do not find a significant effect of
the intervention on this outcome.


5    Conclusion
    There are a host of ways to intervene to improve women’s and girls’ well-being in
contexts where cultural norms deny them equal opportunities. These include laws granting
equal rights, affirmative action policies, subsidies to encourage investment in girls, programs
that impart skills or target resources to women, and many others.
    The approach studied in this paper is to try to directly reshape the gender attitudes that
people hold. We examined whether an attitude-change intervention in schools in Haryana,
India, could make adolescents’ attitudes and, in turn, their behavior, less gender biased. The
intervention had students discuss and think about gender norms and gender discrimination
through class sessions held over two and a half school years.
    We find that the intervention succeeded in making attitudes more supportive of gender


                                              21
equality and coaxing more gender-equal behavior. Moreover, the impacts observed shortly
after the program ended persisted: When we re-surveyed participants two years later, we
continued to find strong effects. At the two-year mark, we also find suggestive evidence that
the program strengthened girls’ belief that they will get a college education.
    North India has particularly strong gender discrimination, and gender norms are often
highly dependent on the context. Thus, the exact programming would need to be adapted for
other contexts, but this general approach of engaging adolescents, or even younger children,
in school discussions could be a widely applicable way to change gender norms. While
it might seem surprising that a series of class discussions changed views formed over many
years, most adolescents had likely spent very little time thinking hard about gender inequality
prior to the program. Interrogating one’s personal prejudices and the norms that prevail in
one’s community might be especially powerful in schools, without voluntary, self-selected
participation and when participants are young enough that their views are still quite pliable.
    That said, perhaps a more indirect approach would be even more effective than explicit
discussions about the importance of gender equality; assigned readings could feature empow-
ered women, or a history assignment could ask students to discuss women’s changing role
in society. This aspect of the program as well as other ones, such as participants’ age, the
dosage, and the relative emphasis on moral versus pragmatic arguments for equality, could
be varied and assessed to optimize programs like this.
    One lesson from our results is the importance of including boys and men in programs
aimed at altering gender norms. We find that attitude change translates into larger shifts in
behavior for boys than girls. We speculate that the very problem the program aims to solve
— that males have more power in society — means that they have more freedom to act on
their gender-progressive views. For this reason, as we look ahead, we expect a larger increase
in employment for male participants’ wives than for female participants. Of course, men also
face familial constraints on their behavior and pressure to conform to traditional norms, so it
is an open question whether such an effect on female employment will materialize. In future
work, we hope to measure whether it indeed does, as well as how the program affects other
adult outcomes such as higher education, age of marriage, and childbearing.

Notes: Asterisks denote significance: ∗ p < .10, ∗∗ p < .05, ∗∗∗ p < .01. Social desirability (SD) score is a
baseline measure of the student’s propensity to give socially desirable answers. Low SD score refers to
having a score that is below median for the sample. All regressions control for the baseline analogue of the
outcome, its school-gender mean, grade-gender and district-gender fixed effects (columns 1 and 3) or grade
and district fixed effects (column 2), missing flags for each variable used to construct the outcome index,
and a missing flag for the baseline outcome. Standard errors are clustered by school.

Notes: Asterisks denote significance: ∗ p < .10, ∗∗ p < .05, ∗∗∗ p < .01. All regressions control for
grade-gender and district-gender fixed effects (columns 1, 3, and 5) or grade and district fixed effects
(columns 2 and 4). Columns 1 to 3 also control for the baseline analogue of the outcome, its school-gender
mean, missing flags for each variable used to construct the outcome index, and a missing flag for the
baseline outcome. The outcomes in columns 4 and 5 are binary variables, not indices, and were not
collected for the 3% of respondents who were surveyed by phone for the second endline (because these
outcomes involved giving printed material to the respondent). Standard errors are clustered by school.

Notes: Asterisks denote significance: ∗ p < .10, ∗∗ p < .05, ∗∗∗ p < .01. The unit of observation is the
student in columns 1–4 and the school-grade in column 5. Columns 1 to 4 control for grade-gender and
district-gender fixed effects (column 3) or grade and district fixed effects (remaining columns) and missing
flags for each variable used to construct the outcome index. Column 1 also controls for the baseline
analogue of the outcome variable, its school-gender mean, and a missing flag for the baseline outcome.
Column 5 controls for grade and district fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered by school. A higher
value of the outcome in column 4 corresponds to higher reported harassment by girls. The outcome in
column 5 is the proportion of boys who report engaging in sexual harassment, based on a list experiment.

Notes: The sample analyzed in this table are the 14,853 potential endline respondents (baseline
respondents plus 44 students enrolled in the school with missing baseline data). ∗ For Endline 2, we
collected some data about students from their parents if the student was unavailable; these observations are
considered to be in the “attrited” sample, as the main outcome variables are missing for these respondents.

Notes: Asterisks denote significance: ∗ p < .10, ∗∗ p < .05, ∗∗∗ p < .01. All regressions include grade-gender
and district-gender fixed effects (columns 1, 3, and 5) or grade and district fixed effects (columns 2 and 4),
plus a set of additional controls selected via LASSO. Panel A and columns 1 to 3 of Panel B also control
for the baseline analogue of the outcome, its school-gender mean, missing flags for each variable used to
construct the outcome index, and a missing flag for the baseline outcome. Standard errors are clustered by
school.

(insignificantly) higher in the treatment group than the control group, so the Lee bounds estimates trim
control group observations to equalize the attrition rate, using either those with the highest or lowest value
of the outcome variable.

Notes: Asterisks denote significance: ∗ p < .10, ∗∗ p < .05, ∗∗∗ p < .01. Each observation is a school. We
were able to match 237 and 307 sample schools with the SCERT and board exam datasets, respectively.
The first panel uses data for both cohorts in our sample, from when each was in Grade 8. The second panel
uses only the older cohort because the outcome is an exam taken in Grade 10 and the younger cohort was
in Grade 9 at the time of these data. Some schools have missing observations in the SCERT dataset for
certain subjects, so the sample size varies across columns within the first panel. All columns control for
district fixed effects. Standard errors are heteroskedasticity-robust.

     Notes: Asterisks denote significance: ∗ p < .10, ∗∗ p < .05, ∗∗∗ p < .01. Social desirability (SD) score is a baseline measure of the student’s
     propensity to give socially desirable answers. Low SD score refers to having a below-median score among students. All regressions control for
     grade-gender and district-gender fixed effects (columns 1, 3, and 5) or grade and district fixed effects (columns 2 and 4). Columns 1 to 3 also control
     for the baseline analogue of the outcome, its school-gender mean, missing flags for each variable used to construct the outcome index, and a missing
     flag for the baseline outcome. Standard errors are clustered by school.
A       Data Appendix

A.1      Sample selection and tracking
      From the universe of 607 government secondary schools in the study districts, we focused on
346 schools with enrollment of at least 40 students in grades 6 and 7 combined based on DISE
(2011) data.27 If a boys’ and a girls’ school shared a building or were adjacent to each other, we
considered them a single school. We conducted pilot activities in 6 of the schools. We removed
26 schools from the list for the following reasons (a) if there were multiple schools on the list in
a village, we randomly selected one (b) based on initial visits, actual attendance was much lower
than 40 students or (c) school officials did not agree to let us conduct surveys, despite our letter of
approval from the Government of Haryana. The remaining 314 schools constitute the sample.
      We distributed consent forms to 30,685 students, 84% of whom returned the form signed by
their parent or guardian. Most students who did not have the signed consent form when the enumer-
ators visited said they lost it or forgot their signed form at home. Providing consent is uncorrelated
with student gender, which is suggestive that it was not driven by parental gender attitudes. The
school-level consent rate is uncorrelated with village-level measures of gender equality. Our sample
of students for each school was randomly selected from those returning the consent form who were
present on the baseline survey day in their school and assented to participate.
      For the baseline parent survey, if after multiple visits and follow-up phone calls, we could
not interview the selected parent, we randomly chose a replacement household. We collected data
for 2,546 fathers and 3,476 mothers. The completion rate was higher for mothers than for fathers
because fathers were more often unavailable during daytime hours due to work. We did not survey
parents at endline.
      To reduce sample attrition, we conducted two tracking surveys to verify respondents’ contact
information between baseline and the first endline, in January to March 2015 (98.5% tracking rate)
and February to June 2016 (93.8%). We also conducted a tracking survey between the first and
second endlines, in February to July 2018 (96.4%). They were conducted through a combination
of in-person visits and phone calls and verified the respondent’s and parents’ contact information
and asked about intentions to move.

A.2      Primary outcomes
A.2.1     Procedure for index construction
     Most of the outcomes variables are constructed by aggregating the responses to several indi-
vidual questions into an index. The index is the weighted average value of the individual variables,
with weights constructed by normalizing the variables to have the same standard deviation and
then recovering the weights from the inverse covariance matrix, following the procedure of Anderson
(2008). The steps involved in producing the final indices are as follows:

    1. The individual variables are first converted to dummy variables. For questions that used a
       5-point Likert scale, the binary variable was coded as 1 if the respondent answered “Strongly
       Agree” or “Agree” with a gender-progressive statement (or “Strongly Disagree” or “Disagree”
       with a gender-regressive statement), and 0 otherwise.
  27
    Because it excludes schools with low enrollment, our sample has, on average, larger villages than the
universe of villages with government secondary schools. In addition to government schools, there are 731
private unaided secondary schools in the four districts, which are disproportionately in urban areas.


                                                   53
   2. For the purpose of constructing the weights (but not for the final outcome variable), we
      impute missing values with gender-district-treatment averages. This is done to enable us to
      invert the covariance matrix to calculate the weights.
   3. Each individual variable is normalized by subtracting the overall sample mean and dividing
      by the control group standard deviation.
   4. Weights are generated from the inverted covariance matrix of all the normalized and imputed
      variables in the respective index. For some index P consisting of variables a, b, c, and d, let
      the weights thus produced be wta , wtb , wtc , and wtd .
   5. If an observation has missing variables (which occurs, for example, because we asked some
      questions to only a random subset of respondents), we construct the index using only non-
      missing items. We weight the non-missing variables by their respective weights and normalize
      by the appropriate sum of weights. For example, if a, b, and c are non-missing, the sum
      S = a × wta + b × wtb + c × wtc . Let W be the sum of weights for each variable, whether
      missing or not. So, W = wta + wtb + wtc + wtd . Let N be the sum of weights of the
      non-missing variables. So, N = wta + wtb + wtc . Then the index is calculated as S × (W/N ).
   6. This weighted index is then re-scaled such that the control group mean is 0 and the standard
      deviation is 1.
   7. In our regression specifications, we control for flags for each variable in the index, indicating
      whether it is missing.
   8. For the gender attitudes index at endline 2 (and its sub-indices), we deviate from steps 4 to 6
      above. The questions in the index were identical at endline 1 and endline 2, so to make these
      two outcome variables identical, we use the weights generated with the endline 1 data when
      we construct the endline 2 attitudes index. The final index is re-scaled by subtracting the
      endline 1 control group mean and dividing by the endline 1 control group standard deviation.

A.2.2    Gender attitudes index
     The baseline attitude index aggregates the following 9 survey questions.

 B1. A woman’s most important role is being a good homemaker
 B2. A man should have the final word about decisions in his home
 B3. A woman should tolerate violence to keep her family together
 B4. Wives should be less educated than their husbands
 B5. Boys should get more opportunities/resources for education
 B6. Men and women should get equal opportunities in all spheres of life
 B7. Girls should be allowed to study as far as they want
 B8. Daughters should have a similar right to inherited property as sons
 B9. It would be a good idea to elect a woman as the village Sarpanch

     The endline index aggregates 17 variables created from responses to 18 questions. Both the
endlines use the questions listed here. We also divide the attitude questions into four mutually
exclusive sub-indices for auxiliary analysis: gender equality in education, gender equality in em-
ployment, women’s roles, and fertility preferences.

                                                  54
      Education attitudes
 E1. Wives should be less educated than their husbands
 E2. Boys should be allowed to get more opportunities and resources for education than girls
 E3. Education Vignette: If you were the head of the family, who would you have sent to the town
     for further studies?28
      Employment attitudes
 E4. A woman’s most important role is to take care of her home, feeding kids and cook for her
     family
 E5. Men are better suited than women to work outside of the house
 E6. Work Vignette: Marriage is more important for Pooja than her job29
 E7. Work Vignette: Being a teacher would be a more suitable job for Pooja
 E8. Do you think women should be allowed to work outside home?
      Women’s role attitudes
 E9. Daughters should have a similar right to inherited property as sons
E10. It would be a good idea to elect a woman as the village Sarpanch
E11. A man should have the final word about decisions in his home
E12. A woman should tolerate violence in order to keep her family together
E13. Parents should maintain stricter control over their daughters than their sons
E14. Girls [boys] should attain higher education so that they find better husbands [wives]30
E15. At what age would you like your sister/female cousins/friends to get married minus At what
     age would you like your brother/male cousins/friends to get married?31
      Fertility attitudes
E16. Suppose the first two children born to a husband and wife are both girls. Which of the
     following should they do? minus Suppose the first two children born to a husband and wife
     are both boys. Which of the following should they do?32
   28
      This question was based on a vignette about a family deciding whether to send a son or daughter to
further schooling. The variable was coded as 1 if the respondent said the daughter or both children, and 0
if they answered the son.
   29
      Based on a vignette about a young woman named Pooja who wants to delay marriage to pursue a job
as a police officer.
   30
      The variable is coded as gender progressive if the respondent gave the same responses to the question
about boys and the question about girls.
   31
      We code two dummies from this, the first for saying that the age for girls should be > 19 and the other
for stating a gap in the appropriate age between boys and girls that was larger than the control group median
response.
   32
      Coded as gender regressive if the respondent said “have no more children” after having two boys but
not after having two girls, and gender progressive otherwise.




                                                     55
A.2.3     Aspirations index
     We construct a gender aspirations index that measures educational and occupational aspira-
tions for girls only. The questions used for the baseline aspirations index were as follows.

 B1. Have you ever discussed your education goals with your parent or adult relative?
 B2. What is the highest level of education you would like to complete if finances and opportunity
     of the school/college are available?
 B3. What occupation do you expect to have when you are 25 years old?

The questions used for the aspirations index in the first endline were as follows.

 E1. How many marks, according to you, will you score in the SSE 10th board examinations?
 E2. Have you ever discussed your education goals with your parents or adult relatives?
 E3. Suppose you were to get married right after school, would you want to continue your education
     after marriage?
 E4. What is the highest level of education you would like to complete if finances and opportunity
     of the school/college are available?
 E5. What occupation do you expect to have when you are 25 years old?33

The endline aspirations index is missing for a few observations because the respondent stopped the
survey midway or refused to answer that module.
The questions used for the aspirations index in the second endline were as follows.

E2.1. How many marks, according to you, will you score in the SSE 12th board examinations?34
E2.2. Have you ever discussed your education goals with your parents or adult relatives?
E2.3. Suppose you were to get married right after school, would you want to continue your education
      after marriage?
E2.4. What is the highest level of education you would like to complete if finances and opportunity
      of the school/college are available? 35
E2.5. What occupation do you expect to have when you are 25 years old?36
E2.6. Do you plan to go to college/pursue a vocational course/professional course/join civil services
      or army?
E2.7. What course would you like to pursue for higher studies?37
E2.8. I would like to have a job outside the home that I continue to pursue when I am married and
      have children.
  33
     White collar occupations are coded as more progressive.
  34
     Coded as 1 if the listed marks were greater than the gender-control group median and 0 otherwise.
Question was only asked to students currently enrolled in grades 11 and 12.
  35
     Coded as 1 if the level of education is greater than the gender-control group median and 0 otherwise.
  36
     Coded as 1 if the respondent is able to report her expectations about having a job irrespective of the
nature/type and 0 otherwise.
  37
     Coded as 1 if the respondent is able to report any course irrespective of the nature/type and 0 otherwise.




                                                      56
A.2.4    Gender behavior index
    We construct a gender behavior index that measures gender equitable behavior. Questions
marked with # are coded with opposite signs for boys and girls. The questions used for the baseline
behavior index were as follows.
 B1. Are you comfortable talking to children of the opposite gender who are not related to you
     inside or outside school?
 B2. In the past week, did you help with cooking/cleaning/washing clothes?#
The endline 1 behavior index was constructed using the following questions. Questions marked
with # are coded with opposite signs for boys and girls. Questions marked with ∗ were also asked
in the second endline.
       Interaction with the opposite sex
 E1. Are you comfortable talking to children of the opposite gender who are not related to you
     inside and outside school?∗
 E2. Do you sit next to students of the opposite gender in class?∗38
       Participation in household chores
 E3. In the past week, did you cook/clean/wash dishes?#∗
 E4. In the past month, have you missed school due to household based responsibilities?#∗
       Supporting female relatives’ ambitions
 E5. Do you discourage your sister/female cousin from working outside home?∗
 E6. Do you discourage your sister/female cousin from studying in college if it is far away?∗
The following questions only pertain to girls and are not included in the main behavior index.
These questions are included in the construction of behavior sub-indices.
       Girls’ decision-making

 E7. I am able to talk to my parents about what work I would like to do in the future.∗
The next 3 questions, E8 to E10, ask about decision-making using the following structure: “Who
mostly makes decisions about the following, or if this is in the future for you, who do you expect
will make this decision? Will you make the decision, make the decision jointly with parents or will
parents make the decision for you?”39
 E8. Whether or not you will continue in school past grade 10 (grade 12 in the second endline)∗

 E9. If you will work after you finish your studies∗

E10. What type of work you will do after you finish your studies∗

E11. How many days were you absent from school last week?40

       Girls’ mobility
  38
     This question was not asked in single-sex schools.
  39
     Coded as 1 if the respondent alone makes the decision and 0 otherwise.
  40
     Coded as 1 if the respondent was not absent to school in the previous week and 0 otherwise.

                                                   57
E12. Are you allowed to travel to school alone or with friends?∗

At endline 2, we excluded some behavior questions used at endline 1 (those not marked with *
above) and added the following new questions to the index:
      Interaction with the opposite sex
E2.1 Is friends with the opposite gender/has friends from the opposite gender.
E2.2 Plays with the opposite gender (who are not related to him/her) inside or outside of school.
E2.3 In the past one week, spoke with children (not related to him/her) of the opposite gender
     inside or outside of school.
The following new questions at endline 2 only pertain to girls and are not included in the behavior
index. The questions are included in the ‘girls’ mobility’ sub-index for the second endline.
      Girls’ mobility
E2.4. Has gone to the market within his/her village to buy personal items alone.
E2.5. Has attended community events without guardians present (either alone or with friends).
E2.6. In the past one week, has gone out of his/her house alone for any kind of purpose.
The endline behavior index is missing for a few observations because the respondent stopped the
survey midway or refused to answer that module.

A.2.5    Revealed preferences measures - Endline 2 only
      In the second endline, we included two revealed-preference measures. First, we offered girls
an opportunity to apply for a financial scholarship to go toward college education or other post-
secondary training. Second, we gave both girls and boys the opportunity to pledge support for a
public petition to abolish the dowry system.
      We set up a scholarship program that offered a Rs. 10,000 (150 USD) scholarship to each of
20 winners. At the end of the in-person endline survey, we informed girls about the scholarship
and gave them the application form. To apply, they had to fill it out and mail it in by the stated
deadline. The forms had a unique student ID, so we used the mailed-in applications to measure
whether respondents applied. We randomly varied the degree of parental endorsement required
on the application. Half of girls received a basic application on which they had to fill out basic
information about themselves and the school and course they would like to pursue. The form also
required a parental signature that stated that they understand the terms and conditions of the
scholarship. In the second version of the form, there was an additional section that had to be filled
by the parent or in consultation with the parent and had a weightier parental declaration that
stated that they support their daughter’s decision to attend college and apply for the scholarship.
As pre-specified, we pool them in our analysis. (We do not see a difference in response rates between
the two versions, in the control or treatment group.)
      For the petition, at the end of the endline 2 survey, the enumerators informed respondents
about a petition against dowry. We told respondent that names and villages of signatories would
be printed in their local newspaper (and we then ran newspapers advertisements to do so). They
were asked to call a toll-free number to register their support. We left a flyer with information on
the petition text and the number to call. Due to a technical problem with the toll-free vendor, we
lost 6 days’ worth of data on potential calls from one phone carrier. Thus, we called those missed
calls back to inquire if the respondents wanted to record their support.

                                                 58
A.3        Secondary outcomes
A.3.1       Social norms
The following questions were asked during both the endlines. Students were randomized to receive
either Set 1 questions or Set 2 questions.

        Set 1
 E1. Do you think that women should be allowed to work outside home?
 E2. Do you think that people in your village/community think that women should be allowed to
     work outside home?
 E3. Do you think the community will oppose you since [if] you disagree with them (regarding
     women being allowed to work)?

        Set 2
 E1. Do you think that girls should be allowed to study in college even if it is far away?
 E2. Do you think that people in your village/community think that girls should be allowed to
     study in college even if it is far away?
 E3. Do you think the community will oppose you since [if] you disagree with them (regarding
     women being allowed to study in college)?

A.3.2       School performance - Endline 1 only
     We examined academic outcomes to test if the intervention crowded out other academic in-
struction. We used overall pass rates and subject-wise test scores from two data sources:

      • State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT): We were able to match 237
        sample schools with the SCERT data. We have data for both cohorts in our sample, from
        when each was in Grade 8.
      • Haryana Board of School Education: We were able to match 307 sample schools with the
        board exam dataset. We have data for only the older cohort of our sample because the
        outcome is 10th grade exam, and the younger cohort had not taken the exam at the time of
        this data collection.

A.3.3       Girls’ self-esteem index
 E1. On the whole, I am satisfied with myself
 E2. I feel that I have a number of good qualities
 E3. I am able to do things as well as most other people

A.3.4       Gender discrimination awareness index - Endline 1 only
 E1. Do you know about female feticide and infanticide?
 E2. Are female feticide and infanticide practiced in Haryana?
 E3. According to you, what is the main reason for female feticide and infanticide?41
 E4. In Haryana, are the number of girls less than the number of boys?
 41
      Coded as 1 if any reason(s) given, 0 if respondent says “don’t know” or doesn’t answer.

                                                     59
A.3.5     Implicit association tests - Endline 1 only
      We use two gender-related implicit association tests as secondary outcomes. Fifty percent
of all student respondents took an IAT associating good-bad behavior characteristics to boys and
girls during baseline. During endline, the same students were administered either the baseline IAT
or a second IAT which asked them to associate gender stereotypical activities like factory work
and ironing clothes to men and women. We use as outcomes the implicit association of girls with
positive words for the first IAT, and of women with market work.
      The IATs were created using Millisecond Software and administered on laptops. We aimed
to collect each IAT for 25% of the sample but the usable sample size is smaller because, following
guidelines for processing IAT data, we exclude observations that were completed very quickly or
slowly (faster than 300 milliseconds or slower than 10 seconds on >10% of trials).

A.3.6     Observed classroom behavior - post-Endline 1 only
      After analysis of our Endline 1 data was complete and we had presented our results to some
audiences, based on feedback, we decided to collect objectively measured gender-related behaviors
in 2017. We developed and conducted three activities in the co-ed schools in our sample. The
three activities aimed to measure (1) girls’ participation in classroom discussions (2) students’
views about girls’ knowledge, and (3) interaction with opposite-gender peers in the classroom. In
activity (1), a surveyor facilitated a class discussion about “What changes do you want to see in
your society?” Another surveyor took note of how many girls and boys made comments in the
discussion. In activity (2), students were told about an inter-school competition based on a general
knowledge quiz. The winning classroom in each district would get school bags for every student
in the class. Students were asked to vote for three students in their class to represent them. The
outcome is how many girls are elected for the quiz competition. For activity (3), students were
asked to form groups of five for a poster-making activity about “Swachh Bharat Abhiyan” (India’s
Cleanliness Drive). The surveyor recorded how many of the groups were mixed-gender.
      There were some major limitations of this exercise. First, our pilot activities were too limited
to reveal to us that there is no gender gap in class participation in the status quo (i.e., in the
control group), and students do not perceive girls’ knowledge as lower than boys’, making the
first two activities ill-suited for testing for changes in gender roles and stereotypes. Second, we
have low power to detect changes in the outcomes, partly because we only received permission from
principals to conduct the exercises in 197 schools. Also, for our third outcome (co-ed poster-making
teams), only 5% of self-formed groups in the control group were mixed-gender, so we only have
power to detect a very large proportional increase in this outcome. With those caveats, we find no
significant effect on these outcomes. Results available upon request.

A.3.7     Girls’ education index - Endline 2 only
E2.1. Which school are you enrolled in?42
E2.2. What stream are you currently following?43
E2.3. In the past one year, have you enrolled for an English speaking, computer training, or voca-
      tional class?
E2.4. Do you take after-school/college tuitions?
  42
     Coded as 1 if respondent is in any school or college, including open school, and 0 if dropped out or in
vocational training.
  43
     Coded as 1 if pursuing a science, commerce with math, or arts with math stream.



                                                    60
A.3.8      Marriage and fertility aspirations - Endline 2 only
E2.1. At what age do you want to marry?44
E2.2. At what age do you want to have your first child?45
E2.3. How many children do you want to have? How many of these children would you like to be
      boys, how many would you like to be girls?46
E2.4. Suppose your spouse and you are going to have N children, how many of them would you
      want to be boys?47
E2.5. If instead of X boys and N − X girls, you could either have X − 1 boys and N − X + 1 girls
      OR X + 1 boys and N − X − 1 girls, which would you prefer?48

A.3.9      Girls’ experience of sexual harassment/assault - Endline 2 only
       The index is coded so that a higher value corresponds to more instances of harassment.

E2.1. In the past one year, have you ever been slapped, hit, or otherwise physically hurt by a boy
      in a way you did not want?

The following questions are coded as 1 if the incidence ever occurred, and 0 otherwise.

E2.2. How frequently have you been teased, whistled at, or called names by boys in school in a
      way you did not want?
E2.3. ...teased, whistled at, or called names by boys outside of school in your village/town in a way
      you did not want?
E2.4. ...touched or groped by boys in school in a way you did not want?
E2.5. ...touched or groped by boys in your village/town in a way you did not want?

A.3.10      Boys’ engagement in sexual harassment/assault - Endline 2 only
     We asked the boys in our sample about sexual harassment/assault, using list randomization.
Half the boys in the sample, stratified by treatment, were given a list of 5 questions including the
sensitive question. The other half were given a list of the 4 non-sensitive questions. They were
asked how many of the statements were true without having to list which statements were true.
We calculate the school-grade level differences between the mean true statements in the two sets as
a measure of the proportion of boys who engage in harassment/assault. This outcome is analyzed
at the school-grade level. Single-sex girls schools are thus excluded when we analyze this outcome.
     The statements given to the respondents are as follows, with the sensitive item italicized:

E2.1. In the past year, I have made new friends.
  44
     Coded as 1 if the age is greater than the gender-control group median and 0 otherwise.
  45
     Coded as 1 if the age is greater than the gender-control group median and 0 otherwise.
  46
     Coded as 1 if the number of girls desired is greater than or equal to the number of boys and 0 otherwise.
  47
     The N was randomly generated integer between 1 and 5, inclusive. Question coded as 1 if the number
of girls desired is greater than or equal to the number of boys and 0 otherwise.
  48
     X is the number of boys that the respondents said they desire to have out of the randomly generated N
number of children.The response options of the questions are as follows: (a) Prefer X −1 boys, and N −X +1
girl or (b) Prefer X + 1 boys, and N − X − 1 girls. The question was coded as gender progressive if the
respondent chooses response option 1 and 0 otherwise.

A.4      Social desirability score
     We use a 13-question short form of the Crowne and Marlowe (1960) module developed by
Reynolds (1982). The following questions were asked at baseline with two answer choices: agree or
disagree. The social desirability score sums how many of the responses are the socially desirable
one. A low score means a lower tendency to give answers that have social desirability bias.

 B1. It is sometimes hard for me to go on with my work if I am not encouraged
 B2. I sometimes feel resentful when I don’t get my way
 B3. On a few occasions, I have given up doing something because I thought too little of my ability
 B4. There have been times when I felt like rebelling against people in authority even though I
     knew they were right
 B5. No matter who I’m talking to, I’m always a good listener
 B6. There have been occasions when I took advantage of someone
 B7. I’m always willing to admit it when I make a mistake
 B8. I sometimes try to get even rather than forgive and forget
 B9. I am always courteous, even to people who are disagreeable
B10. I have never been irked when people expressed ideas very different from my own
B11. There have times when I was quite jealous of the good fortune of others
B12. I am sometimes irritated by people who ask favors of me
B13. I have deliberately said something that hurt someone’s feelings

A.5      Parent’s gender attitude index
     To understand how parental attitudes influence program impacts, one parent of a random
40% subsample of the surveyed students participated in a survey during baseline. The following
questions were used to construct our parent’s gender attitudes index at baseline.

 B1. A woman’s most important role is being a good homemaker

 B2. A man should have the final word about decisions in his home

 B3. A woman should tolerate violence to keep her family together

 B4. Wives should be less educated than their husbands

 B5. Boys should get more opportunities/resources for education

 B6. Men and women should get equal opportunities in all spheres of life

                                                62
 B7. Girls should be allowed to study as far as they want

 B8. Daughters should have a similar right to inherited property as sons

 B9. It would be a good idea to elect a woman as the village Sarpanch

     The heterogeneity analysis with the parent index is restricted to students whose parents were
surveyed. We also use the parent attitude index as a possible control variable in our LASSO
extended controls procedure. We impute missing values at the mean value for those students whose
parent was not surveyed.

A.6         Extended control variables
The following variables are used in the LASSO procedure to select the extended controls.

Student-level variables from baseline survey

       • Student’s age
       • Student lives with both his or her mother and father
       • Number of sisters
       • Number of brothers
       • Mother has completed 8th grade
       • Mother works part-time
       • Mother works full-time
       • Scheduled caste
       • Scheduled tribe
       • Muslim
       • Asset variables: House is pukka, House is connected to electricity, Flush toilet, No flush
         toilet, Family owns the house, Household owns radio or tape recorder, Household owns
         TV/cable TV/satellite TV/dish TV, Household owns refrigerator, Household gets
         newspapers daily, Tap water, Household owns water pump
       • Self-efficacy index49
       • Social desirability score
       • Parent’s gender attitude index

School and village characteristics from other data sources

       • Number of full-time teachers
  49
    The self-efficacy index is constructed using the respondent’s agreement with the following statements:
(1) On the whole, I am satisfied with myself. (2) I enjoy learning. (3) I feel that I have a number of good
qualities. (4) I am able to do things as well as most other people. (5) I help make my community a better
place. (6) I am full of ideas. (7) I think about social problems. (8) I have parents who try to help me
succeed. (9) Some people say that it is important to have definite opinions about lots of things, whereas
other people think that it is better to remain neutral on most issues. I think it is better to have definite
opinions.
