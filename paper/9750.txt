                                           ABSTRACT

With substantial fixed costs of drug development, more common conditions can support more
products. If additional pharmaceutical products are beneficial, they will attract greater consumption
and promote better health, e.g. greater longevity. We ask how market size n measured by condition
prevalence n affects consumption and longevity. We document in condition cross sections that both
the tendency to use a drug and longevity are higher for individuals with more prevalent conditions.

We also make use of the 1983 Orphan Drug Act (ODA), which promoted development of drugs for
the treatment of rare conditions. Longevity and drug use have grown more quickly for persons with
rare diseases and even more quickly for persons with conditions with substantial orphan drug use.

        When production entails fixed or sunk costs, the number of products developed

can increase in the size of the market. A larger potential market provides greater reward

for firms that can bring a product to market. Additional products increase welfare

because if products are differentiated, then additional products confer benefits by

allowing more types of consumers options that better suit their needs. In this way,

consumers benefit each other via a mechanism one might term “preference externalities.”

Of course, whether products are differentiated or not, additional products can place

downward pressure on prices. 1

        Although the relationship between market size and consumption and, by

extension, welfare operating through product variety follows from theory in

straightforward ways, evidence on it is scarce. 2 Yet, the conditions giving rise to this

phenomenon can appear whenever fixed costs are large relative to market size. Nowhere

is this more likely to be true than in pharmaceutical markets. According to the Tufts

Center for the Study of Drug Development, the average cost to develop a new molecular

entity is $802 million3 The number of drugs available per condition bears out the claim

that drug development costs are large relative to market size for many conditions. The

median number of drugs labeled to treat a four-digit ICD9 condition is 2. 4 These facts

lead us to ask whether individuals are better off in their capacity as drug consumers if

their condition is more common. More succinctly, we ask whether “misery loves

company.”

          Despite the novelty of the academic question of the welfare of small consumer

groups in markets, concern about this issue is not new to policy makers. The possibility

that small populations would see few medications developed for their conditions led the

US Congress to pass the 1983 Orphan Drug Act (ODA), giving firms special incentives

to develop drugs for diseases afflicting fewer than 200,000 Americans. 5 The ODA

contains provisions that reduce the cost, and raise the appropriability, of research on rare

diseases. First, under the Act drugs approved as orphan drugs (for conditions affecting

fewer than 200,000 persons), drug makers get seven years of exclusive marketing upon

FDA approval. According to the FDA, this is the “most sought incentive.” For seven

years following FDA approval, the FDA cannot approve another drug for the same

indication without the sponsor’s consent. Second, drug makers qualify for a tax credit for

clinical research expense of up to 50 percent of clinical testing expense (see

http://www.fda.gov/orphan/taxcred.htm). In addition the FDA provides grant support for

investigation of rare disease treatments (see http://www.fda.gov/orphan/grants/info.htm).

Together, these provisions a) increase effective market size, and b) reduced fixed (sunk)

costs. In doing so, the Act provides a natural experiment for measuring the impact of

increased market size, relative to fixed costs, on product development, consumption, and

welfare.

          According to the FDA , the ODA has had a large effect on drug

development:“ODA has been very successful - more than 200 drugs and biological

products for rare diseases have been brought to market since 1983. In contrast, the

of the drugs that have been granted Orphan Drug Status by the FDA is provided in

drugs approved, 1979-1998, as a percent of the cumulative number of drugs approved in

Between 1979 and 1983, the number of orphan drugs increased at about the same rate as

the number of other drugs. By 1998, there were more than five times as many orphan

drugs as there had been in 1979, and fewer than twice as many non-orphan drugs.

               In light of the apparent effect of the ODA on drug development, we examine its

effect on two measures related to welfare, consumption and mortality. First, we ask

whether there is evidence, in the pharmaceutical context, that misery loves company. We

compare across conditions with different levels of prevalence (“market size”), asking

    Some of these drugs also have non-orphan indications, i.e. they may be used to treat common diseases.

whether physicians are more likely to prescribe drugs for common diseases, and whether

people with common diseases are likely to live longer. Results from this approach are

highly suggestive: more prevalent conditions have substantially more products available,

and we document both that larger affected populations are much more likely to take a

drug and that mortality rates are lower for persons with more common conditions. A

shortcoming of this approach, however, is the possibility of unobserved heterogeneity

leading both to large markets and many drugs. Putting this differently, the cross

sectional measurement strategy may not provide a clean source of exogenous variation in

market size.

       Conveniently, the passage of the Orphan Drug Act provides a source of

exogenous variation in market size, relative to fixed costs, for drugs targeting small

populations. This motivates our second measurement approach for documenting the

effect of ma rket size on drug consumption and, by extension, welfare. We document

growth in consumption and increases in longevity for individuals with less common

conditions, relative to those with more common conditions. Moreover, we document that

these effects on consumption and longevity are significantly related to Orphan Drug use

for the condition.

       The paper proceeds in four sections. Section 1 provides background by outlining

the mechanism for preference externalities. We also review relevant literature. Section 2

describes the data used in this study. Section 3 presents our empirical strategy and

results. We find clear cross sectional evidence that misery loves company, both before

and after the Orphan Drug Law. But the Law appears to have weakened the link between

market size and welfare. Conditions with substantial Orphan Drug use have larger




                                             4
increases in consumption and longevity than others. In the conclusion we consider our

results in both narrow and broad contexts.



    I.       Market Size, Entry, and Welfare: Why Would Misery Love Company?



         This paper is mainly concerned with the positive question of how market size

affects drug development, consumption, and other measures of welfare. Still, it is helpful

to locate this problem in its normative context, which we briefly do below.

         When development carries sunk costs and products are imperfect substitutes,

markets can fail to achieve optimal outcomes. 8 First, if sellers cannot appropriate the

entire consumer valuation of their product, some products with consumer valuation in

excess of their production cost will not be developed. That is, inefficient under-provision

is possible. At the same time, because products are substitutes, the private benefit of

entry can exceed the social benefit if some of a produc t’s business is diverted from other

products. 9 For illustration, consider an additional identical product. It imposes its fixed

cost on society, but adds no consumer benefit (except, possibly, reduced prices). It is

possible, as a result, for markets to support inefficient overprovision of products with

sufficient total demand to cover the costs of multiple products. Spence terms the process

by which the market determines what to produce, “the product selection problem.”

         Some products that the market selects not to produce are candidates for the

“inefficient underprovision” designation. Indeed, one can view the ODA as an attempt to

(1977).

  Lichtenberg and Philipson (2003) provide evidence that the present discounted value of a pharmaceutical
innovator’s returns is reduced more by competition from other brands (“creative destruction”) prior to
patent expiration than it is by competition from generic manufacturers after patent expiration.


                                                     5
remedy inefficient underprovision. In this case, the reason the allocation may be

inefficient is presumably inability to price discriminate.

        We envision firms introducing competing products as long as it is profitable to do

so. Competing products are imperfect substitutes for one another. Different products in a

category work best for different sorts of patients, so that additional products in a category

may draw additional persons to consumption. A sufficient, although not necessary,

condition for additional products to increase welfare is that additional products raise the

tendency for patients to consume a drug in the category corresponding to their condition.

We assume that drug development carries only fixed (sunk) costs. The presence of more

products creates greater potential for consumers to find a product closer to their ideal.

Unless pricing extracts all surplus, consumer welfare is greater. 10

        The “business stealing vs. market expansion” distinction provides a helpful

framework for viewing the relationship between consumption and welfare (see Mankiw

and Whinston, 1986). If a new drug is substantially differentiated, it may draw new

customers into the market rather than simply diverting business from existing products.

In this case, the share of affected people consuming a drug will increase with entry. On

the other hand, an undifferentiated product may draw all of its business from existing

products and will therefore not increase the tendency to consume. Of course, additional




10
  We recognize that a higher tendency to consume in a cross section does not necessarily reflect higher
welfare. Welfare is not higher if 80 percent of people are barely willing to consume than if 79 percent of
persons consume and derive substantial surplus. On the other hand, if the arrival of a new product (without
withdrawal of existing products) raises the tendency to consume, then by revealed preference welfare is
higher. We will treat consumption tendencies as suggestive evidence about welfare in the paper, paying
particular attention to results from longitudinal measurement approaches.


                                                    6
products can put downward pressure on prices, and this pressure is presumably more

acute as the products are less differentiated. 11

        In this scheme it is easy to see how misery loves company. An increase in market

size raises the amount of revenue available to a product category, possibly justifying the

development of an additional product. An additional product may attract a new customer

(valuing the product above its price), whose use of the product generates some

combination of consumer surplus and greater longevity. Furthermore, additional

products may reduce the price paid by all customers.

        The passage of the ODA increases the effective size of the market, relative to

fixed costs, for drugs targeting uncommon conditions. This may give rise to more

products in those categories, as well as a greater tendency to consume. Because rare

conditions are targeted by few products, especially prior to the ODA, new products

spurred by the ODA are likely to be strongly differentiated products; that is, their entry

provides some product, as opposed to no product.

        The foregoing suggests the following questions. Do larger markets attract more

products? Is there a greater tendency to consume in markets with more products and/or

lower prices? Do additional products promote longevity? We now turn to the empirical

analysis of these questions.

                                               II. Data

        The basic data for this study are information on disease prevalence, prescription

drug consumption, and longevity, by 3-digit ICD-9 disease code, in 1979 and 1998.

These observations occur before and fairly long after the 1983 ODA. In addition, we

by Bresnahan and Reiss (1990, 1991).


                                                   7
have information on the fraction of prescriptions written for orphan drugs between 1995

and 2000. Our data are drawn from two sources, which we describe below.


          1. Physician Survey Data on Drug Consumption and Condition Prevalence


          Our primary data on drug consumption and prevalence are drawn from a

physician survey, the National Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys (NAMCS). The

NAMCS surveys offer information on patients' visits to a national sample of office-based

physicians. The universe consists of office visits to nonfederally employed physicians

classified by the American Medical Association (AMA) or the American Osteopathic

Association (AOA) as "office-based, patient care" (excluding specialties of

anesthesiology, pathology, and radiology), from 112 Primary Sampling Units (PSUs) in

the United States.


          Each NAMCS office visit record reports the physician’s diagnoses (usually only

one), any drugs ordered, administered, or provided, and a sampling weight. We measure

condition i’s prevalence in a year based on the number of visits with primary diagnosis i.

In particular, we define:


          N_VISIT_PREi = the estimated annual number of office-based physician visits in

          which 3-digit ICD9 diagnosis i was recorded in the pre-ODA period (1980-

          1981)12 ; and

          N_VISIT_POSTi = the estimated annual number of office-based physician visits

          in which 3-digit ICD9 diagnosis i was recorded in the post-ODA period (1997-

          1998).
12
     NAMCS was conducted in 1980, 1981, 1985, and annually since 1989.


                                                   8
Thus, the NAMCS-based prevalence measure is based only on physician visits. The

advantage of this sampling condition is that physician diagnoses are more likely than

self-diagnoses to be correct. At the same time, this sampling has the possible

disadvantage of excluding persons who are ill but do not seek medical care.

       We measure drug consumption tendencies from prescription information in the

NAMCS in two ways. Our first measure is whether patients diagnosed with a condition

have one or more drugs prescribed for them. The “consumption” measure is therefore

based not literally on consumption but rather whether the doctor believes beneficial drugs

exist for the individual’s circumstance. In particular, the fraction of visits with primary

diagnosis i in which one or more drugs were prescribed as follows:

       RX%_PREi = visits in which any medications were prescribed as a fraction of

       total visits in which 3-digit ICD9 diagnosis i was recorded in the pre-ODA period

       (1980-1981); and

       RX%_POSTi = visits in which any medications were prescribed as a fraction of

       total visits in which 3-digit ICD9 diagnosis i was recorded in the post-ODA

       period (1997-1998).

Our second consumption measure is the average number of drugs prescribed per visit, by

condition.


       2. Longevity and Prevalence Data from Vital Statistics


       Our data on longevity, as well as a second measure of prevalence, are drawn from

Vital Statistics-Mortality Detail files. Two items that are recorded on death certificates

are the cause of death, and the age at death. The number of (non- infant) deaths due to a




                                              9
condition is our second measure of prevalence. We measure longevity using the percent

of people dying before age 55 (excluding infant deaths) due to a condition.


       3. Orphan Drug Use


       The third piece of information for this study is a measure of Orphan Drug use.

We use the percent of 1995-2000 prescriptions, by 3-digit ICD-9 condition, that are for

the Orphan Drugs listed in Appendix Table 1. These data are drawn from NAMCS.


       Table 1 provides summary statistics on prevalence and consumption measures

from the NAMCS survey and the Vital Statistics mortality data. We restrict attention to

the 479 3-digit ICD-9 codes for which all variables are available. The first two columns

report unweighted means, while the latter two columns report means weighted by

contemporaneous MD visit prevalence measures. All measures of prevalence increase

over time as do all of the measures of drug consumption. The share of deaths occurring

young declines over time in both weighted and unweighted measures. We do not observe

orphan drug use for the early period, although we can safely assume it is close to zero.

By contrast, roughly 5 percent of prescriptions written between 1995 and 2000 are for

Orphan drugs. The median is 3.3 percent, while the 25th and 75th percentiles of the

distribution are 0.3 and 8.1 percent, respectively.


         III. Empirical Strategy and Results


   1. Empirical Strategy




                                             10
       Our goal in this paper is to measure the effect of market size on consumer welfare

in drug markets, and we employ two empirical strategies. First, we exploit cross

sectional comparisons across conditions with different levels of prevalence (“market

size”), asking whether physicians are more likely to prescribe drugs to patients with more

prevalent conditions. The inherent difficulty with this approach, however, is the

possibility of unobserved heterogeneity leading both to large markets and many drugs.


       Fortunately, the passage of the Orphan Drug Act provides a source of exogenous

variation in market size for drugs targeting small populations. Using panel data at two

points in time, along with a measure of Orphan Drug use, we can exploit this policy

change to provide more compelling evidence of the effects of market size on

consumption and mortality, than one might find using cross-sectional comparisons across

medical conditions alone. As a useful byproduct of this approach, we can also simply

examine the effectiveness of the Orphan Drug Act.


2. Prevalence and Consumption using Physician Survey Data


       Do persons with more common conditions have a greater tendency to take a drug?

First, we estimate cross-condition relationships between the tendency to take a drug and

condition prevalence, via the following equations:

RX%_PREi = α 0 + β 0 ln (N_VISIT_PREi) + ε i0                              (1)

RX%_POSTi = α 1 + β1 ln (N_VISIT_POSTi) + ε i1                             (2)

where eq. (1) characterizes the pre-ODA period and eq. (2) characterizes this relationship

in the post-ODA period. We recognize that these are very parsimonious specifications of

what are, essentially, demand equations. It would be natural to also include a drug price


                                            11
as an explanatory variable. We experimented with a number of price measures and found

little sensitivity of consumption to prices, perhaps owing to the role of insurance in

financing prescription drug expenditures. We also include specifications using the

mortality-based prevalence measure, as well as both measures. All regressions are

weighted by the contemporaneous MD visit prevalence measure.

        The estimates are reported in table 2. Consistent with our expectations,

probability of drug use is higher for more prevalent diseases both before and after

enactment of the ODA in all specifications. That is, misery loves company, in the sense

that persons with more prevalent conditions are more likely to find a suitable prescription

drug. The dependence of drug use on the MD visit prevalence measure declines after the

ODA. Using the pre-ODA estimates in the first column, 45 percent of persons with a

condition in the 25th percentile of prevalence would take a drug compared with 62

percent of persons with a condition in the 75th prevalence percentile. By contrast, the

column 4 post-ODA estimates indicate that 45 percent of persons in the 25th prevalence

percentile get a prescription compared with 59 percent in the 75th percentile.

        It is possible that the cross sectional relationship between consumption and

prevalence arises because of unobserved heterogeneity. Some factor determining

consumption may be correlated with prevalence for reasons outside our explanation. 13

Because we have consumption data at two points in time, we can eliminate the fixed

unobservable by differencing. We can then test whether the change in consumption is

larger for the conditions for which patients take orphan drugs. It is also possible that


13
  For example, the measure of prevalence used in these regressions, doctor visits where a condition is
diagnosed, may be driven by the known availability of particular medications (e.g. Viagra). Other
measurement approaches we employ, including both longitudinal data and mortality-based prevalence
measures, avoid these problems. Death is not endogenous in the same way as doctor visits.


                                                    12
drug consumption is growing at different rates for conditions with different levels of

prevalence. To avoid attributing a general prevalence effect to Orphan drug use we also

include measures of condition prevalence in the regressions as follows:

        ∆RX%i = α ∆ + β∆ ln (N_VISIT_PREi) + γ∆ (%orphani) + ε i∆                       (3)

where

        ∆RX%i = RX%_POSTi - RX%_PREi

Finally, we include regressions controlling for prevalence with dummies for prevalence

quintiles according to 1979 MD visits. Table 3 reports results of these regressions. The

change in the tendency to have a drug prescribed bears a positive and generally

significant relationship to the orphan drug measure. This relationship survives the

inclusion of controls for condition prevalence. The range of point estimates falls between

0.16 and 0.3. Between 1979 and 1998 the tendency to have some drug prescribed

increases from 71 to 73 percent. At the mean level of orphan drug use (about 5 percent),

orphan drugs raise the tendency to have a drug by between 0.8 and 1.5 percentage points

beyond the baseline increase with time. At the 90th percentile of orphan drug use (16

percent), the effect is between 2.5 and 5 percentage points. The orphan effects on whether

one has a drug prescribed are large relative to the overall increase in this measure.

        Tables 4 and 5 revisit the relationships in table 2 and 3 with a different measure of

consumption, the number of drugs prescribed rather than the tendency to have any

prescriptions. In table 4, as in table 2, drug use increases in market size. Using this

measure of consumption, misery loves company. In contrast with the consumption

results based on the share consuming, here the dependence of consumption on market

size is higher after the ODA than before.




                                             13
       Similarly, in table 5 as in table 3, the number of drugs prescribed increases more

quickly as our orphan drug measure is higher. The mean number of drugs taken

increases by 0.26 between 1979 and 1998 (see table 1). At the mean of orphan drug use

(0.05) the orphan effect adds between 0.02 and 0.05 to the baseline increase in drugs

taken; at the 90th percentile or orphan drug use, the effect is between 0.06 and 0.17. In

contrast with results on whether one takes a drug, the orphan effects on number of drugs

taken are small.


3. Mortality and Prevalence


       Although product consumption is the usual economic measure underlying welfare

inferences, the medical context provides other intuitive measures of welfare. We can use

the Vital Statistics to examine the relationship between prevalence and longevity, as

measured by the percent of persons, among those dying of a condition, dying before age

55. Our empirical approaches are analogous to those above.

       Table 6 shows cross sectional regressions of our longevity measure on the

prevalence measures. In all cases conditions that are more prevalent have lower fractions

of their deaths occurring young. A disease at the 25th prevalence percentile (by MD

visits) in 1979 has 21 percent of its deaths occurring young, compared with 13 percent

young for conditions in the 75th prevalence percentile. In 1998, the percent of deaths

occurring young for conditions at the 25th prevalence percentile had fallen by 6 points to

16 percent, while the percent of deaths occurring young for more common conditions – in

the 75th percentile – had fallen only two percentage points, to 11 percent. Both before

and after the ODA, misery loves company in the sense that more prevalent conditions




                                             14
have greater longevity. Furthermore, the dependence of longevity on prevalence declines

following the ODA.

        Finally, table 7 shows that the change over time in longevity is larger – the

percent dying young declines more – for conditions with more orphan drug

consumption. 14 Overall the percent dying before 55 falls by 6.7 percentage points (from

25.6 to 18.9). For a disease with the mean orphan drug use the additional orphan-related

decline is 0.2 to 0.4 percentage points; for a condition at the 90th percentile of orphan

drug use, the additional decline is 0.8 to 1.3 percentage points.



4. Discussion: the ODA’s Effects and Context


        The effects of the ODA are visible in a variety of ways in our results. Prior to the

ODA, drug availability – and ensuing welfare – were more sensitive to market size. We

see this primarily in the contrast between the pre and post-ODA estimates of the

relationship between share consuming and prevalence. The ODA increased the incentive

for firms to develop drugs for small populations, relative to the incentive for larger

populations. As a result, there was sharper growth in the drug consumption tendency in

low-prevalence conditions than in more common conditions. Similarly, there was a

large decrease in mortality for low-prevalence conditions relative to higher-prevalence

conditions. The ODA decreased the extent to which misery loves company. It is not

clear whether these effects are efficient, although if the Act simply allows more complete

appropriation of drug benefits, then there would be no reason to suspect inefficiency.


14
  This is consistent with evidence presented in Lichtenberg (2003) that, in general, medical conditions with
greater increases in the number of drugs available exhibit greater increases in longevity (mean age at
death).


                                                    15
       Most observers of the ODA applaud this policy precisely for its effect of reducing

the dependence of welfare on market size. Intuitively, in the context of disease, it is not

hard to understand the popularity of this policy. Yet, the conditions facing would-be

consumers of drugs for unpopular conditions are not unique to pharmaceutical markets.

These conditions arise, generically, whenever there are large fixed costs and preferences

that differ across consumers.

       The process by which markets select which products to make causes markets to

deliver more welfare to persons with common preferences than to persons with

uncommon ones. As Spence (1977) has emphasized, there is no reason to expect the

market to select the right mix of products in contexts of this sort. As we consider the

sense of the ODA, we might also ask whether other policies aimed at raising the welfare

of small consumer groups are also justified.

       Some people believe that investment is not too sensitive to incentives (e.g. patent

enforcement, price controls). They doubt that weakening patent protection or imposing

price controls would significantly reduce investment in new drug development. 15 Our

evidence supports the hypothesis that at least one type of incentive (the extent of the

market) has an important effect on the amount of investment. It may shed light on the

effect of changes in other incentives on investment. For example, a government-

                                                 16
mandated 25% price reduction may have a similar effect on investment as a (“market-

mandated”) 25% reduction in prevalence.




                                          17
       IV. Conclusion


       The results show two things. First, the results show that in this market, as in some

others, supply-side nonconvexities give rise to an important relationship between market

size and consumption and, arguably, welfare. In this context, misery loves company.

This has broad implications. First, market size matters in provid ing incentives for

product development.

       Second, the prevailing, and generally implicit, view is that market allocation,

unlike allocation through collective choice, gives each consumer whatever she wants,

regardless of her fellow consumers’ preferences. Given the large drug development

costs, however, consumers see drugs developed for their conditions only as they make up

large potential markets. Our results are, frankly, not surprising; but they do provide some

evidence about how the mix of differentiated products selected in a market depends on

the distribution of product-preferring types in the market.

       Third, our results show that the Orphan Drug Law “works,” in the sense that it has

induced increased development of drugs targeted at small populations and that these

populations are now more likely to take drugs. The policy is lauded, and other policies of

this type (equalizing utility across large and small populations) exist. Perhaps most

notably, the U.S. Postal Service has an explicit policy of charging the same rates for

postage regardless of letter origin or destination within the U.S. If mail pricing were left

entirely to the market, postage rates would presumably be lower for letters sent to and

from densely populated areas. Under government provision, by contrast, administered

rates are the same for consumers with substantially different costs of service, in densely

and sparsely populated areas.



                                             18
       It is becoming increasingly clear that in large- fixed cost contexts where

preferences differ across individuals, markets deliver fewer products and perhaps less

satisfaction to small groups. In the pharmaceutical market this is deemed a bad feature of

market outcomes; and policies have been devised to remedy the situation. Yet, there is

no clear distinction between the economic circumstances of pharmaceutical markets and

other large- fixed-cost markets. How widely such a policy rationale should be applied is

an important remaining question for policymakers.
