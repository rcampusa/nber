I. Introduction

The effects of foreign direct investment (FDI) on the home countries of multinational

corporations (MNCs) have been discussed for several years, but the topic has recently attracted
renewed attention in the international debate, as a result of the regional integration processes in

Europe and North America. The liberalization of trade and factor movements is creating new,

large markets and removing restrictions on where plants can be located. Integration is therefore

expected to alter the pattern of international investment, and cause changes in the industry

structures of both home and host countries.

      The home country effects of FIX are likely to be more important and significant in Sweden

than in most other countries. A first reason is that Swedish MNCs occupy a dominant position

in the Swedish economy, accounting for about half of manufacturing employment, which means

that their decisions are likely to have notable effects on the national economy. A second reason

is that the flows of outward investment have (at least until very recently) been much larger than

flows of inward investment - the sum of Swedish investment abroad between 1981 and 1990 was
                                                2

more than five times larger than inward FDI (OECD, 1993). The home country effects are

therefore not balanced by any large host country effects. Moreover, the boom of Swedish

outward investment during the late 1980s (going mainly to EC countries) provides a current

motive to ask how the foreign investment of Swedish MNCs influence the home country Sweden.

      The purpose of this paper is to examine two issues related to foreign investment by Swedish

multinationals: first, the effects of outward foreign direct investment on domestic investment,

exports, and employment, and second, the effects on the domestic economy from the increasing

division of labor between the parents and foreign affiliates of Swedish MNCs. We will

summarize and synthesize the existing empirical evidence on these matters (much of which has

hitherto only been available in Swedish) and discuss some possible long run effects that have not

received much attention in the literature.

      The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The second section outlines the motives

for Swedish FDI and provides some descriptive statistics. The third section examines the

evidence on the effects of FDI on Swedish investment, exports, and employment, while the

fourth section focuses on some possible effects on domestic industry structure. There is alsoa

summary and conclusion.



2. The Motives and Pattern of Swedish P1)1

Sweden has a long tradition of foreign direct investment and multinational firms in the

manufacturing sector. The oldest Swedish MNC dates back to the 17th century, and several of

today's leading multinationals had established foreign operations before the first World War.

Eighteen of Sweden's twenty largest MNCs were multinational already three decades ago
                                                3

(Swedenborg et al, 1988).

     Throughout the history of Swedish Fl)!, the main ownership advantages of the country's

multinationals have been related to technologies based on domestic natural resources. Olsson

(1993) identifies two types of development paths that were emerging already at the beginning of

the 20th century. One group of Swedish multinationals have based their competitiveness directly

on local raw materials, like wood and ferrous metals, and stayed close to their original industry.

Others have built on the long Swedish tradition of metal manufacturing, originally based on the

exploitation of local sources of high quality iron-ore, and upgraded their operations to more

advanced industries, like machinery and transport equipment. This pattern with technology as the

main competive advantage is still discernible, although some firms have subsequently relied

heavily on the sales networks created to exploit some initial technological asset (see Olsson,

1993).

      The motives for foreign production have also remained largely unchanged over time.

According to Jordan and Vahlne (1981), Swedish firms have typically established foreign

affiliates to avoid transportation costs and trade barriers and to get closer to their customers.

Close customer relations have been necessary in order to develop products adapted for specific

markets or specific national product standards, and to avoid discrimination of foreign producers

in e.g. public procurement. The foreign operations of Swedish multinationals have seldom been

undertaken to secure access to foreign raw materials, and access to cheap foreign labor has

generally not been an important argument, except in the garment industry after the l960s

(Swedenborg, 1979).

      However, some of the motives for FDI in the late 1980s seem to differ from earlier
                                               4
periods. A new reason to establish foreign affiliates - industry's need to prepare for an

increasingly more likely European Single Market that might exclude Sweden -coincided with

reductions in Swedish controls on international capital movements, extremely high liquidity in

Swedish firms, and a strong Krona to create a boom of outward investment.' This boom has had

a significant impact on the overall structure of Swedish FDI, and it may also have changed the

character of some home country effects, as we will discuss later.

      Swedish firms with foreign production facilities are concentrated in manufacturing and

include somewhat over a hundred corporations. As Table I shows, these finns dominate the

Swedish manufacturing sector. Domestic MNCs accounted for almost half of Sweden's

manufacturing employment and 90 per cent of commercial R&D expenditures in 1986. There are

no data on their shares of total production, but it may be observed that they have supplied well

over half of Swedish manufacturing exports since 1970. It is also useful to note that the

population of Swedish multinationals is heavily dominated by a relatively small number of large

and old firms. The 20 largest corporations accounted for 90 per cent of the foreign production

and foreign employment of Swedish manufacturing MNCs in 1986; the 10 largest corporations

alone recorded more than 75 per cent of the total (Swedenborg, et al., 1988). Only two new

corporations - IKEA and Tetra Pak - have joined the "top 20 club" since the 1960s.



                                   -- TABLE I HERE --



     Table 1 also shows that the importance of the Swedish market for the multinationals'

operations is diminishing, and that the firms are gradually becoming more internationalized. The
                                                5

Swedish share of the MNCs' total employment and output (including both parents and affiliates)

fell from about 70 per cent to 60 per cent between 1970 and 1986. Employment in foreign

production affiliates increased from 182,090 to 259,820 during the same period. The absolute

and relative importance of foreign operations has increased further since 1986, as a result of the

investment boom during the late 1980s - the flow of outward FDI during the 1986-1990 period

was almost five times higher than that in the 1981-1985 period. Preliminary reports using the

latest available data indicate that the total employment of foreign affiliates had reached above

450,000 and the Swedish share of the MNCs' production had fallen to below 40 per cent by 1990

(Andersson, 1993).

      The sectoral distribution of the foreign production of Swedish firms in 1970 and 1986 is

presented in Table 2.2 Non-electrical and electrical machinery were the most important sectors

in both years, in terms of employment as well as assets (although the relative importance of non-

electrical machinery is declining), but the shares of paper products and transport equipment

increased significantly during the period. Comparable data on FDI stocks for more recent years

are not available, but information on FDI flows from the Swedish Central Bank suggest that the

shares of pulp and paper, paper products, machinery, and transport equipment industries have

increased since 1986, particularly in the EC region (Andersson and Fredriksson, 1993, p. 44).



                                     -- TABLE 2 HERE --



      Table 3 presents some data on the geographical distribution of Swedish FIN in 1970, 1986,

and 1990. The EC countries and the United States were the main locations for Swedish
                                                 6
 investment during this period, although the Latin American share was also relatively high, The

table shows a reduction in the EC share of investment between 1970 and 1986, but a large

increase thereafter. The EC share of employment in Swedish foreign affiliates had increased to

56 per cent by 1990. The employment shaje of North American affiliates has grown

continuously, to 22 per cent in 1990, whereas the shares of EFTA, other developed, and

developing countries have fallen.



                                      -- TABLE 3 HERE —



      The continuous growth of the foreign operations of Swedish multinationals raises important

questions regarding the impact of outward FDI on Sweden and the Swedish part of the MNCs'

operations. One cause for worry is that there are differences in how the competitiveness of

Sweden, on the one hand, and Swedish multinationah, on the other hand, has developed over

time. Sweden lost more than 20 per cent of its share of world exports of manufactures between

the mid-1960s and mid-1980s, but the export shares of Swedish multinationals (including both

parents and affiliates) increased over the same period (BlomstrOm and Lipsey, 1989). The reason

is that the exports from foreign affiliates have increased faster than the exports from the Swedish

parent companies. Does this suggest that Swedish exports are replaced by goods produced abroad

by Swedish affiliates, and that foreign jobs substitute for Swedish jobs? These questions are

examined in the next section.

3. Effects on Home Investment, Exports, and Employment

Analyzing the interactions between domestic and foreign operations, Stevens and Lipsey (1992)

divide the topic into two related questions. First, there are financial interactions that come about

because investments in different locations compete for scarce funds, and second, there are

production interactions because FDI may either substitute for home exports or increase home

exports of components and intermediate goods used by the foreign affiliates. It is convenient to

distinguish between these two types of interactions also here.



Financial interactions

In the debate on financial interactions, it is argued that domestic and foreign investment may be

substitutes when the multinationals' capital costs are not constant. If the cost of borrowed funds

increases as the firm becomes more leveraged, then the MNC's alternative projects (foreign and

domestic) will compete for access to relatively cheap internally generated funds. The decision to

invest scarce resources abroad may thus reduce the likelihood for concurrent investments in the

home country, and vice versa. However, restrictions on international capital mobility, vertical

integration, and other complementarities between domestic and foreign production are likely to

dilute this effect, so the degree of substitution is an empirical question. Evidence from the U.S.,

presented by e.g. Stevens (1969), Ladenson (1972), Severn (1972), and Stevens and Lipsey

(1992), suggest that there is in fact some substitution between domestic and foreign investment

by U.S. firms. McClain (19749 argues that the same holds for multinationals from the United

Kingdom, and Belderbos (1992) points to a similar pattern for Dutch MNCs.

      There are no published studies on Sweden, but it should be noted that capital market
                                                 8

regulations limited the Swedish MNCs' possibilities to finance FIN from Sweden until 1986.

Consequently, thedegree of substitutability between Swedish and foreign investment opportunities

was probably low before that time. After 1986, the behavior of Swedish MNCs may have

become more similar to that of multinationals from other countries. In fact, there is an on-going

public debate about whether the low level of domestic investment in the early 1990s is partly due

to the high indebtedness of Swedish multinationals, inherited from the FDI boom of the late

1980s.




Production iñtenctions

Questions regarding the impact of foreign direct investment by Swedish firms on Swedish exports

and employment have had much more prominent positions on the Swedish research agenda, and

there are several detailed studies available. These represent business oriented analyses as well as

econometric studies, which means that there is some variation in methodology and generality of

results. Typically, the more business oriented authors have attempted to examine what would

have happened in specific cases if investment abroad had not been possible, whereas the

econometric studies have tried to detect the overall relationship between Fl)! and exports in

larger samples of firms or industries.

     Jordan and Vahlne (1981) is an example of the former approach. They aim to compare the

domestic employment effects of foreign direct investment with alternative ways to exploit the

competitive advantages of a sample of Swedish firms. The alternatives considered are exports

1mm Sweden, licensing, and minority joint ventures, and the analysis attempts to take into

account several factors that may influence Swedish exports and employment in the medium term.
                                                 9

These include estimates of the market shares that can   be captured under the alternative strategies,

differences in .the ability to face and solve customer problems in the relevant markets, flows of

royalties and license payments (which influences the possibilities to undertake R&D), and

differences in related product sales under the alternative strategies.

      Jordan and Vahine's overall conclusion is that foreign direct investment has positive effects

on Swedish exports and employment, because the establishment of foreign affiliates typically

leads to large increases in the foreign market shares and in exports of intermediate products to

affiliates. The driving force is the existence (or fear) of various types of trade bathers that would

limit the market shares if export was the only available alternative. Moreover, foreign direct

investment is connected with higher royalty and license payments (from affiliates) and higher

exports of related products. Foreign production is judged, by Jordan and Vahine, to be

particularly beneficial for low-technology products with high transportation costs. However, the

results rest on very specific assumptions about export survival rates, i.e. the fractions of the

affiliates' market share that could have been served by home exports. In some cases, for

standardized products, the assumed survival rates are as low as 2 to 8 per cent. In a related

government research report (SOU 1981:33), Vahlne and Solvell study a larger sample of firms

and reach similar results, with the summary conclusion that FDI has been a necessary strategy

for the survival and international competitiveness of Swedish firms.4 Foreign direct investment

has been complementary to Swedish exports and employment, because the alternatives would

have resulted in much lower foreign market shares for Swedish firms.

      It is obvious that the assumptions about export survival rates are of central importance for

the outcome, and it is therefore interesting to compare Jordan and Vahlne's (1981) estimates with
                                                10

data from other sources. To begin with, it can be noted that many other business oriented case

studies have also been based on very low survival rates. For instance, Stobaugh, et al. (1972),

who study nine U.S. firms, conclude that their entire foreign markets would have been lost

within five years in the absence of FBI. A problem with these studies is that the estimates of

survival rates are often based on surveys and interviews with company officials, who naturally

are interested in "portraying their foreign activities in as favorable a light as possible vis-à-vis

their impact on the domestic economy" (Frank and Freeman, 1978, p. 9)5

      An alternative is provided by Frank and Freeman (1978), who set up a model for the U.S.

economy where survival rates are explicitly calculated from data on costs and revenues. The

model yields estimates of survival rates ranging between 20 and 40 per cent depending on

industry. However, they rule out shifts in market size that are "occasioned by the establishment

of a foreign subsidiary" (p. 35), which means that their figures are likely to be on the high side:

the establishment of an affiliate may lead both to shifts in the demand curve and increases in

market shares. They also calculate a short run "break-even" survival rate for the U.S. economy

in 1970, that would lead to equally large export displacement and export stimulus from FDI. This

break-even estimate is 11 per cent (p. 62): foreign direct investment will stimulate domestic

exports if the surviving market shares are smaller, but reduce exports if it is larger. Using their

own best estimates of survival rates, they conclude that foreign direct investment has substituted

for U.S. exports and that the net employment effect of FDI is an annual loss of between 120,000

and 160,000 jobs (p. 62).6 It should be noted that the generality of these results is also
uncertain, since the period under examination may not be representative - this was the peak of

the U.S. firms' internationalization process. Still, a Swedish government research report (SOU
                                                11

1981:43) looking at a FDI project in West Germany made by the packaging firm PLM applies

the model on Swedish data. The results suggest a survival rate between 15 and 50 per cent,

which means that the project is likely to substitute for home exports. This stands in sharp contrast

to PLM's management estimates of survival rates close to nil, which imply that the project would

have stimulated Swedish exports.

      The problem of assessing survival rates does not usually come up in the econometric

studies. Instead, these typically employ regression analysis to determine the relation between

exports and various firm, industry, and country characteristics - controlling for as many other

determinants as possible, the focus is on the partial effect of foreign direct investment (measured

e.g. as the stock of foreign assets or the value of foreign production). A negative coefficient for

FDI implies that foreign production substitutes for exports, whereas a positive sign suggests that

complementarity - the stimulus to home exports of intermediate and other related products - is

more important in aggregate. It can be noted that most U.S. studies of this type, including Horst

(1974), Bergsten, Horst, and Moran (1978), Kravis and Lipsey (1988), and Lipsey and Weiss

(1981 and 1984), conclude that the complementarities have tended to outweigh the substitution

effects. Yet, there are differences between the competitive advantages of Swedish and U.S.

multinationals, .and it may not be possible to generalize results across countries. Moreover, there

is reason to examine the Swedish studies separately, since many of them include interesting

methodological innovations and employ more detailed and disaggregated data than what is

available elsewhere.

      The most comprehensive econometric analyses of the Swedish FDI-trade relationship are

presented in Swedenborg (1979 and 1982), Blomstrom, Lipsey, and Kulchycky (1988), and
                                                 12

Svensson    (1993). The studies are all based on a detailed data set on Swedish multinationals

collected by the Industrial Institute for Economic and Social Research (IUI) in Stockholm, but

there are significant differences in methodology and results.

        The major innovation in both of Swedenborg's studies is that she bases her analysis on

2SLS (two-stage least squares) estimations, in order to avoid the bias that comes about because

both foreign production and exports may be affected by the same omitted variables. The first

stage   estimates the size of foreign production as a function of various firm, industry, and host

country characteristics, and the second stage estimates exports from the Swedish parent company

with the first-stage fitted values of foreign production as one of the independent variables. In

Swedenborg (1979), the focus is on a sample of some 100 Swedish manufacturing MNCs with

more than 300 foreign affiliates in 1974. Her findings suggest that there was no significant

overall effect of foreign production on the exports of Swedish parents that year, but that the

aggregate results hide two significant, but opposite effects. Foreign production seems to substitute

for some exports to sales affiliates and non-affiliated customers in the host country, but there is

a concurrent (larger) positive effect on the exports of goods to producing affiliates (both

intermediates and finished products).7 Swedenborg (1982) adds observations for three more years

(1965, 1970, and 1978), with very similar results. The effect on total export is still not

statistically significant, but there is a clear pattern when complementary and substituting exports

are examined separately. A one dollar increase in foreign production is found to result in a 12

cent increase in exports to producing affiliates, but only a 2 cent fall in exports to other

customers in the host country, i.e. a net export stimulus of 10 cents.

        BlomstrOm, Lipsey, and Kulchycky (1988) argue that Swedenborg's results are uncertain
                                                 13

because her first-stage estimations have low explanatory power, so that much of the relevant

variation in the affiliates' production is neglected in the second stage. They examine Swedish

exports and foreign direct investment for 10 aggregate industry groups in 1978, as well as

changes between 1970 and 1978, in a conventional OLS (ordinary least squares) framework. By

focussing on changes in the variables, they hope to eliminate the impact of the omitted variables

that simultaneously affect foreign production and exports, but not those that affect changes in

production or exports. Moreover, they look at total Swedish exports in each industry, rather than

only the parent corporations' exports. This means that they may capture some instances where

the affiliates' activities have substituted for other firms' exports, but also cases where FDI has

facilitated other Swedish firms' exports to the host market. The latter situation may occur if

foreign production familiarizes the host country with Swedish products, or if the affiliates transfer

information about the host country's business environment back to Sweden.

      Yet, the findings in BlomstrOm, Lipsey, and Kulchycky (1988) differ little from those

presented by Swedenborg (1979 and 1982). There are no signs of substitution between Swedish

exports and foreign production for any of the industries included - if anything, the authors find

a larger complementary effect -    and   there is no evidence that large foreign production in a

country reduces the country's subsequent imports from Sweden.'

      A recent study by Svensson (1993), using unpublished data from the latest survey of

Swedish direct investment abroad (for 1990), challenges the results of the earlier research.

Svensson argues that it is necessary to account for the foreign affiliates' exports to third

countries, because they are likely to substitute directly for parent exports. Doing this, he finds

that there now appears to be substitution between Swedish investment abroad and exports from
                                                 14

Sweden. However, his results are not comparable to those of the earlier studies. While

Swedenborg (1979, 1982) and Blomstrom, Lipsey, and Kulchycky (1988) examined the effect

of production by Swedish foreign affiliates on the absolute value of exports from Swedish parent

companies or Sweden, Svensson investigates the effect of foreign direct investment on the ratio

between parent exports and the company's (parent plus foreign affiliates) sales. Since foreign

direct investment typically increases the denominator of his dependent variable, there is reason

to expect a negative estimated effect of FDI even if nothing at all happens with parent exports.9

Thus, what he finds is simply that exports from the home country become relatively less

important when the size of foreign operations increases.

      We can therefore summarize the Swedish debate on production interactions by noting that

both the business oriented and the econometric studies have found either no effect on home-

country exports, or a somewhat higher level of home-country exports as a result of Swedish

finns' investment abroad. Judging from these results, Swedish ED! does not appear to be

detrimental to Swedish exports. However, it must be noted that the examination of financial and

production interactions leaves out some important aspects of the effects of ED! on the home

country. For a more complete analysis, we must turn our attention to another set of issues that

has been neglected in most studies, until recently: the structural effects that come about because

foreign direct investment influences the composition of home country exports.



4. Effects on the Home Countxy's Industry Structure

The structural effects of foreign direct investment on the home country have received relatively

little attention in the international debate, and the few studies that are available have focussedon
                                                15

a limited set of issues. A number of studies have examined the relation between FDI and profits

(or, more generally, market power) in the home country, and concluded that internationalization

typically strengthens the domestic market position and the firm characteristics that made it

possible to undertake Fl)! in the first place (see e.g. Cohen, 1972, Pagoulatos and Sorensen,

1976, Bergsten, Horst, and Moran, 1978, Hirshey, 1982, and Benvignati, 1983). The MNCs'

profitability benefits from their ability to "achieve greater vertical integration (utilizing cheap

labour and/or raw materials), spread joint costs across a larger base, diversify portfolios across

different economies and markets and reduce tax liabilities" (UN, 1993, pp. 73-74). Higher

profits, in mm, stimulate investments in R&D and marketing and enhance the oligopolistic nature

of the industries where multinational corporations typically operate. Other researchers have

discussed the impact of foreign direct investment on the composition of domestic labor demand

(see Hawkins, 1972, U.S. Tariff Commission, 1973, and Frank and Freeman, 1978). The picture

emerging from these studies is that there is a shift in labor demand favoring "white-collar"

employees at the expense of "blue-collar" workers, arguably because multinational firms tend to

export production activities, while concentrating management, marketing, and R&D at the home

base.

        Only a few Swedish studies have examined this kind of issues in detail - one exception is

a government research report dealing with effects of investment abroad on the structure of the

Swedish labor force (SOU 1983:16) - but there is a growing awareness of the importance of

structural effects. The consequences of FDI on the composition of export products - shipments

of intermediate inputs and other complementary products to affiliates replace exports of finished

products to other customers - may well be more conspicuous than the effects on the total amount
                                               16

of exports. Below, we will first discuss what type of Operations the Swedish MNCs are likely

to retain in Sweden, and then try to identify some possible effects of this change in industry

structure.



What type of ptoduction is located in Sweden?

Trade theory proposes that the international division of labor within multinational corporations

(under free trade) should conform to the factor endowments of different production locations (see

e.g. Dunning, 1993). The factor requirements of different stages in the production process vary,

and each separate stage should be located where the most intensively used inputs are most

abundant.

      Traditionally, Swedish comparative advantages have been based on natural resources like

timber, ore, and hydro-power, and products developed from these assets continue to be important

in Swedish exports. According to BlomstrOrn, Lipsey and Ohlsson (1990), Sweden's comparative

advantages vis-á-vis other OECD countries are still in products with low and medium R&D

content, many of which are based on the indigenous natural resources. Raw material based

industries (metals, wood products, and paper products) are particularly prominent in Swedish

exports to the EC, whereas imports from the EC are largely made up of engineering products

(machinery, electronics, and transport equipment). This pattern persists even though the R&D

expenditures of Swedish firms (in per cent of value added) have been among the highest in the

world since the mid-1970s.

     Theory therefore suggests that the production undertaken at home by Swedish

multinationals should also capitalize on Sweden's comparative advantages and focus on products
                                               17

with relatively low R&D content. The production of Swedish affiliates located in other

industrialized countries should have some bias toward high-tech products (although transport costs

and various types of market imperfections may unsettle the picture). Unfortunately, it is not

possible to test this hypothesis directly. There are no comprehensive data available on the factor

contents in the MNC5' foreign and domestic production, nor is there detailed information on

what specific products parents and affiliates are actually manufacturing.
      However, data on intra-firm trade seem to confirm that the division of labor between

parents and affiliates is becoming more accentuated, and that the degree of specialization in home

production is increasing. The intra-firm trade between parents and affiliates has always made up

a large share of the Swedish parents' total exports, but the importance of these flows increased

significantly during the late 1980s, particularly for EC affiliates. About a third of the parent

exports to the six original EC members went to producing affiliates in 1986, but the share had

increased to nearly half by 1990, as shown in Table 4. The rates of increase in intra-firm exports

to affiliates located in the other EC countries were equally large, although from lower initial

levels. At the same time, there were marked changes in the structure of these exports. Whereas

intermediates and finished goods had accounted for roughly 50 per cent each in 1986, the share

of intermediates had grown to nearly 75 per cent in 1990. The affiliates exports back to Sweden

also increased during the period, to reach almost a fifth of their total sales in 1990 (Andersson,

1993, p. 6).



                                    -- TABLE 4 HERE —
                                                18

      Hence, it appears clear that the parents are concentrating their efforts on production of

intermediate inputs. Can we say anything at all about the characteristics of these products? For

lack of readily available data on product categories and factor intensities, some authorshave used

information on other aspects of MNC operations to answer the question. Andersson (1993) notes

that the labor productivity of EC affiliates increased at an average annual rate of 5.5 per cent

between 1986 and 1990, while the parents' productivity growth rates were negative. He posits

that this was mainly caused by a shift in the location of the Swedish MNCs' various production

stages. Earlier, most of the value added was produced in the parent company and many affiliates

functioned as relatively simple assembly plants. More recently, he argues, affiliates have taken

over some of the more skill-intensive parts of the production process, and parents have

specialized in simpler, raw material based operations at lower stages in of the value added chain.

Andersson also examines firm level data for the periods 1974-1978 and 1986-1990 in a

regression analysis, and finds a significant negative relation between labor productivity growth

in parents and increases in the share of intermediate goods in the parents' total exports to their

EC affiliates. From this, he concludes that FDI is now leading to an increasing specialization in

raw material based production with relatively low value added.

      Given the lack of direct evidence, it is necessary to interpret this conclusion with caution.

Swedish productivity growth may have been low for reasons that have nothing to do with the

division of labor between MNC parents and affiliates - for instance, the incentives to work hard

have probably been weak in Sweden because of the high income taxes and the compressed wage

structure. It is also possible that imperfections in Swedish markets have motivated MNCs to

move operations abroad, so that the causality runs from events in the home country to MNC
                                                19

behavior, rather than the opposite. Yet, it is interesting to note that the only available study of

the employment structure in Swedish MNC5 outlines a picture that is at least partly consistent

with Andersson (1993). Increasing foreign, production in Swedish MNCs was apparently

accompanied by lower, skill requirements in home based production already in the early 1980s -

the largest MNCs employ a lower share of qualified production workers than Swedish industry

on avenge (SOU 1983:16, p. 172).
      In addition to the suspected specialization in intermediates with low value added and high

raw material content, Swedish MNCs have also retained most of their technology production at

home. Over four-fifths of the MNCs' R&D expenditures in 1990 were undertaken in Sweden,

although the affihiates share of R&D had increased slightly since 1986 (Andersson, 1993). The

focus on R&D is also apparent in the MNCs employment structure. The largest MNC5 employ

higher shares of R&D personnel than other Swedish firms (SOU 1983:16, p. 172).

      As a result of this concentration of research efforts, Sweden exhibits one of the world's

highest rates of R&D expenditures, along with Japan, Germany, Switzerland and the United

States. However, there seems to be a contradiction between the intensive research efforts and the

large export shares of products with a low R&D content. Why have exports not shifted towards

more R&D intensive products during the past decades? One possible answer is that the MNCs

have not found Sweden to be the most suitable location for their high-tech production -the fruits

of the MNCs' Swedish research efforts have instead been exported for use in foreign affiliates

(see BlomstrOm, 1990, for such an argument).

      Thus, the limited evidence we have about what type of production is located in Sweden

suggests a somewhat peculiar pattern. On the one hand, there appears to bea concentration to
                                                 20
production of intermediates, which, according to some authors, are characterized by relatively

low value added and high raw material content. On the other hand, there is also a focus on

technology production, which is the area where Swedish MNCs have their firm specific

competitive advantages. It is possible that this peculiar pattern arises only in advanced countries

with abundant natural resources, but not in advanced countries with comparative advantages in

human capital or technology, where the country's and MNCs' advantages are likely to coincide.

Hence, the pattern in Sweden may differ from that in countries that are poor in natural resources,

like Japan, the Netherlands, or Switzerland.



Effects of increasing specialization

The discussion above implies that Swedish multinationals are concentrating their home production

in two areas: R&D and intermediate products. Since the MNCs' location choices are based on

profit maximization, it can be assumed that their decisions reveal that there are private gains to

be made from specialization. It is not equally obvious what the net effects are for Sweden. One

reason is related to the characteristics of markets and production processes. Differences in market

structure allow some industries to charge higher prices and generate larger profits than others,

and differences in technologies mean that some types of production processes are connected with

positive external effects and spillovers. The impact of FDI on the home country may be

beneficial if production processes with high profits and positive externalities are retained at home,

but effects are likely to be less advantageous if these are among the activities that are moved to

foreign affiliates. Another reason is that it is impossible to identify any alternatives to the

continuing internationalization of Swedish multinationals. Would the MNCs be able to retain the
                                                21

present production volumes and market shares if they were not allowed to continue the

specialization of their Swedish operations and the expansion of their foreign production, or would

they be outcompeted by foreign rivals?

      Consequently, very few studies have examined the home country effects of FDI from this

perspective, and there is no generally accepted notion of what industries are most beneficial, what

kinds of externalities are relevant, how important they are in quantitative terms, and how they

compare with the gains from specialization identified in neo-classicai trade theory. The sole

exception seems to be a consensus that FDI has allowed the Swedish MNCs to grow larger and

spend more resources on R&D than what would otherwise have been possible, and that this has

had a positive impact on the scientific and technological capability of Sweden (see e.g.

Fjálcansson, 1980). Our discussion of the possible long-term effects of increasing specialization

will therefore be rather speculative, and the ensuing paragraphs are perhaps best seen as an

agenda for future research.

      The view that the MNCs' decisions to concentrate R&D in the parent company are

beneficial for Sweden is seldom questioned, as noted above, and there is no need to repeat the

well-known arguments for why R&D may be connected with positive externalities. Instead, it is

interesting to note that the recent debate has raised several questions about Sweden's ability to

benefit from. the potential R&D spillovers in the long run.

      First, the debate has revealed worries that R&D is also moving abroad, and the foreign

affiliates' share of the Swedish MNCs' total R&D expenditures did indeed increase slighlty

between 1986 and 1990. It is not yet clear whether this is a stable trend (the affiliates' share of

R&D remained more or less stable between 1970 and 1986), but the recent changes call attention
                                               22

to questions about what has determined the location of R&D. More specifically, it has been

argued that R&D has been cheap in Sweden because the salaries of scientists and engineers have

been low compared to other OECD countries (BlomstrOm, 1990). However, low salaries have

also meant that the incentives to invest in higher education are weak, and skilled labor is

becoming more scarce. Sweden has therefore lost its position among the countries with the

highest education and skill levels in manufacturing, and it may be difficult to retain the

comparative advantages in R&D if present trends continue.

      A second cause of concern has been the lack of a shift in total Swedish exports toward

more high-tech products during the past decades, in spite of the very high R&D expenditures

(BiomstrOm, Lipsey and Ohlsson, 1990). As discussed earlier, this may indicate that Swedish

research results are not exploited at home, but rather exported to foreign affiliates where

production takes place. The question is then which activities yield the most positive externalities:

production of high technology (i.e. R&D) or high-technology production? This may be a more

general problem than the previous one.

      Finally, for Sweden to benefit front the potential R&D externalities, it is necessary that

there is a population of local firms that are able to absorb spillovers (see Kokko, 1992).

However, a concentration of the MNCs' Swedish operations to fewer and perhaps less advanced

intermediates might have a profound impact on thousands of their non-multinational suppliers and

sub-contractors in Sweden. Overall, there is already a downward trend in the number of sub-

contractors, and the share of inputs purchased in Sweden is also falling (Braunerhjelm, 1991).

Further increases in Swedish investment abroad and a continuing specialization of Swedish

operations could enhance this trend, since many of the suppliers and sub-contractors may lack
                                               23
the resources to follow the MNCs abroad. This potential effect of FD! on industry structure

therefore raises questions about the possibilities to absorb the spillovers from the MNCs' R&D

efforts in the future.

      The consequences of an increased bias towards production of intermediates, which may be

characterized by low R&D and high raw material content, have only been discussed very briefly

in the Swedish literature, but most of the comments point in the same direction: there are serious

doubts about the advantages of this type of development. One apparent reason for the skepticism

is a worry that the MNCs' decisions about production locations may have been partly motivated

by various market imperfections that have distorted factor prices. This would also render the

resulting division of labor more or less distorted, and motivate policies to remove the
imperfections. In fact, the current unemployment rates - over eight per cent of the labor force

is unemployed and another five to six per cent are engaged in various public programs, to

compare with average unemployment rates of between one and three per cent during the past

decades - testify that problems of this kind are serious, since all markets do not clear.

      However, the possibility that market structure and various types of externalities are

important has also figured in the debate. For instance, Andersson (1993) departs from the

assumption that Swedish MNCs are increasingly specializing in simple raw material based

products, and argues that this is undesirable because there are differences between markets for

simple intermediates and more advanced and differentiated finished goods. For the first group

of products, there is already fierce price competition and the entry of new producers from the

industrializing countries and the emerging market economies of Eastern Europe is likely to add

to the pressure. Continued competitiveness in these industries requires cost reductions and
                                                24

perhaps also falling real wages. The markets for advanced finished products, by contrast, are

more oligopolistic, and there are generally higher profits, faster product development, and more

room for increases in real wages. One objection to this assessment is that the exports from MNC

parents to affiliates are intra-firm transactions. The prices and competitive conditions in parallel

arms-lenght markets may not apply, and intra-firm trade may even be an effective way to exploit

domestic raw materials.

      Another potential effect of specialization in raw material based intermediates is that the

prices of these products are often more sensitive to changes in business trends than those of

advanced finished products. The case of Finland, where exports have traditionally been much

more biased towards intermediates based on forest products and meta]s than in Sweden, provides

a relevant example (Haavisto and Kokko, 1991). The value of Finnish exports has always

dropped rapidly during the troughs of the international business cycle, and the resulting balance

of payments crises have necessitated recurrent devaluations. In fact, the Finnish ten-year

devaluation cycle (with major devaluations in 1949, 1957, 1967, and 1977-78) is highly

correlated with the major depressions in the European economy during the post-War period.'0

Devaluations have been seen as the only possible policy response, simply because the size of the

export sector has made it imperative to uphold international competitiveness, often at the expense

of other objectives. Income distribution is one of the other goals that has sometimes been

sacriflced, because devaluations typically benefit capital owners at the expense of wage earners.

Hence, there may be cause to be wary about increasing raw material dependence to the extent

that recurrent exchange rate changes (or volatile exchange rates) are contrary to other political

or economic objectives.
                                               25

      Finally, thereis reason to once again consider the effects of specialization on the sub-

contractors and suppliers of MNCs. What happens with industry structure if the parent companies

specialize in the production of some of the intermediate inputs used in their final products, and

there are fewer components to be made in Swedish plants? Are the Swedish suppliers able to

export to Swedish foreign affiliates, or will the motives to engage Swedish suppliers be reduced?

The number of suppliers employed by Swedish MNCs has been falling rapidly over the past

years, as noted earlier. Moreover, few domestic (non-multinational) suppliers and sub-contractors

have the capability to follow the MNCs abroad, as shown by Braunerhjelm (1991). Examining

a sample of 140 Swedish sub-contractors, he notes that only 4 per cent of their output is shipped

to Swedish MNC affiliates abroad, while Swedish MNCs at home account for 43 per cent of their

sales. This implies that a continued division of labor along the lines discussed above - even one

that is successful enough to increase the total employment in Swedish industry - may have a

profound impact on Swedish industry structure, It is conceivable that the present population of

manufacturing firms, which is made up of few large MNCs and thousands of smaller sub-

contractors and suppliers, may be replaced by a structure with an unchanged number of MNCs

(that are perhaps even larger than today) but a significantly lower number of smaller firms.

     We already noted that this kind of development might reduce the opportunities to benefit

from R&D-spillovers, but there may be additional effects on e.g. growth rates. It is generally

believed that small and medium sized firms were instrumental in generating economic growth in

the U.S. and the U.K. during the 1980s, and they have played major roles in the development

of new high-tech industries all over the industrialized world. Recent empirical studies have also

demonstrated that firm growth decreases with firm size and firm age (see. e.g. Evans, 1987;
                                               26
Hall, 1987; Dunne, Roberts, and Samuelson, 1989). The link between firm size and growth in

Sweden may be different, but any significant relation provides a motive to think twice about the

possible effects of FDI on the home country's economic structure.



5. Summary and Conclusions

This paper set out to summarize some of the research on the impact of Swedish investment

abroad on Swedish investment, exports, and employment, and to discuss some effects of the

division of labor between MNC parents and foreign affiliates. Reviewing the literature on the

relation between foreign investment and home country exports (and employment), we found that

the net effect seems to be one of complementarity. Foreign production substitutes for some borne

exports of finished goods, but the advantages of market proximity allow the foreign affiliates to

capture a larger market share than what the parent, exporting from Sweden, could achieve. The

resulting increases in the parent's exports of intermediate and related products are large enough

to make up for the lost exports of finished goods.

      We also noted that the effect of foreign direct investment on the structure, rather than

volume, of Swedish exports may be important. Instead of shipping finished products to foreign

consumers, MNC parents are increasingly shipping intermediate products to their foreign

affiliates. There are no data on product categories or the factor content of the parents' and

affiliates' production, so it is not possible to draw any conclusions regarding the characteristics

of these intermediates. Yet, some Swedish economists have argued that the division of labor may

entail an increasing specialization of Swedish manufacturing on products with relatively low value

added and low R&D content. In addition, there is a concentration of R&D activities in Sweden.
                                               27

      Few studies have hitherto examined the effects of FDI via its impact on the structure of

exports, and there is a paucity of relevant information on the topic. Our discussion of the

possible long-term effects of increasing specialization was therefore rather speculative, and

focused on some topics for future research. The questions that were raised concerned the

possibilities to benefit from potential R&D externalities, the impact of an increased raw material

bias on income distribution and exchange rate volatility, and the consequences for industry

structure and growth rates. Some of these effects are potentially important, not only for Sweden

but perhaps also for other home countries of multinational corporations,

Notes

1. It is useful to note the difference between the Swedish response to European integration and
some North American reactions to NAFTA. The fear that Sweden would perhaps not join the
European Community contributed to the surge of Swedish investment in EC countries during the
late 1980s. The North American debate in 1993 has revealed concerns about the opposite
reaction, i.e. massive outflows of investment ('the great sucking sound') as Canada and the
United States join NAFTA. This illustrates a fundamental difference between the motives for FDI
in the two regions: Swedish MNCs are still mainly concerned about market access abroad,
whereas North American MNC5 already have access to their most important markets (i.e. their
home markets) and worry more about production costs.

2. Most of the data on Swedish MNCs are from comprehensive surveys conducted by the
Industrial Institute of Economic and Social Research (IUI) in Stockholm. The surveys have been
conducted every fourth year between 1970 and 1990 (except 1982), but detailed information on
the results of the 1990 survey are not available.

3. As quoted by Caves (1982, p. 166).
4. The SOU publications are government committee reports on various topics: the ones referred
to in this paper are all based on investigations by the Direct Investment Committee 1977-1983.

5. Interestingly enough, the prevailing view of the Swedish labor movement has also been that
FDI is 'necessary and positive for overall the competitiveness of the firms, and generates
spitlover gains to the domestic branches of the corporations" (Hjalmarsson, 1991, p. 256).

6. Another illustration of how results depend on assumptions about export survival rates is given
by U.S. Tariff Commission (1973), where the employment effects of FDI are analyzed.
Assuming 100 per cent survival rates, the Commission estimates that the total impact of U.S.
Foreign direct investment in 1970 was a loss of 1.1 million jobs. Assuming a 50 per cent
survival rate reduces the estimated loss to 400,000 jobs. Finally, the effects are recalculated
under the assumption that U.S. exporters would have maintained the shares of world trade they
held in 1960-1961 (i.e. before the rapid expansion of American investment abroad that took place
during the 1960s). The result is a net job gain of 500,000 U.S. jobs. (See also Frank and
Freeman, 1978, Chapter II.)
7. Swedenborg claims that a one dollar increase in foreign production stimulates 15 cents worth
of exports to the producing affiliate, but substitutes for 9 cents worth of exports to other firms
in the host country (Swedenborg, 1979, pp. 215-217).
8. Blomstrom, Lipsey, and Kulchycky (1988) also include some 2SLS estimates similar to those
of Swedenborg (1979 and 1982). Their 2SLS regression yield somewhat larger positive
coefficients for the effect of foreign production on Swedish exports than what their Ol.S
regressions do. This is contrary to Swedenborg's findings (although the only looked at the
parents' exports from Sweden), and possibly an indication that foreign production may have some
                                               29

positive external effects on other Swedish exporters.

9. Apparently, Svensson (1993) has divided his original dependent variable (parent exports) with
the size of the MNC in order to avoid heteroscedasticity.

10. Trade with the Soviet Union exerted a countercyclical effect on Finnish exports after the mid-
1970s, which led to a change in the export structure and reduced volatility during the 1980s, until
the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 (Haavisto and Kokko, 1991). The picture has now
reverted to that before the 1980s: consequently, the most recent European depression has forced
a large devaluation.
