                 Interpreting Tests of Forward Discount Bias Using
                     Survey Data on Exchange Rate Expectations




                                       ABSTRACT



                Survey data on exchange rate expectations are used to divide
          the forward discount into expected depreciation and a risk prem-
          iurn. Our starting point is the common test of whether the forward
          discount is an unbiased predictor of future
          rate. We use the surveys to decompose the changes       in the spot
                                                         bias into a portion
          attributable to the risk premium and a portion attributable to sys-
          tematic prediction errors. The survey data suggest that our
          findings of both unconditional and conditional bias are
          overwhelmingly due to systematic expectational errors. Regres-
          sions of future changes in the spot rate against the forward
          discount do not yield insights into the sign, size or variability of
          the risk premium as is usually thought. We test directly the
          hypothesis of perfect substitutability, and find support for it in
          that changes in the forward discount reflect, one for one, changes
          in expected depreciation. The "random-walk" view that expected
          depreciation is zero is thus rejected; expected depreciation is
          even significantly more variable than the risk premium. In fact,
          investors would do better if they always reduced fractionally the
          magnitude of expected depreciation. This is the same result that
          Bilson and many others have found with forward market data, but
          now it cannot be attributed to a risk premium.

1. INTRODUCTION

      The forward exchange rate is surely the jack-of-all-trades of international
financial economics. Whenever researchers need a variable representing inves-
tor expectations of future spot rates, the forward rate is the first to come to
mind. On the other hand, the forward rate is frequently used to measure the
empirically elusive foreign exchange risk premium.
      These two conflicting roles are most evident in the large literature testing
whether the forward discount is an unbiased predictor of the future change in
the spot exchange rate.1 Most of the studies that test the unbiasedness

hypothesis reject it, and they generally agree on the direction of bias. They
tend to disagree, however, about whether the bias is evidence of a risk premium
or of a violation of rational expectations. For example, studies by Longworth
(1981) and Bilson (1981a) assume that investors are risk neutral, so that the
systematic component of exchange rate changes in excess of the forward
discount is interpreted as evidence of a failure of rational expectations. On the
other hand, Hsieh (1984) and most others attribute the same systematic com-
ponent to a time-varying risk premium that separates the forward discount
from expected depreciation.
    Investigations by Fama (1984) and Hodrick and Srivastava (1986) have
recently gone a step further, interpreting the bias not only as evidence of a risk
premium1 but also as evidence that the variance of the risk premium is greater
than the variance of expected depreciation. Bilson (1985) terms this view a new
"empirical paradigm" because it incorporates an essentially static model of
exchange rate expectations; changes in the forward discount predominantly
reflect changes in the risk premium rather than changes in expected deprecia-
tion. Often cited in support of this view is the work of Meese and RogofT (1983),
who find that a random walk model consistently forecasts future spot rates
better than alternative models, including the forward rate.
    But one cannot address without additional information the basic issues of
whether systematic expectational errors or the risk premium are alone respon-
sible for the repeatedly biased forecasts of the forward discount (or whether it
is some combination of the two), let alone whether the risk premium is more
variable than expected depreciation. In this paper we use survey data on
exchange rate expectations in an attempt to help resolve these issues. The sur-
veys allow us to divide the forward discount into its two components - expected
depreciation and the risk premium -- and to inspect separately the properties

 of each.

     Though surveys of agents' expectations may in general be less desirable
 than data on agents' actual market behavior, in this case the merit of a new
 data source lies in what could not have been learned without it. One particular
 advantage of the surveys is that our estimates of the risk premium do not
 depend on the validity of any specific model or assumptions. As a consequence
we can test directly whether investors regard assets denominated in difTerent
 currencies as perfect substitutes. A second advantage is that, with the issue of
the risk premium's existence tentatively resolved, we can then test the
hypothesis of forward rate unbiasedness and come away with a clear idea of
how much bias is due to the risk premium and how much is due to systematic
expeetational errors. A third advantage of the surveys (which cover a variety of
sample periods and forecast horizons) is that they can help us gain a sense for
the accuracy of earlier interpretations given to the large number of rejections
of the forward rate unbiasedness hypothesis.

     The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents some simple descrip-
tive statistics from the survey data. Here the focus is primarily on the uncondi-
tional prediction errors of the forward discount. In section 3, we perform the
standard (conditional) test of forward discount unbiasedness, and use the sur-
veys to decompose the bias into a component attributable to systematic expec-
tational errors and a component attributable to the risk premium. In section 4,
we test formally whether the risk premium component is significantly different
from zero, that is, we test whether investors regard positions in different
currencies as perfect substitutes. In section 5, we test formally whether the
expectational errors component is significantly different from zero, that is, we
ask if the survey expectations are rational in the sense that they are formed in
a manner consistent with the true spot process. Finally. section 6 offers our

conclusions.

2.   DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS

       Our exchange rate expectations data come from three independent sur-
veys. The first survey source is Money Market Services (MMS), Inc. Every two
weeks from January 1983 to October 1984, MMS spoke by phone with an average
of 30 currency traders or currency-room economists at major international
banks. Respondents were asked for their expectations of the value of the
pound, mark, Swiss franc and yen against the dollar in two weeks and three
months time. From October 1984 to February 1986, MMS conducted its survey
every week, asking for expectations one week and one month into the future.
The Economist Financial Report has conducted telephone interviews with
currency traders at 14 leading international banks one day each six weeks
beginning in June, 1981. On each occasion, respondents reported their expec-
tations of the value of the pound. French franc, mark, Swiss franc and yen at
three-, six- and twelve-month horizons. Finally, the Amex Bank Review (Amex)
surveys 250-300 central and private bankers, corporate treasurers and finance
directors, and economists, and records their expectations of the value of the
pound, French franc, mark, Swiss franc and yen against the dollar at six-month
and twelve-month horizons. Most of these data sets are discussed and analyzed
in Frankel and Froot (1986).2

      Naturally, the benefits that survey data provide do not come without possi-
ble costs. The presence of heterogeneous beliefs, the use of the median
response, the lack of perfect synchronization, and the sheer volatility of the
spot rate all make some measurement error in the survey data likely. We
present results in section 4 which suggest that the surveys are surprisingly

 "clean". Nevertheless, we try to use only tests that are robust to the presence
 of random measurement error in the data.3 In order to take advantage of the
 complete sample of data available (the three sources contain over 1.450 data
 points), we used every available opportunity to raise our sample sizes. The data
 are frequently pooled across currencies. We also employ a method-of--moments
 estimation procedure which allows us to pooi the data across different forecast
 horizons.

 2.1. Decomposition of Forward Rate Prediction Errors

       The simplest test for whether the forward discount is an unbiased predic-
tor of the future spot rate is a test for unconditional bias in the forward rate
prediction errors. These errors are defined as:
                     —
                         As ÷   = (f4— ,s'÷)       +   (s'   — tst +)        +                  (i)
where fd is the forward discount (the log of the current forward rate minus
the log of the current spot rate, f — s) expressed in terms of domestic
currency, and      and S+k are the log of the actual spot rate and expected
spot rate k periods into the future, respectively, minus the log of the current
spot rate. Equation (1) thus defines the risk premium, rp, as the expected
excess return required by investors in order to hold an open position in domes-
tic currency at time t and       as the expectational prediction error, realized
at time t+k. If exchange rate risk is completely diversifiable and expectations
are rational, then the forward rate prediction errors should be purely random.4
     Also, we experimented with different approximations to the precise survey and forecast
dates of the Amex survey, which was conducted by mail over a period of up to a month. We
used the average of the 30 days during the survey and also the mid-point of the survey
period to construct reference sets. Both gave very similar results, so that only results from
the former sample were reported.
     Under perfect substitutability, expected real, and not nominal, profits should be zero;
the two differ because of Jensen's inequality (see Engel, 1984). We do not incorporate the
effects of purchasing power uncertainty in this paper, however. One might expect the
effects are sma]l the standard deviation of unexpected changes in the inflation rate are
about 1/30 the size of the standard deviation in exchange rate changes (Litterman, 1980,
and the results in Tables 1, 2 and 3 of this paper).
                                              -6-
      Table 1 reports the time series means of the forward discount, ex post
change in the spot rate and the forward rate prediction error in equation (1),
sampled on the days when surveys were conducted.5 In several cases (particu-
larly the MMS three-month data and the Economist and Amex twelve-month
data), we can reject the hypothesis that the forward rate is on average an
unbiased predictor of the future spot rate.6 The signs of the errors are clearly
sensitive to the sample period; they are negative in the later MMS sample
(October 1984 to February 1986) and in the Amex data from the late 1970s, but
positive in between. Columns (1) and (2) of Table 1 show that such variation is
due to substantial swings in average ex post exchange rate changes from sam-
ple period to sample period and not due to swings in the forward discount.
      Without any additional information on investors' expected future spot rate,
      one would have to assume that the risk premium is zero in order to inter-
pret equation (1) as a test of market efficiency. Alternatively, if one wishes to
interpret equation (1) as a test for the existence of a risk premium, the
assumption of rational expectations is required (i.e., ?7÷k is serially uncorre-
                  ft     ft
lated and F? ( flg÷ft I Tg) = 0). Thus the results in Table 1 could be interpreted


as evidence that investors made repeated forecasting mistakes during some the
survey periods, .g that investors distinguished between assets denominated in
different currencies on the basis of risk (or else some combination of these
polar points of view).7
  b DEl provided us with daily forward and spot exchange rates, computed as the average
of the noon-time bid and ask rates.
  6 The  Economist surveys, MMS one-month and three-month surveys, and the Amex
twelve-month survey were conducted at intervals shorter than their respective forecast
horizons. This implies that the prediction errors of the forward discount and of the survey
expectations, in Tables 1 and 2 respectively, are not all independent, even under the hy-
pothesis of rational expectations. For the Economist and MMS data, the standard deviation
of the means were estimated by a method of moments procedure discussed in the following
section. For the Amex data, confidence intervals were constructed assuming that the
number of degrees of freedom is equal to the number of nonoverlapping observations. This
latter procedure implies that t-tests reported for the Amex data are lower bounds.
   7 Other potential candidates to explain the non-zero forward rate prediction errors are
the so-called "peso problem" (but see Frankel, 1985) and the convexity term due to
Jensen's inequality (see McCulloch, 1975).

     In Table 2 we use the survey data to separate the forward rate prediction
errors into the two terms on the right-hand-side of equation (1): the risk prem-
ium and expectational errors. Here the conclusions concerning the nature of
each are surprisingly very different from those one might draw from Table 1.
Note first that the means of the risk premia measured in the survey data are
large, averaging around an annualized 5 percent and reaching 9 percent in
several cases. Second, and perhaps even more striking, is that nothing about
the sign or magnitude of the risk premia as measured by the survey data can be
inferred from the forward discount prediction errors. In fact, the premia in
column (1) of Table 2 happen to be consistently opposite in sign from the for-
ward rate errors.6 Third, the risk prernia often appear negatively correlated
with the forward rate errors, not just across data sets, but within each data set
as well. The first column of Table 3 reports correlation coefficients for each
currency and survey: 21 of the 33 estimates are less than zero. Charts 1
through 4 show the time series of the forward rate errors and the survey risk
prernia for each of the data sets.9 The graphs show how badly the forward pred-
iction errors have measured the premia in the past.
     Such a poor correspondence might suggest instead that the survey data
are very imprecise measures of investors' true expectations. But, in the first
place, it should be noted that findings of unconditional bias are unaffected by
any measurement error in the survey data, provided the error is random. Posi-
tive and negative measurement errors should tend to cancel out, just as posi-
tive and negative prediction errors should tend to cancel out under the null
hypothesis. In the second place, we offer an explicit estimate of the magnitude

    This is the same as saying that the survey prediction errors are of the same sign as the
forward rate errors, but have consistently larger absolute values.
  ° Graphs 1-3 use moving averages across all of the currencies included in the designated
survey. The Amex data in Graph 4 were straightforward averages over the five currencies

of this measurement error component in section 4. In the third place, the
degree to which the surveys qualitatively corroborate one another is striking.
For example, the risk premium in the Economist data (Chart 1) is negative dur-
ing the entire sample, except for a short period from late 1984 until mid-1985.
The MMS three-month sample (Chart 2) reports that the risk premium did not
become positive until the last quarter of 1984, while MMS one-month data
(Chart 3) shows the risk premium then remained positive until mid-1985. That
the surveys agree on the nature and timing of major swings in the risk premium
is some evidence that the particularities of each group of respondents do not
influence the results.
    We can test whether the data statistically reject the hypothesis that the
means of the forward rate prediction errors are attributable entirely to the risk
premia alone, assuming that the surveys measure expectations accurately. The
tests for the significance of the mean survey prediction errors in Table 2 show
that 27 out of 44 samples reject the hypothesis that the survey expectations
are unbiased predictors of the future spot rate. This is a rejection of the
equivalent hypothesis that the systematic component of the forward rate pred-
iction errors is attributable entirely to the risk premium. We can also test
whether the data statistically reject the hypothesis that the errors are attri-
butable entirely to the existence of expectational errors. Table 2 shows that we
can easily reject this hypothesis because the risk premium is significantly
different from zero and of the opposite sign.
    The survey data therefore suggest that an interpretation of the uncondi-
tional bias in the forward rate prediction errors that imposes rational expecta-
tions would lead to consistently incorrect conclusions with respect to the sign
of the risk premium and the nature of its time-series variation. At the opposite
extreme, the systematic portion of the errors could be interpreted solely as evi-

 dence of a failure of rational expectations, but then the forward rate errors
would offer no evidence at all regarding the substantial risk premia recorded in
the survey data. Either interpretation, or any combination of the two, would
miss the fact that the survey risk premium lies in the direction opposite to that
indicated by the results in Table 1, that is, expectational errors are more than
100 percent responsible for the unconditional bias in the forward rate errors.

2.2. Variability of the Risk Premium and Exchange Rate Expectations

       Survey data can also be used to shed some Light on the relative volatility of
expected depreciation and the risk premium. The recent papers by Fama
(1984) and Hodrick and Srivastava (1986) argue that the risk premium is more
variable than expected depreciation or, in the extreme formulation of Bilson
(1965), that expected depreciation is zero. Table 3 shows the variance of
expected changes in the spot rate and the variance of the risk premia, for each
data set and broken down by currency. The magnitude of ex post exchange
rate changes (column (1)) dwarfs that of the forward discount (column (2)).10
For example, the reported variance of annualized spot rate changes of 2 per-
cent represents a standard deviation of about 14 percent. By comparison, the
variance of expected depreciation is around .25 percent. a standard deviation
of 5 percent.

      The variance of expected depreciation is comparable in size to the vari-
ance of the risk premium, and is larger in 36 of the 40 samples calculated in
Table 3. Thus "random walk" expectations are do not appear to be supported
by the survey data. We test formally the Fama (1984) hypothesis that the vari-
ance of expected depreciation is less than the variance of the risk premium in
section 4. Both are several times larger than the variance of the forward
 10   This empirical regularity has often been noted; e.g., Mussa (1979),

 discount. Thus the relative stability of the forward discount masks greater

 variability in its two components, corroborating Fama's finding that the risk
 premium is negatively correlated with the expected change in the spot rate11
       Table 3 also has implications for tests of serial correlation in the forward
 rate errors, fcL — LSg4ft. Such tests have been performed by Hansen and
 Hodrick (1980), Dooley and Shafer (1982) and others. Under the assumption of
 rational expectations, any serially correlated component of the forward rate
 errors would be evidence of a time-varying risk premium. However, the small
 size of the variance of the risk premium compared to the variance of the for-
 ward rate errors (reported in columns (2) and (6) of Table 3, respectively),
 implies that even when the null hypothesis of no serial correlation fails because
 of the risk premium such tests will have low power. Using the assumption of
rational expectations and equation (i), the autocorrelation coefficient of
     —
         t+k converges in probability to:

where p is the probability limit of the corresponding autocorrelation coefficient
of the risk premium. Table 3 suggests that ratio of the variance of the risk
premium to that of the forward rate errors on the righthand-side of equation
(1') has an upper bound of 0.1.12 Thus, even if the the risk premium follows a
random walk, so that p = 1, this ratio implies that the upper bound for the por-
tion of the autocorrelation coefficient of the prediction errors attributable to

     This correlation is, however, biased downward by any measurement error that might
be present in the surveys. If such error is purely random, theniie cnxariance of expected

equals .19, .23 and .08, respectively.

 the risk premium is only 0.1.


 3. USING THE SURVEY DATA IN THE FORWARD RATE UNBIASEDNE5S REGRESSION

     In tests of forward market unbiasedness, attention has focused on the
 optimal weights placed on the forward rate versus the contemporaneous spot
 rate in predicting the future spot rate. The equation most commonly used is a
 regression of the future change in the spot rate on the forward discount:
                                            =   a ÷ pfdk + tt+k
                                                             k
                                                                                                   (2)

 where the null hypothesis is that the weight on the forward rate is one and the
 constant term is zero, i.e., fi = 1 and a = 0. In other words, the realized spot
rate is equal to the forward rate plus a purely random error term. A second but
equivalent specification is a regression of the forward rate prediction error on
the forward discount:

                                   —        = a1 +          + tlt+k                               (2')
where a1 = —a and            = 1—fl.
                                The null hypothesis is now that a1 =                   fl1 = 0:   the
left-hand-side variable is purely random.

      Most tests of equation (2) have rejected the null hypothesis, finding fi to be
significantly less than one. The range of point estimates has been wide, from
about -2.8 to 0.8. Coefficients that are positive, but less than one, imply that
the optimal predictor of the spot rate puts positive weight on both the forward
rate and the contemporaneous spot rate. A coefficient of zero is the random
walk hypothesis: the forward discount is of no help in forecasting future spot
rate changes.13 Least appealing, but nevertheless not unusual, are findings of
  ' Findings of this kind are not limited to investigations of foreign exchange markets. In
their study of the expectations hypothesis of the term structure, for example, Shiller,
Campbell and Schoertholts (1983) conclude that changes in the premium paid on longer-
term bills over short-term bills are useless for predicting future changes in short-term in-

 significant negative coefficients, which indicate that the spot rate tends to move
in the direction opposite to that predicted by the forward discount.
     As in the previous section, tests of equation (2) are joint tests of rational
expectations and no exchange risk premiuim Without other information, how-
ever, researchers have been forced to focus on one alternative hypothesis at
the expense of the other. For example, one could ignore the risk premium and
interpret the forward rate as representing investors' expectations. In this con-
text, Bilson (1981b) proposed that the alternative of     less than one be termed
"excessive speculation", because it would imply that investors could do better
on average if they were to reduce fractionally their forecasts of exchange rate
changes, and that the alternative of f? greater than one be termed "insufficient
speculation", because it would imply that investors could do better if they were
to raise multiplicatively the magnitude of their forecasts of exchange rate
changes.
    The most popular alternative hypothesis in regressions of equations like
(2), however, is that domestic and foreign securities are imperfect substitutes
because of risk. As we have already mentioned, Fama (1984), Hodrick and
Srivastava (1985) and Bilson (1985) argue that coefficients close to zero in such
regressions can be viewed as evidence of a risk premium that, is more variable
than are expectations. By taking probability limits, the slope coefficient      in
equation (2) can be rewritten as:
                        k                             k
           cov(tsg÷k,fdg)                 cov(I.s÷k,fd)
                            =
              var(fd)           var(Es÷k) + 2cov(s:÷,i,) + var(rp)

              var(ts÷k) + cov(ts÷k,rp)

where the second equality follows from assuming rational expectations. If <

 as is usually found, it follows that var(rp) > var(Es÷k). Accordingly, Bilson
 (1985 p. 63) interprets the accumulated results of such regressions as evidence
 that "most of the variation in the [forward] premium reflects variation in the
 risk premium rather than variation in the expected rate of appreciation."
 Indeed, the growing body of evidence that is insignificantly different from zero
 does not permit one to reject the extreme view that expectations are totally
 unrelated to the forward rate, in other words, that all variation in the forward
 discount is attributable solely to variation in the risk premium.

 3.1. Econometric Issues

   Before turning to our own estimates of equation (2). we pause briefly to
mention several important econometric issues.
      Estimation of equation (2) (and most of the equations we estimate later), is
performed using OLS. We stack different countries, and in some cases different
forecast horizons, into a single equation. The complicated correlation pattern
of the residuals, however, renders the OLS standard errors incorrect in finite
samples. Several types of correlation are present.
    First, there is serial correlation induced by a sampling interval shorter
than the corresponding forecast horizon (up to eight times). This is the usual
case in which overlapping ob .vations imply that, under the null hypothesis,
the error term is a moving average process of an order equal to the frequency
of sampling interval divided by the frequency of the horizon, minus one. Han-
sen and Hodrick (1980) propose using a method of moments (MoM) estimator
for the standard errors in precisely the application studied here.

      Second, in order to take advantage of the fact that the surveys covered
four or five currencies simultaneously, we pooled the regressions across coun-
tries. This type of pooling induces contemporaneous correlation in the residu-
                                                 - 14 -

  als.14   Normally. Seemingly Unrelated Regressions should be used to exploit this
  correlation efficiently. We use SUR later; here, however, the serial correlation
  induced by overlapping observations makes SUR inconsistent.
       The basic model may be written as:
                                            k = k
                                                 t
                                                 -k .P + v
                                                          k
                                                                                              (4)

 where k is the number of periods in the forecast horizon and i indexes the
 currency. We account for the two types of correlation in the residuals with a
 MoM estimate of the covariance matrix of :

                                    =
                                                                                             (4')
 where          is the matrix of regressors of size N (countries) times T (time). The
 (i,j)th element of the unrestricted covariance matrix, ci is:

                1
           =          E E gj7g_17 for
               NT—k
                                                                         n=0,.       ,N—1


           =0       otherwise.                                                               (5)
where r is the order of the MA process,                   is the OLS residual, and k = li—i
In some cases, this unrestricted estimate of C) uses well over 100 degrees of

freedom.15 We therefore estimated a restricted covariance matrix, C) with typi-
cal element:
                                    N
                            1
(t+iT. f—k +pT) =
                           N—i
                                    E c,(t+1T, f—k +pT) if A = p and —r k              r

                                        N-iN-I
                                2
                       =                E E w(t +It, t—k+pT) if            and
                           N(N—1) p=Oi=O
   14 Each
           currency in our pooled regressions was given its own constant term. This model-
3flg sta-ategy seemed most reasonable in view of the dilTerences across currencies in the
magnitudes of both ex post spot rate changes and the forward discount (see Table 1).
   15 The
          number of independent parameters in the covariance matrix does not affect the
asymptotic covariance, as long as these rarameters are estimated consistently (see Hansen
                                                 - 15 -

                        =0         otherwise                                                      (6)

These restrictions have the effect of averaging the own-currency and cross-
currency autocorrelation functions of the OLS residuals, respectively, bringing
the number of independent covariance parameters down to 2r.
      Tests of forward discount unbiasedness also provide an opportunity to
aggregate across different forecast horizons (though we are unaware of anyone
who has done this, even with the standard forward discount data), adding a
third pattern of correlation in the residuals. Such stacking seems appropriate
in this case because we wish to study the predictive power of the forward
discount generally, rather than at any particular time horizon. Moreover, a
MoM estimator which incorporates several forecast horizons has appeal beyond
the particular application studied here because it is computationally simpler
than competing techniques and at the same time can be more efficient than sin-
gle k-step-ahead forecasting equations estimated with MoM.
      To demonstrate the precise nature of the correlation induced by such
aggregation, consider the stochastic process, ,                       which    is stationary and
ergodic in first differences and has finite second moments. We denote the k
period change in y from period f—k to t as y, and the h period change as
     n-i
   =        where h = nk for any positive integer n16 We then define the
        =0

innovations,    v and        as:
                                       k     k            k
                                     v =Y —E(yj                                                   (7)

(1982)). Nevertheless, one suspects that the small-sample properties of the MoM estimator
worsen as the number of nuisance parameters to be estimated increases,
   16 The
          following example can easily be generalized to allow h and k to be any positive
integers. It is also possible to combine iii a similar fashion more than two diflerent forecast
horizons. Indeed, we combine three horizons in the Economist data estimates in the regres-
sions below. Because these extensions yield no additional insights and come at the cost of
more complicated algebra, however, we retain the simple example above.
                                              - 16 -

                                     = Yg      E( y pt—h)
 where       includes present and lagged values of the vector of right-hand-side
 variables, z. These facts allow us to write the covariance matrix of the innova-
 tions as:
                                     k
                                v                          11k hk

where the (i,j)th element of each submtrix of E is equal to the corresponding
 autocovariance function, evaluated at q =         i   —



             = E( VtV+q) =    if q I <k
                                 1
                                                                             (9)
                         = 0 otherwise,


         tSjE(l1g?VI+g)Xqhif qcZh
                        =0   otherwise

             =E(VL/g'+g)=Xqif0q<k                                           (10)
             = E( v14'q) =     if —h <q <0
                         = 0 otherwise

In this context consider the aggregated model:

                                     y=xtP4-Vt                              (ii)
where Yg' [y÷ Y+h'1' z' [zr'             x] and
                                              [v' V7+h'J. The OLS estimate
of then has the usual MoM estimate of the sample covariance matrix:

                      a = (x2NTx2NT) xEx(xx)
                                         —1                         —1



where is a consistent estimate of E, and is formed by using the OLS residuals
to estimate the autocovariance and crosscovariance functions in equations (9)
and (10).

    One might think that by stacking forecast horizons, as we do in equation
(ii), greater asymptotic efficiency always results than if only the shorter-term
                                             - 17 -

forecasts are used, in other words, that              —   2 is positive semidefinite. After
all, the sample size has doubled, and the only additional estimates we require
are nuisance parameters of the covariance matrix. This intuition would be
correct for asymptotically efficient estimation strategies, such as maximum
likelihood. But because OLS weights each observation equally, the MoM covari-
ance estimates reflect the average precision of the data. it follows that if the
longer-term forecasts are sufficiently imprecise relative to the shorter-term
forecasts, the precision of the estimate of fi              drops:   we could actually j
efficiency by adding more data. In the appendix we demonstrate this potential
loss in asymptotic efficiency, and show how it is related to the disparity in fore-
cast horizons. Efficiency is most likely to increase if the longer-term forecast
horizon is a relatively small multiple of the shorter-term horizon, indeed, in the
forthcoming regressions we find a marked increase in precision from stacking
across forecast horizons when r = 2 (in the Economist and Amex samples), but
little or no increase in precision when r = 4 or 6 (in the MMS samples).

      Finally, the above MoM estimates of the covariance matrix need not be
positive definite in small samples. Newey and West (1985) offer a corrected esti-
mate of the covariance matrix that discounts the jth order autocovariance by
1—   (ji(,n+1)), making the covariance matrix positive definite in finite sample.
Nevertheless, for any given sample size, there remains the question of how small
in must be to guarantee positive definiteness. In the upcoming regressions we
tried in = r (which Newey and West themselves suggest) and in = 2r; we report
standard errors using the latter value of in because they were consistently
larger than those using the former.17

  17 For the two aggregated MMS data sets in Table 8 below, a value of in = r was used
after finding that in = 2r resulted in a nonpositive semi-definite covariance matrix This
correction reduced the standard errors in these two regressions by an average of only 3
percent.

 32. Results

        Table 4 presents the standard forward discount unbiasedness regressions
 (equation (2)) for our sample periods.18 Most of the coefficients fall into the
 range reported by previous studies. Note that in the Economist and Amex data
 sets, in which forecasts horizons were stacked, the standard errors fell in the
 aggregated regressions by 14 and 31 percent, respectively, in comparison with
 regressions that used the shorter-term predictions alone. In terms of the point
 estimates, all but one of the data sets indicate that the optimal predictor of the
 future spot rate places negative weight on the forward rate, and more than half
 of the coefficients are significantly less than zero. There is ample evidence to
reject unbiasedness. In the two MMS data sets, which cover shorter sample
periods of 14 and 21 months, respectively, the coefficients have unusually large
absolute values, lending support to the observation by Gregory and McCurdy
(1984) that the regression relation in equation (2) may be unstable. The F-tests
also indicate that the unbiasedness hypothesis fails in most of the data sets.
        At this point, we could interpret the results as reflecting systematic pred-
iction errors. Under this interpretation, it follows that agents would do better
by placing more weight on the contemporaneous spot rate and less weight on
other factors in forming predictions of the future spot rate, the view discussed
by Bilson (1981b). On the other hand, we could interpret the results as evi-
dence of a time-varying risk premium. Then the conclusions would be that
changes in expected depreciation are not correlated (or are negatively corre-
lated) with changes in the forward discount and, from equation (3), that the
variance of the risk premium is greater than the variance of expected deprecia-
tion.
    Regressions were estimated with dummies for each country, which we do not report to
save space. For the regressions which pool over different forecast horizons (marked
Economist Data and Amex Data), each country was allowed its own constant term for every
forecast horizon.

3.3. Decomposition ot the Forward Discount Bias Coefficient

     The survey data, however, let us go a step further with the results of Table
4: we can now allocate part of the deviation from the null hypothesis of = 1 to
each of the alternatives: failure of rationality and the presence of a risk prem-
ium. Using the fact that the (log) forward discount can be written as the sum of
expected depreciation plus the risk premiurn,
                                                    e
                                      fdft =            + rpgft                (12)

we can decompose the probability limit of the coefficient in equation (2) into:

little algebra, can then be written as equal to 1 (the null hypothesis) minus a
term arising from any failure of rational expectations, minus another term aris-
ing from the risk premium:

                                                                              (14)

With the help of the survey data, both terms are observable. By inspection,
   = 0 if there are no systematic prediction errors in the sample, and       = 0 if
there is no risk premium (or, somewhat more weakly, if the risk premium is
uncorrelated with the forward discount).

     The results of the decomposition are reported in Table 5a. First, ,8, is very

large in size when compared to ,, often by more than an order of magnitude.
In all of the regressions, the lion's share of the deviation from the null
hypothesis consists of systematic expectational errors. For example, in the
Economist data, our largest survey sample with 525 observations,       = 1.49 and
    = 0.08.   Second, while     is greater than zero in all cases,   is sometimes
negative, implying in equation (14) that the effect of the survey risk premium is
to push the estimate of the standard coefficient in the direction above one. In
these cases, the risk premia do not explain a positive share of the forward
discount's bias. The positive values for , on the other hand, suggest the pos-
sibility that investors tended to overreact to other information, in the sense
that respondents might have improved their forecasting by placing more weight
on the contemporaneous spot rate and less weight on the forward rate. Third,
to the extent that the surveys are from different sources and cover different
periods of time, they provide independent information, rendering their agree-
ment on the relative importance and sign of the expectational errors all the
more forceful. To check if the level of aggregation in Table 5a is hiding impor-
tant diversity across currencies, Table Sb reports the decomposition for each
currency in every data set. Here the results are the same: expectational errors
are consistently large and pusitive, and the risk premium appears to explain no
positive portion of the bias.

    While the qualitative results above are of interest, we would like to know
whether they are statistically significant, whether we can formally reject the
two obvious polar hypotheses: a) that the results in Table 4 are attributable
entirely to expectational errors; and b) that they are attributable entirely to
the presence of the risk premium in the survey data. We test these hypotheses
in turn in the following sections.

4. A Direct Test of Perfect Substitutability

      We consider first a test of whether the bias introduced by the risk prem-
ium. p,,.   is   statistically significant. The most direct test is a regression of the
survey expected depreciation against the forward discount:


                                          = a2 + 2fd + e2g                                     (17)

where the null hypothesis is that no risk premium separates the two, a2 = 0 and
    = 1. Strictly speaking, the expected future spot rate exactly equals the for-
ward rate if assets are perfect substitutes, so that we should interpret the
regression error     as measurement error in the surveys. Thus,
     = iS + 2t' where t+k is the unobservable "true" market expected
change in the spot rate. Note that if the null hypothesis holds, we can use the
R2 from equation (17) to obtain an estimate of the relative importance of the
measurement error component in the survey data.19
      To see that a test of         = 1 is equivalent to a test of           = 0, note that the

 Equation (19) says that if p2 is significantly greater than , the variance of
 expected depreciation exceeds that of the risk prerriium. The qualitative
 finding in Table 3, column (6). that the variance of expected depreciation is the
 greater can thus be tested formally. Although measurement error in the survey
 data would tend to overstate both of these variances, it does not affect the esti-
mate of their difference (equation (19)). This point is evident from equation
(17), in which the measurement error e2 is conditionally independent of the
estimate of as long as it is random, i.e., E(2g fd) = 0.

      Under mild assumptions, equation (17) may also be interpreted as a direct
test of uncovered interest parity. If we rule out the presence of riskiess arbi-
trage opportunities, then by covered interest parity the forward discount
exactly equals the excess return paid on domestic securities relative to foreign
securities:

where       and       are the domestic and foreign interest rates on instruments
which mature in k periods. Uncovered interest parity is thus the hypothesis
that the interest differential equivalent to investors' expectations of future

 MMS    three-month sample). In the Economist and Amex data sets which aggre-
 gate across time horizons, the estimates are 0.99 and 0.96, respectively.21
 Expectations seem to move very strongly with the forward rate. With the excep-
 tion of the MMS data, the coefficients are estimated with surprising precision.
 As we might expect, however, the large magnitudes of the risk premia discussed
 in section 2 cause us to reject perfect substitutability. Each of the F-tests
 reported in Table 6 rejects the parity relation at a level of significance that is
 less than 0.1 percent.

     In terms of our decomposition of the forward discount bias coefficient,
 Table 6 shows the values of j9,., in column 2 of Table 5a are not significantly
 different from zero. Thus the rejection of unbiasedness found in the previous
 section cannot be explained entirely by the risk premium at any reasonable
 level of confidence. Indeed, in spite of the fact that the survey risk premium
has substantial magnitude (Table 2), we cannot reject the hypothesis that the
risk premium explains no positive portion of the bias.
      Table 6 also reports a t-test of the hypothesis that                  =   }. In six out of
nine cases the data strongly reject the hypothesis that the variance of the true
risk premium is greater than or equal to that of true expected depreciation; we
have rather var(ACk) > var(). In addition, equation (16) and the finding
that = 1 together imply that:
                                             Th
                               var(rp) + cov(Asrp) = 0
Thus we cannot reject the hypothesis that the covariance of true expected
depreciation and the true risk premium is negative (as Fama found), nor can we
  21 For
         the Economist six-month and twelve-month and the Amex twelve-month data sets,
the estimates of ft2 from equation (1?) do not exactly correspond to 1 — ft in Tables   ba
and 5b, This is because Table 6 includes a few survey observations for whicffactual future
spot rates have not yet been realized, whereas these observations were left out of the
decomposition in Tables 5a and 5b for purposes of comparability. If we had used the small-
er samples in Table 6, the regression coefficients would have been .92 and 1,03, for the
Economist and Amex data sets, respectively.

reject the extreme hypothesis that the variance of the true risk premium is
zero.
                            -
      Note that the R 2,
                      s in Table 6 are relatively high. Under the null hypothesis
that true expected depreciation exactly equals the forward discount, one could
interpret these results as evidence that the measurement-error component of
the survey data is relatively small. For example, under this interpretation of
the     statistics, measurement error accounts for about 10 percent of the vari-
ability in expected depreciation from the Economist survey.22 The presence of a
time-varying risk premium uncorrelated with the forward discount, however.
implies that the disturbance term,                will riot be purely measurement error
but will also include variation of the risk premium around its mean. In this case
a second interpretation of the R2 measure is possible: that it overstates the
measurement error component of the surveys. Indeed, the low values of the
Durbin-Watson statistics reported in Table 6 seem to suggest the presence in
the OLS residuals of a risk premium which is serially correlated but uncorre-
lated with the forward discount.
      In Table 7 we correct for the potential serial correlation problem by
employing a Three-Stage-Least-Squares estimator that allows for contem-
poraneous correlation (SUR) as well as first order auto-regressive distur-
bances.23 3SLS is consistent here because there are no overlapping observa-
tions -- predictions by the forward rate and the surveys are observed contem-
poraneously -- and it has the advantage of being asymptotically efficient. The
results reported in Table 7 show that this correction does not change the
nature of the results; all but one of the coefficients remain close to one, and

     Recall, however, that the Ff2 measures in Table 6 include the explanatory power of the
constant terms for each currency and forecast horizon.
     Unfortunately, the highly irregular spacing of the Amex data sets did not permit an
auto-regressive correction in this case.

there is clear evidence that the variance of expected depreciation is greater
than that of the risk premium (while there is no evidence for the alternative
that the variance of the risk premium is greater).

5. Tests of Rational Expectations
      In this section we test to see whether the interpretation of the standard
bias findings in section 3 as evidence of systematic prediction errors can be
supported. While in section 2 we found evidence that investors err in their
unconditional forecasts of future changes in the spot rate, here we focus
instead on whether investors tend to place too little weight on the contem-
poraneous spot rate and too much on all other information. Tests of rational
expectations which address this question typically regress future prediction
errors of the forward discount on subsets of the contemporaneous information
set. As we have already noted, these tests are only valid in the absence of a risk
premium.. Consequently, we use here the prediction errors of the survey data
instead.

5.1. A Test of Excessive Speculation
     Perhaps the most powerful test of rational expectations is one which asks
whether investors would do better if they placed more or less weight on the
contemporaneous spot rate as opposed to .fl other variables in their informa-
tion set.24 This test is performed by a regression of the expectational prediction
error on expected depreciation:
                                    —        =a+              + Vt+k                            (20)

where the null hypothesis is a = 0 and d = 0.25 This is the equation that Bilson
     Frankel and Froot (1986) test whether the survey expectations place too little weight
on the contemporaneous spot rate and too much weight on specific pieces of information
such as the lagged spot rate, the long-run equilibrium exchange rate, and the lagged ex-
pected spot rate.
     To see how the alternative in equation (20)is too much or too little weight on all vari-
ables in the information set other than the contemporaneous spot rate, assume expecta-
                                                 - 26 -


 (1961b) and others had in mind, which we already termed a test of "excessive'
 speculation, with the dierence that we are measuring expected depreciation
 by the survey data instead of by the ambiguous forward discount.
       Our tests are reported in Table 8. The findings consistently indicate that
 ci > 0, so that investors could on average do better by giving more weight to the
 contemporaneous spot rate and less weight to other information they deem
 pertinent. In other words, the excessive speculation hypothesis is upheld. F-
 tests of the hypothesis that there are no systematic expectational errors,
 a = ci = 0, reject at the one percent level for all of the survey data sets.
      The results in Table 8 would appear to constitute a resounding rejection of
rationality in the survey expectations. Up until this point, our test statistics
have been robust to the presence of random measurement error in the survey
data. But now, under the null hypothesis, measurement error biases toward
one our estimate of d in equation (20). The test of d = 0, therefore, may reject
more easily than the usual probability values would imply. To demonstrate this
efTect, suppose that expected depreciation as recorded by the survey is equal
to the market's true expectation,                  plus an error term:

                                                = S1÷k +                                         (21)
where          is iid and E(E st°k) = 0. The actual spot rate change can then be
expressed as the sum of the true market expectation plus a prediction error:

tions are formed as a linear combination of the current spot rate, S, and any linear coinbi-
nation of variables in the information set, l:
                                       =       + (i—ii-1)s
If the actual process is:
                                   = 112; + (1—ir2)s —
                                                           v+k
Then equation (20) can be rewritten as
                   LSg÷
                           —       = a + (ira — 1r2)(It — s) + 't+k                      (20')
Rational expectations is the case in which the coefficient 7T — 112 is zero, A positive value
implies 71 > 712: investors put insufficient weight on S and too much weight on other in-
formation.

Using these facts, the coefficient d in equation (20) converges in probability to:

                                var(E) —
                           ci = —————————             —

                                    var() + var(Ask)
Measurement error therefore biases our OLS estimates toward one. Indeed, in
the limiting case in which the measurement error accounts for all of the varia-
bility of expected depreciation in the survey -- in other words, no information
at all about the "true" market expectation is contained in the surveys -- the
parameter estimate would be statistically indistinguishable from one. In Table
8, 13 of 15 estimates of ci are greater than one; in five cases the difference is
statistically significant. This result suggests that measurement error is not the
source of our rejection of rational expectations. However, we shall now see that
stronger evidence can be obtained.

5.2. Another Test of Excessive Speculation

     One way to get around this added source of noise is to use the projection of
the survey expectations onto investors' information set as the right-hand-side
variable in equation (20). Thus we seek a proxy for the survey expectations.
The candidate must be highly correlated with the survey expected depreciation,
and conditionally independent of the measurement error, E(E Jfd) = 0. In
view of the results from section 4, the forward discount seems eminently
qualified. The usual instrumental variables estimation procedure is not neces-
sary in this case because the null hypothesis is that d 0. Thus we run the OLS
regression:
                              —
                                  Sg+k   a1 +      + 1.t+k                   (24)
and perform a test of rationality, a1       = 0.

     Equation (24) has additional relevance in the context of our decomposition
 of the forward rate unbiasedness regression in section 3: the coefficient, fi1,       is
precisely equal to the deviation from unbiasedness due to systematic prediction
errors, fi,.. Thus equation (24) can tell us whether the large positive values of
fi,. found in column (1), Tables 5a and 5b are statistically significant.

     Table 9 reports OLS regressions of equation (24). We now see that the point
estimates of fi,. in Tables 5a and 5b are measured with precision. The data con-
tinue to reject statistically the hypothesis of rational expectations,
a1 = 0,   fi1
                = 0. They reject fi1 = 0, in favor of the alternative of excessive specu-

lation. (Because the measurement error has been purged, the levels of
significance are necessarily lower than those of Table 8.) Thus the result that
    is significantly greater than zero seems robust across different forecast
horizons and different survey samples. In terms of the decomposition of the
typical forward rate unbiasedness test in Table 5a, we can now reject the
hypothesis that all of the bias is attributable to the survey risk premium. Put
differently, even after allowing for measurement error, it is still not possible to
reject the hypothesis that all the bias consists of repeated expectational errors
made by survey respondents, and that no positive portion of the bias can attri-
buted to the survey risk premium.

6. CONCLUSIONS


(1) The survey data indicate that forward rate prediction errors do not give
insight into the nature of the risk premia as commonly thought. In all three
surveys, the errors exhibit unconditional bias of a sign opposite to estimates of
the risk premium from the survey data. The prernia are large in absolute value,
and are statistically different from zero. We can reject the hypothesis that sys-
tematic unconditional mistakes made by the forward rate in predicting the
future spot rate are due entirely to a failure of rational expectations. But at
the other extreme, the hypothesis that the forward rate prediction errors can
be explained by the risk premium alone is also rejected.

(2) Expected depreciation is more variable than both the forward discount and
the risk premium. The first finding corroborates Fama's (1984) conjecture that
expected depreciation and the risk premium are negatively correlated. The
second finding rejects the hypothesis that the variance of expected deprecia-
tion is less than the variance of the risk premium, let alone the more extreme
random-walk hypothesis that the variance of expected depreciation is zero.

(3) Direct tests of perfect substitutability across assets denominated in
different currencies produce mixed results. We find evidence against a time-
varying risk premium, in the respect that changes in expected depreciation are
on average matched, one for one, with changes in the forward discount. In
terms of point (2). changes in the forward discount appear to be unrelated to
changes in risk. The hypothesis of no risk premium fails in our regressions.
however, because the level of expected depreciation is significantly different
from the forward discount by a constant term. In short, while the survey data
do support the existence of a substantial risk premium, they suggest that the
many previous citations of forward discount bias as evidence for the exchange
                                      - 30 -

risk premium may have been misplaced.


(4) While changes in the forward discount reflect changes in expected deprecia-
tion, they seem to be, if anything, negatively related to future spot rate
changes. Significantly negative coefficients in regression tests of forward
discount unbiasedness, a common finding in many previous tests, are also found
here. The survey data indicate that this large and significant deviation from
unbiasedness is overwhelmingly due to repeated forecasting mistakes made by
survey respondents. As in the unconditional case in point (1), we are unable to
reject the hypothesis that the conditional deviation from unbiasedness is due
entirely to a failure of rational expectations. We    able   to reject the compet-
ing hypothesis that the deviation from unbiasedness is purely a consequence of
the risk premium. The implication is that, when forming their expectations,
investors would do better to put more weight on the contemporaneous spot
rate, and less weight on all other variables on which they rely. This is the same
result that Bilson and many others have found with forward market data; but
now it cannot be attributed to a risk premium.

     In this appendix we show how the asymptotic efficiency of the method-of-
moments estimator is affected by aggregating over forecast horizons. Consider
the model:

                                              =   ft        ft
                                                       +                                (Al)

where        =        — and the error term is orthogonal to the present and past
values of z and y, E(÷ft                                          ) = 0. Our example below
considers the simple case of a single regressor, x, but may easily be extended
to a vector of righthand-side variables. Define the lid innovations                       =

best unbiased forecast of Yg÷ft That is, under the null hypothesis of forward

These facts imply that the Jc and h period prediction errors,                                                and
respectively, are stationary with finite second moments. If we assume that

E(qgqg) = 0 for ,i. k, and E(qhh

as a k —1 order moving average process:

Similarly,    from equation (AZ') we have that q may be written as a h —1 order

Using     equation (A4), the covariance generating function for                                      can be written
as:

where    X'(z) is a complicated generating function of the as's and ci's which we
need not specify here. Finally, the covariance generating function, X'(z) =
   h—i h—I

a   L1    L1 a5d,+5   can be rewritten as:

where X2(z) is another generating function of the as's and c1's.
     Now consider the asymptotic MoM covariance matrix of 'JT(p — ) from
equation (Al):

                                           &   = (x:i-2 Aa()                              (A7)

                       7'

where k =        T
                  —1        kk If we add- in the longer-term forecast data, our model

is that of equation (11) above, with asymptotic covariance matrix:

                            =   (x.   + x)2 (Xd(z) + Xa(Z)            + 2X(z))            (A8)

By substitution, we have that & >                if   and only if:


                                               —1+——                                      (A9)



                                                      Xa(z)÷xc(z)+2(XacI(z)+xac2(z))_X:
    >fl 23f1+ _____ +n33+ ____-                  +
                                        X(z)                               XU(z)

Equation (A9) says that the variance of the longer-term data, X, must increase
at a rate the same as or greater than the relative forecasting interval, n, if we
are to gain by adding longer-term forecasts to data sets of only shorter-term
forecasts. Thus as the forecasting interval increases, we require correspond-
                                           - 34 -

 ingly greater variability of the regressors in order to compensate for the
 greater variability of the forecast errors.
       One might think that the result in equation (A9) is a consequence of
 weighting the more imprecise longer-term predictions equally with the predic-
 tions of shorter-term. Perhaps if we downweighted the longer-term data, we
 would always gain in efficiency. It turns out that this is not the case. In the
 remaining space, we construct a consistent, optimally weighted estimator and
 show that the efficiency of this estimator may still worsen asymptotically by
 adding in the longer-term forecasts.
       In most circumstances, GLS represents the optimal weighting strategy
 when the data have different levels of precision. GLS is, however, inconsistent
when used on a model with overlapping observations. Thus we consider instead
 a weighted least squares estimator which is optimal within a class of consistent
estimators. Consider a transformation of the model in equation (ii), which
stacks the shorter- and longer-term data:

                                 Wy = Wxfl+           Wv1                    (AlO)
where W is a diagonal matrix. The MoM estimate of in equation (Alo), , will
be consistent for any arbitrary diagonal matrix W. To see this, note that the
MoM estimate of equation (Alo), P may be written as:


        I7 (, — p)      Xr' Wx
                            ——             XT
                                                                            (All)

                            27    —1
                                           27
                        1   22 —
                     = — zi w1         1               2
                                             z1   v
The   final term in equation (All) converges in probability to zero, provided that
the error term in equation (Alo) is conditionally independent of the contem-
                                           - 35 -


poraneous   value of the regressor, E(v x) = 0 (this is just the Gauss-Markov
assumption required for the consistency of OLS in estimating equation (AiD)).
Suppose now that we choose W optimally in order to maximize the gain in
efficiency from adding longer-term forecasts to our shorter-term data. That is:
                                     max
                                                                               (A12)

where     is the MoM asymptotic covariance matrix of

                      =                                                        (A13)

By normalizing the weight on every shorter-term data point to one, it is
straightforward to show that the optimal weight placed on each longer-term
observation is:
                                     ha             kad
                                    X0X    (z)—X0X——
                                                  (z)
                                =                                              (A14)
                                    xxd(z) —XX(z)
Note that         will always be positive if the data sets are uncorrelated, i.e. if
X(z) = 0. In other words, appropriately weighted independent information
can always improve efficiency, no matter how imprecise the new information
may be. But, the nature of the correlation between contemporaneous longer-
term and shorter-term predictions implies that the optimal weight given to
longer-term data may be zero. In particular, Wh will be zero if the numerator in
equation (A14) becomes negative. This occurs if n is too large in comparison
with the relative variance of the longer-term forecasts. Using equations (AS').
(AG) and (AlA), it can be shown that a sufficient condition for     to be zero is:

                                    (n+i)     > ——.                           (Ai5)
                                       2

Thus, while the standard errors reported in the text indicate that for small
values of n one may obtain improvements in efficiency, this result is not likely
                                      - 36 -

to apply MoM estimation of data with considerably
                                                  longer forecast horizons,
even when the data are downweighted to account for the greater variance of
the longer-term forecast errors. It is worth stressing in closing that this poten-
tial loss in efficiency is a direct consequence of our limited information MoM
estimation strategy. Full information techniques, such as maximum likelihood
estimation, will consistently achieve nonzero gains in asymptotic efficiency with
the addition of longer-term data.
