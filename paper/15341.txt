                                            ABSTRACT

Incomes per capita have grown dramatically over the past two centuries, but the increase has been
unevenly spread across time and across the world. Growth accounting is the principal quantitative
tool for understanding this phenomenon, and for assessing the prospects for further increases in living
standards. This paper sets out the general growth accounting model, with its methods and assumptions,
and traces its evolution from a simple index-number technique that decomposes economic growth
into capital-deepening and productivity components, to a more complex account of the growth process.
In the more complex account, capital and productivity interact, both are endogenous, and quality change
in inputs and output matters. New developments in micro-level productivity analysis are also reviewed,
and the long-standing question of net versus gross output as the appropriate indicator of economic
growth is addressed.

                                            I. Introduction

        World income per capita increased from $651 in 1820 to $5,145 in 1992,

according to estimates by Maddison (1995). Though spectacular compared to the

negligible 15 percent gain during the preceding three centuries, this eight fold increase

was not shared uniformly. Income per capita in Western Europe and its offshoots grew

by a factor of 15, while the rest of the world experienced only a six-fold increase. This

general pattern continues to this day, with some notable exceptions in Asia. The

unevenness of the growth experience is also evident within specific countries over time.

Output per hour in the U.S. private business sector grew at a robust annual rate of 3.3

percent from 1948 to 1973, then slowed to 1.6 percent per year between 1973 and

1995, and then picked up to 2.6 percent from 1995 to 2007 (U.S. Bureau of Labor

Statistics Multifactor Productivity Program).

 This review builds on, and expands, my 2001 survey of the topic. As with any survey, space
considerations limit the material than can be covered and choices have been made with which others
may quibble. A survey of the growth accounting field is particularly hard because of the nature of the
field, which aims to provide a summary measure of the determinants of economic growth and therefore
links a large number of other research areas. For example, the econometric side of productivity analysis
has largely been omitted, and will be touched upon only in so far as it affects growth accounting. The
same is true of growth theory, and the reader may wish to consult the general treatment of that subject by
Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1995) and many of the articles in the Handbook of Economic Growth. Other
areas, like the economics of R&D, the measurement of service sector output, the information technology
revolution, and the determinants of the productivity slowdown of the 1970s and 1980s, do not get the full
attention they would deserve in a longer treatise. Perhaps the greatest omission is my decision to focus
on growth accounting in an economy that is closed to international trade. This choice is made because of
the great complexity that trade adds to the problem, and not because international income flows are
unimportant. The ultimate problem is that the proper treatment of trade flows requires a different national
income accounting structure than the ones currently in place (see, for an example of the complexity
involved, Reinsdorf and Slaughter (2006)). The interested reader is also referred to the important paper
by Diewert and Morrison (1986).

Like its 2001 predecessor, this survey is a somewhat personal view of the field, stressing its core
technical evolution rather than specific applications or numerical estimates (different theories give
different numbers). The reader is directed to the surveys by Barro (1999), Griliches (1996, 2000),
Jorgenson (2005), and the OECD manual on productivity measurement, for other recent treatments of the
subject. Anyone wishing to delve further into the history of the field will be rewarded by reading Solow
(1988), Maddison (1987), Jorgenson, Gollop, and Fraumeni (1987), Brown (1966), and Nadiri (1970).

        Income per capita and the closely related output per worker are key determinants

of national living standards, and the field of growth accounting evolved as an attempt to

explain these historical patterns. It grew out of the convergence of national income

accounting and growth theory, and, in its simplest national income form, it is a rather

straightforward exercise in which the growth rate of real GDP per capita is decomposed

into separate capital formation and productivity effects.2 The unevenness of growth

rates over time and across countries can then be traced to these two general sources,

providing insights into the nature of the growth process.

        This is the simple story of growth analysis. A more complex tale has emerged

over time as data and computing power have improved, and economic theory has

evolved. In the process, growth accounting has itself changed, and this evolution is the

story told in this chapter. The essay is organized into three main sections: Section II

devoted to the basic growth accounting framework; Section III covering the

measurement of the key variables; and Section IV devoted the last to a critique of the

growth accounting method. Several cross-cutting themes resurface throughout these

sections: the role of economic theory in determining the appropriate form of the growth

account and the related index number problem, and the issue of ‘path independence.’

Other issues also appear in multiple contexts: the question of whether capital formation

and innovation can be treated as separate phenomena, the distinction between product

and process innovation and the associated problem of output and input quality change,

and the basic issue of whether growth accounting is supposed to measure changes in

2
  As with many ideas in economics, the dichotomy appears in a rudimentary form in Adam Smith.
Kendrick starts his seminal work on U.S. productivity growth with the following lines from Smith: “The
annual produce of the land and labour of any nation can be increased in its value by no other means, but
by increasing either the number of its productive labourers, or the productive powers of those labourers
who had before been employed …“ (quoted from Kendrick (1961), page 3).

consumer welfare or changes in the supply-side constraints of an economy. Answers to

these questions, however imperfect given the current state of the art, help illuminate the

nature and boundaries of the growth accounting method and the interpretation of the

results.

                                     II. The Growth Accounting Model

                                      A. The Basic Aggregate Model

1. Origins. Growth accounts are a natural byproduct of the basic national accounting

identity which relates the aggregate value of the final goods and services produced in a

country (gross domestic product (GDP)) to the total value of the labor and capital used

to produce the output (gross domestic income (GDI)). Using more or less standard

notation for output, labor and capital, and the corresponding prices, the accounting

identity takes the following form:


    (1)          p t Q t = wt L t + c t K t .


The simplicity of this formulation conceals the complexity and effort actually involved in

measuring and reconciling GDP and GDI, and the development of these estimates is

one of the great achievements of economic science. Though measures of national

income can be traced back to the late 17th century, the development of comprehensive

national accounts is a relatively recent event and reflects the conceptual efforts of

Simon Kuznets, Richard Stone, Richard Ruggles, and many others (Kendrick (1995)).3



3
   It is noteworthy that a group of economists, statisticians, and national accountants came together in the
later 1930s to form the Conference on Research in Income and Wealth, with Simon Kuznets as the first
chairman and Milton Friedman as secretary. The CRIW provided a forum in which many of the
conceptual issues involved in setting up a national account were discussed. The conference proceedings
were published in the volumes of the Studies in Income and Wealth Series, and they provide a valuable
insight into the complexity of the national accounting undertaking (many of the issues on the table then


                                                     3
The U.S. national income accounts date from 1947, while the United Nation’s System of

National Accounts was published in 1953.

        The study of economic growth requires estimates of GDP and GDI that control

for price inflation. Most accounts therefore provide estimates of GDP in constant prices,

but a parallel adding-up identity between real GDP and real GDI is only possible for the

base (comparison) year in which all prices are normalized to one. If there is a change in

the efficiency with which inputs are used, the real GDP identity cannot hold in

subsequent years (if the same quantity of input produces ever more output, valuing

output at fixed prices will break the identity). An additional term is needed to account for

this possibility, which, in the simplest case takes the form


 (2)            p 0Q t = T t [ w0 Lt + c0 K t ] .


Rearranging this expression shows that the variable Tt is a scalar index that can be

interpreted as the level of real output per unit of total input. The equation is also a

rudimentary form of a growth account, since real output is decomposed into a real input

effect [w0Lt + c0Kt] and a productivity effect Tt. The index Tt calculated in this way is a

residual that sweeps in many things, a feature that led Abramovitz (1956) to bestow on

it the title “a measure of our ignorance.”

        This form of the proto-growth accounting model is based on simple linear index

numbers and is very close to the underlying data. The formulation is largely

atheoretical, except for the theory implicit in the assumptions that statisticians use in

their measurement procedures. This atheoretical approach can be justified by an



are still there, in one form or another). The CRIW continues its work, and the conference proceedings
now run to almost seventy volumes.


                                                    4
appeal to the axiomatic index number theory, that is, by the kind of rules and “tests”

advocated by Irving Fisher (1927) and his followers.

       However, the simplicity achieved by imposing a minimum of economic structure

comes at a substantial cost. Why is a linear index number formulation desirable? What

types of technical change are envisioned for the index Tt? What variables are

appropriately included in the growth account and in what form? Without some

theoretical foundation, there are no firm criteria for constructing any type of growth

account. There is little help, in this regard, from axiomatic index numbers other than a

set of “reasonable” (though somewhat arbitrary) “tests” and rules. It was against this

backdrop that the 1957 paper by Robert Solow made its seminal contribution.



2. The Solow Residual. The seminal paper by Solow (1957) provided the economic

structure missing from the axiomatic approach (Griliches (1996)). Rather than

appealing to some implicit production function to interpret the index Tt, his model starts

with an explicit function and derives the implied index. This involves several

assumptions: that there is a stable functional relation between inputs and output at the

economy-wide level of aggregation; that this function has neoclassical smoothness and

curvature properties, that inputs are paid the value of their marginal product, that the

function exhibits constant returns to scale, and that technical change has the Hicks’-

neutral form:


(3)         Qt = At F(Kt,Lt) .




                                             5
The variable At plays the same conceptual role as the index Tt, that is, as a measure of

output per unit input, but it now has an explicit interpretation as a shift in the production

function. Changes in output due to growth in inputs are interpreted as movements

along the function F(Kt,Lt).

          Tt is an index number while At is a parameter of the production function. What

Solow did was to show how to measure At as an index number, that is, using

observable prices and quantities alone without imposing the assumptions needed for

econometric analysis.4 The first step in this derivation is to express the production

function in growth rate form.


                 Q& t   ∂Q K t K& t ∂Q Lt L& t A& t
    (4)               =            +          +     .
                 Qt     ∂K Qt K t ∂L Qt Lt At


The dots denote time derivatives, so the corresponding ratios are rates of change. This

form indicates that the rate of growth of output equals the growth rates of capital and

labor, weighted by their output elasticities, plus the growth rate of the Hicksian shift

parameter. These elasticities are equivalent to income shares sKt and sLt when inputs

are paid the value of their marginal products (∂Q/∂K = c/p; ∂Q/∂L = w/p), giving


                      Q& t K K& t L L& t A& t
(5)            Rt =       -s t    -s t =      .
                      Qt       Kt     L t At

The left-hand part of the equation defines the “residual” of Rt as the growth rate of

output not explained by the share-weighted growth rates of the inputs (the residual is



4
   Solow was not the first to suggest estimating a production function with a time index. Tinbergen (1942)
is usually credited with this advance (see, for example, Griliches (1996, 2000)). Solow’s great
contribution was to show how the time effect could be estimated directly from the data on prices and
quantities presented in national income and product accounts.


                                                    6
also called “total factor productivity” (TFP) and “multifactor productivity” (MFP)).5 The

second equality shows that the residual equals the growth rate of the Hicksian efficiency

parameter At. The residual can therefore be interpreted as the shift in the underlying

production function and the weighted growth rates of capital and labor as movements

along the function.6

        Though linked to an underlying production function, the residual itself is a pure

index number because it is based on prices and quantities alone (actually, (5) is a form

of the Divisia index). By implication, the shift in the function can be measured without

actually having to know its exact form. The trick, here, is that the slope of the

production function along the growth path of the economy is measured by real factor

prices (MQ/MK = c/p; MQ/ML = w/p). The price paid for this generality is that the estimates

are “local” to the path actually followed by the economy and may therefore depend on

the path, as we will see in the following section.7




5
   Multifactor productivity (MFP) is the name given to the Solow residual in the BLS productivity program,
replacing the term ‘total factor productivity” (TFP) used in the earlier literature, and both terms continue in
use (usually interchangeably). The “F” in both terms refers to the factor inputs K and L, and the “M” and
“T” distinguish MFP/TFP from the single productivity indexes Q/L and Q/K (labor and capital productivity).
The “M” is perhaps preferable to the “T” simply because the latter presumes that all the relevant K and L
are counted, which is typically not the case. A problem also arises at the industry level of analysis, where
inputs of energy, materials and purchased services are also used to produce output. “Multi-input
productivity” (MIP) would be a more accurate term in this situation, but to avoid confusion, we will
continue to use “MFP” in this paper.
6
  Under constant returns to scale, the residual (5) can equally be written as the growth rate of labor
productivity (Q/L) less the growth rate of the capital/labor ratio (K/L), weighted by capital’s income share,
since the shares sum to one in this case.
7
  The shift parameter A in the Hicksian production function might also be estimated using econometric
techniques. The result would be “global,” in the sense that the estimated parameters would reveal the
structure of production throughout the entire production space, not just along the growth path through the
space. Choosing between the index number and the econometric approach depends on the choice of the
biases that one is prepared to accept. Fortunately, this choice need not be made, since both approaches
can be used on the same data (much of which come in the form of index numbers).



                                                       7
        The implicit link between growth accounting and the aggregate production

function has another implication: it places constraints on the variables included in the

analysis.8 This implication was drawn out by Jorgenson and Griliches (1967), who

established the modern form of growth accounting (the form underpinning the empirical

estimates of the BLS and the EU KLEMS productivity programs, and the recent OECD

manual on productivity analysis). In the strict production function interpretation, real

output is based on the number of units actually produced, and, by implication, it should

be measured gross of depreciation.9 However, capital stocks should be measured net

of physical depreciation but the price of capital services should include depreciation

cost. Jorgenson and Griliches also incorporated the educational dimension of labor

input into growth analysis. These advances virtually define modern growth accounting,

but it should be emphasized that they were controversial in their day -- witness the

exchange between Denison (1972) and Jorgenson and Griliches (1972).



3. The Potential Function Theorem. The Solow-Jorgenson-Griliches model is familiar

to most students of economic growth. This model establishes sufficient conditions for

deriving the Divisia index (5) from the production function (3). The question of

necessary conditions is rather less familiar: if you start from Solow’s Divisia index in (5),



8
  The production function (3) is the basis for the Solow-Jorgenson-Griliches residual, and under the
maintained hypotheses of the model, constant returns to scale and perfect competition, the basic
accounting identity (1) can be derived from (3) using Euler’s Theorem on homogeneous functions. Thus,
the variables in the production function appear, ipso facto, in the accounting identity. Christensen and
Jorgenson (1969, 1970) develop this idea into a detailed income and wealth accounting framework, and
Jorgenson and Landefeld (2006) develop it into a “Blueprint for Expanded and Integrated U.S. Accounts.”
9
   The net versus gross output debate involves a conceptual issue about the aims of growth accounting
(production versus welfare), and thus goes beyond a technical question about economic measurement. It
will be discussed in greater detain in Section IV.


                                                   8
is there an underlying production function to which it corresponds, and is the solution

necessarily unique?

        The answer is “not necessarily” (Hulten (1973)). Because the residual is a

differential equation involving continuous growth rates between two points, finding a

solution involves line integration. This, in turn, requires the existence of a vector-valued

“potential” function, Φ(X) whose gradient is φ = ∇Φ , to serve as an integrating factor.

Line integration of φ over the path Γ followed by the vector X over the time interval [0,T]

gives Φ.10 Applied to growth accounting, the φ corresponds to the differential equation

in (4), and the Γ to the path of inputs and output over time. The solution Φ is related to

the production function, and the gradient LΦ is related to the marginal products of the

inputs. Intuitively speaking, the production function (or bits and pieces of the production

function) serves as the potential function for integrating the Solow residual back to the

original production function.11

        Growth accounting deals with index numbers (its defining characteristic), and the

property of uniqueness is important. If the economy starts at the point X0 and ends at

XT, uniqueness requires that the path Γ followed by the X during intervening years

should not affect the final value. In this situation, the index is said to be “path

independent”. The property of path independence is not guaranteed merely by the


10
   A more complete account is given in Hulten (1973, 2007). See also Richter (1966) for the invariance
property of the Divisia index.
11
   It is important to emphasize that the application of potential function theory to growth accounting is not
limited to production functions. In some variants of the problem, a factor price frontier or cost function is
the appropriate potential function (see below). Moreover, there is no reason to exclude the use of utility
functions as a possible integrating factor (Hulten (2001)). Indeed, in some versions of growth theory,
utility and production functions are tangent along the growth path, implying that the Solow residual could
be interpreted in both output and welfare terms (an idea developed in Basu and Fernald (2002)).



                                                      9
existence of the potential function Φ, it must also be homothetic or linearly

homogenous, depending on the application (Hulten (1973), Samuelson-Swamy

(1974)).12

        These results imply that the Solow conditions -- the existence of an aggregate

production function, competitive price, and constant returns --- are both sufficient and

necessary for growth accounting. Together, they imply that some underlying economic

structure is needed in order to “solve” the growth accounting equation (5), and,

moreover, that whatever belongs in the production function belongs in the growth

account, and vice versa. This establishes boundaries for the Solow growth accounting

exercise, and it has a more general implication for the construction of index numbers:

stringing together an arbitrary set of variables in an index number format without some

underlying conceptual rationale does not necessary result in a valid economic index.13

This is the basic difference between economic index numbers and axiomatic indexes.


12
   An index number is a one-dimensional indicator of an underlying phenomenon. While the data may
allow an index number to be computed, the usefulness of the index is compromised if more than one
possible value is associated with the same value of the underlying variable(s). The a priori assumption
that the index is a reliable indicator carries with it the implicit assumption of uniqueness, and thus path
independence. This condition may not be true, for there are many circumstances in which path
dependence is an inherent attribute of the underlying production function (e.g., non-Hicksian technical
change, non-separability of the production into capital or labor subaggregates). In some cases, like
Harrod-neutral technical change, a correction can be made if the analyst has a priori information about
the nature of the problem. In other cases, the analyst must use more complex econometric techniques or
simply live with the suspicion of non-uniqueness.
13
    It is sometimes tempting to put together a list of disparate variables in order to inform some interesting
issue. The attempt to construct an index of technological innovation is an example: elements like the
number of patents issued, the number of engineers employed or in training, lists of citations to scientific
research, and real R&D expenditures are all plausible elements of such an index. These elements can
be arithmetically combined into a single number, but without a potential function to guide the construction
of the index, how is the analyst to know which variables to include in the index, what form they should
enter, and what weight they should be given? The intuitive approach to this problem risks double-
counting and potentially confuses inputs and outputs. At a minimum, imposing a potential function on the
problem forces the analyst to think about the nature of the innovation process (and its determinants) in a
sufficiently precise way that the resulting index numbers have a meaningful interpretation.




                                                     10
4. Relaxing Some of the Assumptions. Potential function analysis has other

implications for measurement. First, there is no particular reason to assume a priori that

the shift in the production function has the Hicks’-neutral form. In Solow (1956) and

Cass (1965)-Koopmans (1965) models of steady-state growth, technical change is

assumed to have the Harrod-neutral form, i.e., Qt = F(atLt,Kt) where at is now the shift

parameter. This form of the production function no longer provides the necessary

potential function for the Solow MFP residual in equation (5). It does, however, serve

as a potential function for a variant of the MFP residual in which the original Rt is divided

by labor’s income share: Rt/sLt. A similar result holds for purely capital-augmenting

technical change, but not for the more general factor augmenting model Qt = F(atLt,btKt),

except in the case in which the production function has the Cobb-Douglas form.

       The assumption of constant returns to scale can also be weakened. Suppose

that the production function in (3), Qt = AtF(Lt,Kt), is not restricted to the case of constant

returns to scale, but also allows for the possibility of increasing or decreasing returns.

Suppose, also, that it is possible to obtain an independent estimate of the user cost, c*t,

that is equal the value of the marginal product of capital. In this situation, GDI is

wtLt+c*tKt, and is not equal to GDP. If a new set of cost shares, sK*t = c*tKt / [wtLt+c*tKt]

and sL*t = w*tLt / [wtLt+c*tKt ], are calculated and used in the residual equation (5), the

resulting residual R*t is a path independent Divisia index of the growth rate of At. In

other words, the equalities in equation (5) hold under non-constant retunes to scale, but

at the price of violating the GDP/GDI identity.

       Potential function theory also plays a useful role in determining the appropriate

way to aggregate across various types of labor and capital. The labor variable in the




                                              11
production function, Lt, is based on the assumption that labor is a homogenous input

whose wage reflects the value of its marginal productivity. If there are N categories of

workers, the original L& t / Lt must be expanded to allow for the heterogeneity. One way

is to expand the Divisia index to allow separately for the hours worked (Hi,t) by each of

the different categories, weighted by the relative share in the total wage bill:


              L& t =         wi,t H i,t H& i,t
                       N
(6)
              Lt
                       ∑Σ w
                       i=1   i   i,t H i,t H i,t
                                                 .


For this index to be path independent, the production function must be weakly

separable into a sub-function of the N types of labor alone: i.e., that the function Qt =

AtF(H1,t,…, HN,t,Kt) must be expressible as Qt = AtF(L(H1,t,…, HN,t),Kt). This separability

restriction requires that the marginal rate of substitution between each pair of elements

in L(H1,t,…, HN,t) is independent of the level of all variables outside the sub-function (in

this formulation, the level of Kt). This is a very restrictive condition, but if it holds,

L(H1,t,…, HN,t) serves as the potential function for the labor index (6). A parallel result

holds when different types of capital (or any other heterogeneous input) is combined

into a single index (Hulten (1973)).

       The separability of the production function also plays a role in sorting out the

debate over the appropriate measure of output: net versus gross output at the

aggregate level of economic activity, and the question of when real value added can be

used as a measure of output at the industry level. Each is a question of the existence of

the requisite potential function and will be taken up in a subsequent section.

5. Discrete Time Analysis. The theory of growth accounting reviewed in the preceding

sections is formulated in terms of continuous time paths. This facilitates the use of

mathematical analysis, but is not directly relevant for real-world national and financial

accounting data, which are collected and reported in discrete-time increments (years,

quarters, etc.). The continuous-time model can, however, be operationalized using

discrete approximations (Trivedi (1981)). The Tornqvist (1936) index is perhaps the

leading example:


                        Q        K
                                   + K                     L
                                                             + L
(7)         ln[ At ]=ln[ t ] -[ s t s t -1 ] ln[ K t ] -[ s t s t -1 ] ln[ L t ]
                At -1   Q t -1      2            K t -1       2            L t -1


Here the continuous-time growth rates of the variables in (5) are replaced with the

difference from one period to the next in the natural logarithms of the discrete-time

variables, and the continuous shares by the corresponding average income shares.

       There is no particular economic rationale for choosing this, or any other,

mathematical approximation procedure. The critical step forward was made by Diewert

(1976), whose path-breaking paper established the economic basis for the discrete-time

form (7) with his theory of exact and superlative index numbers. Diewert showed that

the Tornqvist index is an exact index when there exists an underlying production

function of the translog form of Christensen et. al. (1973). By analogy to continuous-

time theory, the translog function plays the role of the potential function for the discrete-

time Tornqvist index (which is analogous to continuous-time for of the residual (5)). As

in continuous time, the production function supplies the underlying economic structure

for judging the accuracy of competing index numbers and for interpreting the index.




                                                 13
Moreover, because the translog form is a second order approximation to a more general

production function, the Tornqvist index (7) is said to be “superlative” as well as exact.

         Diewert’s theory of exact and superlative index numbers is, however, more than

just a rationale for the Tornquist/translog discrete-time approximation to the Divisia

formulation. It provides an alternative way to approach growth accounting that is more

focused on the index numbers than the underlying structure of production. In Diewert

and Morrison (1986), the underlying structure is represented by the feasible set St,

which contains the output vectors y that can be produced from the primary input vector

x given the state of technology in each time period.14 GDP is, as before, the value of

output at market prices p, or p⋅y. This is equal to GDI, w⋅x, where w is the vector of input

prices. A maximum GDP function is defined as gt(p,x) ≡ max y {p⋅y : (y,x) ε St}, which is

a tangent line (supporting hyperplane) to the technology set St. A shift in the technology

set holding inputs constant is thus a shift in the maximum GDP function:


(7’)     τ(p,x,t) ≡ gt(p,x)/gt−1(p,x).


The index τ(p,x,t), and its variants, are a measure of MFP, and are closely related to the

Solow-Jorgenson-Griliches-BLS formulation (5). However, this approach shifts the

focus from the structure of production to the index number problem of measuring gt(p,x)

and τ(p,x,t). The emphasis now is on flexible approximations as opposed to the

retrieval of the technology parameters of St. A range of issues can be handled in the

index-number approach, like separability, but problems of uniqueness in characterizing

the underlying technology remain. From an operational standpoint, however, the

     I am indebted to Erwin Diewert for his input to the formulation of this section.


                                                       14
computation of MFP estimates is not much affected (both approaches use the

Tornquist-translog method), though the interpretation may be. For more on this strand

of literature, see Diewert (1978), Diewert and Morrison (1986), Kohli (1990), and

Morrison and Diewert (1990).



6. Level Comparisons. Traditional growth accounting evolved largely as an explanation

of one country’s growth rates over time. The analysis can also be used to explain why

growth rates differ across countries, but a look at the growth rates alone can be

misleading. Countries with relatively high rates of productivity growth may also have

relatively low levels when compared to the richest countries of the world (China and

India are recent examples). Indeed, high growth rates may even be associated with a

low starting point, a process known as ‘convergence’ or ‘catching-up’.

       There is no reason why the growth analyst should have to choose between a

comparison of levels versus growth rates, since both can generally be calculated from

the same set of data. However, an additional difficulty arises when estimating the

relative level of productivity across countries. For any individual country, the level of

MFP is a pure index number with a value of one in the base-year of the analysis (the

year in which price indexes are also normalized to one). If applied to a collection of

individual countries, each would have the same level of MFP in the base year. This is a

severe limitation, since cross-national differences in the level MFP in any given base

year are a potential cause of the income gap noted in the introduction.

       This issue was resolved by Jorgenson and Nishimizu (1978) who developed a

cross-country Divisia/Tornqvist index of comparative productivity levels. However, this




                                             15
solution depends on which country is selected as the basis for comparison, and the

result was generalized by Caves, Christensen, and Diewert (1982) to permit a country-

invariant comparison. In this formulation, the levels of output and input for each country

are expressed as logarithmic deviations from the corresponding average value across

all countries, and the relative inputs are weighted with averaged income shares:


                                     K+  K                 L+  L
                          Q
(8)        ln[ ADi ] = ln[ Di ] - [ s i s ] ln[ KDi ] - [ s i s ] ln[ LDi ]
               A          Q            2        K            2        L


Time subscripts have been omitted for clarity of exposition, the superscript D refers to

the Divisia cross-country index, and the bar over the shares is an all-country average.

Intuitively, this equation indicates that the gap between a country’s MFP and the N-

country average depends on the gap between the corresponding output and share-

weighted inputs. By rearranging terms, the gap between output per worker in each

country, Qi/Li, and the average level, QD/ LD, can be calculated.

      Cross-national productivity comparisons also encounter a units-of-measurement

problem. National accounting data are typically denominated in the currency units of

each country, and have to be converted to a common price for a comparison with other

countries to be meaningful. Official currency exchange rates are a poor choice for this

conversion, since they may reflect non-market administrative or political decisions. The

International Comparison Program seeks to correct for this potential bias by making

direct price comparisons of similar items across countries (146 in the most recent 2005

ICP round). The result is a set of Purchasing Power Parity price indexes suitable for




                                                 16
income and productivity comparisons.15 The switch to PPPs can have major

consequences: according to Deaton and Heston (2008), world GDP in 2005 was

$54,975 billion under the new 2005 ICP estimates compared to $44,306 billion when

world GDP is valued in dollars using official exchange rates.16



7. Price Duality. Traditional growth accounting links the quantity of output to the

quantities of the inputs via the aggregate production. The emphasis on input and output

quantities is warranted because it is ultimately the quantity of consumption (current and

future) that determines the standard of living. However, the story of growth accounting

can also be told using prices under the assumptions of the Solow-Jorgenson-Griliches

model. Jorgenson-Griliches show that differentiation of the basic GDP/GDI identity,

equation (1), gives the following equation.


                Q& t K K& t L L& t     p&         &           &    &
(9)                 -s t    -s t    = - t + s K t c t + s L t wt = At .
                Qt       Kt      Lt    pt         ct          wt At


This result indicates that the residual estimate of the parameter of interest, A& / A , can

equally be obtained from the growth rates of prices or quantities. Put differently, a

growth account based on quantities implies a parallel and equivalent growth account

based on prices.


15
   This view of the PPP is not universally held. Bosworth and Collins (2003) argue that national prices
provide a better measure of the relative value of capital goods.
16
    Deaton and Heston also issue a “health” warning about using the ICP price data. The changes
introduced in 2005 caused a substantial downward revision in world GDP relative to the methods of the
previous round, which had put world GDP at $59,712 billion (significantly greater than new $54,975 billion
estimate). The downward revision was particular large for the high-growth economies of China and India,
both of which saw their GDP in dollar terms revised downward by around 40 percent. A change of this
magnitude is a reminder about the evolving nature of international comparisons, even in a “gold standard”
program like the ICP, which is one of the major achievements of economic data collection.


                                                    17
        Quantity-based estimates of the residual are interpreted as a shift in the

production function, but what is the interpretation of the price-based growth estimates?

Intuitively, the answer is that under the conditions under which the production function

Qt = AtF(Lt,Kt) serves as a potential function -- constant returns to scale, strict quasi-

concavity, Hicks’-neutrality, and marginal productivity pricing -- there is an associated

“factor price frontier” that has the form: pt = (At)-1 Q(wt,ct).17 This is the “price dual” to

the production function, serves as the potential function for integrating the price-based

form of the residual in (9).

        The work of Hsieh (2002) illustrates one practical consequence of the dual

approach. In some cases, developing countries for example, price data may be more

reliable than published quantity estimates, so that the price side may lead to a more

accurate growth account. This was the idea implemented by Hsieh in his critique of the

papers of Young (1992,1995).18

        The price side of growth analysis is also the ‘port of entry’ for introducing

changes in product quality into growth accounting. The best example is the Hall (1968)

model of quality improvements in capital goods. This seminal paper showed how

capital-embodied technical progress could be incorporated into the price dual and how it

could be measured using the hedonic price approach. This is an important subject by

itself and will be discussed in subsequent sections, including the one that follows.

17
   The productive efficiency term enters the price dual in inverse form because an improvement in
productive efficiency reduces output cost for a given level of input prices, and output price equals
marginal (and average) cost. Because of the linear homogeneity property, the price dual can also be
expressed as a relation between the level of MFP and real factor prices: At = Q[(wt/pt),(ct/pt)]. This form
emphasizes the role of productive efficiency in increasing the real return to the factor inputs.
18
    It is important to emphasize, here, that a sources-of-growth table constructed using prices does not
give different results than a table based on the quantity approach constructed from the same data set. It
is the use of a different, and presumably more accurate, set of prices that makes the difference, and this
implies a different set of quantity estimates.


                                                    18
8. Product Quality. The productivity residual has thus far been associated with a shift

in the production function, inviting the view that it is due to improvements in the

efficiency of the production process. Process-oriented technical change is certainly an

important source of growth, but it is not the only source. Technical change also results

in a profusion of new or substantially improved consumer and producer goods, and in

many industries, this is just as important as process innovation (if not more). Mandel

(2006) underscores this point with this comment “Where the gizmo is made is

immaterial to its popularity. It is great design, technical innovation, and savvy marketing

that have helped Apple Computer sell more than 40 million iPods.” In other words, it is

product development, not production per se, that counts here.

        Bringing product quality into the sources of growth framework is more easily said

than done. Differences in quality are often hard to detect, as Adam Smith observed in

the early days of the Industrial Revolution: "Quality ... is so very disputable a matter,

that I look upon all information of this kind as somewhat uncertain (page 195)." All

solutions are likely to involve assumptions and approximations, and the solution most

commonly used in growth accounting assumes that the arrival of a superior good in the

market place is equivalent to having more units of its inferior predecessor. This “better

is more” approach involves measuring the price differential between inferior and

superior varieties to infer the corresponding “quantity” difference attributed to the new

good.


        Several methods are available for measuring the price differential. When there is

a reliable overlap between the prices of the old and new goods, the gap can be



                                             19
measured directly, and when this is not possible, the gap can be forecasted using price

hedonic techniques.19 Once prices have been adjusted for quality change, that is the Pt

converted to quality-based price Pet, the efficiency-adjusted quantity Qet is defined

implicitly from the equation Vt = PtQt = PetQet, as Qet = Vt/Pet. Since quality change is

usually associated with product improvements due to technical change, the quality-

adjusted Pet. is less than Pt, and the quality-adjusted quantity Qet is larger than its

counterpart, and “better” becomes “more.”

        In this case, the quality-adjusted Qet will grow more rapidly than Qt and will

therefore give a different pattern of output growth to be explained by the growth

accounting decompositions. What exactly does this mean for the Solow residual? The

residual can now be computed in two ways: with and without the quality adjustment to

output, and some simple algebra yields the following relation between the

corresponding residuals:


                  A&te     &     p&  p& te
(10)                     = At + [ t − e ] .
                  Ate      At    p t pt


Multiple outputs can be accommodated by weighting the individual price terms in (10)

by the corresponding output shares.20


19
   Price hedonics is too a large topic to cover in a survey focused on growth accounting. However, a few
general comments are in order. In the price hedonic model, a good is thought of as a bundle of
underlying “characteristics,” like the number of bathrooms and square footage of a house, or the
processor speed and storage capacity of a computer. A change in the quality of a good is thought of as
an increase in one or more characteristics, and the difference between superior and inferior varieties is
defined in terms of the differences in the component characteristics. Regression analysis establishes the
implicit price of each characteristic, and these prices can be used to put a price on the quality gap (how
much of the price increase is due to quality change and how much to pure price inflation). This method
was used by BEA to adjust the observed price changes of computers (Cole et. al. (1986), Cartwright
(1986)). The hedonic method and its alternatives are discussed in greater detail in Triplett (1990, 1987).
20
  The term in square brackets in (10) reflects the fact that “better” has been converted to “more” via the
price differential. Because the quality-corrected quantity grows at a more rapid rate than uncorrected
quantity, the quality-corrected price grows at a slower rate than uncorrected price. The term in brackets
thus makes a positive contribution to generalized productivity growth (it’s a reflection of the “more”).


                                                    20
        This formulation can be interpreted as a decomposition of the quality-corrected

rate of productivity change, on the left-hand side of the equation, to process-driven

productivity growth (the ability to produce more units of the good from given inputs) and

quality-driven productivity growth (the price correction for quality change) on the right-

hand side. Unfortunately, the latter is rarely made explicit in growth accounting data, so

this formulation is largely notional at this point.



                                 IIB. Industry Growth Accounting



        The GDP of the macro economy reflects the economic activity of the component

industries and firms that make up the total economy. Some attention should therefore

be given to how these components evolve and how their growth relates to the growth of

the economy as a whole. There are two general ways of approaching this problem, one

that proceeds from the top down, and another that proceeds from the bottom up, as in

much of the recent work on micro-productivity data sets.


                              1. Disaggregation from the Top Down


a. Aggregate GDP is conceptually the sum of the contributions of each industry,

adjusted for imports and exports. One way of moving from the top down is therefore to

disaggregate the total back into its industry components and (in principle) continue all

the way down to the shop floor. This is the so-called “unpeeling the onion” approach. A

separate Solow residual could be calculated at each step along the way, and the

However, the quality change effect need not be positive. Companies may cut costs by reducing the
quality of their products, through cheaper materials, a lesser degree of “workmanship,” or reductions in
ancillary features. In this situation, the quality factor acts as a drag on productivity.


                                                    21
individual residuals linked back to the grand total. This is a conceptually straight-

forward process if real value added were the only measure of output at each level of

disaggregation. Unfortunately, it is not, because some firms make goods and services

that are inputs to the production functions of other companies. These intermediate

goods are both an input and an output of the economy, and this complicates the way

the industry or firm-level residuals are linked to economy-wide measures of productivity.

        The problem becomes apparent when examining how GDP and GDI are related

at different levels of aggregation. On the GDP side of the aggregate accounting

identity, aggregate output is the sum of deliveries to final demand from each sector, Di,t,

while on the GDI side, it is the sum of sectoral value added. The basic national

accounting identity (1) can be expanded to show this detail:


(1’)   GDPt = Ei pi,tDi,t = Ei wi,tL i,t + EI ci,tK i,t = GDIt .


Intermediate inputs and outputs do not appear in aggregate GDP/GDI, because their

totals are offsetting. However, this is not the case at lower levels of aggregation where

there is no reason that the purchase of intermediate inputs from one set of industries

should exactly match the value of the intermediate outputs delivered to another set of

industries. This is reflected in the industry (or company) accounting identity:


(11)     pi,tQi,t = pi,tDi,t + Ej pi,tMi,j,t = wi,tL i,t + ci,tK i,t + Ej pj,tMj,i,t .


The value of industry gross output sums to an amount that exceeds GDP, and total

input cost exceeds GDI. Moreover, since the terms involving intermediate goods in (11)

do not necessarily cancel, deliveries to final demand (pi,tDi,t ) generally do not equal to




                                                           22
industry value added (wi,tL i,t + ci,tK i,t) -- a point that sometimes gets lost when real

value added is used as a measure of sectoral output.

          The difference in these accounting identities reflects differences in the underlying

structure of production. The constant returns technology that corresponds to the

sectoral accounting identity (11) implies, via Euler’s Theorem, a production function in

which output is produced by a list of inputs that includes intermediate goods. The

Hicks'-neutral form of this function is


(12)         Qi,t = Ai,t Fi(Li,t,K i,t,M1,i,t, … ,MN,i,t) .


Proceeding as before with the aggregate model, the industry version of the Solow

residual is then


                                                               .
                 Q& i ,t &              &                                       &
                     - s K i ,t - siL,t L i ,t − ∑ j s Mj ,i ,t
                                                                M
(13) R i ,t =               K
                           i ,t
                                                                    j ,i ,t
                                                                              = Ai ,t ,
              Q i ,t     K i ,t         Li ,t                   M   j ,i ,t     Ai ,t


for which (12) serves as the requisite potential function. The share-weights used in (13)

are based on the value of industry gross output, not value added, and thus have a

larger denominator that the share-weights in the aggregate Solow residual (5). The so-

called “KLEMS” model is the most common form of (13), in which the list of intermediate

goods includes energy, material, and purchased services, in addition to capital and

labor.



b. How do the industry MFP residuals, Ri,t, map into the aggregate MFP residual, given

the difference in scope of output and the corresponding difference in the share-weights?




                                                                     23
Domar (1961) resolves this problem in the following way. Suppose that there are two

industries, one that makes an intermediate good, Mt = AM,tFM(LM,t,K M,t), and another that

makes a final good, using labor, capital and the intermediate good as an input, Dt =

AD,tFD(LD,t,KD,t,Mt). If both functions have the multiplicative Cobb-Douglas form, the first

can be substituted into the latter to eliminate the intermediate good from the final

demand function, which then becomes a quasi-aggregate production function. In this

altered form, the Solow MFP residual (5) can be computed, but it is now the sum of two

components: the growth rate of AD,t and the growth rate of AM,t weighted by the output

elasticity of M in the production of D. This result shows that efficiency gains in the

production of intermediate goods affect overall MFP, even though intermediate goods

cancel out in the aggregate.

       What happens when there is more than one final-demand producing industry,

when multiple industries produce deliveries to both intermediate and final demand?

Domar proposes a weighting scheme in which aggregate MFP is the weighted sum of

the individual industry residuals, where the weights are equal to the value of industry

gross output divided by total value across industries of deliveries to final demand.

These weights sum to a quantity greater than one (recall equation (11), here), allowing

for the leveraging effects of intermediate inputs on MFP.

       Each element in the Domar MFP index has the usual Solow interpretation as a

shift in an industry production function. But what interpretation can be given to the

weighted average of the industry shifts, given that the Solow aggregate production

function generally does not exist in this situation? What is the relevant potential function

for the aggregate index? The production possibility frontier (PPF) is the natural choice




                                             24
for this role, since it is the basic supply-side constraint of an economy in which each

sector has it own production function (11). The PPF is defined implicitly as



(14)        S(D1,t, … ,DN,t;Kt,L t:A1,t, …, AN,t) ;



The growth in the vector of real final demands can be decomposed into the contribution

of the growth in aggregate inputs, on the one hand, and the growth in sectoral

technology indexes, on the other. Hulten (1978) develops an aggregate index of MFP

based on the latter, RtPPF, and shows that the shift in the PPF is equal to the weighted

sum of the sectoral rates of MFP change, where the weights are those proposed by

Domar:

                         N

In this formulation of the multi-sector MFP problem, the PPF (14) serves as a potential

function for (15), but there is no guarantee of path independence. In general, RtPPF is

not equal to the aggregate Solow residual obtained by imposing an aggregate

production function like (5) across sectors.



c. The problem with the gross output approach is that growth results are not invariant to

the degree of vertical integration in an industry. If a company merges with a supplier,

what was counted as an intermediate flow becomes an internal flow and disappears.

Another problem arises from a lack of reliable and timely input-output data on the price




                                                         25
and quantity of the intermediate flows among industries. Problems with the

measurement of intermediate goods imply problems with industry final demand as well.

       One popular solution is to abandon the gross output approach and work with

value-added data instead. Industry value added excludes intermediate flows and

therefore does not vary with the degree of vertical integration. Indeed, it has the

property that it sums to GDP/GPI. On the other hand, industry value added, in current

or constant prices, is basically a measure of primary input (the industry’s contribution to

GDI), and as we have already seen from the accounting identity (11), it does not

necessarily equal industry final demand. Still, because of measurement problems, the

growth accountant may opt to use real value-added as an indicator of industry output.

The first step in this direction is to derive a price index with which to deflate nominal

value added. This is often done using a “double deflation” technique in which the value

of intermediate inputs is subtracted from the value of gross output in both current and

constant prices to get an implicit deflator for the difference (which is value added). A

Divisia procedure based on equation (13) can also be used, and is in fact

recommended, since the next step is to modify (13) to derive the industry value-added

residual:

                        .
                     V             &              &
(16)        R v
             i ,t   = i ,t - viK,t K i ,t - viL,t L i ,t ,
                     V i ,t        K i ,t         Li ,t

where Vi,t is industry real value added and viK,t and viK,t are the relative shares of capital

and labor in Vi,t. Though calculated on a different basis than the gross output residual,




                                                             26
(15), the value-added residual Riv,t is equal to that residual divided by the value-added

share of the value of gross output: Ri,t/( si,Kt + siL,t ).21

         The valued added-weighted average of the industry Riv,t sums to RtPPF , implying

that the two approaches arrive at the same aggregate result via different paths.

However, this nice aggregation property is deceptive. The problem lies at the industry

level, where potential function theory implies that, in general, the industry residuals Ri,t

and Riv,t cannot simultaneously be an exact index of the shift in the industry production

function (12), Ai,t. Which is correct? That honor goes to Ri,t when the technical change

augments intermediate inputs as well as labor and capital, that is, if the efficiency term

Ai,t multiplies all inputs as in (12). In that case, what does Riv,t measure? That index is

“exact” for a restricted form of (12) in which the production function is separable into a

value-added sub-aggregate and in which technical change augments only capital and

labor:


(12’)      Qi,t = Fi(ai,tV(Li,t,K i,t),M1,i,t, … ,MN,i,t) .


If this is the correct specification of technology, then Riv,t is the appropriate form of the

MFP residual because it gets at the variable of interest, which now is ai,t. Thus, from a

theoretical standpoint, the choice between the value-added or gross-output approach to

industry growth accounting comes down to a question of which specification of technical

change is thought to be the more compelling. The value-added approach generally
21
   The analogy with Hicks’ versus Harrod-neutral specifications of the aggregate production function is
worth noting here. In the former, technical change augments both capital and labor, but it augments only
labor in the latter. In the gross-output industry specification, technical change augments capital, labor,
and intermediate inputs, while in the value-added approach, it augments only capital and labor. In both
cases, the respective residuals are linked by an algebraic expression involving input shares.


                                                       27
loses this contest, since it implies (improbably) that efficiency-enhancing improvements

in technology exclude materials and energy.


                         2. Disaggregation from the Bottom Up


Much of the recent growth in the field of productivity analysis has been generated by the

development of panel data sets like the Longitudinal Research Database of the U.S.

Census (Bartelsman and Doms (2000)), Foster, Haltiwanger, and Krizan (2001)). The

LRD data set contains establishment-level data on inputs and outputs at a highly

disaggregated level of industry detail. These data permit a close-in look at the growth

dynamics of units in which the production actually occurs, and their uses go beyond

growth accounting (the study of job loss and creation, for example). The panel nature of

the data inclines the analysis more towards the econometric branch of productivity

analysis, but growth accounting has also been greatly enriched by the capacity to study

the effects of the entry and exit of establishments.

       Industry MFP change has several sources in the bottoms-up approach: within

establishment change in technology or organization, changes in the shares of

incumbent establishments, and, discontinuous share changes due to entry and exit to

and from the industry. One goal of industry-level growth accounting has been to

incorporate this richness of detail into the analysis, and one index that captures at least

some of these effects was developed by Baily-Hulten-Campbell (1992). This index has

several forms, but for purposes of this review, we will focus on one in which the top-




                                            28
down residual RtPPF in (15) is generalized to include terms associated with the change in

the shares.22

        These shift-share terms allow for an increase in aggregate productivity even

when industry (establishment) productivity is unchanged, if resources are transferred

from lower to higher productivity units. However, Petrin and Levinsohn (2005, 2008)

argue the assumptions used to derive RtPPF in (15) -- constant returns, perfect

competition, and costless and immediate adjustments -- imply that the shift-share

terms should be zero. Intuitively, this occurs because output price equals the same

marginal cost for all firms within an industry, and competitive pricing insures that there

are no marginal efficiency gains from transferring resources from one industry (or firm)

to another. In this case, RtBHC and RtPPF are the same. However, the literature finds that

reallocation effects do matter empirically, implying a disconnect between the two

formulations.

        The disconnect between the top-down and bottom-up approaches is illustrated in

Figure 1, based on Basu and Fernald (2002). This diagram shows the production

possibility frontier of a two-good economy as it evolves over time. The economy is

located initially at the point B on the PPF bb, the point of utility maximization, and over

time, the PPF expands outward along the path EE to the PPF aa and the optimal point

A. The shift along EE is due to two factors: the growth in aggregate capital and labor,

and the growth in MFP in the sectoral production function for goods X and Y.




22
   This is but one form of the BHC index. A fuller account is given in Foster et, al (2001), who provide an
extensive discussion of the BHC index and other approaches. See, also, Petrin and Levinsohn (2005,
2008).

The aggregate measure RtPPF from (15) is the weighted sum of the latter, measured

along the ray EE. There are no reallocation effects along this path. Thus, for

reallocation effects to matter, the growth path of the economy must be located

somewhere other than along EE.

       Foster et. al. (2001) identify several reasons why this may happen: adjustment

costs and diffusion lags in technology transmission, monopolistic pricing, and resource

distorting policies (e.g., taxes and regulations). Foster, Haltiwanger, and Syverson

(2008) highlight the role of price dispersion and product differentiation as a source of the

reallocation. These distortionary effects push the economy off the optimal expansion

path EE, to say, a path through points like C and D. At C, there is a distortion in output

prices that results in too much of good Y and too little of X, but keeps the economy on

the maximal PPF. A distortion in the use of inputs can also drive the PPF inward, back

to the PPF bb, to, say, the point D. Growth of the economy can then occur through

changes in the distortion (reallocation) or because the efficient frontier shifts. This is the


                                                 30
basis for the Basu-Fernald distinction between aggregate productivity and aggregate

technology. 23

        Reallocation effects are an important addition to the original Solow-Jorgenson-

Griliches paradigm. However, there is potentially an issue of consistency. The

individual industry or establishment MFP estimates that make up the direct-growth part

of the decomposition are typically computed under the assumptions of the Solow

residual, which envision distortion-free markets and efficient allocation. On the other

hand, the reallocation model is based on the existence of distortions and frictions across

industries. The level of industry aggregation is to some extent arbitrary (often

determined by data availability), and it is not always clear why the factors that distort the

allocation of resources should operate at one level of aggregation but not another.




23
     The PPF reflects the efficient operation of the component industry production functions. In a two
sector model with given amounts of total labor and capital, the PPF is the locus of efficient input
allocations in an appropriately drawn Edgeworth box. These give the output combinations at which the
isoquants of the two technologies are tangent. Along the locus of tangencies, relative factor prices are
the same in both industries. A distortion in these factor prices will tend to result in a point (like D in Figure
1) off the PPF at which the isoquants cross. Removing all input price distortions increase aggregate
output by restoring the economy to the maximal PPF. This is the idea behind the reallocation effects
estimated of Jorgenson et. al. (2007).

Modeling reallocation as a shift in the interior distorted PPF to the frontier is intuitively appealing, but the
existence of the frontier as a stable concave function may require strong assumptions about separability,
particularly in the presence of intermediate inputs produced in other industries (Basu and Fernald (2002)).
Moreover, a sub-optimal PPF may also be due to the inefficiency in the industry technology itself (a
suboptimal value of the Hicksian shift term “A” in the production function Q = AF(L,K)). Bloom and Van
Reenan (2006), for example, have found a wide variation in management efficiency across companies
and countries. The voluminous literature on cross-national differences in economic growth is also
focused on this source of inefficiency. The large difference in output per worker between emerging-
market and OECD economies is widely attributed to cultural, institutional, and environmental barriers to
attaining the best practice technology frontier (see Bosworth and Collins (2003) and Hulten and Isaksson
(2007) for recent reviews), and possibly to the lumpiness of infrastructure capital. Growth accounting
comparisons suggest that effective PPF in many low income countries may be below the best-practice
PPF by as much as a one-to-five ratio. Frontier estimation is another one way to get at this sort of
problem, but is beyond the scope of this paper (see, for example, Fare et. al. (1994)).



                                                       31
                           3. The Company-Establishment Problem


Any analysis of industry productivity must also confront the company versus

establishment problem. Many large companies have diversified product mixes (autos

and auto insurance, pharmaceutical drugs and home care products, jet engines and

refrigerators, etc.). These diverse products are often made in different “establishments”

within the company, and it makes sense, from the production function perspective, to

group similar establishments across companies when defining an industry.

        However, something gets lost in this approach. The company, as a whole, is the

legal and organizational entity that manages the various production establishments, as

well as non-production activities like research and development, marketing, and finance.

The latter are treated as overhead costs by accountants and fixed costs by economists,

but they are activities that are essential for the ongoing success of a company.

Unfortunately, there is no good way of attributing many of these costs to individual

production establishments within the company -- they belong to the company as an

entire business entity and, like any joint product, they cannot be uniquely partitioned.24

On the other hand, to treat them as a separate establishment of their own is to miss the

role they play in defining the overall business model and administrative functioning of

the company (the Coase-Penrose firm is more than the sum of its parts). To exclude

the product development and management activities of the firm entirely is to miss the




24
   In the case of the larger establishments with a company, some part of the “overhead” may actually be
assigned to the establishment. But, there are establishments within establishments, and at some point
this devolution stops.



                                                  32
vital synergies that determine much of the dynamism of the company as a whole and

the changes observed at the establishment level.25

        Technical change exacerbates the industrial classification problem. If

establishments are grouped according to similarity of their products, product innovation

may force a reclassification, as with computing devices which used to be mechanical

machines and were classified accordingly, but now they are electrical. New

management and production processes may also lead to changes in the composition of

a company’s establishments, as in the financial services industry. Care must therefore

be taken when interpreting industry-level growth accounting estimates over long spans

of time.26


                               III. The Individual Sources of Growth



The Koopmans (1947) injunction against measurement without theory has greatly

influenced the evolution of growth accounting theory, from its national accounting

origins through Solow, Jorgenson and Griliches, and beyond. The theoretical

foundations are well-developed, and now the problem lies in the opposite direction:

theory without measurement. In his 1994 Presidential Address to the American



25
   It is worth noting, here, that European accounting practice is more oriented to the company as the
basis for industry classification, though problems still exist. This helps with the overhead cost problem,
but comes at the cost of combining operating units with different products and technologies.
Unfortunately, there is no one correct approach that addresses all the questions that are asked of the
data.
26
    The periodic change in industrial classification is illustrated by the recent adoption of the North
American Industrial Classification System (NAICS), which has replaced the older Standard Industrial
Classification System (SIC). Once a new system is adopted, it is hard (and costly) to extend the newly
reorganized data backward in time for more than a decade or two. This problem tends to be more acute
at lower levels of industry aggregation, where the establishments are more prone to reclassification.


                                                     33
Economic Association, Zvi Griliches pointed to the propensity of academic economists

to give priority to the former at the expense of the latter


”We [economists] ourselves do not put enough emphasis on the value of data and data collection in our
training of graduate students and in the reward structure of our profession. It is the preparation skill of the
chef that catches the professional eye, not the quality of the materials in the meal, or the effort that went
into procuring them (page 14).”



Ingredients matter a lot in growth accounting, and inadequate data can have a greater

impact on the results than inadequate theory. Nordhaus (1997, pages 54-55) has

argued “that official price and output data “may miss the most important revolutions in

history,” because they miss the really large (“tectonic”) advances in technology. Part of

the blame belongs to theory because, as Griliches also observed, “... it is not

reasonable for us to expect the government to produce statistics in areas where

concepts are mushy and where there is little professional agreement on what is to be

measured and how (page 14).” This section is devoted to the principal ingredients of

growth accounting: output, labor, and capital.


                                                 A. Output


1. Output is an intuitively simple concept when it is just the “Q” in a textbook production

function. It is often called “widgets,” which is short-hand for a product that can be

measured in neat and tidy physical units. In the real world, however, there is a great

diversity of “widgets”, tangible and intangible, and even within relatively homogeneous

product categories, differences in quality, variety, and location matter. The range of

products in a modern economy is so diverse that it is virtually impossible for the

statistician to capture the full richness of detail. Some degree of sampling and



                                                      34
aggregation is necessary before estimates are presented to the public, and this degree

is rather high in the data typically used for growth accounting. In the process, the

growth of real output no longer refers to specific products, but to synthetic constructs

that represent broad groups like autos, pharmaceutical drugs, machine tools, and

houses, where the exact units of measurement are somewhat fuzzy.

        One way to attack the heterogeneity problem is from the price side. This is the

strategy for dealing with changes in product quality, and a variant works for within-group

diversity. The total value of sales or revenues for a given product group, is usually

available for products for which there are active markets (e.g., auto sales), and a

measure of average real output can be obtained by deflating product value by an index

of average price. This approach implicitly assumes that there is a synthetic product Qt

whose notional price is Pt and whose value is Vt = PtQt = Ei Pi,tQi,t. The implicit quantity

index is then Qt = Vt/Pt. In the case of the U.S. national accounts, the consumer and

producer price indexes fill this role.27 The units of measurement of Qt are in price-

adjusted units of currency, not in numbers of widgets. This ambiguity is not so much of

a problem for most manufactured goods or agricultural commodities, where the

connection between the constant-price quantity index and the underlying physical units

is more intuitive, but it is a greater problem as the growth accountant moves to product

types and sectors at the outer boundaries of accurate measurement.




27
   The use of an average price deflator in this context is encouraged by the Law of One Price. The price
of a given item tends to be similar across outlets, whereas the quantities sold vary considerably. In the
U.S. CPI program, agents visit stores and other outlets to observe the prices of representative items in a
range of product groups. They can get many item prices “from the shelf” or the menu, etc., without
having to estimate the associated product sales. One downside of relying on price indexes to back out an
estimate real output is that price estimates are typically made using data sources and methods that differ
from those used to estimate the nominal value of GDP and its components.


                                                   35
2. Boundary Issues.28 The data underlying output statistics (e.g., national accounts and

census survey data) are mainly based market-mediated transactions. This forms a

loose boundary between what gets into the accounts and what does not. Since growth

accounting results are sensitive to what gets included, a few remarks about the main

ingredients are warranted.



a. The government sector is usually included in national accounting data, because it is a

large draw on national resources and because the boundary between public and private

sectors is often indistinct. The main measurement problem is that much of the output

originating in the public sector is not distributed through markets (or is distributed at

prices that do not reflect full costs), and there are thus no reliable valuation data.

Moreover, there are a dearth of output price indexes with which to estimate real output

even if the public PtQt were available. As a result, the growth rate of real output is

typically inferred from the growth rate of input, with productivity change assumed to be

zero. For this reason, some growth analyses omit the public sector and focus only on

the market sectors of the economy.



b. The household sector presents an even greater problem for growth accounting. Not

only is most of the sector’s output not sold in markets, but here is also little reliable data

on the value of inputs (the recent American Time Use Survey is an attempt to get at this



28
   The question of what to include in a national account has been debated since the beginning of the
national accounting movement. There is currently a good deal of interest in the topic, generated, in part,
by an increased concern about the environment, as well as a renewed focus on health and education
issues. The papers by Nordhaus (2006) and Abraham and Mackie (2006) provide recent surveys of
many of the central issues.


                                                    36
problem for the U.S.). The household sector is therefore (largely) excluded from

national accounting data. According to estimates by Landefeld and McCulla (2000), the

household production of consumption goods in the U.S. national accounts was 43

percent of 1946 GDP, falling to 24 percent in 1997.

       Not only does the exclusion of most household output affect the level of

measured GDP, it also changes the growth picture as well. For example, the shift in

female labor force participation from the household sector to the market and

government sectors is an important source of growth in measured labor input in the

latter, but much of the reallocation is portrayed in the GDP statistics as a net expansion.

Moreover, the household sector is where much of the investment in human capital

occurs via the opportunity cost of time (Jorgenson and Fraumeni (1989, 1992)). Growth

accounts that focus only on the market and near-market segments of an economy may

thus present a distorted picture of the true sources of growth of the economy. A variant

of this problem arises in countries with a large non-market component to their

economies, and in countries with significant “informal” markets.



c. The service-producing sectors. There are data on the value of product transacted for

these sectors, but here it is the real product that is notoriously hard to measure

(Griliches (1994) refers to this part of the economy as the “unmeasurable sectors”). The

heart of the problem is the lack of clarity on just what is meant by a “unit” of service

output. Should a service be measured as a unit produced by its supplier, or as the

‘outcome’ obtained by the recipient? Doctors typically sell expertise, not health

outcomes, because the latter depends on the initial condition of the patient and the




                                             37
extent to which advice or treatment is followed. Education is similar, since the

production of human capital involves student and family inputs as well as formal

schooling. Indeed, many, if not most, services involve some form of contingent

outcome that drives a wedge between the resource cost of the service and the value

ultimately captured by the consumer. Sorting out the P’s and Q’s is hard if there is no

clear idea of what a unit of Q actually is.29



4. R&D and other Business Intangibles. Until very recently, expenditures for

intangibles like R&D were treated as intermediate goods and not counted as part of

GDP or GDI. This treatment was due, in part, to the fact that business intangibles are

largely produced and used within firms, without any market transaction to provide a

dollar metric of the volume produced, and without any visible real product to measure.

However, as previously noted, expenditures for R&D, marketing, and worker training are

the source of much of the product and process innovation that drive the future

profitability and productivity of companies. These expenditures usually operate with

lags (often with long lags), and the benefits spill out over a number of years, and they

are thus more appropriately seen as capital investments than intermediate goods.

        Various aspects of this omission have received a fair amount of attention in

recent years. 30 Nakamura (1999, 2001) was the first to develop comprehensive


29
   There is quite a large literature on the problem of measuring service sector output, stimulated, in part,
by Baumol’s (1967) hypothesis that the labor intensity of that sector makes productivity gains inherently
harder to achieve. This possibility, along with the difficulty in measuring service sector output, was a
leading explanation of the U.S. productivity slowdown of the 1970s and 1980s (Griliches (1994)).
However, the recent productivity boom in the service sector, associated with the IT revolution, puts these
explanations in a different light (Triplett and Bosworth (2003)).
30
   Lev (2001), Blair and Wallman (2001), and Sichel (2007) provide overviews of the economic and
accounting issues involved in capitalizing intangibles. For the links to technology, and information
technology in particular, see Basu et. al (2004) and Brynjolfsson and Hitt (2005).


                                                     38
expenditure estimates and Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel (2005, 2006)) the first to

incorporate intangibles into a growth accounting framework (Sichel (2007)). This line of

research finds that intangible investments by U.S. companies have grown rapidly in

recent decades and are now larger than investment in plant and equipment (adding

around 10% or more to GDP if fully counted), and that the sources-of-growth accounts

for U.S are rather different when intangibles are included as both inputs and outputs of

the non-farm business sector. The BEA has launched a program to include scientific

R&D investments in U.S. GDP as a satellite account to the main national accounts

(Robbins and Moylan (2007)), and the BLS plans to incorporate these estimates into

their productivity estimates.


                                           B. Labor Input.


1. Labor services. The flow of labor services is generally seen as the appropriate

concept of labor input for the production function framework of growth accounting and

hours worked as a reasonable measure of the flow. However, hours paid or

employment are often the only available measures.31 Other complications include the

likelihood that some labor input and compensation are misclassified as the capital

income of sole proprietors, and that unpaid family workers and other undocumented

workers go uncounted. Accounting for fringe benefits and equity participation (e.g.,

stock options) also poses problems for measurement. Finally, some workers (e.g.,


31
    A supplementary form of growth accounting is available when there are data on both hours paid (H)
and employment (L). In this case, the growth rate of output (Q) can be decomposed into the growth rate
of output per worker (Q/L) and the growth rate of hours per worker (and further when hours worked are
also available). This sort of decomposition is often of interest in cross-national comparisons, as, for
example, studies that examine the recent growth experience of the EU countries and the U.S. (Van Ark
et. al (2008)).


                                                   39
managers) are essentially quasi-fixed inputs whose direct impact on production does

not vary with the flow of output.

.

2. Labor Composition. In the production-function approach, different types of labor

input should be grouped according to differences in their marginal products. In

analytical terms, if there are N types (cohorts) of labor, the production function would

contain a separate variable for each type: Q t = A tF(Kt,H1,t, … ,HN,t), where Hi,t is the

number of hours worked in the ith cohort. Following Jorgenson and Griliches (1967), a

Divisia index of labor input can be computed by weighting growth rates of the Hi,t with

their shares of total labor income. This index is decomposed into two parts, the first

equal to the growth rate of total hours across all cohorts, Hi,t, = EI Hi,t, and the second a

compositional term which measures the weighted contribution of each cohort’s hours to

the growth of total hours:


              L& t = H& t +
                              N                     &       &
                              ∑Σ w
                                    wi,t H i,t
(17)                                              [ H i,t - H t ] .
              Lt     Ht       i=1   i   i,t H i,t   H i,t H t

The compositional part of (17) is sometimes called the “labor quality” effect, because it

is positive when the composition of the labor force shifts toward cohorts with higher

wages, which are assumed to equal the corresponding value of marginal products (an

assumption that is frequently challenged). The compositional effect is zero when wages

are equal or when there is no relative shift in the make-up of the work force.

       The index (17) is path independent when the production function is separable,

i.e. Q t = AtF(Kt,L(H1,t, … ,HN,t,)), in which case there is a well-defined labor aggregate of

the form L(H1,t, … ,HN,t) to act as the potential function. This is a strong assumption,



                                                         40
since it requires the marginal rate of technical substitution between different types of

labor (e.g., skilled versus unskilled) does not depend on the amount of capital available.

A parallel formulation applies to the existence of a capital subaggregate.

       The labor cohorts are typically constructed using such characteristics as

education, age, gender, and age (or experience). Because of the multiplicity of

dimensions and the resulting large number of cohorts, much of the cohort data has to

be estimated using techniques like the method of bi-proportional matrices. This

imputation introduces an additional source of measurement error into the growth

account, but the benefits from this formulation are substantial, since the empirical

studies that use this method tend to show a large positive contribution of increased

educational attainment to economic growth.


                                     C. Capital input.


1. Owner-utilized Capital. In a world in which the flow of input services from capital is

priced in an active rental market, the formation of the Divisia index of the capital

aggregate would be almost as straight-forward as the labor counterpart (17).

Unfortunately for the statistician, the measurement problem is greatly complicated by

the fact that most capital is owner-operated and some of it (intangibles) is owner-

produced as well. As a result, there are no market transactions for this type of capital,

so the price of capital services must be imputed using indirect methods. The absence

of market data also means that the quantity of capital services must be imputed. The

imputation procedures in common use are discussed in some detail in the following




                                             41
subsections, because of their importance to practical growth accounting and because

there are still areas of controversy.32



2. The “perpetual inventory method”. Capital is both an input and an output of the

production process. It is also a durable good (by definition) in which there may be

different vintages of past investment goods in operation at any point in time. Together,

these characteristics suggest an aggregate production function like Qt = Ct + It =

AtF(Lt,It, … ,It-T), with T being the age in which the oldest vintage is removed from

service, and Ct the amount of output used for consumption. This is an extension of the

Solow production function of the preceding sections, which is based on the stock of

capital, Kt, rather than on its component vector (It, … ,It-T). The problem for growth

accounting is to connect the two. One possibility is to work directly with the vector form

and interpret the results in the stock context. There is, however, a problem: while the

price and quantity of new investment goods is readily observable, the price and quantity

of the older vintages is not so easily obtained. The other way to proceed is to convert

the vector (It, … ,It-T) into the implied stock Kt. This is the rationale for the perpetual

inventory method. 33

        The perpetual inventory stock of capital is the sum of current and past investment

goods, weighted by the productive efficiency of those investments:


32
   General treatments of the capital measurement problem can be found in Diewert (1980), Hulten
(1990), and the recent OECD manual.
33
   Capital stock can also be estimated directly from historical book value accounting data, but this is
problematic because of the difficulty in adjusting for price level changes, and because somewhat arbitrary
methods of depreciating capital are often used. Moreover, book value data are usually presented at a
highly aggregated level of asset detail, and the shift in the composition of capital is also of interest to
growth accountants.



                                                    42
(18)                 K t = Φ0 I t-0 + Φ 1 I t-1 + … + ΦT I t-T .


The weighting index, Φs, is the efficiency of an s-year old asset relative to a new asset,

defined as the ratio of the marginal product of an s-year old asset to the marginal

product of a new asset. The term ΦsI t-s is therefore the amount of investment put in

place s years previously, measured in units of productive efficiency. In this formulation,

K t is the total amount of effective capital denominated in units of new capital, that is, the

equivalent amount of new capital needed to replace the capacity of the actual stock with

its various layers of vintage capital.

        The Φs are generally treated as fixed parameters in the perpetual inventory

approach. This is a strong assumption, given that they are the ratios of marginal

products that can vary over time according to economic conditions, and because the

age-efficiency path of an asset will generally depend on intensity of use and

maintenance.34 Since they cannot be observed directly, the Φ’s must be obtained by

indirect procedures. A number of methods have been proposed, but all involve a high


34
   The marginal product problem is usually dealt with by assuming strong separability of the production
function, in which case the ratio is invariant to changes in the variables outside the capital aggregate.
The second problem is usually dealt with by assuming that the Φ’s reflect optimal utilization and
maintenance programs that are relatively stable when averaged across individual assets. These
assumptions are used more from necessity than conviction, because the data needed to improve on them
are unobtainable for a wide range of assets. The model of Diewert and Lawrence (2000) permits a more
flexible approach in which different vintages of investment are not assumed to be perfect substitutes,
although this approach gives the same results as the perpetual inventory method when depreciation has
the geometric form.

Another important implication of the exogenous Φ approach is that periods of exceptional retirement are
not allowed for. Exceptional retirements may arise from a natural disaster, a large hurricane or
earthquake, from wars, or from technological sources. The Y2K problem is an example of the latter. As
the millennium year 2000 approached, there was a concern that existing software could not handle the
transition from “99” to “00,” and this triggered a wave of IT purchases to replace older systems. This led
to a parallel wave of retirements not captured by the fixed-life perpetual inventory method. Bartelsman
and Beaulieu (2007) estimate that the failure to account for these Y2K retirements had a small, but
material, effect on measured MFP in the nonfarm private business sector.


                                                    43
ratio of assumption to fact. BEA uses a procedure derived from the price-based study

of depreciation rates of Hulten and Wykoff (1981), who apply price-hedonic procedures

to samples of used investment good prices for a variety of assets and find that the

depreciation pattern (and rate) is approximately geometric. Other methods involve

estimation of the average service life, T in (18), combined with assumptions about the

appropriate pattern of efficiency decay (one-hoss shay, hyperbolic, and straight-line are

the common alternatives).

       The problem is complicated by a fallacy of composition: each individual asset in

a group of similar assets may follow one Φ pattern based on its own useful life, Ti, but

the average group Φ can have an entirely different pattern when the Ti vary among the

assets in the group (the usual case unless all are retired from service at the same point

in time). This fallacy is strengthened when assets are grouped into broad assets types

(e.g., machine tool, factory buildings), as they must be in order to keep the

measurement problem statistically manageable. But, as the heterogeneity of assets

increases, the group Φ tends toward a convex pattern that is usually well-approximated

by the simple geometric form.

       The perpetual inventory model can also accommodate the situation in which the

productivity (“quality”) of new assets improves over time (Hall (1968, 1971)). In this

case, the weighting index of a new asset, Φ0, is allowed to drift upward over time to

reflect the increase in the marginal productivity of new assets due to improvements in

design and technology. In the notation of capital accounting, the index of a new asset in

year t, Φt,0, exceeds that of a new asset in the preceding year, Φt-1,0. The index of

relative efficiency now has two subscripts, one denotes the year and the other the




                                            44
asset’s age: in general, Φt,s. The efficiency profile of any single vintage of asset is

therefore [Φt,0, Φt+1,1, Φt+2,s+2, … , Φt+T,s+T], and the capital stock in year t is made up of

investments from past vintages. Thus:


(18’)                K t = Φt,0 I t-0 + Φt,1 I t-1 + … + Φt,T I t-T .


This form of (18) is also measured in efficiency units based on relative marginal

products. This amended form of the capital accumulation equation is closely related to

Solow’s “jelly” stock of capital that will be discussed in the section on capital-embodied

technical change. The “dual” side of this formulation links the rise in the efficiency of

new asset, Φt,0, to the induced decline in the value of preceding vintages of capital, a

process known as obsolescence.



3. The Price of Capital Services. Once the capital stocks have been estimated, the

unobserved price of capital services can be imputed. For a single type of capital and

labor, the basic GDP/GDI identity can be rearranged to obtain an implicit estimate of the

capital service price: ct = (ptQt - wtLt)/ Kt . This is the reverse of the usual procedure in

which an independent estimate of the price deflator is used to compute quantity. The

difficulty with this solution is the feature that long-lived assets like buildings are lumped

together with short lived goods like autos. Since the shift in the composition of capital is

a potentially important factor influencing economic growth, as with the composition of

labor input, the number of capital goods in the analysis is ideally greater than one.35


35
   Indeed, much of the recent literature on growth accounting has focused on the role played by the rapid
growth of information and communications equipment relative to other types of capital (see, for example,
the survey by Oliner and Sichel (2000) and the early contribution by Baily and Gordon (1988))



                                                    45
       One solution to the composition problem was developed by Jorgenson and

Griliches (1967), based on the path-breaking work by Jorgenson (1963) on the service

price of capital (also called the “user cost” or “rental price”). The investment price of a

capital good (pIt) is assumed to equal the expected present value of the annual service

prices/user costs/rents (ct) generated by the asset over its life. Jorgenson (1963)

showed that an explicit formula for the service price can be obtained by solving the

present value equation for ct, as a function of the rate of return per dollar of investment

(rt), the asset price (pIt), the asset price revaluation (Dt = dpIt/pIt), and the rate of

depreciation (*):


(19)      ct = (rt - Dt + *) pIt .


Taxes were added to the model by Hall and Jorgenson (1967). Estimates of the

individual components on the right-hand side provide an estimate of the user cost,

which is, itself, assumed to equal the value of the marginal product of capital in

competitive equilibrium.

       The estimation of each component of the user cost presents its own difficulties

and has its own literature. However, the rate of return component deserves special

mention because of its history and theoretical implications for growth accounting. The

main candidates are to use the endogenous ex post approach developed by Jorgenson

and Griliches (1967), or to use an exogenous ex ante rate of return based on the

finance decision underlying the investment. The former is typically used in empirical

growth accounting because it preserves the adding-up property of the basic GDP/GDI.




                                                46
In this approach, the adding-up property of the GDP/GDI identity is expanded to allow

for multiple types of capital and labor and solved for total income accruing to capital:


(20)      At = ptQt - Ej wj,tL j,t = EI ci,tK i,t .


The formula for the service price of capital can be substituted into this equation, and

solved for rt, under the rather strong assumption that the rate of return is the same for all

assets regardless of risk. In this formulation, rt is simply the residual average rate of

return that insures that GDP equals GDI.

       A case can also be made for the alternative procedure of using an independent

ex ante estimate for rates of return in (19) and (20) (for example, Schreyer (2004)).

Under uncertainty, investment decisions are made on the basis of the rate of return

expected (ex ante) at the time that the investment is made, not the return actually

realized ex post. Moreover, investors are likely to apply different ex ante rates

according to the degree of risk associated with each investment. The ex ante approach

thus leads to a user cost that is presumably closer to the price/marginal product linkage

envisioned in the neoclassical theory on which the Jorgensonian capital pricing model is

based. It should also be noted that the ex ante procedure gives an estimate of the

service price that does not presume that the GDP/GDI adding-up condition necessarily

holds, so growth accounting with non-constant returns to scale can be accommodated

(at the expense of the GDP/GDI identity). The ex ante approach is also the important

option when implementing the pricing-duality version of the growth accounting model.




                                                      47
The Hsieh-Young debate is a reminder how important the choice can be for growth

accounting. 36



4. Capital utilization. The perpetual inventory method produces a measure of capital

stock, not of capital services. The latter will depend on the intensity of use of the

former, and this will vary over the business cycle and may even show a secular drift

over time as management practices change. To the extent that this stock-flow problem

is ignored, the discrepancies between the two will be suppressed into the MFP residual.

Field (2003) shows how big an impact the utilization problem can have on the observed

pattern of growth.

        One way to correct for the stock-flow problem is to introduce an explicit utilization

term into the production function. However, this runs afoul of the pricing problem

associated with unused capacity. It also ignores the fact the some capital is

continuously in service, as with a building that keeps out rain and thieves, or capital for

which the demand is stochastic (telephones).

        Berndt and Fuss (1986) offer a different solution. They show that the stock

approach (I.e., one without an explicit utilization adjustment) does, in fact, correct for

variations in capital utilization, at least in the case of a single capital good.37 In this


36
    There are also some important issues with the other elements of the service price formula (19). For
example, during periods of asset price inflation, the service prices imputed under the perfect foresight
assumption implicit in (19) can be negative (an implausible outcome for a variable that proxies for the
marginal product of the underlying capital). Doing away with the perfect foresight assumption ameliorates
this problem, but raises the question of how expectations are formed and how they (along with risk)
should be incorporated into the model.
37
   When there is more than one type of capital good, a separate Berndt-Fuss utilization correction does
not apply to each type. However, one does apply to the entire collection of capital goods, and when the
production function is separable into a capital subaggregate, the Berndt-Fuss correction applies to the
subaggregate.


                                                   48
framework, capital is a Marshallian quasi-fixed input, and the degree of utilization is

determined by the amount of variable input applied to the stock. The correction for this

form of utilization is captured by the ex post service price as computed using the

Jorgenson-Griliches procedure underlying equation (20). But, apart from this implicit

correction, the stock-based perpetual-inventory-method estimates used in growth

accounting are not adjusted for fluctuations in the flow of service over time, and this

introduces a pro-cyclical bias in the estimate of MFP.38 This pro-cyclical pattern makes

it hard to interpret the size and timing of MFP movements, and is one of the reasons

that the U.S. productivity slowdown of the 1970s and the 1980s is still something of a

mystery.



5. Some Final Caveats on Capital. The methods used for imputing the price and

quantity of capital input are strongly neoclassical. Capital is treated as a malleable

homogenous entity in which the different efficiency-adjusted investment goods

produced in different years (vintages) are generally assumed to be perfect substitutes,

and for which markets function smoothly and competitively. These assumptions were a

source of great controversy in the 1950s, and while the controversy has largely

receded, the basic assumption that capital goods of greatly differing characteristics can

be lumped into a single entity and substituted freely against labor must be recognized

as a strong assumption (e.g., it asserts that many workers with abacus’ are equivalent

to one worker with a personal computer). Fisher (1965, 1969) shows just how

restrictive these assumptions really are.



38
     The economics of procyclical productivity are discussed in Basu and Fernald (2001).


                                                    49
       On the other hand, Jorgenson (1966) made the important point that

measurement errors are offsetting along the Golden Rule steady-state growth path,

because capital is, in general, both an input and an output of the economy. The basic

Solow residual in equation (5) can be modified by replacing the growth rate of output,

Qt, with the share-weighted growth rates of its components, consumption, Ct, and

investment, It, and a rearrangement of terms gives:


                          C& t + [ I I&t - K K& t ] - L L& t = A& t .
(21)          Rt = sC t           st      s t        s t
                          Ct         It       Kt         L t At


The terms involving capital goods are shown in brackets, and in optimal steady state

growth they are exactly offsetting, because investment and capital stock grow at the

same rate and the corresponding shares are equal. This result “works” because of the

nature of investment. Investment arises from the act of saving, which is the attempt to

shift consumption from the current period to the future, and today’s optimal investment

is tomorrow’s dissaving. However, errors in measurement do matter outside of optimal

growth.



                          IV. Critique of the Growth Accounting Model


An examination of specific innovations reveals that the arrival of a new technology

involves much more than a simple shift in the production function. Studies of the Corliss

steam engine by Rosenberg and Trajtenberg (2004) and the computer numerically-

controlled machine tools by Bartel, Ichniowski, and Shaw (2007) bear witness to this.

Culture and institutions also determine how much innovation an economy (or company)



                                                       50
can achieve (see, for example, Landes (1998), for a recent examination of this point).

No aggregate model can hope to capture all the complexity of the innovation process,

but the growth accounting model does provide something that the detailed studies do

not: a bottom-line metric of the importance of innovation in the process of economy-

wide growth.

       The benefits of this generalization come at the cost of accuracy. Some of the

flaws and limitations of the growth accounting model have already been put on display.

There are others, and three issues will be highlighted: whether the contribution of

capital accumulation can be separated from that of technical change; whether the MFP

model should be modified to reflect changes in consumer welfare; and how imperfect

competition affects the interpretation of the standard results.


                    A. Capital versus Technology: A Clear Division?


The decomposition of the growth rate of output (or output per worker) into its basic

sources, inputs and MFP, is the defining feature of the growth accounting approach.

The two sources arise from different processes: the accumulation of capital per worker

is linked to the propensity to save, while MFP is linked to the accumulation of

knowledge and the propensity to innovate. Under the usual assumptions about the

production function, the former may be subject to diminishing marginal returns while the

latter is not so burdened (although advances of knowledge tend to be sporadic and

come in waves), so sorting out the separate contributions is potentially important for the

question of sustained growth.




                                             51
        Unfortunately, the dichotomy between the two effects is not so clearly drawn in

reality. First, R&D expenditures are a form of capital formation, yet they are also the

source of much technical change. Second, there are mutual feedback effects in which

an increase in the MFP residual causes the amount of capital to increase, and the

increase in capital leads to spillovers that increase MFP. And, third, improvements in

technology are often embodied in the design of new capital goods. Each effect has

implications for growth accounting and will be discussed briefly.



1. R&D and its Coinvestments. It is well established that R&D expenditures have a

positive rate of return and that they are the source of much product and process

innovation (see Griliches (2000) for survey) and company valuation (B. Hall (1993)).

Since R&D has a positive marginal product, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that it

deserves to be treated as an input to production, and, in this vein, Griliches (1973)

showed how R&D capital might be incorporated into the growth accounting model on

the input side. R&D as an output in this model appeared in Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel

(2006) (CHS). The definition of output is expanded to include investments in R&D and

other intangibles, Ht, giving Q t = Ct,+It,+Ht = AtF(Lt,Kt,Rt), where Rt is the stock of R&D

input. The corresponding GDP accounting identity is also expanded to include the

value of R&D output; pCtCt+pItIt+pHtHt.39

        The growth accounting model that accompanies this expanded production

framework is a variant of the residual in (12). In optimal steady state growth, the R&D

terms cancel and could have been ignored in calculating MFP (the Jorgenson (1966)

39
   According to the estimates by CHS, adding a broad list of intangibles (pHtHt) expanded U.S. GDP by
around 10 percent relative to its conventional counterpart in 2003. This list includes brand equity and
organizational capital, in addition to R&D.


                                                   52
result in equation (21)), but then so do all the other capital terms. However, while

steady-state growth is a useful theoretical parable, it is not observed in real world data,

where capital terms generally do not cancel. In the CHS study, for example, the effect

of adding intangibles to a growth account of the U.S. non-farm business sector for the

period 1995-2003 is to reduce measured MFP from 1.42 percent to 1.08 percent. In

other words, the intangible capital terms of an expanded version of (21) do not cancel,

and their omission presents a rather different picture of the forces driving growth.


2. R&D Spillovers and Endogenous Growth. Growth accounting formulated in this way

still provides for a dichotomy between capital formation and productivity growth, but the

nature of the dichotomy has changed. It is no longer a story about technology versus

capital formation, but a story about costless advances in technology versus different

types of capital formation, including those that promote technical change. Costless

MFP growth arises from serendipity, inspiration, or the diffusion of technical knowledge

from the originator who bears the development cost to other users. 40

        The costless diffusion of knowledge leads to feedbacks effects that are central to

the endogenous growth model of Romer (1986) and Lucas (1988). This model has an

important implication for growth accounting, where diffusion appears as a spillover from

the stock Kt (one that includes R&D and human capital) to the level of MFP and thus

appears as a component of the Solow residual (Barro (1999) and Hulten (2001)). The

R&D spillover is illustrated in the production function Qt = Ae8tL"tK$tK(t :t, where ( is the

40
   Kendrick (1980) observes that “Informal inventive and innovative activity, including the myriad small
technological improvements devised by plant managers and workers, was the chief source of
technological progress in the nineteenth century, and is still significant (page 25).” The MFP residual was
a factor in growth before formal R&D programs were invented (as, for example, the case of the Corliss
steam engine noted above), and thus before R&D spillovers.



                                                    53
externality associated with K, and " and $ are the direct output elasticities of labor and

capital, the parameter 8 is the autonomous rate of productivity change, and : is an

“Abramovitz” term summarizing the other factors (errors and omissions) that affect

production. There are constant returns to scale to the direct inputs, "+$ =1, so the

overall production function exhibits increasing returns. However, producers do not

capture the externality and are in a constant-returns perfect-competition equilibrium with

respect to K and L, and the GDP/GDI identity thus holds. Under these conditions, the

standard Solow residual calculated as per equation (5) is equal to

                                  •

(5’)                      K& t + μ t .
               Rt = λ + γ
                          Kt μt

This makes the Solow residual an endogenous function of capital and adds structure to

the original Solow model (5). However, the presence of the regular “Solow” 8 and the

“Abramovtiz” : in (5’) indicates that the endogenous growth view does not invalidate or

replace growth accounting, it enriches it. Sorting out the relative importance of the

various effects is another matter, since all that growth accounting produces is the

residual Rt.

2. Simultaneity Bias and the Problem of Causality. The Lucas-Romer growth model

makes the residual an endogenous function of the growth in capital. Neoclasssical

growth theory points in the opposite direction: investment is a function of income, and

the growth rate of capital is therefore endogenous and depends, among other factors,

on the rate of technical change. An autonomous increase in the latter (e.g., via 8 in (5’))

will lead to an induced accumulation effect on capital that could plausibly be counted as




                                            54
part of the MFP effect in assessing the importance of technology as a cause of growth.

(Hulten (1975)).

        One solution to the capital-endogeneity part of the problem is to use the

Harrodian version of the MFP residual rather than the conventional Solow-Hicks model

(recall that the former is algebraically equal to the latter divided by labor’s share of

income) (see Rymes (1971), Hulten (1975,1979)). The ability to handle capital-

endogeneity is, indeed, the rationale for the Harrodian approach and the reason for its

use in neoclassical steady-state growth models. In growth accounting terms, the

Harrodian approach attributes the induced accumulation effect to the Harrodian version

of the MFP residual.41

3. Capital-Embodied Technical Change. A third problem with the simple dichotomy

between technology and capital formation arises when product-oriented technical

change occurs in capital goods. In this case, the rate at which new technology is

introduced depends on the rate of investment, and a clear division between the two as

independent sources of growth is, again, impossible. However, growth accounting can

accommodate capital-embodied technical change, as in the other cases in which the

capital-technology dichotomy is broken.

        The potential function in the capital-embodiment model is based on a

specification of production in which each vintage, <, of a capital good has its own

technology: Q< = f<(K<,L<). This formulation allows output and labor to be vintage


40
  It is perhaps worth noting that the Harrodian version of the residual can be computed without actually
having to impose Harrod-neutrality on the problem, though path independence may be a problem in this
case. Hulten and Isaksson (2007) provide a more detailed discussion of this issue, as well as a
comparison of the Harrodian and Hicksian residuals for a panel of high- and low-income countries. See
also the results of Hall and Jones (1999) and Klenow and Rodriguez-Claire (1997).



                                                   55
specific as well as capital (e.g., the case of computer numerically-controlled machines

tools above). Unfortunately, a model of this generality is usually not empirically feasible

because of its data requirements, since, with a few exceptions, input and output data

are not collected by vintage. This has led to three empirically tractable variations on the

general embodiment model.

       The first is Salter (1960), which directly compares plants of different vintages,

and tries to detect embodied technical change via differences in plant productivity. This

experiment is cleanest in cases like electricity generation in which the plant itself is

strongly vintage dependent, but as Gort and Boddy (1967) pointed out, technological

embodiment generally applies to capital that comprises only a fraction of the total capital

stock of a plant, so plant-based studies in most industries may not detect the true size

of the embodiment effect.

       The Johannsen (1959) putty-clay framework provides an alternative approach.

Different vintages are treated as though they were different techniques in the putty-clay

mode but, in practice, all putty-clay models are hard to work with, for the same reasons

as the Salter model but also because locking into any technique within the envelope of

choices requires expectations about future technology and prices that must be included

in the model.

       The Solow (1960) jelly-capital variant of the capital-embodiment model is the

closest to the growth accounting framework described in this survey. Solow derived a

form of the aggregate production function Q = AF(J,L) from the individual Q< = f<(K<,L<)

by assuming that each has the Cobb-Douglas form, and defining the ‘jelly’ stock of

capital J as the weighted sum of the K<. This formulation of the jelly-stock is essentially




                                             56
the same as the perpetual inventory formulation of the capital stock measurement with

quality change in capital goods, as represented by equation (18’) in which “better”

capital is equivalent to more units of capital.

        The link between the product quality literature and embodied technical change is

used in Hulten (1992b) to estimate the capital-embodiment effect in the growth

accounting context.42 The key conceptual issue that surfaces in this work is that there

are actually two versions of the embodiment model that could be used: the pure Solow

model in which embodiment only affects the capital stock but not the output of

investment goods (costless quality change in capital goods), and the Jorgenson (1966)

model in which capital-embodied technical change requires resources to obtain (i.e.,

R&D expenditures). Hulten (1992b) adapts the residual in (21) to accommodate both

views as special cases, by introducing an additional parameter into the term that is zero

for the Solow model and one for the Jorgenson model, but which can be sorted out

empirically.

        Some mention should also be made of the distinction between a change in

technology that affects investment via capital-embodiment (the production of “better”

investment goods) and disembodied technical change in the investment-goods

producing sectors that leads to cheaper investment goods of the same quality. Both

phenomena are at work in a modern economy and both are important, but they need to

be kept separate. The picture has become somewhat ambiguous with the paper on

42
   Estimates by Gordon (1990) were combined with a variant of the MFP residual in (21) to get at vintage
quality effects in the capital equipment used by the U.S. manufacturing industry. The quality-adjusted
equipment stock was found to grow at a significantly more rapid rate than its unadjusted counterpart (7.28
versus 4.37 percent) over the period 1949-1983, and the contribution of embodiment effects to the MFP
residual was about 20 percent. Wolff (1996) reports a somewhat larger number for the U.S. economy as
a whole, using different techniques, but concludes that his estimates are comparable when put on the
same basis.

change” and the critical reaction by Oulton (2007).43


                   B. Production Versus Welfare-Based Growth Accounting


1. The model set out in Section II is built on the assumption that output gross of

depreciation, and the corresponding production function, is the appropriate basis for

growth accounting. However, early contributors, like Denison (1962), based their

estimates on a welfare concept of product in which output is measured net of

depreciation. As Denison puts it: “The proper goal of society and objective of policy

clearly is the maximization of net product, from which this duplication [i.e., the

depreciation of capital] has been eliminated, rather than gross product (1962, page 24).”

The case for net output received a boost from Weitzman (1976), who linked annual

national income (not net output!) to the time-discounted flow of future consumption. The

net concept of output continues to be a viewed as a viable competitor to the traditional

GDP concept (e.g., Sefton and Weale (2006)).


43
   There are a number of other important contributions to the embodiment literature that merit a much
longer treatment. There is the Nelson (1964) average-age model, in which output, labor, and technology
are treated as aggregates, but capital enters the aggregate production function as individual vintages, not
as a jelly aggregate. In this formulation, embodiment effects enter via a variable that measures the
average ages of the stock. Variants of this model have subsequently appeared (Wolff (1996)), but they
tend to rely on econometric estimation rather than on pure growth accounting techniques.

Solow et. al. (1966) develop an ingenious vintage model without capital-labor substitution (see also Solow
(1987). Separate fixed-proportion functions, Q = f<(K<,L), are permitted, as are separate capital goods,
and an equilibrium is obtained that is similar to the aggregate solution. The obsolescence and retirement
of older, less-productive, types of capital due to competition from newer, more productive, capital goods is
the mechanism by which technology change takes place. This alternative formulation addresses the
common complaint levied against the neoclassical model (implausible substitution and aggregation
assumptions), and resonates with the mechanisms through which high-technology capital like computers
affect growth. It also leads to the conclusion that the equilibrium age structure of the capital stock will not
change even though superior new capital goods are appearing at a steady rate. See also the papers by
Harper (2007) and Diewert (2009).



                                                      58
        Since net income is a contemporaneous reflection of the future stream of

consumption and thus of consumer welfare, a concept of output net of depreciation (net

product) seems like a reasonable candidate for use in growth accounting. But what

would such a model look like? How would it compare or coexist with the Solow-

Jorgenson-Griliches gross output model? This issue can be explored by inserting the

terms on the Jorgensonian user cost (19) into the GDP/GDI accounting identity:


(22)     pCtCt + pItIt = wtLt + [(rt - Dt) pItKt + *pItKt].


The terms of the right-hand side of this equation are the components of gross value

added: labor income, the return to capital, and capital depreciation. Net product on the

left-hand side is obtained by subtracting the depreciation term from both sides of the

equation (Hulten (1992a), Hulten and Schreyer (2009)). Under geometric depreciation,

the perpetual inventory equation in (18) can be expressed as )Kt = It - *Kt, with the

result that (22) becomes


(22’)    pCt [Ct + (pIt/pCt) )Kt] = wtLt + (rt - Dt) pItKt.


The right-hand of (22’) is value added net of depreciation, or net income. The term in

square brackets, Nt = Ct + (pIt/pCt) )Kt, is then defined as net real output measured in

consumption units. It is also the concept proposed for a welfare-based MFP residual

based on (22’). But, following the rules of Divisia growth rates, there also needs to be a

potential function in order to obtain an index of the welfare-based MFP index, ANt.

Some form of the utility function is one possibility, but a net production function of the

form Nt = ANt G(Lt,Kt) seems closer to what Denison and others have had in mind. This



                                                   59
formulation says that labor and capital produce net units of output, and that the index

ANt is the residual net output not generated by those inputs.

        The problems with the net output approach are similar to the problems

encountered in choosing between industry output gross of intermediate goods and

industry gross (of depreciation) value added. 44 This analogy raises a parallel question

of interpretation. Does the interpretation of ANt make intuitive sense? To answer this in

the affirmative is to say that technical change and R&D spillovers augment output only

net of depreciation. That interpretation seems to be highly implausible given the nature

of technology.

        Indeed, what is net output as an economic entity, as opposed to net income?

The price and quantity of gross output, Qt, and its price can be observed from market

transactions, but net output Nt and its price cannot because that is not how transactions

are structured.45 Moreover, since capital and intermediate goods are produced within

the economic system, are they too to be treated as net outputs and therefore as net

inputs to production? What does a net input-output table look like?


44
   Under one interpretation of net output, the depreciation is really an intermediate good that should be
netted out against gross production just like any other intermediate good. In this view, capital is seen as
a bundle of productive services that are given up bit-by-bit over time as the capital good is used up in
production. The problem is that capital input comes in the form of services, not as bits of the physical
capital stock. Capital services may decline over the life of the asset, and this causes a loss in asset value
but not necessarily in its quantity. The case of the “one-hoss” shay (or “light bulb”) asset is a useful
example. The one-hoss shay retains its full productive capacity to generate services until it is retired from
service, with no part of the physical asset being “used up” along the way and thus no “intermediate good”
to deduct when figuring net product. The one-hoss shay asset does, on the other hand, lose its value over
time as the date of its retirement approaches. This value depreciation is a charge against income, not
against the physical amount of capital, and to equate the two is to commit the Triplett (1996) fallacy
(Hulten and Schreyer (2009)).
45
   The output of the auto industry, for example, is observed to be the gross volume of the vehicles that
emerge from the assembly line over a particular span of time (or their constant-price value). Fractions of
autos are nowhere in evidence (the fraction left over after a deduction for depreciation), nor are their net
prices and quantities evident in the show rooms. Subtracting depreciation from the value of the auto
yields a measure of the net income associated with auto production, not the volume of autos produced.


                                                     60
        An issue also arises when the rate of depreciation is not constant at a geometric

rate * (for example, when the pattern of depreciation has the “one-hoss shay” form).

The geometric case is convenient for this analysis because * is both the rate of

depreciation of the value of existing capital, and equally the rate at which this capital

loses its productive capacity. In the non-geometric case, these two processes follow

different time paths (Jorgenson (1973)), with the result that )Kt … It - *Kt, and the *pItKt

term on the right-hand side of (22) does not cancel out the corresponding term on the

left-hand side (Hulten and Schreyer (2009)). In this situation, net product is different

from net income, raising questions of interpretation and specification.

        If net output were the only way to introduce welfare considerations into growth

accounting, the problems might be tolerated (after all, the conventional gross output

residual is not without its own flaws). However, there is another way to bring the

consumption side of the economy into the growth accounts, a way that complements

the existing Solow-Jorgenson-Griliches gross output residual. A consumption-based

residual can be obtained from an analysis similar to that in Weitzman (1976), by

regarding capital as an intertemporal intermediate good (Hulten (1979)). In this

approach, the results of the Domar inter-industry aggregation can be applied to the

intertemporal welfare problem to yield an intertemporal residual that measures the shift

in the intertemporal production possibility frontier. Since the shift is measured along the

utility-maximizing path of the economy, it captures the change in consumption wealth,

and thus welfare, associated with costless technical change.46 Because this new



46
      Basu and Fernald (2002) make a similar point in an inter-industry context. They point out that the
shift in the production possibility frontier from the curve bb to aa in Figure 1 can be read as a change in
utility, as the economy makes the transition from one equilibrium point to another.


                                                     61
residual is the weighted sum of the standard MFP gross output residuals, where the

weights are equivalent to the Domar weights of inter-industry analysis, the two types of

residual are complements rather than substitutes (indeed, when technical change is

Harrod neutral and constant over time, the two concepts converge). By implication,

there is no need to replace the conventional gross-output MFP residual with one based

on net output in order to capture welfare effects.

2. The dividing line between the supply-side of economic growth and consumer

welfare is complicated further by the fact that product innovation sometimes leads to

goods that are entirely new to the market (the internet is a prime example). New goods

cannot be handled with the hedonic and price-overlap techniques used to adjust output

for changes in quality, because those techniques presume improvements in existing

models. When a new good appears, it typically brings with it an increase in consumer

surplus (see, for example, Hausman (1997)). Ignoring this consumer surplus (the usual

case) may end up understating the true magnitude of efficiency-adjusted output growth,

thus understating the role played by technical change as a source of growth during

periods of rapid innovation.


                        C. Beyond Perfectly Competitive Markets


The non-parametric (non-econometric) nature of growth accounting is made possible by

the assumption of competitive markets in which prices are equal to marginal cost. In

this case, cost shares are equal to the corresponding output elasticities. This equality

does not hold in non-competitive markets where prices are likely to deviate from

marginal cost. The marginal-cost markup developed by Hall (1988) explores this issue




                                            62
in the context of monopolist competition, as does Basu and Fernald (2002). Some

degree of monopolistic pricing is also an intrinsic part of the product variety and quality

ladder models described in Barro (1999), the Schumpeterian framework in Aghion and

Howitt (1992, 2007), and the models described in Greenwood and Jovanovic (2001).

These (and other) models introduce a degree of complexity and realism that goes

beyond the simple competitive-market framework.

        However, the added dose of realism comes at a cost. These models generally

require econometric solutions to get at the complexity of the resulting models (this is

apparent in equation (5’) which captures endogenous growth effects). The econometric

approach may correct for some of the biases in the non-parametric Solow MFP residual,

but it can introduce estimation and specification biases of its own (see, for example,

Nadiri and Prucha (2001)).47 Moreover, an added dose of realism is not the same thing

as realism itself. It has been known for a long time that the conditions under which

capital and technology can be functionally aggregated are extremely unrealistic (again,

Fisher (1965, 1969)).48 There are also many omitted, mismeasured, or unquantifiable

variables that affect growth but are not captured by existing models or are not in the

data needed to test the models. The real world is a very messy place, and fundamental

47
    “We note that any misspecification of the underlying technology of the firm will typically lead to
inconsistent estimates of technical change and the determinants of the investment decisions. A simple
illustration of misspecification is the case where the true technology is translog but the hypothesized
model is Cobb-Douglas, or the case where the input adjustments involve considerable time lags but are
ignored, or where the expectation process is not taken into account or not formulated properly” (Nadiri
and Prucha (2001), page 104). The Cobb-Douglas functional form is widely used in macroeconomic
models of economic growth (but typically not in growth accounting)
48
   In the first sentence of his 1957 article, Solow leaves no doubt on this point: “ … it takes something
more than a “willing suspension of disbelief” to talk seriously of the aggregate production function.” This
remark applies equally to non-parametric growth accounting and to production function estimation. By
extension, it requires a further leap of faith to believe that adding theoretical bells and whistles to the
aggregate production function will significantly increase the realism of the analysis. The role of the
production function is to organize the data in an internally consistent way, and to serve as a framework for
interpreting the results.


                                                    63
technological innovation is often idiosyncratic and episodic (Weinberg (2006)). In this

context, different empirical and theoretical growth models (including the simple growth

accounting model) are better seen as complements that offer different insights into the

growth process rather than as competing descriptions of reality.


                                       V. Conclusion


The Solow residual is now some 50 years old. It has evolved over time and has

become the work horse of empirical growth analysis. As Solow (2001) puts it: “Like my

children, it has aged well, and has produced many grandpapers (page 173).” The

residual is now part of the official statistical repertoire of many countries, through the

productivity program of the U.S. BLS, the newly developed EU-KLEMS productivity data

base, and the program at the OECD. What ever else its flaws may be, fecundity is not

among them.

       Because of this success, it seems fitting to end this survey with another remark

made by Robert Solow, this one in his 1987 Nobel Lecture:


       “… I would like to remind my colleagues and their readers that every piece of
empirical economics rests on a substructure of background assumptions that are
probably not quite true. For instance, these total-factor-productivity calculations require
not only that market prices can serve as a rough-and-ready approximation of marginal
products, but that aggregation does not hopelessly distort these relationships. Under
those circumstances, robustness should be the supreme econometric virtue, and
overinterpretation the endemic econometric vice. So I would be happy if you were to
accept that [growth accounting results] point to a qualitative truth and give perhaps
some guide to orders of magnitude” Solow (1988), page xxii.

What qualitative truth does growth accounting reveal? This, of course, depends on the

country, the sector, and the time period of the analysis. For the U.S., BLS estimates for

the U.S. private business sector show that output per unit labor grew at an average



                                             64
annual rate of 2.5 percent per year over the period 1948 to 2007. At this rate, the level

of output per worker more than quadrupled, a stellar performance considering the length

of the period involved and the fact that output per worker is one of the key factors that

determine the standard of living. What accounts for this success? BLS estimates

indicate that somewhat more than half (58 percent) of the increase was due to the

growth in MFP and the balance to input growth. Within the latter, there was a shift in

the composition of capital toward information and communication technology (ITC)

equipment.

       Growth accounting also reveals that the growth rate of Europe over recent years

was only half that of the U.S. This result comes from the analysis of the EU-KLEMS

data set for the period 1995 to 2005 by van Ark et. al. (2008), which reveals that output

per hour worked in the market economies of the 15 countries in the European Union

grew at an average annual rate of 1.5 percent, while the corresponding rate in the U.S.

was 3.0 percent. Moreover, the drivers of growth were quite different: MFP explained

about one-half of the U.S. growth rate, but only one-fifth of the EU rate. EU growth

relied more heavily on the growth of capital per hour worked, and within capital, more

heavily on non-ITC capital.

       These two comparisons, BLS and EU/US, are based on a concept of capital that

excludes intangible assets like R&D, brand equity, and organizational capital. As noted

in Section III, adding these intangibles to the growth account for the U.S. changes the

picture substantially. Corrado, Hulten, Sichel (2006) report that the inclusion of

intangibles increases the growth rates of output per hour in the U.S. non-farm business

sector by 10 percent for the 1995-2003 period. This is a small overall effect, but the role




                                            65
of MFP as a driver of growth changes significantly, moving from 50 percent without

intangibles to 35 percent when they are included. The role of ITC capital is also

diminished, and intangible capital is found to account for more than a quarter of growth.

A similar pattern is found in the U.K. during roughly the same period, though the

contribution of MFP is smaller both with and without intangibles (Haskell and Marrano

(2007)). Fukao et. al. (2007) find that the introduction of intangibles also matters in

Japan’s growth accounts, though tangible capital is by far the most important source of

growth, and the contribution of MFP growth is quite low. As with the EU versus US

comparison, different countries exhibit different patterns of growth.

       The same is true of broader cross-national studies that include developing

economies, though problems of data quality and availability make even qualitative

comparisons problematic. Hulten and Isaksson (2007) show that the dichotomy

between MFP and capital formation depends heavily on what assumptions are made

about labor’s share in income: when the labor share as actually reported in the data is

used, MFP has a negative growth rate in the low and middle-income countries of the

world (excluding the rapidly growing Asian Tiger economies); when a common labor

share of two-thirds is imposed on the analysis, MFP growth rates are higher for all

country groups (an average increase of 0.80 percentage points to an average growth

rate of 1.05 percent per year), and only the low-income economies exhibit negative

MFP growth. The main contribution of growth accounting in this situation lies in its

ability to identify a glaring need for better data. Growth accounting is, first and last, a

diagnostic technique that relies more on good data than on high theory.
