I.   INTRODUCTION

     Attempts   to measure the impacts of pensions on household saving

have occupied much of the literature in empirical public finance over

the past decade. From a theoretical perspective, identifying the

channels through which pensions affect the intertemporal consumption

decision can help to distinguish among motives for saving (e.g., for

retirement consumption or for bequests) and to explain empirical

findings of the relationship between wealth and lifetime earnings.

Proper quantification of the effects of pensions on saving is important

for analyses of intergenerational equity, bequests and income

distribution, and tax policy and saving.

     Most of the attention in the pension—saving controversy has focused

on the social security system, beginning with the time—series studies of

Feldstein (1974).1 The theoretical argument of Feldstein (and of Barro,

1974, 1978) has centered around the funding status of social security,

i.e., the degree to which an unfunded social security system reduces

private saving. Empirical tests of the effects of social security on

saving in this vein have been conducted in the perfect certainty version

of the life—cycle model (Modigliarti and Ando, 1957; Modigliani and

Brumberg, 1954).2 In that approach, social security affects wealth

accumulation only through its impact on individual intertemporal budget

constraints. Disposable income falls by the amount of the tax. To the

extent that the present value of benefits exceeds the present value of

taxes paid, an increae in lifetime resources is generated, raising

consumption in all periods.

     The emphasis here is on the annuity insurance aspects of social

security and pensions; uncertainty over length of life figures
                                  —2—

 prominently in the explanation of the impact of pension annuities on

 non—pension saving. The evolution of public and private pensions is

 reviewed in response to missing markets for providing insurance for

 consumption in the fact of uncertain lifetimes. A simple life—cycle

 model is put forth in Section II to show that even
                                                      an actuarially fair,

 fully funded social security system can reduce individual saving by more

 than the tax paid. Hence, previous partial equilibrium estimates of the

 impact of social security on saving drawn solely from consideration of

the intergenerational wealth transfer at the introduction of the system

are, if anything, too small.3

     A related finding stems from the fact that under current U. S. law,

social security taxes and benefits are calculated only up to an earnings

ceiling. High—income individuals have incomplete access to the social

security annuity system. Hence, even in the absence of an explicit

bequest motive, the ratio of wealth to lifetime earnings could rise with

the level of lifetime earnings. Constrained access to publicly provided

pension annuities may provide an impetus to the growth of private

pension annuities.

     Individual wealth—age profiles are constructed in Section III given

uncertain lifetimes and social security. The large
                                                      partial equilibjium
saving impacts found in Section II are mitigated when initial endowments

are considered. Specifically, accidental bequests, which arise in the

model because of lifetime uncertainty, provide an intergenerational link

for saving decisions. To the extent that the introduction of social

security reduces the size of accidental bequests, the net effect of

social security on the consumption of subsequent generations is

diminished.
                                —3—

    Section IV extends the approach to private pensions. The fifth

section addresses empirical issues arising from the models of Section

III and IV, primarily with respect to how one should interpret

econometric estimates of "offsets" to individual saving attributed to

pensions. Using a model specification for individual wealth

accumulation from the literature, potential offsets are interpreted

according to the presence or absence of a bequest motive and according

to the ability of individuals to adjust their participation in private

pensions to counteract involuntary changes in social security. Some

conclusions and directions for future reserch are given in Section VI.




II. SOCIAL SECURITY AND SAVINGS IN A LIFE-CYCLE )DEL

    A. Consumer Saving Decisions

     The solution to an economic agent's intertemporal consumption

problem subject to a lifetime resource constraint requires the

equalization of expected marginal utilities of consumption across

time. Otherwise, an increase in consumption at one point in his life at

the expense of consumption at another time would raise lifetime utility,

indicating that the initial allocation was suboptimal. The introduction

of uncertainty generates a demand for insurance to diversify risks.

Where insurance markets are incomplete or missing, the firstbest

optimum may be unattainable.

     The type of uncertainty considered here is that over longevity;

agents do not know when they will die. Yaari's (1965) seminal paper

showed that with an uncertain lifetime, intertemporal utility

maximization can dictate saving for the possibility of living longer
                                      —4—

 than the expected lifetime to avoid deprivation in old age (excessively

 high marginal utility of future consumption).4 That excess saving can

 be large. Kotlikoff and Spivak (1981, P. 379) found that for plausible

 underlying parameter values, the present expected value of unintended

 bequests represented almost 25 percent of initial wealth for a single

 male aged 55.

      To emphasize this point, consider the following simple model.

Agents are assumed to be selfish, in the sense that no bequests are

desired. The retirement age Q is taken as exogenous, and individuals

live Q periods for certain. The probability of having died in the

interval [O,t] is        for each t; by assumption, Pt is equal to zero in

the interval [O,QJ. Individuals have an expected lifetime of D years,

with D' > D being the maximum age to which one can survive. That is, D

is just the weighted average of the years t in (Q+1, D'J, with weights

        for each t. Individuals receive a gross wage Wt in each period t

during their working period; wages are assumed to grow at rate g.

Income taxes on wages are levied at rate 0.

      Following Yaari (1965) and Barro and Friedman (1977), let
                                                                  utility
be additively separable, and let U(C) be evaluated contingent on being

alive at time t. That is, the consumer's intertemporal choice model is

given by


(1)          max   E(l—p) U(C) (1)t

subject to



                   Ct(l+r) = (1—0)   w (1+g)t
                                        —5—

where C, 5, and r represent consumption and the (constant) subjective

discount rate and real interest rate, respectively.

      Carrying Out the optimization in (1) assuming U(C) =
                                                                 ly
                                                                  C   yields an

optimal consumption stream of



            C =          (_+_rt/(1—y)   1 —       1/(1—y)

        The extent to which uncertainty over length of life affects the

stream of consumption depends on agents' degree of relative risk

aversion, a transformation of y, the elasticity of the marginal utility

function. The higher is an individual's degree of relative risk

aversion (or, equivalently, the lower is his intertemporal elasticity of

substitution in consumption), the slower will hIs consumption grow over

time.




      B. The Introduction of Social Security

        Access to a fair annuity market could remove the influence of

lifetime uncertainty on consumption. Individuals could exchange a

portion of their labor income when young to smooth consumption in old

age. This role of annuities as a mechanism for sharing uncertainty

about longevity is an integral part of Diamond's (1977) evaluation of

the social security system, in which he focuses on the absence of

complete markets for such contracts. Merton (1983) considers Pareto—
                                  —6—

 improving social security programs in an intertemporal model in which

 human capital is not tradeable. Eckstein, Eichenbaum, and Peled (1983)

 consider the Pareto—improving potential of mandatory social security in

 the context of market failure in competitive insurance markets in the

 presence of adverse selection in the paradigm of Rothschild and Stiglitz

 (1976) or Wilson (1977).

      If all individuals were identical in terms of their probabilities

of survival,5 then (with risk—neutral insurers) a competitive

equilibrium in the provision of fair annuities would be possible. The

existence of a competitive equilibrium may be precluded by asymmetries

of information between individuals and insurers. This is, of course,

the familiar "adverse selection" phenomenon discussed by Rothschild and

Stiglitz. (1976).6 There may be additional "moral hazard" or "free—

rider" barriers to the existence of an annuities market. If individuals

conjecture that the state will support them in deprivation, the need to

purchase annuities is diminished. A rigorous development of optimal

second—best provision of annuities Is beyond the scope of this paper.

      Public provision of the annuities through public pensions is one

possibility.7 Moral hazard problems still make voluntary participation

difficult. Consider, though, a public pension system ("social

security") of the following form. Individuals are compelled to pay a

payroll tax at rate t5 on gross wages, from which the social security

system Is funded. During retirement they receive annuity benefits St in

each period t until death. The budget constraint in (1) becomes

                                             —7—

If benefits are set according to a replacement rate of the terminal

wage, (i.e., where S =                  where R is the earnings replacement rate)
                                RWQ.

then the economy—wide actuarially fair benefit S satisfies the condition

that8



                                                               +       g

        Substituting the actuarially fair social security benefit into the

budget constraint in (4) yields

                                        t=Q+1




                                 =     (1—O+t(w—1))        w()t

where w arises because of the difference in discount rates under

certainty and uncertainty and is equal to


           D'
      (           (l+r)t)/( Z
                                     _pt)(1+r)t)
          t=Q+1            t=Q+1


Since w is greater than unity, the system generates an increase in

lifetime resources. Note that this increase in resources occurs even in

a system which is actuarially fair and fully funded (i.e., In which
                                     —8—

    contributions are invested and earn the market rate of return r in each

 period).9 In reality, the initial cohorts participating In social

 security received a rate of return greater than the actuarially fair

 return (see Hurd and Shoven, 1983). This analysis focuses only on an

actuarially fair system to point out that the negative impact of social

security on individual saving does not hinge on such initial
transfers. 10


        Table 1 shows the percentage increase in lifetime resources

generated by an actuarially fair social security system under various

assumptions about the real rate of interest and the social security

payroll tax rate.:u For example, when r=0.04 and      t = 0.14,   a 32

percent increase in lifetime resources is afforded by an actuarially

fair social security system. Because the system generates an Increase

in lifetime resources, saving is reduced by more than the amount of the

tax paid.

III. SOCIAL SECURITY AND DYNAMIC WEALTH ACCUMULATION

         A.   Individual Saving Behavior

        We can use the derivation from the previous section of the impact

 of mandatory actuarially fair social security on saving to study

 individual wealth accumulation over time. For any time t, the present

 value (at time 0) of an individual's accumulated stock of wealth, Kt

 (i.e., the present value of the "accidental bequest" of an individual

 who died in period t), can be expressed as

    The ratio Kt/VL tracks an individual's accumulated stock of assets

relative to lifetime earnings. In a world of no uncertainty over

longevity, Kt/VL is simply a function of age, and the results of the

basic life—cycle model are reproduced, as long as the present values of

social security contributions and benefits are equal. With lifetime

uncertainty, wealth is still built up relative to earnings during the

working period, but the rate at which consumption draws down accumulated

wealth depends on survival probabilities and relative risk aversion.

Because an actuarially fair social security system generates an increase

in individual lifetime resources, lifetime consumption rises. Much of

this increase in consumption comes during an individual's working life,

as the need to save for retirement is reduced. Depending on risk

aversion, while retirement consumption is higher in the presence of

social security, dissaving in retirement is likely to be less than in

the certainty case.'2

     The problem becomes more complicated when the insurance coverage

provided by social security is not the same across individuals. Suppose

again that there is a ceiling on the level of earnings against which

payroll tax rates and replacement rates are calculated. If that ceiling

is w in period 0 and grows at the same rate as the wage base, then the

 equation    (10) reveals that the ratio of wealth to lifetime earnings

 rises with the level of lifetime earnings, though at a decreasing

 rate.'3 This nonlinearity of saving rates with respect to lifetime

 earnings occurs in the absence of any explicit bequest motive.                                                    The
 Implications of this effect for studies of the relationship between

 bequests and lifetime resources will be discussed later.

        A related problem surfaces in the consideration of received

 bequests which augment lifetime resources. If we let A0 represent the

 initial bequest, then we can rewrite equation (10) as

aversion.    The initial capital endowment A0, which comes here from an

accidental bequest from the previous generation, raises the individual's

lifetime resources, increasing the consumption out of the present value

of labor income and reducing the ratio of accumulated wealth to lifetime

earnings. In the case in which participation in social security

annuities is higher for low—income individuals, initial wealth

endowments may smooth the nonlinearity in earnings of saving rates

brought about by such a social security system.

     To quantify the impact of social security and bequests on

individual consumption and wealth—age profiles, the model embodied in

equation (11) can be simulated for plausible parameter values.

Simulations were performed over a set of different values of r, g,

cS, and y.    The following relationships among the parameters are
                                        114
assumed: r > g, r > 6, and 6 > 0.                There is some evidence on the

value of y in the literature. In their study of household portfolio

allocation, Friend and Blume (1975) estimated the coefficient of

relative risk aversion to be in excess of 2.0, implying a value of Y of

at most —1.0. Farber's (1978) estimation of preferences of United Mine

Workers from collective bargaining agreements yielded estimates of the

 coefficient of relative risk aversion of 3.0 and 3.7. Here we use three

alternative values of y: 0.25, —        1.0,     and —3.0. g is assumed to equal

      Table 2 reports Kt/VL for selected ages. The optimization begins

 at age 20; individuals are assumed to retire at age 65. Figures are

 expressed as differences from the no—social security case. Column 1

 reports values in the absence of social security, but with an initial

 bequest equal to 25 percent of lifetime earnings. Column 2 reports the

       Several interesting patterns emerge. As expected, higher values of

relative risk aversion (lower values of y) encompass higher wealth in

all periods, particularly in old age. Given uncertainty over longevity

with no social security, an initial bequest of 25 percent of lifetime

earnings is almost completely consumed by age 75 when y      0.25.

When y = —1.0,     however, about 13 percent remains; nearly 20 percent

remains in the case in which y = —3.0.

       The second and third columns, which address the implied resource

gains made possible by access to actuarially fair social security,

display the reduction in K/VL attributable to social security (when

   =   0.14).   When the effective tax rate is less than the nominal tax

rate, the reduction in K/VL is smaller. Hence, effective participation

in social security which rises with income, ceteris paribus, leads to

saving rates which rise with earnings (and, a fortlori, stocks of wealth

which rise with earnings). As y is decreased (higher relative risk

aversion), the social security system permits greater wealth

decumulation in old age. In other words, the more risk—averse the

individual, the less of the "income effect" of social security

participation consumed prior to retirement. Those findings are

intuitive, since the value of annuity is highest for very risk—averse

individuals.

       The last column of Table 2 shows the combined impact on the wealth—

age profile of the combination of effective participation in social

security at the nominal rate (14 percent here) and the receipt of an

initial bequest. 'From the information in the first column of Table 2

and from a comparison of the second and fourth columns, most of the

impact of Initial bequests on consumption occurs prior to retirement.
                                           — 17




That is, the differences in K/VL in old age (with respect to the no—

social security case) are almost invariant to the initial bequest (at

least in the range examined here).

       We can now consider the issue of the consumption pattern of the

elderly, addressed earlier by Hirer (1979) and by Davies (1981). Given

uncertainty over length of life, the rapid reduction in consumption

(relative to lifetime resources) in old age confirms the findings in

Davies (1981) that positive net worth may continue indefinitely after

retirement. The resulting slow decline (or possible increase) in net

worth in retirement ignores, however, the decline in the value of the

social security annuity. Since the model implies that individuals

acknowledge the actuarial value of their social security holdings, that

dissaving must take place.

       For each year t in retirement, withdrawals to finance consumption

relative to lifetime earnings can be expressed as



           ct =
                           (1   - + t(w-1)) (1+r)()
(12)

                     i=O

Correspondingly, in each year t,               the   decline in the annuity value of

social security relative to lifetime earnings is



                St
                        s(1 — p )         tS   (1 — p

                                         i=Q+1
       The relationship between these two uses of total (pension plus non—

pension wealth) depends on y and the distribution of survival

probabilities. To see the importance of considering the "dissaving" of

annuity wealth, Table 3 contrasts consumption and annuity revaluations

Note that annuity dissaving (the reduction in the actuarial value of the

social security annuity) is substantially greater than the reduction in

non—pension wealth.

      To estimate correctly the net effect of social security on

Individual consumption and wealth accumulation after the commencement of

the system, we must also consider its impact on intergenerational

transfers (here, accidental bequests). By affecting the accidental

bequests of previous generations, social security further influences

individual consumption patterns. It is to this issue which we now turn.




B. Long—Run Effects on Individual Saving

      Given uncertainty over length of life, an actuarially fair social

security system can reduce individual savingby more than the amount of

the taxes paid. For plausible underlying assumptions about individual

discount rates, survival probabilities, and the intertemporal elasticity
                                  — 19 —



of   substitution in consumption, the magnitude of that reduction is

substantial. The partial equilibrium conclusion is clear ——   estimates
of the reduction in individual saving brought about by social security

which focus only the extent to which the system delivers a present value

of anticipated benefits greater the present value of taxes paid are, If

anything, an underestimate. Before discussing general equilibrium

interpretations of this finding (in the sense that the wage rate and

real interest rate are endogenous and respond to changes in the saving

rate), It is important to address the issue raised in the simulation

exercises of the links among generations provided by accidental

bequests.

      An initial bequest from an "early death" of one's parent raises the

beneficiary's consumption relative to lifetime earnings. In the model,

the size of that bequest depends on the testator's coverage by social

security and his age at death. By facilitating greater consumption out

of lifetime earnings, social security reduces the accidental bequest.

On that account, the Initial resources available to the heir (and, from

Table 2, consumption when young) are lower. Even within the partial

equilibrium analysis, the impact of social security on the consumption

and saving patterns of individuals in a given generation depends on the

balance between the effective increase in lifetime resources made

possible by access to a fair annuity and the reduction in inheritances

because of that impact on the saving of the previous generation.'7

      To see this more clearly, note that for an individual receiving an

accidental bequest from a "parent" who died at age t in the interval

EQ + 1, D'J, the reduction in the bequest because of the parent's

participation in social security is18

security on saving n generations after its introduction, an n—

generational analogue to equation (15) could be constructed given the

ages of death of previous testators. The role of family mortality

history is important here, as individuals whose "ancestors" all died

impact of a pay—as—you—go social security system on the capital stock in
a general equilibrium. For plausible parameter values, he found that

the positive lifetime wealth increment traceable to social security

(because of growth of the wage base) caused a twenty—percent steady—

state reduction in the capital stock in the general equilibrium.21

While this is certainly substantial, it is roughly half of his partial

equilibrium effect, which is directly related to the extent to which

benefits are unfair (i.e., to the extent that the present value of

benefits exceeds the present value of social security taxes paid).

     While general equilibrium calculations of the impact of social

security on aggregate saving are not performed here, it is useful to

differentiate the effects implied by the life—cycle model under

uncertain lifetimes from those implied by the perfect certainty life—

cycle model. First the partial equilibrium effect in the uncertain

lifetime framework must be larger; the commencement of even an

actuarially fair, fully funded social security system will substantially

reduce individual saving. When the effect of social security on

accidental bequests (which arose from the life—cycle model under

uncertain lifetimes) is considered, however, the partial equilibrium

impact is reduced over time. Smaller changes are induced in factor

returns, so that the divergence between the general equilibrium impact

and the partial equilibrium impact (including the intergenerational

component) will be reduced.

early   will receive large bequests relative to those whose parent lived a

long time.

     Members of the first generation to participate in the social

security system benefit in two respects, as their lifetime resources are

augmented both by the bequests from the (uninsured) previous generation

and the gains from participation in the social security annuity

system. The reduced value of accidental bequests permits smaller

consumption gains for subsequent generations. While it is true that

social security reduces individual saving to a lesser degree in the

generations after its introduction, there is still a reduction in the

long—run capital stock. Ultimately, to consider the potential welfare

gains from compulsory pensions, the tradeoff between the benefits to

early participants from access to the annuities and the costs to

generations that follow of a lower capital stock must be examined.




C.   General Equilibrium Effects of Social Security on the   Capital   Stock
     The partial equilibrium effects of social security on individual

saving will be dampened in a general equilibrium analysis of the impact

of social security on aggregate capital formation.2° The reduction in

individual wealth accumulation brought about by social security will

induce changes in factor returns, exhibiting both income and

substitution effects on consumption. A higher real interest rate

decreases lifetime resources; in addition, a higher rate of interest

reduces the price of consumption in old age.

over longevity and a Cobb—Douglas production technology, considered the

IV • APPLICATION TO PRIVATE PENSIONS
    To the extent that high—income individuals (those for whom w > )

are constrained to less than their desired participation in social
security, there is excess demand for social security annuities. Adverse

selection and the possibility of multiple insurance22 still render

unlikely the provision of such annuities by competitive insurance

companies. Employer—sponsored private pension funds may act to fill

this gap. Employers are likely to have better information on individual

workers' life expectancies than would a disinterested insurance

company. Second, by definition, such annuities can only be purchased at

an individual's place of work; multiple insurance is not possible.

Finally, the pension instrument may provide an added degree of freedom

for the firm in influencing worker behavior.23

     The tax treatment of pension plans is an important consideration.

Social security taxes are levied on gross earnings, and prior to the

1983 amendments to the Social Security Act, benefits were not considered

taxable income. For private pension plans, employer contributions are a

deductible business expense and are not regarded as taxable income to

employees until benefits are paid. Pension fund earnings accumulate

tax—free until disbursement. Upon distribution, taxes paid on benefits

are presumably less than corresponding wage tax payments, since earnings

(and hence tax rates) are lower in retirement. Moreover, special

retirement income credits further diminish effective tax rates on

pension benefits.

     At this point, we will assume that covered workers take their

participation in plans as given; the implications of relaxing that

assumption will be discussed later. For simplicity, let P be the
                                            — 24    —



actuarially       fair pension benefit in retirement (determined by the

product of a replacement rate and the terminal wage) corresponding to an

 implicit reduction in wages at rate

       In the context of this model, the worker bears only (1—O)t of the

wage reduction, where 0 is the marginal income tax rate. Benefits are

taxed at rate 0, where 0 > 0. We introduce a parameter                   to measure the

extent to which benefits received are actuarially fair. That is, an

actuarially fair pension benefit P can be constructed just as in the

case of social security annuity benefits in equation (5). Benefits

received are equal to 8P, where P solves



(16)          P               —       + r)_t =               (1+)t

For received annuity payments to be actuarially fair, it must be the

case that         = 1;   less—than--fair benefits are associated with           < 1.

       Given participation in social security, the budget constraint in

(7) can be rewritten as



(17)         Ct(1+r)_t= (1-0-)(1-t)                 w()t + (S+(1-0)P) E            (1+rt

As shown before, w > 1.    As long as        is close to unity, for any

reasonable assessment of the relationship between 0 and 0,(1—0)w > 1—0—

This is certainly true for the estimated tax rates used by the Treasury

in calculating the tax expenditure associated with pension tax

subsidies, namely 0 =   0.23   and 0 =   0.115 (See Munnell, 1982, p. 44 for

details). Because of the tax deductibility of pension contributions,

even in a world of certainty over longevity (w=1), a funded private

pension can still generate an increase in lifetime resources for the

individual.

     The tax treatment of pension contributions reinforces the role of

private pension annuities in alleviating the rationing of public

annuities. The effective contribution rates (participation rates) in

the public and private pension systems both depend on the income of the

individual. Recall that          t(/w0), where w is the ceiling on taxable

earnings. Under a progressive tax system, the marginal tax rate also

depends on income (i.e., 0(w) > 0).            Hence for given (assigned)

nominal participation rates in social security and private pensions,

high—income individuals receive a greater effective increase in lifetime

resources from private pensions of the sort described here. This effect

may be desirable if one reason for the private pension system is to

supplement the rationed access to social security annuities for high—

income workers. Capital market imperfections and borrowing restrictions

would still limit the demand for pension annuities.

     We can now reconstruct the wealth—age profiles given both social

 security and private pensions. Wages and public and private pension

 annuity payments are the sources of income to the individual. w Is

 zero in the interval [Q+1, D'], and St and P are zero in the Interval

       If        =   0, then the impact of a change in holdings of social
security annuities has the same influence on lifetime resources as

before. When              < 0 (i.e., increases in involuntary social security

annuitization can be at least partially undone through changes in

private pension participation), the impact of social security on

individual wealth accumulation will also depend on the extent to which

private pension annuities are actuarially fair (i.e., on the value of

8) and on the tax advantages of pensions as compensation (values

0 and 0).

       When coverage by social security is higher for low—wage earners

 than for high—wage earners, we can use equation (13) to examine the

 impact on non—pension wealth of change in the social security payroll

 tax rate (index of participation). First, since the effective tax rate
       =   t   Cw/w0), a given increase in the nominal tax rate translates into

a smaller increase in V (and, ceteris             paribus,   a smaller displacement

of non—pension wealth) for high—income workers (for whom w > ) than

for low—income workers (for whom > w). When private pension

participation is responsive to changes in social security annuity

holdings (i.e., when              < 0), then for a given offset factor          high—
income individuals receive a smaller total offset than low—income

individuals 25

           In the next section, we take up issues associated with empirical

treatment of forms of (18), emphasizing the role of assumptions about

the structure of social security and private pensions, the presence or

absence of a bequest motive, and the extent to which participation in

private pension annuities is voluntary.



V•   EMP IRICAL     ISSUES

           Gathering   econometric evidence of the impact of social security and

private pension annuities on household saving in the context of lifetime

uncertainty entails estimation of the wealth profiles consistent with

equation (18). Suppose one has a cross—section of household or

individual data with information on earnings, assets and liabilities,

pensions, and individual and labor—market characteristics. Most previous

empirical examinations of the impact of social security on non—pension

wealth have employed versions of the following specification:



(21)            Wi =   f(Y,   A1, z1) — Pw1,
                                        — 29 —




where i refers to the individual and W, Y, A, Z, and 'PW are non—pension

wealth, lifetime earnings, a vector of socioeconomic variables and

individual characteristics, and the actuarial present value of

anticipated pension benefits, respectively.

       Consider for example a wealth accumulation equation of the

following form:



(22)            =
                    g(Y)   +
                               j(A.)   —
                                           a(.S ).   — a(.1). + I       +   C•.



Anticipated   pension benefits are divided into two components, social

security (sSW) and private pensions (PPW), to allow for different

effects on saving. a5 and a are coefficients to be estimated. j is a

function of age. Finally, the function g can be specified to test the

nonlinearity in income of the ratio of wealth to permanent income.26

       Recalling the wealth—age profiles constructed from the theoretical

model in the previous section, the specification of wealth accumulation

in (22) illustrates the importance of the inclusion of the pension

variables. With respect to social security, if individual earnings

 replacement rates are negatively correlated with earnings for high—

 income workers (as in the U.S. system), the measured effect of             on

WIY* would be biased upward if the social security variable were

 omitted. The correlation of PPW/Y with              is less clear. Similarly,

 if one wanted to use (22) to interpret the impact of social security on

 saving, then omitting the private pension variable biases the estimate

 of a toward zero. The extent of the bias depends on the degree of

 "integration" of the benefits of the two systems and on the extent to

 which private pension participation is discretionary.
                                           — 30




      Many recent the empirical studies have tried to isolate the impact

of pensions on the level of non—pension saving (using cross—section

data) in models similar to (21) or (22). Estimating a version of (22)

in level form, Feldstein and Pellechio (1979) found that an extra dollar

of social security wealth reduced non—pension wealth by approximately a

dollar, using data from the Federal Reserve Board's 1962 Survey of

Consumer Finances; they had no data on private pensions. Some of their

specifications also found a positive relationship between the ratio of

net worth to permanent income and the level of permanent income. Using

data from the Retirement History Survey, Diamond and Hausman (1982)

found a social security offset of 30 to 50 cents (with a smaller non—

pension wealth reduction for changes in private pension wealth). They

also found evidence of a positive relationship between W/Y and Y.

     Employing a logarithmic form of (22) for Canadian data, King and

Dicks—Mireaux (1982) estimated the offset to non—pension wealth from a

one—dollar increase in social security wealth to be 24 cents (10 cents

for private pensions), with offsets of approximately dollar—for—dollar

for individuals in the top decile of the wealth distribution. Hubbard

(1983) estimated a similar model for the U.S. (using data from the

President's Commission on Pension Policy), finding a mean offset for

social security wealth of 33 cents (16 cents for private pensions), with

social security offsets in excess of dollar—for—dollar for those in the

top decile of the wealth distribution.

     Whether the versions of (21) and (22) used in the empirical studies

described above can be justified according to a consistent set of

economic assumptions depends on the structure of annuity markets and on

whether or not a bequest motive exists. The basic model presented
                                      — 31




earlier assumes complete market failure in the private provision of

annuities and the absence of a bequest motive. Theoretical

possibilities encompass assumptions along the dimensions of

"perfectness" of private annuity markets and the presence or absence of

a bequest motive.

     In addition, econometric estimates of the impact of private pension

annuities on non—pension wealth accumulation as well as of the links

between changes in social security annuities and private pension

participation are necessary for an empirical consideration of the impact

of the social security system on individual saving. The latter link is

both important and not often noted. That annuity markets are extremely

imperfect in the real world is not evidence per se of a severe market

failure, as individuals have some control over their participation in

private pensions either explicitly (for participants in defined—

contribution plans) or implicitly (through choice of employer). To the

extent that individuals adjust their pensions for variation in social

security annuities, the effective annuity market may be quite large.

The magnitude of that adjustment must be resolved empirically.

     As an empirical proposition, it is important to ascertain the

degree of discretion in individual private pension plan participation.

We can consider an auxiliary model of the form



          1PPW '                      (SSW
(.
          L       *   ).   —

              Y                        Y


where         as before, represents the adjustment of private pension

annuities to involuntary changes in social security annuities. Again,

apart from issues of substitutability (i.e., if =1), a value of zero
                                  — 32 -




for   p   indicates no discretion in pension participation;      —   1


indicates complete discretion.

       Given the assumption of market failure in the provision of non—

pension annuities, four potential cases can be considered along the two

dimensions of (1) bequest motives and (ii) discretion in private pension

participation. As a first case, suppose that there is no bequest motive

and that private pension participation is exogenous to individual

decisions. The offset to non—pension wealth of a change in compulsory

social security annuities corresponds to the level described earlier;

that is, the present value of anticipated (actuarially fair) social

security benefits should displace non—pension wealth by more than dollar

for dollar (in the absence of capital market restrictions). If

effective replacement rates are nonlinear in earnings, high—income

individuals are rationed in their access to social security annuities,

and saving rates will rise with the level of permanent income.

       Second, suppose that while there is no bequest motive, private

pension participation is completely under Individual control. In the

limit, if private pension annuities are also actuarially fair

(=1 in equation (17)), there would be no restricted access to fair

annuities, and WIY* would be independent of the level of Yk.

Involuntary increases in compulsory annuities (social security) would be

completely reflected in reduced holdings of private pension annuities

and not in the level of non—pension wealth. For intermediate versions

of this second case, both a smaller offset to non—pension wealth from a

change in social security benefits and a smaller effect of      on W/Y

would be expected relative to the first case.
                                — 33 —




    The existence of a bequest motive changes the predicted effect of

changes in compulsory social security annuities on the level of non—

pension wealth and complicates the distinction of "annuity rationing"

effects from the data. The third and fourth cases embody the sort of

"bequest motive" described above, evidenced by levels of non—pension

wealth relative to permanent income that rise with permanent income.27

    The third case is described by the existence of an operative

bequest motive in conjunction with discretionary private pension

participation. In this case, involuntary changes in social security

participation will have no impact on non—pension wealth; the changes are

counteracted by offsetting movements in private pension holdings. With

discretion in pension participation, there is no restriction of "fair"

annuity purchases, so that a nonlinear relationship between WIY* and

is traceable to the desire to leave bequests.

     The fourth case combines a bequest motive with exogenous

participation in private pensions. Again, the reduction in non—pension

wealth attendant to an increase In holdings of social security annuities

will be less than in the first case. An observation that saving rates

out of permanent income increase with permanent income could reflect a

combination of a bequest motive and rationed access to pension

annuities.

     The cases are summarized with respect to interpretations of the

offset parameter a and nonlinearity of the ratio of non—pension wealth

to permanent income with respect to permanent income in Figures 1 and 2

below. Note that the predicted effects of changes in social security

wealth and of changes in permanent income on individual wealth

accumulation depend greatly on assumptions about bequest motives and on
                                    — 34 —



the   size of the effective private annuity market afforded by access to

private pensions. In reality, of course, the degree of discretion in

private pension annuity holdings can vary anywhere between "none" and

"complete." Estimation of the impact of changes in compulsory social

security annuities on holdings of private pension annuities (e.g.,

equation (23) above) can help to allocate observed nonlinearities of

saving rates with respect to the level of earnings between annuity

rationing and bequest motives.28

observed nonlinearity In the wealth—income relationship reflects both a

social security.




VI. CONCLUSIONS AND EXTENSIONS

     Assessing the impact of social security and private pensions on

individual wealth accumulation is important for many analyses of

welfare, capital formation, and equity in the distributions of income

and wealth. Previous research efforts along the lines of Feldstein

(1974) have addressed the funding status of social security and

pensions. The focus here is on insurance features of pension annuities

with respect to the problem of uncertainty over length of life.

     The first part of the paper considers the introduction of social

security into an economy with market failure in the provision of private

annuities. The principal findings are three. First, in such a world,

even an actuarially fair, fully funded social security system can

substantially reduce individual saving, though individual welfare Is

initially improved. Hence, partial equilibrium estimates of the Impact

of social security on saving which rely solely on the extent to which

individuals earn a more than fair return on social security are

underestimates of the true effect.

     Second, under current U. S. law, social security taxes and benefits

are calculated only up to an earnings ceiling. High—income individuals

have incomplete access to the social security annuity system. Hence,

even in the absence of an explicit bequest motive, the ratio of wealth

to lifetime earnings would rise with the level of lifetime earnings.

     The theoretical results in sections II — IV and the summary of

implications in Figures 1 and 2 facilitate interpretation of the

coefficients of (22). We can infer information about bequest motives

and the impact of involuntary changes in social security annuities on

non—pension wealth. First, consider the case in which the wealth—

earnings relationship exhibits little nonlinearity in earnings. As

    approaches minus one, the model implies no bequest motive (of the

sort outlined here) and no substantial impact of changes in social

security on the level of non—pension wealth. As           approaches zero,

the implication of no bequest motive is joined by the prediction of a

significant impact of a change in social security on non—pension wealth.

     Second, suppose that the ratio of wealth to permanent income

increases with permanent income. As           approaches unity in absolute

value, a bequest motive is ratified (since discretionary pensions

provide an effective annuity market); the impact of involuntary changes

in social security will fall almost entirely on holdings of private

pension annuities. The closer is          to zero, the greater will be the

impact of changes in social security on non—pension wealth, so that the
                                — 37 —




Constrained access to publicly provided pension annuities may provide an
impetus to the growth of private pension annuities.

     Third, the partial equilibrium impact of social security and

private pension annuities on non—pension saving is reduced when initial

endowments are considered. For example, to the extent that the

introduction of social security reduces the size of accidental bequests,

the net effect of social security on the consumption of suceeding

generations is mitigated. In addition, general equilibrium

considerations, primarily the endogeneity of factor returns, can be

expected to reverse part of the partial equilibrium impact. Because of

these two considerations, the impact of social security on the steady—

state capital stock is likely to be smaller than the partial equilibrium

impact.

     To provide an interpretation of econometric measures of the impact

of pensions on non—pension saving, two additional considerations are

important. Theoretical possibilities encompass assumptions along the

dimensions of "perfectness" of private annuity markets (in this case,

the ability to adjust private pension participation in response to

involuntary changes in social security annuities) and the presence or

absence of a bequest motive. Four cases are generated, as shown in

Figures 1 and 2 in the text. The predicted effects of changes in social

security wealth and of changes in permanent income on individual wealth

accumulation depend on assumptions about bequest motives and on the size

of the effective private annuity market afforded by access to private

pensions.

     Two immediate extensions to the models presented here are left as

tasks for future research. First, additional research is needed on
                                  — 38 —



private   annuity markets to determined the actual extent of market

failure. Second, given the current political environment, introducing

uncertainty over future social security benefits may be appropriate.

That uncertainty would modify the wealth impacts derived here.

     The debate over the influence of pensions on individual saving

brings together questions of consumer choice under uncertainty and the

effectiveness of fiscal policy. Researching the relationships among

social security, private pensions, annuity markets, and bequests

facilitates close empirical scrutiny of models of individual and

aggregate saving, permitting consideration of the welfare effects of

compulsory pensions. In addition, while this paper has concentrated on

annuity insurance, similar approaches could be used to study the impacts

of other social insurance programs on national saving.

                                 NOTES



'Earlier studies for private pensions include those of Cagan (1965),
Katona (1964), and Munnell (1974). Feldstein's results have by no means
gone unchallenged; see for example Leimer and Lesnoy (1982) and the
reply in Feldstein (1982). Microeconomic (cross—section) evidence has
generally been supportive of the proposition that social security has
reduced individual saving. See Feldstein and Pellechio (1979),
Kotlikoff (1979b), Blinder, Gordon, and Wise (1981), Diamond and Hausman
(1982), King and Dicks—Mireaux (1982), and Hubbard (1983).

2Empirical tests of the life—cycle model under certainty have tested the
hypothesis of a hump—shaped wealth—age profile, but results have by no
means unambiguously validated the model. See for example WhIte (1978),
Mirer (1979), and Kurz (1981). Even after controlling for the effects
of permanent income, Blinder, Gordon, and Wise (1981), Diamond and
Hausmari (1982), King and Dicks—Nireaux (1982), and Hubbard (1983) found
results only mildly supportive of the basic theory. Other studies have
addressed the possibility of other motives for saving. Kotlikoff and
Summers (1981) reject the ability of the life—cycle model to explain
wealth accumulation in the U. S., putting forth a major role for
bequests.

3Abel (1983) takes up the intergenerational consequences of this point
in a two—period overlapping—generations model, with the implication that
the insurance features of social security may reduce inequality in the
distribution of wealth.

4me precise  direction of the influence of this uncertainty for saving
is unclear. Heightened uncertainty over the length of life may lead to
more saving (because of a longer than expected lifetime) or to less
saving (to maintain present consumption). In the argument of Yaari
(1965), two individuals with identical tastes, income, and investment
opportunities are compared. The difference between them is that one
lives T periods for certain while the other faces an uncertain lifetime
of t periods, up to a maximum of T periods. Given a shorter expected
life, uncertainty over length of life unambiguously leads to increased
initial consumption. Champernowne (1969) and Levhari and Mirman (1977),
on the other hand, consider two agents with identical expected lives,
but differing the distribution of length of life. In either case, the
impact of uncertainty over the length of life on wealth accumulation of
a risk—averse individual Is ambiguous and depends on the parameters of
the model.

5Note that this does not require that they actually die at the same time.

6Rothschild and Stiglitz (1976) show that there will be no "pooling
equilibrium," where all buy the same contract. They illustrate
conditions under which a "separating equilibrium" occurs, in which
different contracts are purchased by the risk groups. Following their
argument and that of Riley (1979), if there is a fairly continous
distribution of survival probabilities, there is little hope for an
equilibrium. Eckstein, Eichenbaum, and Peled (1983) consider the
Pareto—improving potential of mandatory social security in the context
of market failure in competitive insurance markets in the presence of
adverse selection.

7Previous work in this area in the context of pensions includes the
contributions of Davies (1981) and Sheshinski and Weiss (1981). Davies
used a life—cycle model under uncertain lifetime to address the
phenomenon of slow dissaving in retirement. The presence of pensions in
his simulation model (using Canadian data) reduced, but by no means
eliminated, the effect of uncertainty on retirement consumption. In the
model of Sheshinski and Weiss, the ultimate impact of social security on
saving depends on the availability of a private annuity market. (The
problem will arise here in Section IV in the context of discretion in
private pension participation.) They found that, at the optimum,
Yaari's (1965) result holds, namely that private savings are reserved
for bequests, while social security benefits are used to finance
retirement consumption.

8The actuarially fair benefit is constructed with respect to economy—
wide survival probabilities. It is true that individuals who believe
they will die "young" will want to purchase less than the "average
optimal" amount of social security annuities, while those who expect to
live a long time will want more. Both groups are better off, however,
with the mandatory social security than without It, since in its
absence, adverse selection is assumed to foreclose the possibility of a
market of private annuities. A discussion of the potential separating
equilibria in the private provision of annuities which may arise after
the imposition of mandatory social security is given Eckstein,
Eichenbaum, and Peled (1983).

9While the imposition of the social security system increases lifetime
resources, nothing has been said about the optimal tax rate. Current
law prohibits the explicit leverage of anticipated social security
benefits. The ability to implicitly borrow against future benefits will
depend on differences in w0 (differences in ability to procure
"unsecured" loans). Under the assumption of complete (explicit and
implicit) nonmarketability of benefits, we can demonstrate that there is
an interior solution (0 < t< 1) for the individual's optimal tax rate
(a sufficient statistic of participation as long as benefits are
actuarially fair). The intuition is that while the purchase of "social
security retirement annuities" increases resources available in old age,
it decreases the resources available for current consumption. The
optimal tax ra t in such a world is just

10Uncertainty over future social security benefits would mitigate the
effect shown here. Watson (1982) discusses the influence of uncertainty
over benefits in assessing the impact of social security on saving.
Merton, Bodie, and Marcus (1984) show that many private pension
integration arrangements remove much of this uncertainty.

"A. retirement age of 65 was assumed. Probabilities for survival were
taken from Faber (1982).

       effect is most pronounced in the absence of explicit capital
market restrictions. With no initial endowment (and, hence, binding
restrictions on the nomarketability of social security when young),
relative impacts on "working—period" and "retirement—period" consumption
will depend on the relationship of the individual's actual and optimal
tax rate (participation). The importance of (accidental) bequests as
intergeneratIonal links wIll be discussed later.

'3ThIs nonlinearity has surfaced in some recent studies of the impact of
social security on saving. See for example Diamond and Hausman (1982)
and Hubbard (1983).

'4For a more complete discussion of the implications of the choice of
parameter values, see Levhari and Mirman (1977) or Davies (1981).

'5As in Table 1, survival probabilities are taken from Faber (1982).

16Note that if participation In social security Is rationed by Income,
low—income individuals have more of their retirement dissaving in the
form of reduction in the value of their social security annuity than do
high—income individuals. This analysis assumes that annuity and non—
annuity holdings are perfect substitutes In dissaving. The studies
cited in the beginning of the paper have found good but not perfect
substitutability of social security for non—pension wealth in
accumulation. Empirical evidence In Hubbard (1983) suggests that the
substitutability is greatest for high—income individuals.

171n a world with capital market restrictions, then, a social security
system of this type may increase saving, since received initial bequests
are more liquid than anticipated social security benefits. The Impact
of social security on intergenerational transfers Is an Important
component of the system's net effect on individual saving.

18The implicit assumption, of course, is that the parent dies at the
beginning of the child's (optimizing) life, age twenty here. This
assumption is made to highlight the point that the existence of social
security for the previous generation mitigates the impact of the present
generation's participation in social security on its own wealth
accumulation. More general assumptions about the timing of a testator's
death would complicate expressions like (14) in the text, but the
qualitative point would remain.

 '9This damping through intergenerational transfers of the impact of
 social security on wealth accumulation is mitigated if "children" earn
 more on average than their "parents" (because of productivity growth).
                                 — 42 —



20The consumption of individuals of each age can be calculated from
equations (17) and (18), given the initial wage. The growth rate of the
population will determine the relative number of persons at each age.
Aggregate consumption can be calculated by summing consumption over
ages, weighted by the relative population size.

21Kotlikoff's (1979a) analysis also incorporates the influence of social
security on retirement age, which is taken as exogenous here. To the
extent that social security lowers the desired retirement age, the
partial equilibrium wealth replacement effect of social security on
saving is dampened.

22The idea here is that an individual who thinks he will live a long
time would buy several small annuities rather than one large one in
order to misrepresent his assessment of his longevity. Companies know
his participation in social security, but not the extent to whIch he has
obtained insurance from other private sources. Pauly (1974) and Wilson
(1977) discuss certain situations in which market equilibria might occur
after a compulsory insurance program Is imposed.

23Lazear (1983) has focused particularly on this point, emphasizing the
role of pensions In influencing turnover, retirement, and investment in
human capital. Many arguments for the existence of private pensions
have emphasized their favorable federal tax treatment. Tax treatment
cannot be the complete explanation, since "defined contribution" plans
would dominate. "Defined benefit" plans are instead prevalent. Munnell
(1982) emphasizes both the tax benefits (to employers and to employees)
and the inadequacy of social security In explaining the growth of
private pension plans.

24Thfs ignores the possibility that firms may be willing to offer "more—
than—f air" plans to achieve some other impact on worker behavior. See
Lazear (1983).

25This is just the characteristic of "integration" of the benefits of
social security and private pension annuities. Since the passage of the
Revenue Act of 1942, Congress has allowed public (social security) and
private benefits to be considered together in determining whether a
private plan discriminates in favor of low—income workers. For
descriptions of typical integration provisions and discussions of their
prevalence In the U.S. pension system, see Munnell (1982) and Kotlikoff
and Smith (1983).

26Note that empirical evidence of saving rates Increasing with income
does not validate the hypothesis the bequests are a luxury good (even if
data on bequests are known), because of, among other things, rationing
of the purchase of pension annuities by Income.
                                — 43 —




27Such a bequest motive is usually grounded in work in the human capital
literature   (see for example Becker and Tomes, 1976, 1979). That is,
if human capital investment initially yield a higher rate of return than
that on financial assets, parents who "care" about their children invest
first in human capital up to the level at which the returns to
additional investment just equal the market return. Further transfers
are exclusively financial. Hence observed (financial) bequests will be
higher for children whose parents had significant resources than for
children with access to low parental resources. Despite serious data
limitations, there have been some recent efforts to estimate the
relationship between bequests and lifetime resources. The finding that
the ratio of bequests to earnings rises with the level of earnings is
corroborated in the careful empirical study of Menchik and David (1983).

28The problem of isolatIng a relatIonshIp between wealth (or bequests)
and lifetime resources if further complicated by the fact that price
effects may be present as well (e.g., a correlation between earnings and
after—tax financial returns). Government retirement saving policy can
bring about those price effects——tax—favored treatment of IRks and Keogh
plans, for example (see Hubbard, 1984). To the extent that changes in
government pension policy Involve tradeoffs among policy options (e.g.,
liberalized ceilings on tax—deductible IRA or Keogh contributions in
exchange for a reduction in social secuity benefits), the stability of
any observed relationship between wealth and earnings is all the nre
tenuous.
