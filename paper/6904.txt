cost, what is sometimes referred to as ‘the death of distance.’ A second fundamental difference lies in the
initial conditions. At the beginning of the first wave, the world was fairly homogeneous homogeneously
poor and agrarian, that is. At the beginning of the second wave, the world was sharply divided between rich
industrial nations and poor primary producers.

2 Industrialisation and Income Inequalities
   The late 20th century globalisation wave started with a very large North-South income gap and it de-
industrialised the North while industrialising the South (or some parts of it). The first globalisation wave
industrialised the North, de-industrialised the South, and produced enormous income divergence between
groups of nations that were not initially very far apart.
   This section documents these facts, turning first to the Industrial Revolution (which drove the first
globalisation wave), then to Third World de-industrialisation and finally to the income
convergence/divergence issue. The section ends with a simple analytic framework that lays out one
explanation of these curious contrasts.

2.1    Industrialisation and De-Industrialisation
2.1.1 The Industrial Revolution
    The outcome was revolutionary but the process was evolutionary. The Industrial Revolution, which
started in Great Britain, was a 100-year sequence of incremental technical, organisational, social and
institutional changes. These increments, however, gradually amalgamated into a massive transformation of
the British economy. The amalgamation’s starting date may be placed in the 1720s but it picked up speed
as the 18th century ended and the 19th began. Placing a precise year on the Revolution is misleading; the
growth acceleration was the fruit of many small transformations, not the result of a sharp policy or
technological change. Be that as it may, 1776 provides as good a landmark as any since Crafts (1995) finds
a structural break in the growth of British industrial production in that year. Conveniently, it is also the
publication date of Adam Smith’s The Wealth of Nations.
    The textiles and iron sectors played decisive roles in the industrial revolution, with key textiles
inventions coming in the 1730-1780 period. The 1780s also saw major breakthroughs in steam engine
technology. Important advances in ironmaking became widespread in the 1760s, 1770s and 1780s. Between
the 1770 and the 1840, significant progress by the British machine tool industry greatly improved the
precision and lowered the cost of turning iron into profitable goods such as steam engines, rails and looms.
    Improved transportation was important to the Industrial Revolution. Red-letter improvements in inland
water and road transportation networks appeared in the last decades of the 18th century. These expanded the
internal market for manufactured goods and lowered the cost of obtaining raw materials. For instance the
London-Birmingham road trip, which took two days in the 1740s, took ‘only’ 19 hours in the 1780s.
    Key transport-technology advances started the first globalisation wave in approximately 1820. The most
important were the rapid expansion of railroad networks (1820s-1850s), and the widespread use of steam-
driven ships for inland and oceanic routes (1840s-1870s), according to Hugill (1993). Railroads
revolutionised land transport by opening up vast tracts of land to the world market (earlier forms of land
transport were only economic for goods with very high value-to-weight ratios). Steamship likewise
revolutionised ocean travel. In the late 1830s, a top-class sailing ship from Liverpool could take up to 48
days to reach New York and 36 days to return. By the 1840s, steamships brought the normal voyage to 14
days in either direction (with much less variance). The 1870s saw further advances with the introduction of
steel hulls that were lighter, stronger and required less fuel.
    Finally, the whole process was fostered by the rapid development of financial intermediation (centred
on in London) during the last half of the 18th century.
    These advances radically re-oriented the British economy. The share of workers in industry rose
progressively from 19% (1700) to 24% (1760) to 30% (1800) to 47% (1840), finally peaking at 49% in
1870 (Crafts 1989:417). The nation also shifted from a rural society to having almost two-thirds of its
populations in urban areas. Although rapid total-factor-productivity growth was not remarkable, according
to Nick Crafts, labour productivity did rise rapidly in some industries. From 1830 to 1860, output per hour
rose 270% in cotton spinning and 708% in cotton weaving (Crafts 1989:426). During the same period,
3


Great Britain became a large food importer and a large exporter of industrial goods.
    The growth effects of the industrial revolution look paltry next to the double-digit rates routinely
observed in today’s rapid industrial-isers. Per capita growth rates rose from something close to zero in the
first half of the 18th century to no more than 2-3% per annum in the mid-1800s. Nevertheless, even these
low rates were revolutionary.
    Continual growth opened the door to steady improvements in the material conditions of mankind. More
importantly, industrialisation altered the fundamental character of international relations. From the
beginning of recorded history until the industrial revolution, income was derived mainly from land. Wealth
based on land is a zero-sum game, so violent conflicts over turf were inevitable. Wealth based on industry,
by contrast, is a positive sum game—despite the fact that mercantilist and Marxist notions about
competition for markets obfuscated this message for almost a century. It took two world wars to teach the
lesson but the notion that more territory equals more power has been firmly relegated to intellectual history,
at least in the advanced industrialised nations.
             Spreading and Deepening Industrialisation
    The French revolution (1789) and Napoleonic Wars (1805-1815) dominated events on the Continent
during the decades bracketing the 18th century’s closure. They also delayed the spread of industrialisation
due to “capital destruction and losses of manpower; political instability and a widespread social anxiety; the
decimation of the wealthier entrepreneurial groups; all manner of interruptions to trade; violent inflations
and alterations of currency.” (Landes 1969:142).
    Belgium was the first to follow Great Britain into the new age, developing rapidly between 1820 and
1870. France, Switzerland, Prussia and the United States followed in the
1830s and 1840s. Industrialisation eventually spread to Russia, the             Table 1: Rostow’s Take-
Austria-Hungarian Empire, Italy, Sweden, Canada and much of the rest of         off Dates
Europe during the end of the 1800s. Rostow (1960) bravely, and                  UK         1783-1802

    As the 19 century reached into its second half, new industries and
production methods emerged. Thus began the so-called second industrial          US         1843-60

(1866) and the subsequent cabling of all the oceans revolutionised
communications, lowering intercontinental communication times from
weeks to minutes. Faster and more reliable communications spurred trade and investment. It was also
critical to the development of multinationals (Dunning 1983).

2.1.2 Third World De-industrialisation in the 19th Century
   While it is often forgotten, the riches of the East included much more than spices. “Before the 19th
century and perhaps not much before it, some presently underdeveloped countries, notably China and parts
of India, were believed by Europeans to be more highly developed than Europe” (Kuznets 1965:20).
Braudel (1984) and Chaudhuri (1966) show that during the 18th century, the Indian cotton textile industry
was the global leader in terms of quality, production and exports. 18th century India and China also
produced the world’s highest quality silk and porcelain. Before the 18th century, these manufactured goods
were exported to Europe in exchange for silver since European manufactures were uncompetitive in the
East (Barraclough 1978). Clearly, civilisations that invented gunpowder, paper and oceanic navigation aids
were by no means primitive societies just waiting for Europe to develop.
   At the end of the 19th century, however, more than 70% of Indian textile consumption is imported
(mainly from Great Britain) and India instead became a net exporter of cotton (Braudel 1984). A matching,
but less dramatic, story can be told for the Indian shipbuilding and iron industries. Similar cases can be
found across Latin America and the Middle East (Batou 1990).
   Some authors, such as Bairoch (1993), Braudel (1984) and Bairoch and Kozul-Wright (1996) claim that
northern industrialisation caused southern de-industrialisation and this amplified income divergence.
4


“There seems little doubt that de-industrialisation in the South was the result of a massive inflow of
European manufactured imports. This was particularly true of textile and clothing industries, where free
trade exposed the local artisanal and craft producers to the destructive competitive gale of more capital
intensive, high productivity Northern producers” (Kozul-Wright and Bairoch 1996:16).
    Table 2 shows the evolution of per capita industrialisation and de-industrialisation. Note that all nations
and regions started at similar levels. In 1750, all European nations were at a level between 6 and 10 (with

China and India are the chief nations represented in the Third World and they follow very similar paths
dropping from something like 8 to about 3. We also see the UK’s spectacular performance and the
subsequent catch up of the US. Japan’s industrialisation path mimics that of the world average.

among the high-income countries has been accompanied by a marked de-industrialisation. Table 3 presents
some data on this. As can be seen from the table, the share of labour force employment in industry for the
OECD nations fell for most nations between 1950 and 1990. Indeed, the annual rate of de-industrialisation
jumped up sharply as globalisation picked up pace in the 1980s.

2.2    Global Income Divergence in the 1st and 2nd Waves
    By the time frame of human history, today’s wide disparity between rich and poor countries is fairly
recent. Until the industrial revolution, the whole world was poor and the logic of Malthus kept it that way.
The globalisations of the 19th and 20th centuries both produced income divergence in the wider world as
well as convergence among a small group of high-end nations. That is, ‘twin peaks’ convergence story,
which has been much discussed in recent years (see Quay 1996) also occurred during the first globalisation
wave.

2.2.1 20th Century Globalisation
   The literature on post-war ‘convergence clubs’ or ‘twin peaks’ is highly developed and widely known,
so we do no more than refer to the basic facts and provide a few references. According to Jones (1997) and

Pritchett (1997), income levels of the advanced capitalist nations converged substantially towards that of
the United States while US income advanced at a pace of about 2% per annum. Additionally, incomes in a
handful of NICs shot up at a truly remarkable pace, allowing them to join the ranks of the world’s
wealthiest nations. By contrast, incomes in many African, Latin American and some Asian nations rose
slower than US incomes between the 1960s and the 1990s; others actually fell.
    Figure 1 clearly illustrates this convergence and divergence story. The roughly bell-shaped 1960
distribution has become a twin-peaks distribution, with the rich nations getting richer (relative to the US)
and the poor nations getting poor (again relative to the US). Jones (1997) shows that things look rosier
when national incomes are weighted by population (mainly since India and China have grown faster than
the US).

2.2.2 19th Century Globalisation
    The paucity of data makes it more difficult to document changes in the global income distribution
during the first wave of globalisation. Nevertheless, many scholars—Braudel, Kuznets, Baumol, Pritchett
and Maddison, inter alios—contend that a big North-South income divergence appeared with the first
Industrial Revolution.
    Table 4 provides some information on the per capita income on the widening of the income distribution
in Europe during the 1st globalisation wave. The first two columns show each nation’s per capita income
6


relative to that of Great Britain’s in 1860 and 1910 respectively. Slightly less than half the countries closed
in on the UK. For some nations – Canada, Germany, Belgium, Denmark, France, Sweden, Switzerland and
Argentina – this era marked a truly remarkable catch-up phase and the US actually surpassed its former
ruler. But 11 of the 20 European nations in Bairoch’s sample and all of the Asian nations in Maddison’s
sample lost ground. For some, such as Portugal, the drop was dramatic. The last two columns show similar
calculations using data from Maddison (1995). If the table 4 data is plotted, the income distribution in 1910
is something akin to a mean-preserving spread of the 1850 distribution. The leftward shift in the lower
incomes is especially marked. The
Maddison data yields similar                Table 4: Income Convergence/Divergence, 1850-1910.

gaps? Why should this convergence U-turn be associated with de-industrialisation of the rich nations?
    As it turns out, the insights of Romerian endogenous growth theory and those of Krugmanesque new
economic geography provide a rigorous, if highly abstract, framework for organising our thinking about the

  Early academic contributions on the subject, such as Barro and Sala-I-Martin (1995), suggested that that
income convergence was evidence for the neo-classical model whereas non-convergence was evidence for
endogenous growth models. The stark-ness of this prediction has become more blurred recently, with
examples of new growth models that exhibit convergence (Leung and Quah 1996) and neo-classical growth
models that exhibit divergence (Baldwin 1998). This literature, however, is of little use in explaining the
convergence U-turn that appears in the historical data.
7


economics of these facts.5 The framework is a stages-of-growth model with four stages and two regions
(North and South) that are identical initially.
    In the first, pre-globalisation stage, transport costs are high. There is little trade, and industry is
primitive, rare and stagnating. Due to the high transport costs, industry is also scattered with a little bit of it
in the North and in the South. This geographic dispersion itself contributes to industrial stagnation in the
following way. Dispersion hinders interactions among entrepreneurs. This mutes the spillovers that could
arise from the odd technological breakthrough occurring in one locale or another. The dampening of
spillovers hampers innovation and technological progress and in this way, world growth is retarded.
    In a second stage, when transport costs have sufficiently diminished, agglomeration forces (of the type
stressed in Krugman 1991) make the even distribution of industry an unstable equilibrium. In this highly
stylised world, the regions are initially identical, so the question of which region takes-off is a matter of
happenstance. Whichever region edges ahead initially call it the North finds itself in a virtuous cycle.
Higher income leads to a larger local market in the North and this in turn attracts relatively more
investment to the North. Of course, the higher investment rate leads to a growing market-size gap and the
cycle restarts. The spiral is also boosted by the localised nature of technological spillovers. Namely,
Northern industry and innovators benefit proportionally more than the South from increasing
industrialisation in the North. As the North experiences this stylised Industrial Revolution, Southern
industry rapidly disappears in the face of competition from northern exports. In a self-generating process,
the North specialises in industry and the South in primary goods.
    In short, the first wave of globalisation, which is triggered by lower costs of transporting goods,
generates a stark process of specialisation that both promotes and is promoted by expanding trade. The
North-South income divergence, Northern industrialisation and South de-industrialisation all appear
naturally.
    During this first globalisation wave (stage two in the framework), the cost of exchanging goods
internationally falls faster than the cost of exchanging ideas and innovations. From 1910 to the late 1960s,
the rich-north-poor-south pattern was unchanged. During this stage, meant to reflect important elements of
the second globalisation wave, the cost of transporting goods asymptotes towards some natural lower limit,
yet the cost of ‘trading’ ideas continues to plummet with the cost of telecommunications. This stylised fact,
which is shown clearly in Section 4.1.1, opens the door to stage four, namely the take-off of a number of
developing nations.
    When the cost ‘transporting ideas’ falls sufficiently, the core-periphery configuration becomes unstable,
this time due to Krugmanesque centrifugal forces. Southern innovators and industrialist, who now have
easy access to the North’s technology and cheap labour, begin to close the gap. As industrial investment
rises in the South, income rises, spurring local investment, and Southern industrialisation and income
growth. Now it is the Southern countries turn to step on the virtuous industrialisation-income growth spiral.
Northern industry suffers to some extent from the new competition. The North experiences some de-
industrialisation and tends to specialise more in services. In this last stage, the two regions converge
towards even income and industrialisation levels.
    At first glance, this analytic framework appears to support notions of 'inequalizing trade'. In this
abstract world, the big divergence between rich and poor countries is a necessary implication of Europe's
Industrial Revolution and the expansion of international trade triggered both. The model, however, departs
sharply from the 'inequalizing trade' paradigm one key point. While globalisation first generates massive
divergence of real incomes, it subsequently becomes the driving force behind industrialisation,
development and income convergence.

3 Capital Markets and Financial Integration
    The popular press gives one the impression that the rapid globalisation of financial markets takes
humanity into uncharted territory. This is an impression that is easy to accept given the staggering growth
of international financial markets. On an average day, turnover in the foreign exchange market has grown
from $190 billion to $1,190 billion in just ten years. Private lending flows to developing nations have
increased sixfold since 1990 (IMF 1996a), and individual and institutional investors are increasingly

holding foreign securities. Eichengreen (1994) points out the between 1980 and 1991, US pension funds
increased the share of foreign securities in their portfolios from 1% to over 5%, and in other OECD nations
the trend is similar. Finally, the world of global finance grows more intricate every year as new and highly
sophisticated financial instruments appear continuously.
    The popular impression of a brave new world, however, is almost entirely wrong. While there are
several distinguishing features of late 20th century financial globalisation, many of its elements resemble
the wave of globalisation that ended in 1914. Indeed, the only real debate among informed observers is
whether we have returned to 1914-levels of financial integration (Sachs and Warner, 1995), or have yet to
reach that those levels (Zevin 1989).
    This section consider, in turn, the facts on capital mobility, capital market integration, and financial
crisis, all of which are frequently cited as major symptoms of globalisation.

3.1     Capital Mobility
    When we read that the IMF is lending record sums to Korea and Indonesia, and that private banks are
topping these figures, it is easy to think of massive international lending as a new phenomenon. This is
incorrect.
    International financial markets in the early part of this century were highly integrated. The gold
standard—combined with a dense network of financial institutions centred on London—allowed enormous
flows of capital to search the world for the highest return. These flows permitted rapid growth in the
‘settler’ economies (e.g., Australia, Argentina, Canada and US) and, since much of the investment hastened
the development of primary resources and vast new settlements, it fostered international trade. This,
together with its stable exchange rates and unhindered convertibility, made the gold standard look like the
golden age of the international monetary system.6
    Capital mobility can be measured in different ways, and each way has is shortcomings. National current
accounts are a good place to begin since a nation’s current account is by definition a measure of its net
capital inflow or outflow. Table 5 (taken from Taylor 1996) provides data on the evolution of national
current-account-to-GDP ratios for several countries. Since we are interested in the size of capital flows
rather than their direction, the figures are the absolute value of the average current-account-GDP ratios for
the various periods. Uniformly we see that numbers for the 1989-1996 period are by no means

extraordinary. Indeed, except for Germany, Japan and the US, the most recent figures are noticeable
smaller than the pre-WWI figures. For the UK, the average was 4.6% of GDP during the period of the Gold
Standard, 1870-1914. In the 1920s, capital flows fell in most countries (to around 2.4% in the UK) and
even more in the 1930s (1.1% in the UK). Capital flows reached an all time low in the 1950s and 1960s and
slowly increased again starting from the 1970s to the 1990s. Although the 1990s figures are significantly
higher than in any post World War II decade, they are still lower than those of a century ago.
    Figure 2 illustrates the change over time aggregating data for twelve countries (those in the above table

plus Denmark, Norway and Sweden). Before World War I, the average size of capital flows was quite high
for certain countries especially during the decades centred on 1880.

    These data offer suggestive evidence that the mobility of capital has been subject to wide changes over
time with a major dislocation during the Great Depression. More to the point, they suggest that the current
international financial system still has a ways to go before its reaches levels of capital mobility attained
during the 1st globalisation wave.


3.2     Capital and Financial Market Integration
    Capital flow volumes are in themselves important indicators of globalisation. Such flows, however,
may give a biased image of capital market integration. On one hand, small flows are consistent with
perfectly integrated capital markets as long as the returns to capital have been equalised. On the other hand,
large flows are consistent with strong capital-flow restrictions if differences in rates of return are very large.
To study the degree of market integration, we look at the relation between national saving and national
investment over time.

3.2.1 Correlation of Investment and Savings
    Feldstein and Horioka (1980) argue that in a world of perfect capital mobility, there should exist no
systematic relation between domestic saving and investment since domestic saving would search the world
for the highest return irrespective of the state of domestic investment.
    Figure 3, taken from Taylor (1996), shows the correlation between domestic investment and saving
between 1870 and 1989 for 12 major countries. The correlation displays considerable fluctuation, but since
a low correlation indicates a high degree of integration, the figure presents confirms the result that the
global capital market is no more integrated now than it was in beginning of the century. Indeed, the figure
suggests that the late 19th century experienced significantly greater levels of integration than those observed
today. More detailed evidence in Cairncross (1953:104) shows that at least for the UK, the globalisation of
capital was far in excess of what we observe today; he estimates that 40% of British national saving was
invested abroad in 1907. It also reveals that capital market integration has always been a long way from
perfect. Econometric evidence in Zevin (1989) confirms these conclusions.

boom of the 1920s .
Again, and more dramatic
crash of the 1930s generated a period of greater autarky. This period saw the introduction of stringent
capital controls—controls that persisted into the Bretton Woods period. During the post-WWII period,
these controls were gradually relaxed and eliminated in many nations. The decline of the investment-saving
correlation in the 1980s is significant, but on that account, capital mobility is still lower than during the
previous booms of the 1880s and 1920s.

3.2.2 Interest rates and Financial Market Integration
    Evidence on nominal interest rates confirms the picture painted by figures 3. Obstfeld and Taylor
(1997) look at differentials of onshore and offshore interest rates (so that the rates-of-return are not affected
by pure currency risk) for short-term assets. Because the financial community is not known for
systematically missing opportunities to make money without risk, this gap suggests the existence of barriers
to capital mobility. In particular, Obstfeld and Taylor find that capital markets were poorly integrated in the
1930s and during the whole period of the Bretton Woods system. Differentials have become small again
only in the most recent years of the flexible exchange rate regime.
    Their empirical estimates also suggest a difference in the nature of financial globalisation at the end of
the 19th century and at the end of the 20th century. This difference is that capital mobility at the end of the
19th century seems relatively more important for long-term than for short-term capital flows. The
comparison of nominal interest differentials on US and British and short term assets between the end of the
19th century and the decade of the 1990s shows that the former were higher. This is true only for the last
decade suggesting also a marked change between the 1980s and the 1990s. While this comparison is
imperfect (assets in the two periods are not identical), it is consistent with other evidence. Bayoumi (1998),
for instance, concludes that capital mobility is today very high for short-term instruments, and may be
higher than for any other period before, but that the same cannot be said for longer-term capital
movements.
    Further evidence for this can be found in the gigantic foreign exchange market turnover. This turnover--
several hundred trillions of dollars a year--far exceeds what would be strictly necessary to finance FDI,
trade and current account imbalances. From this, and micro-studies of the foreign exchange market (e.g.,
Lyons, 1998), we can deduce much of the money is crossing borders many times a year. That is to say, it is
invested in short-term assets. While we do not have hard data on the pattern in the late 1800s, the total size
of the turnover is surely without precedent.
    Bairoch and Kozul-Wright (1996) also insist on the fact that a large part of the capital flows of the late
19th century were long term in nature. Foreign direct investment (FDI) was growing rapidly during this
period, accounting for as much as one-third of overseas investment. FDI was considerable in the natural
resources sector but also in railways and utilities. Moreover, government borrowing was very important
during this period and the flotation of new issues dominated trading of second hand debt.
    This difference between the two waves can roughly be associated with the cost of trading ideas. In the

19th century, the high cost of transmitting knowledge favoured long-term capital investments. The
telecommunications revolution of the late 20th century favours the rapid, almost frenetic, movement of
highly liquid assets.

3.3    Financial Crises
    Perhaps the most spectacular symptom of financial globalisation is the recent spat of currency and
financial crises: Thailand, Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines in 1997-8, Mexico in 1994, and
the European exchange rate crises in 1992-93. The Asian crises are especially associated with financial
market globalisation. Sachs and Radelet (1998) point out: “The single most dramatic element—perhaps the
defining element—of the crisis has been the rapid reversal of private capital flows into Asia.”
    While these financial crises sound modern and high-tech, there is very little new about them.
Kindleberger (1996:203) lists no fewer than 22 crises and panics between 1870 and 1914, with the first
truly international crisis coming 277 years ago. A proper characterisation of the extent and international
nature of financial crises is far beyond the scope of this paper. Yet one needs only to skim a few pages of
Kindleberger’s book to understand how thoroughly unoriginal today’s financial crises are. The 19th century
crises variously involved banks, government bonds, commodities, private bonds and private equity, inter
alia. Some affected Europe and North America, others affected developing nations. Many involved
contagion-effects, pulling several nations into the panic. To give one example, the crisis of 1847-48 led to
the failure of several hundred banks and companies spread across the United Kingdom, France, the
Netherlands, Germany, Italy, the US and India – all within the space of 12 months.
    Governmental reaction to such crises also has a long history. For instance, virtually every proposed
‘solution’ to today’s Asian crises has a historical precedent, as Kindleberger points out in his chapters
entitled “Letting it Burn Out, and Other Devices”, “The Lender of Last Resort”, and “The International
Lender of Last Resort”.

4 Trade, Investment, Migration and Factor Prices
    Until the recent Asian financial crises, the rapid growth of international trade and investment was the
most cited and feared symptom of globalisation. Indeed, in many circles especially in the United States—
there is a firm belief that the current level of openness is unprecedented and that this takes policymakers
into uncharted waters. This belief is easy to understand. US trade accounted for less than 5% of its GDP in
1960 but the current figure is more than double that. Growth in the trade-to-GDP ratio for the average
OECD nation is more like 50%, but even this figure is impressive.
    To informed analysts, the popular conviction that unprecedented globalisation has changed everything
is wrong, or at least considerably exaggerated. As Krugman (1995:327) points out “the U.S. economy is not
now, and may never be as dependent on exports as Britain was during the reign of Queen Victoria.”
Krugman’s historical reference is correct but misses much. In terms of trade flows, the 1st and 2nd waves of
globalisation are superficially similar but fundamentally different.
    This section compares the two waves in terms of trade, direct investment, migration, and factor price
movements.

4.1    Trade
   Large-scale international trade was born the 19th century. Between the defeat of Napoleon and WWI
European trade multiplied nearly forty-fold, having only doubled in the previous 100 years (Bairoch, 1989).
By the end of the 19th century, a complex, but lopsided, system of international trade had taken shape. As
Harley describes it:
       The United States exported heavily to Europe while importing tropical raw materials, like
       jute, sugar and coffee, from the less developed economies of the periphery. The Continental
       European nations, as a group, balanced imports of temperate and tropical foodstuffs and raw
       materials primarily by exporting manufactured goods to Britain. Britain, in turn, earned
       surpluses by selling manufactured goods to the periphery, on shipping and financial services,
       and from large overseas investment. (Harley 1996:xii).
   The UK did export manufactured goods to the US and the Continent, but these were dissimilar from the
industrial goods it imported from those regions. Roughly speaking, the UK exported ‘old’ industrial goods
12


(textiles, clothing, iron, ships and railway material) while the US and Continentals focused on ‘new’
industrial goods (chemicals, steel and engineering goods), according to Harley (1996).
    The contrast with today’s trade pattern is remarkable. Developing nations are vastly less important in
today’s system and the commodity composition of exports across developed nations is much more
symmetric. In particular, most of the world’s trade (about two-thirds) takes place among rich nations that
have similar factor endowments. Moreover, most of this trade (about three-fourths) is two-way trade in

manufactures. Even when one zooms in to the finest level of commodity disaggregation and even when one
focuses on very similar nations, one sees that world trade is dominated by intra-industry trade in similar
products.
   We turn now to a closer look detailed developments. We start with transport costs and trade barriers,
before moving on to aggregate trade-to-GDP ratios, the geographic direction of trade and the commodity
composition of trade.

4.1.1     Trade Barriers
            Transport Costs in the 1st Wave
    Technological innovation and infrastructure investments radically lowered late 19th century transport
costs. Cheaper and faster oceanic shipping facilitated trade among coastline settlements such as London,
Calcutta and New York. For instance, Harley (1980) estimates that the cost of shipping a bushel of wheat
from New York to Liverpool was halved (from $0.25) between 1830 and 1880, and then halved again
between 1880 and 1914. This is only part of the story. According to his estimates for 1880, it cost as much
to get wheat from Chicago to New York as it did to get it from New York to Liverpool. He shows that these
inland costs also halved in both the 1830-1880 and in the 1880-1914 periods. Since wheat sold in Chicago
for about $1 a bushel throughout the 1870-1914 period, falling transport costs had an enormous impact on
world wheat trade. Similar stories can be told for other bulk items such as iron and coal. Trains and ships,
of course, make roundtrips, so transport improvements also fostered globalisation by expanding markets for
industrial and food-producing centres.
    All this was led to quantitative changes for the Atlantic economies, but for nations with massive
interiors—those in North American, Latin America, and central Europe – the transport improvements
constituted a revolution in itself, opening up new frontiers to settlement. This, in turn, fostered the mass
migrations of people and capital in the late 19th century (more on this below).
    Table 6, based on Bairoch (1989) illustrates the radical impact of these innovations on trade costs. It
also clearly shows how transport costs reductions were systematically more important for bulk trade
commodities.
    The first transatlantic telegraph cable was laid 1866 and by the turn of the century, the entire world was
cabled. This was a radical change, reducing communication times from months to minutes.
            Transport and Communications Costs in the 2nd Wave
    In the post-war period, oceanic shipping costs continued to decline sharply up to 1960. The cost
airfreight also fell dramatically, but costs flattened out in the 1980s as Figure 4 shows. The costs of
communications, however, continue to plunge, as the figure shows.

    Frances Cairncross further documents the remarkable decline in the cost of trading ideas in her book
The Death of Distance.8 The costs of a 3-minute call from New York to London fell from about $250 in
1930 to a few pennies today. Even as recently as 1960, the call would have cost something like $50. The
very recent expansion of telephone capacity is
equally impressive, as Table 7 shows. The last      Table 8: Tariffs on Manufactured Goods, 1820,

  The demise of distance has been greatly exaggerated when it comes to commodity trade. The gravity
model, which uses distance and partner country GDPs as its main explanatory variables, still does an
excellent job of accounting for the geographical pattern of trade. In particular, the distance-trade-volume
elasticity is about –0.7; See Baldwin (1994 Chapter 3) for further details.

protectionism.9 Bairoch (1989) and Harley (1996) distinguish four periods: the rise of British liberalism
(1815-1846), the spread of European free trade (1846-1860), the liberal period (1860-1879), and the
Continent’s return to protection while Britain remained open (1879-1914). Apart from brief flirtations with
free trade, non-European advanced nations, especially the US, remained protectionist until after WWII.
Colonial nations that were not self-ruling had liberal policies (at least with their ‘mother’ countries)
throughout much of this period (Bairoch 1989).
    The period from 1815 and 1846 saw the establishment of Great Britain’s economic supremacy and its
embrace of free trade; the liberalisation of wheat imports (repeal of the Corn Laws) was the climatic event
in 1846. Other European powers also moved towards freer trade during this period. This, however,
essentially entailed a shift

1846 to 1860. After 1860,
liberal trade policies in
Europe spread rapidly via a system of bilateral treaties (the so-called Cobden-Chevalier treaties). Since
these generally included most favoured nations (MFN) clauses, they established multilateral free trade in
Europe. These liberal policies, which lasted up to the end of the 1870s, were distinctly amplified by
‘natural’ liberalisation, i.e. sharply lower transport cost (as discussed above).
    Protectionism returned to Continental Europe after 1878 (more on this in Section 5.2). For farmers, the
renewed protection just offset the sharp drop in wheat prices due to transport costs reductions (Bairoch
1989:57). For industrial goods, by contrast, the new tariffs sharply reduced or prevented increases in

    Table 8 shows puts some numbers to these trends, showing that although trade barriers of the late 19th
century were lower than those of the early part of the century, the 1875-1914 period was marked by high or
rising barriers everywhere except the UK and the Benelux countries.
    The more recent globalisation wave is also marked by tariff liberalisation. Since the signing of the
GATT in the late 1940s, all developed nations have progressively liberalised tariffs and other border
measures on industrial goods. Table 9 shows that except for clothing and a few sectors where special
protection is important (mainly anti-dumping duties on chemicals and steel), the rich nations are quite

world’s remaining protection (at least the easily quantified forms of protection) is limited to two basic two
categories, industrial goods in developing nations
and agricultural goods in developed nations.            Table 11: Total Trade to GDP, 1870, 1910, 1950

first two columns show that most nations experienced increased openness during the first wave of
globalisation. The increases for Japan, Sweden and Denmark were quite spectacular, while those of other
nations were more mild. The UK and Germany, for instance, had already done most of their opening up by
1860. Shares for the US, Australia and Canada actually fell during this period. A part of this stems from
relative price changes between their exports (mainly primary goods, especially wheat) and domestic
production but a large part is due
to the fact that they never

aggregation there is very little
new about the 2nd wave of globalisation at a superficial level. However, as Lindbeck (1973) noted, the
denominators in the 19th century consisted primarily of private economic activity. In modern times,
however, governments account for between 30% and 50% of GDP, so the fraction of private economic
activity exposed to international competition is now much greater than it was in the Victorian-era
globalisation wave.
     Figure 5 presents a more detailed time series for the US and the UK. The figure shows that the US is
still no more open than the UK was in 1850. It also shows that the UK’s burst of openness preceded the
first wave of globalisation and that the US bucked the openness trend, becoming progressively more closed
during the 1870-1910 period. Since WWII, however, the US has opened up remarkably. This may help
explain why the ‘globalisation is unprecedented’ school-of-thought is so strong in the US.

almost 150 years. While the deep integration of Western Europe between 1910 and 1996 has increased the
regionalisation of Europe’s trade, the impact is not especially large. Europe’s exports to Europe rose from
about two-thirds in 1860 to about three-fourths in 1996. European exports to Asia have varied little from
the 10% mark and its exports to North America were unchanged between 1910 and 1996.10 There was more
regionalisation on the import side between 1910 and now, but much of this has to do with the increased
importance of manufactures in Europe’s import basket (more on this below). d
    The basic message of invariant trade shares does not carry through for the UK. As the 1st globalisation
wave progressed, the UK’s exports were increasingly oriented towards her colonies with India being
particularly important. The share of British exports heading to the Continent fell from about half to about a
third. This is partly due to rising Continental tariff barriers but also due to the rapid industrialisation of
West Europe. The increased importance of Asian and African markets is especially noticeable with the
former doubling to 25% and the latter increasing by half.
           Composition of Trade
    Manufactured goods dominate world
trade today. In 1996, for instance,              Table 13: Manufactures Share of Exports and

78.2% for imports. Japan, whose corresponding figures are 94.9% and 54.3%, is the exception but Japan
accounts for only 10% of world trade.
    In the late 19th century, manufactures were also important in the exports of developed nations but much
less so in their imports. Table 13 presents some figures illustrating this. For the most industrialised nations,
viz. UK, Germany and France, manufactures were two or three times more important in exports than
imports. For the US and Italy the figures are roughly balanced but at quite a low level by modern standards.
At the time, the economies of Denmark, Sweden and Canada were still heavily reliant on primary goods
and this is reflected in the imbalance of manufactures in their imports and exports.

4.1.3 Trade with Emerging Economies
    Some trade scholars, notably Ed Leamer, view the post-WWII globalisation as having two distinct
phases. During the first phase, roughly 1950 to 1979, rapid trade expansion consisted primarily of North-
North trade in manufactured goods. The developing nations played only a minor role (in terms of volume)
and much of this was dominated by the exports of primary goods. During the second phase, however, trade
liberalisation and rapid industrialisation changed the nature of the Third World’s participation in the world
trading system. In short, they became exporters of industrial goods, especially labour-intensive industrial
goods. This matters, according to Leamer and Wood, since these goods compete more directly with goods
produced in the developed economies. The link between this and labour market developments is considered
at length below. Here we focus on the trade facts.
    Imports from the emerging economies (the subset of developing nations that grew rapidly since 1970 or
1980) are still a small share of OECD GDP, about 2% for the US and about 1.5% for the OECD nations as
a whole (OECD 1997). This, however, is up sharply from the ¼% it was in 1970. OECD exports to these
nations have risen by approximately the same amount, but the rapid growth in imports from emerging
economies has been concentrated in manufactured goods, especially labour-intensive manufactured goods.
For instance, as share of total manufactured imports, the emerging economies account for 22% for US
manufactured imports, up from about 10% in 1970. (The corresponding figures for the OECD as a whole
are 13% and 6% respectively.)

the developing countries’
exports, however, has shifted rapidly from primary to secondary sector goods. While the drop in oil prices
(the figures are based on current price data) exaggerates the shift, there has clearly been a significant shift
in the Third World’s export mix. This is especially marked after 1980; more recent data confirm this trend.

4.2    Multinationals and Foreign Direct Investment
    Multinational corporations (MNCs) and foreign direct investment (FDI) are an essential component of
late 20th century globalisation—both in terms of volume and impact. Indeed, on the microeconomic side of
globalisation, FDI flows are the only thing that has changed sharply in the last twenty years. As Figure 6
shows, FDI flows rocketed in the mid-1980s. UNCTAD (1997:17), for instance, estimates that the global
sales of MNCs’ foreign affiliates now exceed the world trade volume by 30%. The associated footloose-
ness of production is also an essential component in the vague, but profound, fear of international
integration that Bob Lawrence has dubbed ‘globaphobia’.
    Multinationals, such as the East India Company, and FDI were also an essential part of the first wave of
globalisation. Indeed, in many ways FDI was more important in the first wave than in the second. Dunning

(1983) writes: “There is also little doubt that, from the viewpoint of some home and host countries, FDI,
both as a channel for the transfer of resources between countries, and as a means of controlling the use of
these and complementary local inputs, played a no less important role [in the 1870-1914 period] than it has
done since the mid-1950s.” He guess-estimates that 35% of net capital outflows in the 1st wave consisted of
FDI. The corresponding figure of the 2nd wave is harder to calculate (since the size and source of capital

outflows bounced around a great deal). Nevertheless, while one might find figures like 35% for particular
developing nations, any reasonable estimate of the global number would probably be less than a tenth of
the 35% number.11The direction and source of FDI has also shifted significantly between the two waves.

Roughly speaking, 1870-1914 period saw FDI flowing mainly from developed countries to developing
countries. In the recent wave, most FDI also originated in developed countries but has also flowed mainly
to developed nations. Table 15 provides some figures on this. For instance in 1996, just four nations the
US, UK, Germany, France are the source of half of the world FDI stock. Strikingly, four-tenths of the
world FDI stock is also located in these same four nations. In a more complete study, Hummels and Stern
(1994) show that rich nations account for 97% of direct investment outflows and 75% of the inflows.
    The composition of FDI has also changed significantly. In 1914, 55% of the FDI stock was in the
primary product sector, 20% in railroads, 15% in manufacturing, and only 10% in distribution, utilities,
banking, etc. (Dunning 1983:89). In the late 1990s, the figures look quite different. In the EU, 63% of FDI
went to services, 31% to manufactures and only 6% to the primary sector (European Commission,
1996:90). UNCTAD (1997:35) shows that only about 20% of the assets of the top 100 MNCs are in the
petroleum and mining sectors.
    Much of the service-related FDI is best thought of as facilitating trade in services since many types of
services require a local presence. Banks are a classic example. The part of FDI that goes to the
manufacturing sector, especially FDI that flows to low-wage nations, is part of another important aspect of
the new globalisation, what Krugman (1995) calls the slicing up the value chain. This phenomenon was
well documented in the aptly titled The Global Factory, a 1985 book by Kenneth Flamm and Joseph
Grunwald. Because of this FDI, an enormous amount of the trade in goods such as transport equipment
consists of shuttling auto parts from a company’s factories in one nation to its factories in another.
Krugman (1985) provides the contrasting example of a 1930s US auto plant, which “was, in effect, a
facility that ingested coke and iron ore at one end and extruded passenger cars from the other.”
    Another striking difference is that now the global FDI pattern is quite similarity to the world trade
pattern. In particular, just as world trade is dominated by trade in similar goods among similar nations, FDI
among rich nations is now frequently involves two-way FDI in the same industry—what has been called
intra-industry FDI (Rugman 1985; Markusen 1995). Moreover, the industries in which there is much intra-
industry trade among similar nations are frequently the same industries in which there is a great deal of
intra-industry FDI among similar nations, according to Rugman (1985). Anecdotal evidence can be found
in sectors such as transport equipment, chemicals, pharmaceutical, and processed foods.

4.3    Migration
    Migration is the most obvious difference

something like one million people a year, which implies a decadal migration rate of about 4% of the initial
population.

4.4    Factor Prices and Globalisation
    Globalisation has produced falling real wages in the US and high unemployment in Europe according to
populists such as Buchanan (1998) and Goldsmith (1994) as well as from some scholars such as Leamer
(1996, 1998) and Wood (1994). They point in particular to trade with low-wage nations, migration and the
internationalisation of production. While these writers are at odds with the mainstream academic view (as
we shall see below), they are influential. In Europe, James Goldsmith calls trade ‘The Trap’, and both the
far right and far left have made headway by appealing to the fears of unskilled workers. In the US, fear of
imports from low-wage nations was important in Congress’s refusal to grant the Clinton administration
trade negotiating authority in the form of ‘Fast Track’. Moreover, we have seen calls for protection as a
means of redressing labour market woes in virtually all industrialised nations. Protectionist appeals have
been heard even from some academics such as Rodrik (1996, 1997).
    The first wave of globalisation was also associated with important factor price changes, and according
to some, this was responsible for anti-immigration and anti-trade legislation in the 19th century. Before
looking at the 19th century facts, we briefly review recent labour market developments and evidence.

4.4.1 Factor Prices and Post-WWII Globalisation
    From the end of WWII until the mid- to late 1970s, the rapid integration of industrialised nations was
associated with a narrowing or stable income distribution within each OECD nation. In sharp contrast, the
past two decades have been nothing less than a disaster for unskilled workers in the world’s rich nations. In
all OECD nations, unemployment rates are several times higher for unskilled workers, and in some nations
– notably the US and UK – the earnings of these workers have fallen sharply relative to earnings of skilled
workers. In the US, for one, the widening wage gap has been a zero sum game between skilled and
unskilled workers since labour’s total share of GDP has not budged. Consider some facts.
            Some Labour Market and Income Distribution Facts
    The distribution of US Family income has become much more unequal since 1980, as Table 17 (taken
from Bill Cline’s excellent 1997 book Trade and Income Distribution) shows. The US family income
distribution moved little between 1970 and 1980, but became substantially more uneven from 1980 to
1992. The share of GDP received by the bottom 20% of families fell by about a sixth while the GDP share
going to the highest 5% of the population
rose by a sixth. The ratio of the highest to   Table 17: Distribution of US Family Income,

full time workers rose from less than 4 to
over 5 since 1970. Real wages for workers with less than High School diplomas fell by almost a quarter
from 1973 to 1993. While overall US unemployment is low, for low-skilled groups the rate is at European
levels, according to OECD (1997). In contrast to the US experience, the level of real wages in Europe rose
(Cline 1997), but so did European unemployment rates, especially among low skilled according to OECD
21


(1997).
    Plainly, the labour-market impact has been global. As Krugman (1997) states, rising wage inequality in
the US is the flip side of the coin to Europe’s rising unemployment.
            Globalisation Suspects and the Evidence
    The past two decades have witnessed four important changes that may help account for the labour
market impact. First, trade has expanded rapidly, especially the manufactured exports of emerging
economies. Second, labour-saving technology (especially factory automation and information technology)
has progressed at a mighty pace, even as overall productivity growth slowed. This has reduced demand for
low-skill workers in offices and factories while simultaneously boosting demand for workers who can
manipulate, manage, finance and develop these sorts of technology. Third, market-oriented economic
policies triumphed worldwide, weakening the power of organised labour. Finally, foreign direct investment
has grown rapidly and this has fostered ‘outsourcing’ or ‘delocation’ of tasks to low wage regions.
    There are by now a large number of empirical studies on the trade and wage issues (see OECD 1997
and Cline 1997 for surveys). Virtually all studies find some impact of trade on the labour market in both the
US and Europe. The range of findings, however, is wide. Some find that trade accounted for virtually none
of the wage gap, while other assigned 100% of the gap to trade. The consensus range is perhaps 10-20%. In
the US, migration accounts for another 30-40% of drop in lowest-skilled US workers (Borjas, Freeman and
Katz 1997). While these estimates cannot be simply sum up, it seem clear that maybe as much as half of the
US wage gap is due to trade and migration. The rest, according to most scholars, is due to technological
change.

4.4.2 Factor Prices in the First Globalisation Wave
    Jeffrey Williamson (1996) and others have shown that the first globalisation wage was also associated
with important factor price changes. In those days, however, the focal-point distinction was between rich
landowners and poor workers rather than between skilled and unskilled workers as it is today. In turn of
the century Europe, land was scarce and labour was abundant; in the New World, land was abundant and
labour was scarce. Not surprisingly, labour (and capital) flowed from the Old World to the so-called settler
economies in the New World. In addition to migration, sharp drops in transport costs narrowed commodity
price gaps, as discussed above.
    Factor rewards responded as expected (Williamson 1996). Old World wages rose relative to land
values, often by a factor of 2 or 3. This was especially felt in the most open economies, such as the UK and
Nordic nations. In the New World, wage-land value ratios fell by 30-50% between 1870 and 1910. Since
landowners tended to be rich to start with, the ratio-shifts decreased European income inequality but
probably increased inequality in the New World (Williamson 1996).
    Theoretically, three factors can be seen as important determinates of the wage-land value ratios: labour
migration and the attendant shift in relative factor supplies within nations, commodity price changes (via
Stolper-Samuelson effects), and biased technological progress. O’Rourke, Taylor and Williamson (1996)
estimate that changing labour-labour ratios and capital-deepening (due chiefly to migration and capital
mobility) accounted for a quarter the changes in the New World’s wage-land ratio, but for none in the Old
World. Commodity price convergence was responsible for 30% of the New World’s drop and about a
quarter of the Old World’s rise. Due to price pressures, technology tended to be labour saving in the New
World and labour using in the Old. These changes accounted for about 40% of the fall in the New World
ratio and about 50% of the rise in the Old World ratio.
    Williamson (1996) also looks at the ratio of unskilled workers to total income per capita in an attempt
to identify changes in the incomes of well-to-do individuals (capital and landowners as well as skilled
workers) relative to poorer citizens (unskilled workers). He found that this proxy for domestic income
inequality rose dramatically for the settler economies (Australia, Canada and US), but that it fell for labour-
the abundant economies in Europe (especially for pre-industrial nations such as Denmark, Italy, Norway
and Sweden).
    These changes in relative factor prices and incomes had an important impact on policy, according to
Williamson (1996). In the US, the rise in income inequality contributed to pressures for anti-immigration
legislation in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It also fostered the anti-trade sentiments in Europe in
the form of the Continent’s post-1880s retreat from liberalism.

5 Economic Beliefs, Institutions and the Policymaking
  Environment
    Keynes tells us that ideas matter more than we think, or at least used to think before he enlightened us.
A full comparison of the two globalisation waves therefore requires discussion of ideas. This is especially
true when attempting to distil lessons from the actions made by last century’s policymakers. This section
first considers differences in the macroeconomic policy environment and then turns to differences in the
trade policy environment.

5.1    Macroeconomics and Finance
    For late 20th century policymakers, globalisation’s most startling impact concerns exchange rate
management. Increasingly, officials have had to choose between floating their exchange rate (with all its
attendant instability) and joining a big monetary union (with its loss of sovereignty). The adjustable peg, it
seems, is dying or dead. 19th-century policymakers never faced such a stark choice. The gold standard,
which was essentially an adjustable and unilaterally chosen exchange rate peg, worked quite well.12 Our
goal here is to understand how the intellectual and political climate of the late 19th century permitted this.
To get there, however, requires a detour into the logic of the adjustable peg’s demise.

5.1.1 Why the Adjustable Peg Died
     Barry Eichengreen, who pushed the adjustable-peg-is-dead point in his 1994 book, argues that the
middle ground between floating exchanges rates and monetary unions has been, or at least may soon be,
completely eliminated by the speed and gigantic quantity of money that is available to challenge any fixed
exchange rate. Recent events in Asia have surely made him feel more comfortable with his conclusion.
Eichengreen s logic is straightforward.
             A Holier ‘Holy Trinity’
     The ’holy trinity’ of monetary policy consists of fixed exchange rates, perfect capital mobility and
independent monetary policy. Governments would love to have all three, but being holy, it is unobtainable
for mere mortals; the result is the well-known tri-lemma of international monetary policy. In reality, capital
mobility is not perfect, so a nation with a fixed rate can get a bit of daylight between domestic and foreign
interest rates. The degree of independence depends upon some combination of the restrictiveness of capital
controls and the size of the country’s reserves. As capital controls have eroded, the size of potential foreign
exchange flows has come to eclipse all conceivable levels of official intervention.13 Consequently, the holy
trinity has become more unobtainable. This is the first factor contributing to the adjustable peg’s demise.
             Self-fulfilling Currency Crises
     The second contributing factor is the appearance of so-called self-fulfilling speculative attacks. These
are best explained with an example.
     Estonia’s currency board is an adjustable peg with a peg that is very hard (politically) to adjust. Eight
Estonia kroons (EEK) to the DM is the rate and Estonia promises never to change it. Estonia s inflation
rate, however, is 6 or 7 times that of Germany, its monthly trade deficit is 1.5 billion EEK with an annual
GDP of 63 EEK, and its interest rate is double Germany’s. Now ask yourself, if no credibility were
invested in the 8-to-1 rate, is this the rate Estonia would choose? If the answer is ‘no’ then a self-fulfilling
attack is in the offing. Here are the elements.
     First, speculators suspect that Estonia would devalue or float, if it were pushed off its peg. Either way,
the kroon would drop, making Soros-sized profits for properly positioned speculators. Second, speculators
suspect that the currency board would be abandoned if Estonian interest rates stayed at outrageous levels
for long enough. Taken together, this means that boatloads of money can almost surely be made if
speculators/investors are willing to pour enough money into an attack on the kroon. In a world where a
trillion dollars a day changes hands, how difficult would it be to suck out the money supply of an 8 billion
DM economy?
12
   The gold standard was a fixed exchange rate system where the rate could be and was changed. By
definition, then, it was an adjustable peg system.
13
   The daily foreign exchange turnover exceeds the official reserves of all IMF members combined
(Eichengreen 1996).
23


    In short, the increased holiness of the monetary holy trinity and self-fulfilling attacks increasingly force
nations to choose between managed floats and membership in a big monetary union. The middle ground is
rapidly vanishing.

5.1.2 The Gold Standard’s Success
     The gold standard was an adjustable-peg regime that worked well despite a high degree of capital
mobility. The system was fully credible and there was little discussion of devaluation by the major players
before 1914. In fact, currency risk was considered so minimal that foreign investment was rarely hedged.
When currency fluctuations did occur, investors usually reacted in stabilising ways. And in particularly
difficult crises, national central banks helped each other, as in the Baring crisis.14
     How did 19th century policymakers manage this? More importantly, could 21st century policymakers do
the same? At one level, the answer is simple. The gold standard worked because governments solved the
tri-lemma; they were satisfied with only two elements of the holy trinity—fixed exchange rates and perfect
capital mobility. Monetary policy was slaved to the exchange rate peg. At a deeper level, the puzzle is why
governments at the time were happy to do this.
            Eichengreen’s Point
     Eichengreen (1996) asserts that the gold standard “was a socially constructed institution whose viability
hinged on the context in which it operated.” Specifically, the critical element was the protection that
governments and central banks had from political pressure—especially pressures to sacrifice exchange-rate
stability for domestic economic stabilisation. 19th century central bankers, in short, just did not face a
dilemma between internal and external balance. They only cared about the exchange rate.15
     Eichengreen identifies two factors as critical to this protection. First, political participation was limited
(universal suffrage, for example, was unheard of) and labour unions and parties were weak. This insulated
19th century central banks from pressures to use monetary policy as an expansionary device; painful
adjustments that resulted from wage contraction were always feasible since workers did not have a say. 16
Second, until John Maynard published his treatises in the ‘20s and ‘30s, Keynesian economics was ill
understood. The impact of monetary policy on employment, output and prices, in particular, was not fully
articulated (See Box 1). Thus, ignorance of the real effects of monetary policy certainly had a positive
effect on the credibility of the system.


           Box 1: The Currency and Banking Schools
       Having observed the impact of gold-finds on output and the inflationary consequences of de-
       basing a currency, central bankers and economists clearly had some notion of the links
       between the money supply, prices, unemployment and aggregate output. Keynesianism,
       however, is not called a revolution for nothing. Before WWI, macroeconomics was not a
       distinct field and much of the debate focused on seemingly tangential issues such as whether
       bank credit in other forms than notes could affect prices. The pre-Keynes debate over the role
       money had two opposing sides, the Currency School and the Banking School. The Currency
       School, which included classical economists such as Ricardo, favoured strict monetary
       policies. They felt that supply created its own demand and that credit expansion based on
       ongoing business opportunities would only produce inflation. The Banking School, instead,
       sought credit expansion as a means of promoting economic expansion. (Based on
       Kindleberger, 1996:47.)

14
   In this 1890 crisis, investors doubted that the Bank of England could both defend sterling and act as
lender-of-last-resort for a major merchant bank. The Bank lost gold despite increases in interest rates.
Assistance from the Bank of France quelled the crisis.
15
   Traces of Eichengreen’s point can also be found in Triffin’s judgement that: “The most significant
development of the [the post World War I] period was the growing importance of domestic factors as the
main determinant of monetary policy.” Flandreau et al (1998) ascribes this point to Polanyi (1944).
16
   See Flandreau, Le Cacheux and Zumer (1998) for a critique of this view and a detailed study of central
bank independence during the gold standard.
24




    In addition to the political insulation surrounding central bankers, the UK’s dominance of the
international trade and finance system was a critical factor supporting the gold standard’s success. As the
hegemon, Britain and her Treasury had a tremendous stake in keeping the system afloat.
             Humpty-Dumpty’s Fall
    World War I, the rise of democracy, the end of Pax Britannica and Keynesianism all combined to
shatter the social and intellectual context that supported the gold standard. The King’s men and horses, so
to speak, did try to put it back together again – mainly by imposed strict capital controls. They also sought
to solve the internal-balance-external balance dilemma with tariffs. While the patchwork did not work,
depression-era capital controls persisted in watered-down forms well into the 1980s. These helped make
Bretton Woods a success since “limits on capital mobility substituted for limits on democracy as a source
of insulation from market pressures” (Eichengreen, 1996, p5).
    It is interesting to note that during the 1980s and 1990s, independence became a ‘must’ among central
banks. One can see this, and devices such as currency boards, as a 20th century attempt to reconstruct the
political insulation which 19th-century bankers enjoyed. For developing countries, the IMF may also have
played this role. As some East Asian policy-makers have realised recently, it may serve their interests to
have the hard choices made by a body that is insulated from local political and social pressures.
    As with macroeconomics, 19th century intellectual attitudes towards trade and trade policy were quite
different from those of today. We turn now to these differences.

5.2    Trade Policy
    As far as trade is concerned, the first globalisation wave ended badly, with the end coming first as a
whimper and then as a bang. That is, after the trade disruptions of WWI, protectionism gradually gained
currency around the world, climaxing in the infamous Hawley-Smoot tariffs and corresponding retaliations.
    This might be taken as suggesting that globalisation sows the seeds of its own destruction and indeed
some such as Greider (1996) have claimed as much. As we shall see, however, important differences
between the intellectual/policymaking environments during the two globalisation waves makes a repeat
collapse unlikely. Our task here is to trace through the relevant developments in the intellectual and
policymaking environments.

5.2.1 Evolution of the Intellectual Climate
    The Industrial Revolution and the accompanying trade expansion emerged from an intellectual climate,
called classic mercantilism, which was profoundly hostile towards imports. This belief, and the fact that
tariffs and tolls were one of the few sources of public funds, meant that both internal and external trade
were heavily regulated, heavily taxed or outright prohibited. Using colonies as shielded market for mother-
country exports was a main ingredient in the mercantilist recipe.
    In the late 1700s and early 1800s, this staunchly anti-import attitude began to change. Adam Smith,
David Ricardo and others established a solid intellectual case for unilateral free trade and all the greatest
economic thinkers of first globalisation came to endorse free trade. The supremacy of the free trade
doctrine, however, did not hinder the development of modern protectionism, namely protectionism
designed to promote development rather than simply achieve an overall trade surplus. The result was a very
strong line of reasoning supporting temporary protection of manufacturing as a means of promoting the
spread of England’s industrialisation to the Continent and the settler economies (US, Australia, Canada,
etc.). Alexander Hamilton, Freidrich List and John Stuart Mill, among others, endorsed this infant-industry
protection argument. Box 2, based largely on Irwin (1996), provide a more detailed intellectual history of
these developments.


          Box 2: Strict Mercantilism, Laissez-Faire and Modern Protectionism
       Under strict mercantilism, which dominated thinking on trade policy in the 17th and 18th
       centuries, imports were consider ‘bad’ and exports were ‘good’ for the simple reason that
       precious metals were crucial to a nation’s wealth and power. Nations without access to gold
25


     or silver mines had to obtain a balance of trade surplus in order to assure a steady inflow of
     gold and silver. In 1664, Mun explained: “The ordinary means therefore to increase our
     wealth and treasure is by foreign trade, wherein we must ever observe this rule; to sell more
     to strangers yearly than we consume of theirs in value” (cited in Irwin 1996:35). In short,
     strict mercantilism viewed trade as a means of dividing a fixed pie of world wealth. In a
     somewhat later form, the argument became subtler; the views being that not all imports were
     bad since some, such as cotton and other tropical products, were essential and unavailable at
     home. This subtler form of mercantilism stated that the importation of manufactures and food
     was ‘bad’, while exports, especially manufactured exports, were ‘good’.
     Strict mercantilist beliefs came to be challenged by the writings of a group of French
     philosophers, the Physiocrats, who proclaimed a harmony of private actions with public
     welfare (in the spirit of what Smith latter called the invisible hand). Their support for laissez-
     faire and free trade policies was important and influential, yet it took the genius of Adam
     Smith to provide the economic underpinnings of the free trade doctrine.
     Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations argued that free trade maximised national wealth since it
     allowed a more efficient division of labour. “If a foreign country can supply us with a
     commodity cheaper than we ourselves can make it, better buy it of them with some part of
     the produce of our own industry…(Smith 1776 cited in Irwin 1996:79). Smith’s treatise was
     the leading work on economics at the end of the 18th century and soon “all founding fathers
     of modern economics adopted a liberal position on international trade” according to Bairoch
     (1993:17). The notion of comparative costs (advantage) came to be more fully fleshed out in
     the first two decades of the 19th century by scholars such as Robert Torrens, David Ricardo
     and James Mill. The supremacy of the free trade doctrine among eminent economists,
     however, did not hinder the development of modern protectionism, the infant industry
     argument in particular.
     Awareness of Britain’s industrial development and rising nationalism in the early 19th
     century nurtured development of an intellectual argument for what we would now call infant-
     industry protection. Alexander Hamilton was one of the earliest and the most influential
     proponents of this doctrine. As a colony, US tariffs were held low to help British
     manufacturers ‘exploit’ the US market. Thus, tariff independence was an important
     component of US independence. Hamilton’s work argued that the US should have a high
     tariff on manufactures and this underpinned the US’ protectionist stance for more than a
     hundred years. Hamilton and other members of the modern protection school, concurred with
     Smith on the fact that protection would have static costs. Their argument was that temporary
     protection of industry was necessary to build up a strong economy. The ensuing growth
     would more than compensate the short-term loss.
     On the Continent, the various writings and lectures of Friedrich List in the first half of the
     1800s provided intellectual support for the protection of manufacturing, even though his
     most famous tract The National System of Political Economy did not appear until 1841. The
     intellectual respectability of infant-industry protection reached its zenith when John Stuart
     Mill, the pre-eminent mid-19th century economist, endorsed it in his famous 1848 book,
     Principles of Political Economy. Importantly, these writers typically did not recommend
     protection for agriculture in any nation, nor did they argue for protection in the leading
     industrial nation of the time, namely Britain. Furthermore, List argued that the tropical
     countries should embrace unilateral free trade since he thought that industrialisation was only
     possible in temperate climates (Bairoch 1993:18).
     The writings of John Stuart Mill and Robert Torrens (who developed something akin to the
     optimal-tariff argument) deflowered the purity of the free trade doctrine. However, the notion
     that protection might improve national welfare in special cases did not provide protectionists
     with firm intellectual support. Several lines of argumentation buttressed the free trade
     doctrine (Irwin 1996:228), the strongest of which was the government-failure argument. As
     Edgeworth wrote in 1894, “protection might procure economic advantage in certain cases, if
     there was a government wise enough to discriminate those cases, and strong enough to
     confine itself to them….”
26




5.2.2 Evolution of the Policymaking Climate
    As is often the case, actual policy and the beliefs of policymakers lagged the intellectual developments
by a few decades. We turn now to the development of policymarkers’ attitudes and the pressures shaping
them.17
            UK’s Free Trade Conversion
    A glimmer of free trade policy emerged in the late 1700s. Promoted by French Physiocrats and Adam
Smith’s writings, the UK and France signed a liberal trade treaty in 1786 despite vociferous opposition by
the French Parliament. Due to the French Revolution and subsequent wars, the Treaty had little practical
effect. Moreover, the English blockade of France and France’s retaliation (the so-called Continental
System) greatly re-enforced policymakers’ protectionist instincts on both sides of the channel.
    The first sustained drive towards free trade began in the UK just after the end of the Napoleonic Wars in
1815. Starting from a position of strict agricultural protection and manufacturing tariffs of about 50%,
English industry battled for free trade against the landed aristocracy. Industry embraced free trade since
they believed it would boost exports by lowering British wages (industrial wages were de facto tied to
wheat prices) and by allowing foreign nations to earn the gold necessary to pay for British manufactures.
    Initially, landed interests held the upper hand, but throughout the early decades of the 1800s, UK
manufacturing prowess grew both relative to its international competitors and relative to domestic
agriculture. The UK’s level of per capita industrialisation, which exceeded that of the rest of Europe by
110% in 1800, exceeded the Continent’s average by 250% in 1830. And around 1810, the agrarian share of
UK GDP exceeded that of industry by 70%, but by 1840 the roles were switched with industry’s share
exceeding agriculture’s by 60% (Bairoch 1993:21). This shift in economic power eventually allowed the
Anti-Corn Law League, formed in 1838, to push through across-the-board free trade in 1846 via the repeal
of the Corn Laws.
            Continental Imitation and Rejection of Free Trade
    While Britain became aware of its industrial lead, Continental Europe was becoming increasingly aware
of its backwardness as was seeking a means of catching up. From 1846 until 1860, Britain’s continued
success and the rapid expansion of trade provided a powerful show-me-the-facts justification of laissez-
faire ideas. Starting in 1860, free trade was widely adopted by the large Continental economies via the
Cobden Treaties (as discussed above). Rapid and large reductions in transport costs furthered this by
lowering ‘natural’ trade barriers, especially for bulk items such as wheat and iron.
    Soon after this liberalisation, Europe lapsed into a two-decade growth slowdown stemming mostly from
a reduction in agricultural growth (Bairoch 1993:47). Per capita GDP growth, which had averaged
approximately 1% to 1.3% between 1830 and 1870, slipped to 0.1% in the 1870s and 1880s (Bairoch 1993
Table 4.1). The slowdown, together with rising nationalism (the modern German, Belgian and Italian states
were formed around this time), led policymakers to abandon the notion that laissez-faire trade policies
could promote industrialisation. Across the Continent, coalitions of landed aristocracy (who suffered from
falling wheat prices) and local industrialists (who suffered from British competition) pushed through
protectionist barriers. Bismarck led the process. After having completed Germany’s unification, he
reinstated higher tariffs, using arguments provided by List: Bismarck declared that “the surfeiting of
Germany with the over-production of other lands … depresses our prices and checks the development of
our industry…”(Cited in Bairoch 1989:60). The trend toward protection, which started with in Germany in
1879, reached a plateau with France’s Meline tariff of 1892.
    These protectionist laws, however, were not temporary and included agriculture, so they would
probably not have been applauded by List, had he lived to see them. As such, this provides an early
example of a sophisticated argument for protection being hijacked and misused by special-interest groups.
            From Pax Britannica to Britain’s Decline
    Rising Continental protection, and the high levels of barriers in the settler economies, evoked a
predictable response in the UK, namely calls for retaliation. This reached a peak in 1881 with the creation
of a Fair Trade League that demanded protection and a retreat to trade with the Empire. Britain, however,
was at the height of her hegemony; Queen Victoria ruled with a firm hand, British industrial productivity

27


was unrivalled (UK industrial exports exceeded her industrial imports by a factor of five), and the sun
never set on the Union Jack. Thus despite foreign protection, Britain chose to maintain its liberal policies
and this allowed the world trading system to flourish, even as British dominance eroded (Bairoch 1989).
    The First World War corresponded to a significant contraction of trade and the erection of wartime
trade barriers. It also signalled the end of Pax Britannica and Britain’s hegemonic support of the
international trade system. The resolution of the war, the Versailles and related treaties in particular,
generally ignored the health of the world trade system despite the fact that President Wilson listed global
free trade as one of his famous 14 points.
    Throughout the teens and twenties, protectionism gained in Europe and elsewhere in a disorganised and
non-linear fashion. Exchange rate instability lead to rapid changes in trade policy (trade treaties were
frequently contracted for only three months) and the widespread introduction of anti-dumping and
countervailing duty laws (Kindleberger 1989). Tariff rate drifted upwards despite some liberalisation of
extreme wartime measures, as Table 18 shows.
     Efforts were made to reverse this trend.18 For
example, the 1927 World Economic Conference agreed            Table 18 Average Tariff Rates on
a tariff 'truce’ and subsequent reductions. The               Manufactures 1913 to 1950.

broadened to include industry, Democrats joined the Republicans and by the end “both Republicans and
Democrats were ultimately pushed from the committee room as lobbyist took over the task of setting the
rates” (Kindleberger 1989:170).
    By 1929, the US was an economic super-power and the US market mattered enormously. The height
and unprovoked nature of the US tariffs therefore attracted censure worldwide. Foreign retaliation did not
wait for final passage of the bill in June 1930; Italy, France and others reacting forcefully in late 1929 and
early 1930. Great Britain finally abandoned free trade, devalued sterling and instituted a system of imperial
preferences a couple of years later.
    By the end of the decade, the world had broken into disparate world trading systems, according to
Kindleberger (1989). Germany, Italy and the Soviet Union maintained systems of bilateral trade
arrangements with explicitly autarkic aims and dreams of global domination. The so-called Oslo group of
small West European nations maintained regional preferences. Britain, the Dominions and Colonies were
linked by the Empire preference system, and the US entertained notions of a Western Hemispheric
preference system but largely stood aloof. Japan carved out her own trade system in the form of the Greater
East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.
    The breakdown of the trading system surely hastened the world towards war. It fostered acceptance of
the autarkic trade philosophies of fascists in Germany, Italy and Japan. It also was used as justification for

18

28


their territorial ambitions, with the Nazi precept of Lebensraum, or living space, providing the clearest
example.19
    This was the period when regionalism and bilateralism acquired a negative image an image that
continues to this day in the minds of many trade-scholars (see, Bhagwati and Krueger 1995). Indeed, the
negative experience with bilateralism in the interwar period goes a long way to explaining why
multilateralism achieved such an exalted status in the post-WWII trading system.

            Post WWII Institutions and Cold War Geo-Politics
    By the end of the 1930s, the US and UK had learned their lessons and were attempting to liberalise
trade even as WWII broke out. The war interrupted these efforts, but restoration of the world trade system
showed up as one of the key objectives of the Bretton Woods institutions. Although the US Congress
showed its isolationist streak by refusing to join the International Trade Organisation, it did accept the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). More importantly, the US has come to see the world
trading system as an essential public good. That is, the world trade order is viewed as a central pillar of
American prosperity, so its defence constitutes a central element of the US’s self-defined national interests.
Other Western nations adopted a similar attitude but war damage left them with little ability to shape events
until the late 1950s.
    As the Cold War heated up in the 1950s, support for the new multilateral trade system took on a geo-
strategic dimension in the eyes of the US, Japan and West Europe. Expanding world trade was viewed as
an important means of fortifying the ‘free world.’ It was also supposed to draw Third World nations into
the capitalist camp, or at least of prevent them from drifting towards the communist side. Moreover, the US
economic dominance put it in a unique position. Although the US import market was by far the largest in
the world, the US was still an essentially closed economy until the 1970s. Thus, US tariff ‘concessions’ had
enormous implications for her trading partners without fundamentally threatening US industry (with the
usual exceptions). This was the period of Pax Americana.
    Trade liberalisation in Europe was also dominated by political motives. The formation of the Common
Market and the European Coal and Steel Community before it was viewed as an economic means to a
political goal, that of making future European wars unthinkable.
            International Trade Institutions: WTO and the EU
    At the end of the first wave of globalisation, the world trade system had virtually no institutional
support and indeed was not really a system in the formal sense of the word. It was supported almost
exclusively by the unilateral decisions of Great Britain. Moreover, protectionism had not acquired the ill
repute that it has today. 19th century policymakers from around the world (with the exception of the UK and
the Low Countries) embraced protectionism as essential to rapid industrialisation. While many
contemporary economists denounced this practice, the infant-industry argument received intellectual
support from as eminent an economist as John Stuart Mill.
    Today, we find ourselves in a very different situation. The world trade system is viewed by almost all
nations as an essential public good a system that is worthy of support even for purely nationalistic reasons.
With the exception of the extreme left and right, blatant protectionism is detested by policymakers and
economists from around the global and from across the political spectrum (even if the same men and
women occasionally approve idiosyncratic barriers for their pet special interests).
    Given the diminished dominance of the United States, it is especially important to note the strong
institutions that bolstering the global trade system. Approximately one-third of world trade is conducted
inside the European Union (EU). This trade is entirely free of tariffs and quotas and this status is enshrined
in the Union’s founding document, the Treaty of Rome, and in each member state’s legislation. A supra-
national legal framework, inter-national transfers and a strong political will also shore the internal market
up. The EU’s imports from non-European nations amount to almost another 20% of world trade. These
imports are not duty free by law, but EU’s tariffs are quite low on average (food imports are an important,
but low volume exception). More importantly, the EU’s decision-making structures in particular, the need
for unanimity would make it difficult for it to raise external protection B la 1930s.
    The GATT and WTO govern almost 70% of world trade, including the EU’s external trade. A sequence

19
     See the masterful account in Chapter 3 “The World through Hitler’s Eyes” in Weinberg (1995).
29


of multilateral trade talks reduced industrial tariffs on to very low levels, and the GATT’s provisions make
it difficult for signatories to put these barriers back up. At the same time, WTO/GATT membership has
grown from 19 nations in the late 1940s to over 120 nations today, the coverage of GATT has been
expanded to include agriculture, services, and clothing. Additionally, the rules and institutions have been
greatly strengthened by creation of the WTO.
    Importantly, the post-WWII expansion of world trade and investment has created a powerful pro-trade
lobby in every advanced industrialised nation, namely exporters and multinationals. More specifically, due
to the today’s very balanced pattern of trade (most trade consists of two-way manufactures trade between
rich nations), the powerful export lobbies in Europe, Japan and the US have a vested interest in maintaining
and advancing free trade among the three blocs. This political power, therefore, acts as a very important
deterrent to another 1930s-size rise in protection rise among the advanced industrial nations.

6 Summary and the Lessons of History
    A paper that covers as broad a topic as ours is difficult to summarise in a few paragraphs. At a detailed
level, the differences and similarities between the two globalisation waves are covered above and we do not
repeat them here. This final section focuses only on three facets of our main message, i.e., that the two
waves are superficial similar but fundamentally different.
    First, we would assert that trade in ideas is more important in the second wave. This can be seen in:
    - The different nature of capital flows (enormous short-term flows driven by a frenetic pace of
information exchange and advances in information technology rather than the long-term flows that marked
the first wave).
    - The different nature of FDI and MNC activity (intra-industry FDI among similar nations with a focus
on manufacturing, services and outsourcing rather than the North-to-South investment in primary product
sectors and railroads that were characteristic of the first wave).
    - The different nature of trade (voluminous intra-industry trade among similar nations driven by scale
economies and product differentiation rather than inter-industry trade driven by factor endowments
differences and technology gaps as in the first wave).
    - The different nature of income convergence/divergence and industrialisation/de-industrialisation. The
second wave witnessed rapid (by historical standards) income convergence among leading nations coupled
with their de-industrialisation and extremely rapid industrialisation of some developing nations. The first
wave was marked by slow catch-up of now rich nations (to the UK) coupled with the industrialisation of
converge-ers and the de-industrialisation of diverge-ers.
    - The different speeds at which transportation and communication costs fell. Both dropped sharply in
both waves, but the drop in communication costs far outpaced the drop in transport costs in the second
wave, especially since 1980). This difference is entwined with the difference just mention, as the Section-2
analytic framework shows.
    Second, the initial conditions are very dissimilar and this matters greatly. The legacy of colonialism and
the vast income differences that we now see have a profound impact on the policymaking environment,
especially in the Third World. On one hand, 19th century trade and de-industrialisation embittered nations,
such as India and China, and this still makes it difficult for them to embrace laissez-faire trade and
investment policies. On a positive side, however, the wide gap between rich and poor—teamed with more
rapid technology transfer—means that those developing nations that do take-off, do so at rates that dwarf
those of the 19th century.
    Third, the international economic system is entirely different. Demands placed on national
policymakers are far greater now than they were at the turn of the century. Electorates routinely expect
expensive social welfare programs and low taxes, full-employment and low inflation, and above all, they
expect steady income growth. These demands—coupled with the heightened interdependence of nations—
face policymakers with challenges that were unknown in during the first wave. The tri-lemma of monetary
policy is perhaps the best example of a new challenge. Another is the tendency for trade negotiations to
encroach on issues that were previously considered matters of purely national concern.
    The international systems also differ in a grander way. Most of the Victorian-era globalisation occurred
under Pax Britannica and without any effective international institutions or formal rules. A good part of the
second wave also occurred under a hegemon, this time the US, but with an important difference. The
30


international economic system is now bolstered by a solid set of international institutions and rules (e.g.,
the WTO/GATT and the IMF) and these are defended by all major nations. Such arrangements help
stabilise the system, even as the US slowly shrugs off the mantle of economic leadership.
    Finally, the changing beliefs of policymakers have also radically altered the international economic
system. The first wave of globalisation ended badly–two global conflagrations resulted in tens of millions
of deaths and incalculable material damage. The ultimate cause of this was the misguided belief that
national prosperity necessarily entailed international competition for turf and/or exclusive access to
markets. In the late 20th century, such notions are dismissed in advanced industrial nations. Unfortunately,
these 19th century beliefs are still alive in some nations–China and Russia in particular. It would seem,
therefore, that a key challenge in global governance is to draw these nations tightly into the global system
of trade and investment.
