                   Are Asset Demand Functions Determined by CAPN?

                                       ABSTRACT


        The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPH) says that the responsiveness of

asset—demands to expected returns depends (inversely) on the variance—covari—

ance matrix of returns,, rather than being an arbitrary set of parameters.

Previous tests of CAPM have usually computed covariances of returns around

sample means, and then checked whether the riskier assets are those with the

higher mean returns. We offer a new technique for testing CAPM. The

technique requires the use of time series data on actual asset—holdings, and

non—linear maximum likelihood estimation. We claim superiority to earlier

tests on three grounds. (1) We allow expected returns to vary freely over

time.     (2) The alternative hypothesis is well—specified: asset—demands are

linear functions of expected returns that do not depend on the variance—

covariance matrix.     (3) The test—statistic has a known distribution; it is

simply a likelihood ratio test. We try the technique on yearly data, 1954—

1980, for household holdings of a portfolio of six assets: short—term bills

and deposits, tangible assets, federal debt, state and local debt, corporate

debt, and equities.. Our test rejects the CAPM hypothesis.

1. INTRODUCTION

     The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) provides a compelling

framework for modeling the asset demands of investors who care about not only

expected returns but risk as well. The model has traditionally been tested

empirically by looking for a significant relationship between various assets'

expected returns and their risk as measured by covariances with the overall

market rate of return.1 However such tests were in the late 197Os subjected to

some powerful methodological criticisms.2 While more sophisticated tests continue

to be proposed,3 some of the leaders of the finance field appear to believe

that the well—specified test of.CAPM still does not exist.4 A well—specified

test would consist of a test statistic that has a known distribution under

the null hypothesis that CAPM holds, and preferably under some meaningful

alternative hypothesis as well. This paper claims to offer such a test.

     To understand the test, it might help to think about asset—demands from

the macroeconomic viewpoint. Macroeconomists have never doubted that the

demands for various assets are functions of their expected returns. The

question is, what determines the parameters in these functions? The CAPH

answer is that the parameters are inversely related to the coefficient of

risk—aversion and the variance—covariance matrix of returns. It is worth

recalling that the Tobin—Markowitz model was first developed by a macro—

economist to answer precisely this question,5 not by a stock market analyst

to help choose his clients' portfolios nor by a business school professor to

demonstrate the wonders of efficient financial markets. However, empirical

tests of CAPM on the aggregate level have at best repeated the methodology

used in the microeconomic finance tests.6
                                                                                                   2




     The test proposed here requires a willingness to use time series data

on actual portfolios held, rather than restricting the analysis to time

series data on rates of return as most previous studies have done.7 The

data used here are the holdings of the aggregate U.S. household sector among

six assets: consumer durables and real estate; short—term U.S. government

securities, open market paper, and deposits; long—term federal debt; state

and local debt; corporate bonds; and equities. It would be possible, indeed

desirable, to apply the technique to more disaggregated data.


2.   ESTIMATION OF UNCONSTRAINED ASSET-D4AND FUNCTIONS

     We begin by     specifying      the general alternative hypothesis within which

the CAIN   hypothesis   is nested. Investors choose their portfolio shares as

some linear function of expected one—period returns on the various assets,

relative to the expected return on some numeraire asset:


                                     = ci                                                    (1)
                                            + S(Er+i_tEr+i)

where x is a vector of portfolio shares allocated to each of the G — 1

assets (the Gth asset is eliminated as redundant; in our case G = 6                    and

the redundant asset is Treasury bills and other short—term assets);

                is a vector of the market's expected one—period real returns on

           each of the C — 1         assets.

                is the market's expected one—period real return on the numeraire

           asset (in our case, Treasury bills again);

      1-   is   a vector of ones,of length C — 1

      a is a vector of C — 1                constants; and

      S    is   a (C — 1) X   (G —   1)     matrix   of   coefficients that measures the

           responsiveness of asset demands to expected returns.
                                                                                             3




We invert equation (1) toexpress expected returns as a function of asset

shares:9


                        Er+1 — tEr"+1 =   —         +                                  (2)
                                                        C'x
     A coon stumbling block is how to model expectations, which are unob-

servable. Usually the expected return is assumed constant, and estimated by

the sample mean. At best it is allowed to change gradually over time as an

ad hoc ARIMA process or as a distributed lag of its own past values, or of

other observable variables. But the way we have set up equation (2), all

that is needed here is to assume that expectations are rational, i.e. that

the ex post realized returns are given by


                        —                   —                                          (3)

(For our purposes it is necessary only that             include x But it can
contain other variables as well.)

     From (2) and (3) we have


                      r+1 — trd+1 = —S1cz + 8x + c.11            .                     (4)

Two aspects of equation (4) are noteworthy. All      variables       are observable.

And by the rational expectations assumption, the error term is independent of

        *Significant at the 95% level.          (Standard errors in parentheses.)
specification of equation (4) is that it allows expected returns to vary from

period to period S much as they want. Fluctuation in interest rates, the ex-

pected inflation rate, the expected rate of return on equity, etc., has indeed

been large in recent years. Furthermore we have made no ad hoc assumptions

about what determines actual returns or expected returns, other than that

expectations are rational.

      Table 1 reports the results of the OLS estimation. The estimates indicate,

for example, that it would take a 30.39 percent increase in the expected aitnual

return on corporate debt to induce investors to accept an increase in their

holdings of corporate debt equal to 1 per cent of their portfolio. This

assumes that the increase comes at the expense of the omitted asset, short—

term bills and deposits. To calculate the effect of a 1 per cent increase

in corporate debt at the expense of another asset, take the difference of

the two relevant coefficients.

      Only a few of the coefficients appear significantly different from zero by

t—tests. But all but one of the individual equations do appear significant by

F—tests)° To do an overall test of the system of equations we must compare the

log likelihood when the coefficients are constrained to zero, to the likelihood

unconstrained.11 The numbers are 220.93 and 259.42          ,   respectively.   Since

twice the difference is distributed      ,   the   reduction in the likelihood

that would result from the constraint that the coefficients are all zero is

highly significant.


3. ESTIMATION OF CONSTRAINED ASSET—DEMAND FUNCTIONS

      We now consider the restrictions imposed on the asset—demand function

(1)   by CAPt   Since the econometrics are necessarily discrete—time, we adopt

a discrete—time theoretical framework. Consider four assumptions:
                                                                                 6




     (Al) perfect capital markets

     (A2) optimization of end—of—period expected utility

     (A3) normal distribution of returns
                                              12
     (A4) constant relative risk—aversion.

As we show in Appendix 1, these assumptions imply a restriction on the asset—

demand function (1) that is astonishingly simple:13


                                    S   =   [p]
where p is the constant of relative risk—aversion and 2 is the G — 1XG         — 1

variance—covariance matrix of returns. Intuidvely, investors will respond less

to a given disparity in expected returns if the perceived uncertainty   (12)


is high, or if their risk—aversion (P) is high.

     The conventional way to estimate the optimal portfolio is to estimate the

sample variance—covariance matrix of ex post returns. But such an approach pre—

suxnes that expected returns are constant, an assumption we have been trying to

avoid, and on the other end leaves us with a constant estimated optimal portfolio,

which would be difficult to compare rigorously to the time—varying actual port-

folio x      The key insight of this paper is that Q is precisely the variance—

covariance matrix Ecc' of the error term in equation (4), and that the equation

should be estimated sublect to this constraint. The imposition of a constraint

between the coefficient matrix and the error variance—covariance matrix is

unusual in econometrics, and requires maximum likelihood estimation Ofl..E). Once

we have done this estimation, we have our test of CAPM: we compare the log

likelihood at the constrained maximum, to the log likelihood of the uncon-

strained version that we have already done in Table 1. Appendix (2) shows the
                                                                                        7




constrained likelihood function and its derivatives, and describes the program

used to maximize it.

      If the   aim   were   to assume CAPH a priori and to use the information to
get   the most efficient possible estinates of the parameters, then one might

wish to impose not only the constraint that the coefficient matrix is propor-

tional to the variance—covariance matrix Si ,          but   to impose as well an a priori

value for the constant of proportionality, which is the coefficient of relative

risk—aversion p .          Friend and Blume (1975) offer evidence that p may be in
the neighborhood of 2.0 .          We   report in Table 2 the parameter estimates for

the case p = 2.0       .    The results look quite different from those in Table 1.

If one believes the constraints, then the difference is simply the result of

more efficient estimates. One has to invert the matrix in order to recover

the original B       matrix    and see which assets are close substitutes for which

other assets. These coefficients are reported in Table 3. We can infer from

the negative numbers in the fourth row for example that corporate bonds are

substitutes for federal debt, state and local debt, and equities)4

      But we have chosen in this paper to emphasize the use of our technique to

test the CAiPM   hypothesis, rather than       the use of the technique to impose the

hypothesis. The log likelihood for the estimates in Table 2 is 154.19

a substantial decrease from the unconstrained log likelihood 259.42 .             In
other words, the fit has worsened. Twice the difference is far above the

5 per cent critical level. This constitutes a clear rejction of the CAPM

hypothesis.

      Perhaps the constraint that p =          2.0   is too restrictive and accounts for

the magnitude of the decline in the likelihood function. We searched over

the range p = 1.0           to p = 20.0 with the technique. The likelihood function

increases with p in this range, but at P = 20.0          the log likelihood was

still only 169.68 , which is again a clear rejection of the CAPII hypothesis.

There did not seem to be any point in searching beyond this already implau-

sibly high range.


4.   CONCLUSION

     How could CAPM fail to hold? Do our results imply that investors are

irrational? The failure of any one of the four CAPH assumptions listed above

could explain the finding. Investors may be rational but may have to optimize

subject to constraints such as imperfect capital markets. Or they may be

maximizing an intertemporal utility function, A   la   Merton (1973) and Breeden

(1979), that is more complicated than a function of the mean and variance of

end—of—period real wealth. Or returns may not be normally distributed. Or

investors may not have a constant coefficient of relative risk—aversion.

     Our rejection of the null hypothesis could also be due to the failure

of other assumptions -that we have made in our model, but that are not part

of CAPM most narrowly defined: homogeneous investors, a constant variance—

covariance matrix, rational expectations, the aggregation of the assets into

six, and the accurate measurement of the holdings of those assets. The test

could be refined with respect to most of these assumptions, especially by

greater disaggregation of the assets or the holders.

      The Capital Asset Pricing Model is a very attractive way to bring struc-

ture to asset—demand functions. One possibility is that true asset demands

are equal to those given by the CAPM formula plus some other factors. The

other factors would not necessarily have to be large for our technique to

reject the null hypothesis. This is entirely appropriate. We are testing
                                                                             11




the hypothesis that CAP)! holds exactly. But it does allow the possibility

that CAP)! may still have something to tell us about asset demands despite

our statistical rejection of it.

                                        Appendix 1


     In this appendix we derive the correct form f or the asset—demands of an

investor who maximizes a function of the mean and variance of his end—of—period

real wealth.

     Let W be real wealth. The investor must choose the vector of port-

folio shares x that he wishes to allocate to the various assets. End—of—

period real wealth will be given by:


                            =   W+ W x'r +1 + W(l_xt)r+1                            (Al)

                            =               + 1 +
                                Wt{xtz+i

where we have defined the vector of returns on the G — 1          assets relative

to the numeraire asset (deposits): z1 E           rt+l
     The expected value and variance of end—of—period wealth (5), conditional

on current information, are as follows:


               EW+1 =     WjxEz+1 +       1 +

                                                  2x
                                    +
                                        vr'÷1 +
                      =
                          W2[xc2x                      Cov(z+1. r+1)]

where we have defined the variance—covariance matrix of relative returns:


                          Q EE(z1 — Ez+1)(z÷1            —



     The hypothesis is that investors maximize a function of the expected

value and variance:



                                 F{E(Wt+1) v(w+1)]

We differentiate with respect to

We define the coefficient of relative risk—aversion p
                                                                           _W2F2/Fi
which is assumed constant. Then we have our resuic:-


                            Ez+i =     P   Cov(z÷l,lrd+l) + pQx                           (A2)



This is just equation (2) with                     constrained to be pQ , as claimed by

equation (5) in the text.            (There is also a constraint imposed on the

intercept term      .   But it is inconvenient to impose this constraint in the

econometrics. Nor do we need it, since the constraint on the coefficient

matrix already gives us 25 overidentifying restrictions.)

     For economic intuition, we can invert (A2) to solve for the portfolio

shares, the form analogous to (1):


                            =    Q Cov(z41, 4+i) + (P1)1Ez+i                 .             (A3)


The asset demands consist of two parts. The first term represents the

"minijjm—variance" portfolio, which the investor will hold if he is extremely

risk—averse (p          .       For example, suppose he views deposits as a safe

asset, which requires that the inflation rate is nonstochastic. Then his

minimum—variance portfolio is entirely in deposits: the G — 1                     entries in

    are all zero because the Coy in (A3) is zero. The second term represents

the "speculative" portfolio. A higher expected return on a given asset induces

investors to hold more of that asset than is in the minimum—variance portfolio,

to an extent limited only by the degree of risk—aversion and the uncertainty

of the return.

in the likelihood function in two ways. To maximize, we differentiate. The

derivatives with respect to the coefficient of risk—aversion and the inter-

cept term are easy:

                                        —

                                    =I
     The derivative with respect to the elements of the variance—covariance

matrix is trickier. It will help to perform the Choleski factorization of

the matrix:


                                            S's =   12
where S is a lower triangular matrix, and to differentiate with respect

to the elements of S , which can be thought of as the C — 1                 generali-

zation of the standard deviation. We first use the two facts (from

Theil (1971, pp. 31—32), equations (6—14) and (6—8), respectively):


                             9detQI   =2—1   and       3(E'Qc)   EC



                     = - cc1 — 4          [Qc+ie+i) + 2Q1(3e+i/32)]

Then we use the chain rule.


      aL/as = (aLfacz)(a12/aS)

            =   {-       (S'S) +4 [(S'S)c+ie+i(S'S) + 2P(S'S)x]}2S.

Setting the derivatives equal to zero gives first order conditions that

characterize the NLE. However, due to nonlinearity they cannot be solved

explicitly for the estimates of p ,            c   ,   and   2 or S .    The Berndt, Hall,

Hall and Hausman (1974) algorithm uses the first derivatives to find the

maximum of the likelihood function in non—linear models. For our problem,

we modified a program written by Paul Ruud, based on this algorithm.15

                                    DATA


     The main source for data on supplies of nine assets held by house-

holds was the Federal Reserve Board's Balance Sheets for the U.S. Economy

(October 1981) Table 702. This source was used in place of the Fed's Flow of

Funds Accounts, Assets and Liabilities Outstanding, to which it is closely

related, because only the Balance Sheets include data for tangible assets,

i.e. real estate and consumer durables (see page iii of the Flow of Funds

for an explanation). The variables used in the econometrics are shares of

wealth, the supply of the asset in question divided by the sum of all nine

asset supplies.

     The asset supplies were taken from the Balance Sheets as follows. Real
                                                                             16
estate is line 1 (total tangible assets) minus line 7 (consumer durables).

Consumer durables is line 717 Open market paper is line 25. Short—term U.S.

government securities are line 20 [not available before 1951]. Deposits is

the sum of lines 13, checkable deposits and currency, 14, small time and

savings deposits, 15, money market fund shares, and 16, large time deposits.

Long—term federal debt is line 18 (U.S. government securities) minus line 20.

State and local debt is line 23. Private bonds are line 24 (corporate and

foreign bonds) plus line 26 (mortgages held).18 Finally, equities are

line 27 (corporate equities) plus line 32 (noncorporate business equity))9

     For three of the asset supplies——long—tern federal debt, state and local

bonds, and private bonds——the numbers represent book value and must be multi-

plied by some measure of current market prices to get the correct measure of

market value. The very large decline in prices of bonds over the postwar

period make this correction a crucial one. (Equities and tangible assets

are already measured at market value, while capital gains and losses are
                                                                                17




irrelevant for the three short—term assets.) Measures of the current market

bond prices are reported by Standard and Poor's Trade and Security Statistics

Security Price Index Record (1982): page 235 for U.S. government bond prices,

233 f or municipal bond prices, and 231 for high grade corporate bond prices.

Standard and Poor's computes the price indexes from yield data, assuming a

3% coupon with 15 years to maturity for the federal bonds and a 4% coupon

with 20 years to maturity for the. other two.2°

     Among the rates of return, the two most problematical are those on real

estate and durables, taken here as the percentage change in price indices

reported in the Economic Report of the President 1982: the home purchase

component of the CPI (p. 292) and the durable goods personal consumption

expenditure component of the GNP deflator (p. 236). There exist better

measures of house prices, and unpublished estimates of imputed service returns

on housing and durables, but they are not available for the entire sample

period. When the two tangibles are aggregated, we use real estate appreciation

as the return.

     The short—term assets are straight—forward. The rate of return on open

market paper is the interest rate on commercial paper from the Federal Reserve

Board: Banking and Monetary Statistics 1941—1970, table 12.5, Annual

tical Digest 1970—79, table 22A, and ASD 1980, table 25A. The rate of return

on short—term government securities is the treasury bill rate: 9—12 month

issues (certificates of indebtedness and selected note and bond issues; the

1—year bill market yield rate is not available before 1960) from BMS 1941—1970,

and the 1—year bill secondary market from ASD 1970—1979, table 22A, and

ASD 1980, table 25A. The rate of return on deposits is the rate on 90—day

bankers' acceptances from EMS 1941—1970, table 12.5, ASD 1970—1979, table 22A,
                                                                                18




and ASD 1980, table 25A. Alternatives such as the return on money market funds

might be theoretically preferable but are not available for the early part of

the sample period. Note that in aggregating non—interest paying money together

with interest—paying accounts, we are assuming that the former performs an

implicit liquidity service that brings its return up to the explicit return

of the latter. When the three short—term assets are aggregated, we use the

Treasury bill rate as the return.

     Each of the long—term assets entails a yield plus capital gains. For

each of the three kinds of bonds, capital gains are percentage change in the

same bond prices from Standard and Poor's Trade and Securities Statistics that

were discussed above. The yields are from the same source: respectively, the

median yield to maturity of a number of government bonds restricted to those

issues with more than ten years to maturity, p. 234, an arithmetic average of

the yield to maturity of fifteen high grade municipal bonds, p. 232, and an

average of the MA Industrial and Utility bonds, p. 219.   (The yields are also

available from the Fed sources: EMS 1941—1970, table 12.12, ASD 1970—1979,

table 22A and ASP 1980, table 25A1) For equities, capital gains are percentage

change in Stanford and Poor's index of common stock prices from BNS 1941—1970,

table 12.16, ASP 1970—1979, table 22A, and ASP 1980, table 26A. To capital

gains we add the dividend price ratio on common stock, from EMS 1941—1970,

table 12.19, ASP 1970—79, table 22A, and ASP 1980, table 25A.

     The foregoing are all nominal returns. To convert to real returns we

use the percentage change in the CPI, from the Economic Report of the President

1982. To be precise we divide one plus the nominal return by one plus

the inflation rate. Subtracting the inflation rate from the nominal return

would give approximately the same answer, and when we computed real returns
                                                                                 19




relative to the numeraire asset the two inflation rates would conveniently

drop out, but this answer would differ from the correct one by a convexity

term.

        Absent from the calculations is any allowance for differences in tax

treatment. In particular, the returns on state and local bonds, and to

some extent on tangibles, are here understated relative to the other assets

because   they are tax—free. The unconstrained constant term that we allow
for in the econometrics should capture most of this effect (and any other
constant omitted factors such as the service return from tangibles, as
well).    But it would be desirable to compute after—tax real returns instead.

6. Nordhaus and Durlauf (1982) is one of the very few attempts to test

    CAPM on a comprehensive portfolio of highly aggregated assets, similar

    to the portfolio used in the present study: corporate fixed capital,

    housing, short—term government bonds, long—term government bonds, and

    consumer durables.

7. A few studies, such as Friend and Blume (1975) have dared to look at

    actual portfolios held by households, but not in time series form. Use

    of consumption data in tests of Breeden's (1979) intertemporal CAPM may

    have accustomed the finance profession to time series data on quantity.

8. The choice to express returns relative to a numeraire is not restrictive.

    We could generalize (1) slightly to




                                          rrt÷i
                             x =a+E Id

     we need only subtract the last row from each of the others to get an

     equation of the precise form as (2). In what follows we only use (2)

     anyway.

            Note, incidentally, that we must avoid the temptation to think that

     because "expected inflation cancels out" relative real returns can be

     replaced with relative nominal returns. If i÷1 is the nominal return

     on a particular asset j and t+l is the inflation rate,


                                        1+ij

9.   The validity of the technique depends on the assumption that the asset—

     demand function (1) holds exactly. If asset demands are determined by

     CAPM   plus   other factors, the null hypothesis does not hold.

10. The test that the coefficients in a row are significantly different from

     zero is a test that the asset in question is not a perfect substitute

     for Treasury bills and other short—term assets. The 5 per cent critical

     level for the F statistic is 2.68

11. The estimated log likelihood is given by equation (6) in Appendix 2, with

     the estinates          and Q substituted in for the true parameters. The

     last of the three terms is simply —                 (G—l)T                            =
                                                             2         because cQ
                      tr     "—1 =
                                        tr   "—1 =       — 1
     tr cQ c =                               QS2     G           .   (See C. S. Maddala,

     metrics (N.Y.: McGraw—Hill) 1977, p. 487 after equation C—50.) So the

     test statistic varies only with the determinant of Q .                      Under the zero—
                                                                                    22



    coefficient constraint, Q is simply the variance—covariance matrix of

    the raw data, the relative rates of return.     (We do allow f or a non—zero

    constant term.) Unconstrained, Q is the variance—covariance matrix of

    the residuals of the C — 1    equations. Because the residuals are

    correlated across equations, T logQ is somewhat less than the sum

    of the lags of the C — 1     individual equations' sums of squared residuals,

    and the log likelihood is correspondingly greater than the sum    of      the

    C — 1    individual log likelihoods. (The 5% significance level for the

          test is 37.65)

12. The utility function will have a constant coefficient of relative risk—

    aversiOn if it is a power function:

                                          1   1—P



    We   could replace the last two assumptions with the single assumption of

    quadratic utility. But that assumption is unrealistic, and we will need

    to assume a normal distribution anyway in order to do our maximum likeli-

    hood estimation.

          The solutián to the one—period maximization problem considered here

     (Assumption 2) will give the same answer as the general intertemporal

    maximization p±tblem if the utility function is further restricted to

    the logarithmic form, the limiting case as p goes to 1.0 ,      or   if

    expected retunis in future periods are independent of the realization of

    this period1s return. See Merton (1973, pp. 877—78) or Fama (1970).

13. The derivation is relegated to the Appendix, not because of any degree

    of complexity, but rather because of its familiarity. Some similar

     formulations are Friend and Blume (1975, equation 5), Black (1976,

    equation 4), and Friedman and Roley (1979, equation 20').
                                                                               23




14. On the other hand, state and local bonds, surprisingly, appear to be

     complementary to federal debt, as is reflected also by a negative sign

     in the corresponding entry in Table 2. This illustrates how big a

     difference it makes to compute the covariance around a time—varying

     expected return (half of —.0007 in this case) rather than the simple

     covariance around the mean, which does turn out to be positive

     (+.0052 in this case) as we would expect. If the model is correct,

     the apparent positive correlation of real returns on these two kinds of

     bonds was a positive correlation of their expected returns, not the

     unexpected returns.

15. This is the same program used in Frankel and Engel (1982). An analytic

     solution was derived in Frankel (1982) for a problem that was the same

     but for the absence of an intercept term to be estimated.

16. An alternative here is to subtract lines 38 and 39, mortgages owed by

     households, viewing them as a liability that is institutionally tied to

     the real estate asset. One cannot explain otherwise households' decision

     to hold on net a negative quantity of mortgages on risk—return considera-

     tions, as the mortgage rate is higher than that on other bonds.

17. An alternative here is to subtract lines 40 and 41, consumer credit,

    viewing it as a liability that is tied to the durables asset, for the

     same reason as in the previous footnote.

18. An alternative here is to add in also lines 30 (life insurance reserves),

     31 (pension fund reserves) and 34 (miscellaneous assets). These cannot

    be treated as separate assets because their rates of return are not
                                                                               24




    available, but it is desirable to have all forms of wealth included

     somewhere, and they fit into the category of private bands better than

     anywhere else.

19. An alternative here is to subtract the difference of lines 44 and 33,

     representing net security credit, viewing it as a liability that is

     tied to the equity asset.

20. These same bond prices were reported in the Federal Reserve Board's

     Banking and Monetary Statistics 1941—1970. They have been discontinued

     apparently because the Capital Markets Section at the Federal Reserve

     Board feels that dispersion in the coupon rate and shifts in the tern

     structure make the aggregation of all long—tern bonds no longer possible.

     But some correction for the market price is clearly preferable to none.
