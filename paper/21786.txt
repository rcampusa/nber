                                            ABSTRACT

During the Great Depression, Building and Loans (B&Ls), the leading home lenders, had a structure
that mitigated the crisis. Borrowers were owners of the B&L and dissolution of the institution required
a two-thirds majority vote. Using panel data from New Jersey in the 1930s, we find that this voting
rule delayed dissolution by about one year. The year delay allowed one-fourth of the borrowers in
the at-risk B&L to pay off their loans, but nonborrowers lost share value. The net loss was roughly
-0.67 percent of the value of all New Jersey B&L assets in the mid-1930s.

         During both the Great Depression of the 1930s and the Great Recession of 2008, the

economy was rocked by home mortgage crises. In both periods nominal housing values fell

sharply after an earlier boom and housing starts fell to levels below 25 percent of the earlier peak

and failed to recover anywhere near normal levels for an extended period of time. 1 On the credit

side, opportunities to obtain new mortgages were cut back drastically. The real stock of home

mortgage debt in 2013 still remained 11.7 percent below its 2009 peak, while during the

Depression the stock remained 15 percent below the 1932 peak as late as 1940. Atif Mian and

Amir Sufi (2011 and 2014) find that the problems in the mortgage markets significantly

contributed to drops in employment in nontradeable sectors and had strong effects on household

balance sheets that contributed to the Great Recession. In both periods the federal government

put significant programs in place to provide relief for borrowers, to reduce foreclosures and

distress sales, and to prop up housing markets. The major New Deal intervention was the Home

Owners’ Loan Corporations (HOLC) that refinanced and modified the loans of distressed

borrowers on more generous terms. During the recent crisis the Homes Affordable Modification

Program (HAMP) was created to offer side payment to loan servicers so that they provided

borrower with relief by modifying the terms of their loans. 2

         One important difference between the mortgage crises of the two periods is the structure

of mortgage contracts and the organization of the most common type of lender. Arms-length

contracts account for the vast majority of modern mortgage contracts. In the early 2000s most

1
  In the 2000s housing starts peaked at 2.1 million in 2005, fell to 1.3 million in 2007 and troughed at 0.5 million in
2009 and recovered to only 0.9 million by 2013. In the earlier era they peaked at 937,000 in 1925 and then fell to
509,000 in 1929, a level that was still substantially higher than the levels prior to the 1920s. They then fell 93,000
in 1933 and only reached the 1929 level again in 1940. Data on housing starts and the stock of home mortgage debt
from the earlier era was compiled from Snowden 2006, 4-481 to 4-482 and 4-526 to 4-527 and deflated by the CPI
1967=100. For the current period they are from the FRED database at the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank.
2
 Government programs provided more forbearance to borrowers in servicing the repayment loans in the
1930s than in the 2000s. In government programs the HOLC allowed borrowers to be delinquent on
repayments for periods that were four to eight times as long as the HAMP has allowed in the modern
period.

were split up and sold into mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations,

breaking the connection between original lender and borrower in the repayment process. When

the mortgage crisis developed in the 2000s borrowers had little say in the foreclosure process or

in the timing of the liquidation of a troubled lender beyond beseeching the lender for forbearance

or pushing for political solutions to their problems. Mian and Sufi (2014) argue that this

imbalance caused borrowers to bear a larger share of the burden than lenders when housing

prices dropped and the financial crisis developed 2006 and 2010. They have proposed a new

“shared responsibility” mortgage contract that would protect mortgage borrowers against the

downside risk of drops in housing prices.                  In a sense their proposed mortgage provides

forbearance to the borrower through the mortgage contract itself. 3

         Before World War II the market for mortgages included opportunities for forbearance by

contract to a significant number of borrowers at Building and Loans (B&Ls), the leading type of

mortgage lender during the period. Each B&L was mutually-owned by both its borrowing and

non-borrowing members. As owners, borrowing B&L members shared in the profits and losses

earned by their associations but also shared control over whether and when their B&L liquidated

when it was distressed. We show here that B&L borrowers who remained current on their loans

generally favored delaying liquidation of the B&L because of the unique structure of the

traditional B&L mortgage loan.              These contracts combined a simple balloon loan with a

commitment from the borrower to purchase in monthly installments over time shares of the

association’s equity association equal in value to the principal of the loan. The borrower’s shares,

and the dividends received on them, formed a sinking fund that secured the loan and was

3
  For examples of uses of contractual clauses to limit the incentives of lenders to foreclose, see Mulherin and Muller
(1987). To see the impact on mortgage interest rates of laws that impose specific contractual arrangements that
influence foreclosure risk, see Pense (2006) and Alston and Rucker (1987). Ghent (2011) description of the loan
modifications made by commercial lenders in the 1930s typically involved lengthening the contract and not
reductions in principal.


                                                          3
normally used to repay it when the book value of the accumulated dues and dividends was

sufficient to cancel the outstanding debt.     If the association went into liquidation before a

borrower could repay his B&L loan, in contrast, the borrower had to refinance the entire

principal of the loan and then wait to receive the liquidation value of the shares in the sinking

fund. These results of a dissolution increased the distress of B&L borrowers and gave them

good reason to favor delaying liquidation until after they had repaid their loans.

       Nonborrowing B&L members in a distressed B&L viewed liquidation differently. Just

like borrowers, these members purchased B&L equity in monthly installments and normally

received dividends on these investments from the profits of the association’s mortgage lending

operations.   But dividends disappeared, and losses from foreclosures became embedded in

balance sheets when B&Ls suffered substantial losses during the 1930s crisis. Faced with this

situation, many nonborrowing members of B&Ls sought to withdraw from their association in

order to avoid further decreases in the value of their investment. Because B&L members held

equity, and not deposits, the association could postpone acting on meeting the request for

withdrawal indefinitely and thousands of B&Ls remained in this “frozen” state for several years

in the 1930s. In this situation voluntary liquidation was the only avenue through which members

could withdraw from a B&L. Absent a closure by state regulators for fraud or mismanagement,

B&Ls could voluntarily liquidate only if two-thirds of its members voted in favor of the action.

Thus, borrowing members had strong incentives to favor delaying liquidation, while

nonborrowers were anxious to use liquidation as an alternative to withdrawal. Given these

conflicting incentives, a B&L was unlikely to voluntarily liquidate until borrowers represented

fewer than one-third of the membership.




                                                 4
       Below we document the contractual elements that governed B&L withdrawals,

insolvency and liquidation and provided the legal basis for borrowing B&L members to delay the

liquidation of their association. We then estimate a hazard model of liquidation for a panel data

set of balance sheets of all 1,563 B&Ls that operated in New Jersey during the 1930s and find

that the two-thirds voting rule delayed the liquidation of failing B&Ls by about a year on

average. We interpret these delays as forbearance by contract, and estimate that the additional

time enabled roughly one-fourth of borrowers in distressed B&Ls to pay off their loans as

originally written and before liquidation.

       Some of these borrowers would have been foreclosed upon had their B&Ls liquidated

earlier and we estimate that through this channel the year of delay prevented a loss equal to

roughly 0.3 percent of the book value of all New Jersey B&L assets in the mid-1930s. The gain

to B&L borrowers and their associations from the forbearance provided by delayed liquidation

came at the expense of the remaining B&L members who suffered additional decreases in the

liquidation value of their shares and waited longer to transfer their B&L equity into more

remunerative assets. We estimate these costs to be about 1 percent of the book value of New

Jersey B&L assets and conclude, therefore, that delayed B&L liquidations generated negative net

benefits on an ex post basis. This last result could help to explain why the traditional B&L

contract and association was rapidly abandoned during the 1930s and transformed into the new

Savings & Loan industry that dominated residential mortgage markets for decades after 1940

(Rose and Snowden, 2012).

                                 I. The Rise and Fall of the B&L

       Why would a rational investor join a Building & Loan in which borrowers could impose

costs on investors by delaying in liquidation when the association became distressed? The



                                               5
reason, of course, is that B&Ls had performed relatively well historically before the U.S.

economy entered the worst Depression and housing crisis in U.S. history. Prior to the

Depression, B&Ls had become the most important source of residential mortgage credit in the

U.S. just one century after their introduction. By 1929 12,342 B&Ls operated in every state and

in cities of all sizes and together claimed 12 million members or one B&L member for every two

of the nation’s nonfarm families. 4 These institutions specialized in residential mortgage lending

and financed 4.2 million of the 7 million homes built between 1920 and 1929 and a total of 10.5

million of the owner-occupied homes standing in 1930. 5 In the aggregate, B&Ls held 30 percent

of the mortgage debt on 1 to 4 family homes in 1930 or 48 percent of home mortgage debt held

by institutional lenders. 6

        This record of success attests to the advantages B&L mortgages provided to borrowers,

and B&L shares to savers, relative to the other loan and savings products that were available at

the time. Before 1930 most other lenders offered homeowners interest-only, balloon loans for no

more than 50 percent of the property’s value and with maturities no longer than five years. Given

these short maturities, loans often had to be renewed one or more times before they could be paid

off in full and each renewal exposed borrowers to additional costs and risks. The B&L SAC

mortgage was written for up to 60 percent of the property value and fully extinguished the debt

over a single 11 to 12 year horizon. The B&L share accumulation plan, in addition, provided

borrowers with a form of amortization at a time no other lender offered such gradual repayment

options.

otherwise, to construct the home with the aid of the mortgage and gradually to extinguish the mortgage.”

        In addition to the attractive terms a B&L loan offered to borrowers, B&Ls also offered

non-borrowers higher returns than the savings accounts offered by commercial and savings

banks. The modal rate of earnings on book values of B&L shares in New Jersey in 1928, for

example, was 7 to 8 percent per annum. 7 Members who paid penalties for withdrawing shares

earlier than scheduled still earned six percent or higher on B&L investments after holding the

shares for five years. At the same time, deposits in mutual savings banks in New Jersey paid no

more than 4 or 4.5 percent interest (Piquet, p.111). B&L earnings were higher on average

because members participated fully in the earnings on their association’s portfolio of home

mortgage loans. 8 In addition, B&L loans were written with higher effective interest rates than

those on other lenders because as mutual organizations they were free to charge their own

borrowing members rates higher than the prevailing usury limit. With higher returns came risk,

but individual B&L loans were better secured (with a sinking fund) and more regularly

monitored (they required weekly or monthly payments) than loans made by other lenders. The

relative attractiveness of B&L shares as investments led to an increase in membership of 141

percent between 1920 and 1928 (5 to 12 million) at the same time that it grew in savings banks

by just 32 percent (11.4 to 15 million). Total B&L assets also grew relatively rapidly; by 318%

(from $2.5 to $8.0 billion) between 1920 and 1928 while the assets of mutual savings banks

increased by only 60 percent ($7.1 to $11.4 billion).

        When taken together, the B&L SAC mortgage structure proved to be attractive to both

savers and borrowers in the pre-1930 home mortgage market, which was smaller in size relative

to the housing stock, less institutionally mature, and more spatially fragmented than its modern

8
 B&L mortgage earnings were relatively high, moreover, because their Loans were not subject to local usury laws
given the cooperative nature of the association. So B&L borrowers often paid loan premiums that raised their
effective interest rate above the legal limit.


                                                        7
counterpart (Snowden, 2010). Within this environment B&Ls proved to be a nimble and elastic

source of mortgage finance as they faced lower barriers to entry than depository institutions and

could organize with no more than several dozen members wherever local demands and supplies

of mortgage funds were sufficient. 9

        For decades B&Ls had proved relatively successful at surviving downturns in the housing

sector. The Great Depression, however, led to their demise in a slow-moving process that lasted

15 years. The combination of a 30 percent drop in per capita income, sharp drops in the nominal

value of housing, and deflation that raised the real cost of repaying loans contributed to a sharp

rise in foreclosures on loans from all types of lenders. By 1934 foreclosures had become so

numerous that real estate accumulated from the foreclosures accounted for 20 percent of B&L

assets. As the foreclosures built up, B&Ls reduced or eliminated dividend payments, suspended

withdrawals, stopped making new loans, and focused on servicing loans still in good standing

and foreclosing on those who became delinquent for too long. As we show below, the process

continued until the number of borrowing members fell to a level where the nonborrowing

members could win a vote to liquidate the B&L.

         The slow moving process is illustrated with the data from New Jersey B&Ls. Even as

the real estate share of assets rose from 4 percent in 1930 to 24 percent in 1935, a level that

would have led to closures of other types of real estate lenders, the number of B&Ls in New

Jersey fell by only 3.2 percent from 1565 to 1514, compared with a 27 percent drop in the

number of commercial banks between 1930 and 1933.                 The real estate share of assets at New

Jersey B&Ls jumped to levels between 39 and 43 between 1936 and 1939, and yet 83 percent of


9
  More than 5,000 B&Ls were established and began operation during the urban building boom of the 1880s. During
the housing boom of the 1920s, more than 3,000 new B&Ls appeared. In both periods B&Ls grew in number and
importance in all regions and states, and in cities of all sizes. See Snowden, 2003.


                                                       8
the 530 closures between 1936 and 1940 did not occur until 1938 or later. The number of B&Ls

continued to decline during World War II, reaching 509 in 1945. 10

        As the B&Ls became frozen and slowly closed, their lending was replaced by Savings

and Loan (S&L) Institutions. S&L “share accounts” offered non-borrowers virtually the same

liquidity and withdrawal privileges as a bank savings account. Borrowers held only nominal

amounts in their share accounts, no longer shared substantially in the association’s lending risk,

and took out only “direct reduction” mortgage loans. These were amortized and principal

payments and immediately reduced the loan balance, so the borrower no longer faced the risk of

changes in the contractual length of the loan. Some B&Ls had begun shifting in this direction in

the 1920s (Rose and Snowden, 2014). After the problems with the SACs during the 1930s, there

was a wholesale shift in the 1930s that given was solidified by the creation of federal S&L

charters in 1934 and the establishment of deposit insurance with the Federal Savings and Loan

Corporation in 1935.



       II. The Contractual and Legal Basis of Delayed Resolution in Building & Loans

        The B&Ls attracted large numbers of lenders and borrowers in the boom of the 1920s

and were slow to close even as the mortgage crisis raged. Four key features of the B&L

contractual structure and the case law related to their operations and closure help explain these

facts: 1) The B&Ls were cooperative lending organizations in which both borrowers and

nonborrowers had ownership. As a result, borrowers had more influence on their lender’s
10
  Information on the New Jersey B&Ls is from the sample we constructed from New Jersey state reports, and the
number of New Jersey banks come from New Jersey fared better than the nation as a whole as the U.S. number of
B&Ls and Savings and Loans declined 12.8 percent between 1930 and 1935 and the number of commercial banks
declined 39 percent between 1930 and the trough in 1933 (U.S. Bureau of Census, 1975, series X834 and series
X580). Nationwide, the number of B&Ls and Savings and Loans fell by 12.8 percent. In comparison, 27 percent of
commercial banks and 15 percent of U.S. life insurance companies were eliminated nationwide between 1930 and
1933/34.The national figures are from the changes in the number of insurance companies and commercial banks
come from series X834 and X580 from U.S. Bureau of the Census (1975).


                                                      9
decisions than they did with other lenders; 2) When the B&L ran into trouble, members faced

limits on their ability to withdraw funds; 3) Liquidation of a B&L typically required a two-thirds

vote of the members, who each had one vote no matter how many shares they owned; 4)

Borrowers had incentives to delay liquidation to give them more time to pay off their loans and

avoid the losses from dissolution.



A. Building & Loans were member-owned, cooperative mortgage lending corporations.

       The heart of the traditional B&L was the share accumulation contract. Upon joining a

B&L each member agreed to purchase one or more shares in the association by making weekly

or monthly installment payments, called dues. In a typical New Jersey B&L, for example,

members pledged to pay monthly dues of $1 to purchase B&L shares that had par values of

$200. The B&L invested these funds in local home mortgage loans and paid dividends to

members from profits earned on the mortgage loans in proportion to their paid-in investments in

the association. If the B&L paid annual dividends of 6 percent, as an example, the combined

value of a member’s dues and dividends reached its $200 par value after 139 months. The time

it took to reach par value was longer if dividends fell below 6 percent, and shorter if they

averaged more.

       Three features of the share accumulation plan made the traditional B&L a unique

financial intermediary.   First, weekly or monthly share accumulation payments were not

deposits; they were equity contributions so that all B&L members were owners of the association

and fully shared in its profits and losses. Second, members who joined to borrow from the

association were required to participate in the same share accumulation plan that non-borrowing

members used for their savings. For borrowing members the investment in B&L shares,



                                               10
however, represented a sinking fund that grew over time in order to repay their loan. Third,

because both borrowing and non-borrowing members were owners they enjoyed similar voting

rights and shared equally in profits and losses even though the borrowing member-owner was, at

the same time, a debtor to the association. This last feature of the traditional B&L created

divergent interests between borrowing and non-borrowing member-owners when an association

became distressed. This divergence proved to be instrumental in delaying resolution within the

industry during the 1930s housing crisis.

         To clarify the unusual dual status of a B&L borrowing member it is useful to describe the

structure of the hybrid B&L mortgage loan in more detail. The loan combined two features: an

interest-only, balloon loan and the requirement that the borrower enter into a share accumulation

contract (SAC) equal in value to the principal of the loan. To secure a $2,000 home loan at an

interest rate of 6 percent, for example, a B&L borrower agreed to purchase ten shares of the

association each with a maturity value of $200 each. Under the combined loan and share

accumulation contracts, the borrower had to pay $10 each month in “dues” on her shares ($1 per

share for each $200 share) and another $10 each month in interest on the balloon loan (6 percent

of the $2,000 loan divided by 12 months). 11 B&L shares were generally structured to mature in

11 or 12 years, but could mature more quickly if dividend rates were higher than expected or

longer if they were lower. When the maturity value was reached, and not until then, the

borrowing member’s share account was used to repay and cancel her loan. If the borrowing

member defaulted on dues or interest payments before the shares matured, the association could

foreclose upon the property and seek full repayment from the borrower’s share account and from

the proceeds from renting or selling the property.

11
  If the market interest rate at the time of the loan differed from the dividend rate at the time the loan was taken out,
the borrowing member might pay an additional premium payment each month or make a lump sum payment at the
time of the loan.


                                                           11
B. Non-borrowing B&L members had limited withdrawal privileges.

       B&L share accumulation plans were marketed as programs that encouraged and rewarded

regular patterns of savings over long horizons. To encourage regularity, B&Ls charged fines to

non-borrowing members who did not keep current on payment of dues. Non-borrowers were also

assessed fines, and forfeited some dividends, if they withdrew their B&L shares before they had

fully matured. The penalties on early withdrawals were structured so that the net return to a

shareholder was negative or just above zero within the first two years of the share accumulation

contract, and then gradually approached the expected full maturity return after that (Clark and

Chase, 1925, 176).   Despite the incentives to hold the association stock until maturity, a survey

in 1920 found that between 35 and 90 percent of B&L shares were withdrawn before maturity

(Clark and Chase, 1925, 170). The term of B&L stock was, therefore, longer than the desired

term of most members, but appears to have offered many savers sufficiently attractive returns

over their expected investment horizon.

       B&Ls became concerned in the 1920s, however, with competition from savings deposits

at banks that offered greater liquidity, although lower expected returns, than B&L shares. To

address the issue, many associations began to waive the industry-wide requirement that B&L

members provide their association with written notification 30 days before withdrawing their

shares (Clark and Chase, 1925, 185). The change in notification policy, however, could not

mitigate the inherent and contractual limitations on B&L withdrawals. Without some restrictions

on withdrawals the B&L could not have invested almost exclusively in illiquid residential

mortgages in pursuit of their stated goals of financing homeownership and encouraging long-

term saving. Even more fundamentally, a “withdrawal” of shares from a B&L actually involved



                                               12
the repurchase of one member’s equity by the remaining owners in the association. From this

perspective, it is clear why limitations had to be placed on B&L withdrawals because an

association could not serve one of its members if by doing so it compromised the health and

liquidity of the entire association or imposed losses on other member/owners (Sundheim, 1922,

153).

        To guard against such withdrawals, B&L statutes regularly required that “at no time shall

more than one-half of the funds in the Treasury [of a B&L] be applicable to the demands of

withdrawing stockholders without the consent of the Board of Directors.” 12 If funds in a B&L

treasury were insufficient to meet withdrawal requests, then directors were required and

empowered to suspend withdrawals beyond the notification window and until sufficient treasury

funds were available. Once withdrawals had been suspended, moreover, the priority given to

members had to be determined solely by the date they had requested their withdrawals. This

meant, in particular, that no priority for withdrawals could be given to members who held

matured shares relative to those requesting early withdrawals; nor could members accelerate a

withdrawal by paying a premium to the association. 13 The obligation to treat members equally

and in their collective best interest led B&Ls to suspend withdrawals indefinitely in the heart of

the mortgage crisis and eventually to develop the rotation principle for distributing withdrawals

in the heart of the mortgage crisis. 14




12
   In citing the 1874 Pennsylvania law, Sundheim, 1922, 152 observes that “statutes in the various jurisdictions
usually contain …a similar proviso”. He shows in New Jersey (p. 253) , for example, “not more than one-half of the
receipts of any one month shall be required to be used for the payment of withdrawal claims.”
13
   Endlich, 1895, 105-7; Sundheim, 1922, 153. The B&L could also not differentiate in priority for withdrawals
between the traditional installment shares and the “full-paid” share that became widely used in the 1920s.
14
   B&Ls that adopted the “rotation principle,” during the 1930s set a fixed dollar limit for withdrawals each month
and members queued up to receive it. Once they had received this fixed amount, they were then placed at the back
of the line to wait for their next fixed payment. It took some members several years to withdraw all of their
investment under this system (Bodfish and Theobold 1938, 161).


                                                        13
        Restrictions on the withdrawal of shares by a borrowing member of a B&L were much

simpler. First, borrowing members could never withdraw their shares without fully repaying the

loan. Second, borrowing members could use unmatured shares and additional funds to prepay

their mortgage loan at any time (Sundheim 1922, 168). Finally, and most important for purposes

here, borrowing members had a right to use their shares to pay off their loans at any time

(Endlich (1895, 144). Such “withdrawals” drained no funds from the association’s treasury and

so could not be suspended. This ability to repay at any time played an important role in

determining the borrower’s incentives to delay the closing of the B&L.




C. B&L insolvency was rare; liquidation generally had to be triggered by a vote of members.

        A B&L could not be closed because it was illiquid.                       B&Ls were member-owned

corporations that were not obliged to repurchase the shares of their owners on demand. It turns

out that B&Ls also rarely became insolvent. A survey of available state supervisory reports in

1925 found there had been no reports of B&L failures in 24 states and only 88 failures reported

across the entire industry since around 1890 (Clark and Chase, 1925, 15). 15 B&L advocates

pointed to the small number of failures as evidence of safety and soundness. A more accurate

characterization, however, would have been that the unique character of the traditional B&L

insured that “failures” within that industry—using the common understanding of the term—

would be rare:


15
  Clark and Chase (1925, 365) conducted the survey by consulting the state regulatory reports that were then
available at that time. The periods covered by this survey varied by state, but rarely extended to before 1890 when
only a few states systematically regulated B&Ls. Nonetheless, the annual reports revealed that no B&L failures had
been reported in 24 states up to that time. Excluded from these counts were the planned closings of what were
known as “terminating” B&L associations and a wave of failures during the early 1890s among a group of
“national” building & loans that unsuccessfully attempted to deploy the local building & loan model over multi-state
markets. Snowden (2003, 172-8) examines the reasons for and impacts of the failures of the national associations.


                                                        14
         The insolvency of [a building and loan] is sui generis. There can be, strictly speaking, no
         insolvency, for the only creditors are the stockholders by virtue of their stock.

                                                              Braver, 1936, 1345-6.

         The meaning of insolvency for B&Ls was unique because their business was confined to

raising capital from their member-owners and making loans to a subset of the same group

(Endlich 1895, 497 and Sundheim 192, 179). The traditional B&Ls in most states were not

allowed to take deposits. 16 B&Ls were also restricted in their use of other forms of borrowing to

conduct their business. 17 With such limited reliance on creditors:

         It is scarcely conceivable that the assets of a building association should shrink in so
         remarkable a manner as to leave such claimants in a position of inability to reimburse
         themselves by process of law. No case, it is believed, has occurred in which this was a
         ground for a successful appointment of a receiver.
                                             Endlich, 1895, 497.

The fact that Building and Loans were generally not vulnerable to insolvency due to the actions

of external creditors was recognized in 1932 in law when the industry was exempted from the

U.S. bankruptcy code (U.S. House of Representatives (1932).

         As a B&L suffered distress, the issue of insolvency did arise, however, because

withdrawing members who had not been paid became general creditors in law and could sue for

restitution after the notification period for withdrawals had passed. In these cases the court was

left to identify the conditions under which an association could be judged “insolvent.” Over

time, case law settled on a deceptively simple standard. A B&L was insolvent when the assets of

the association became insufficient to repay on a “dollar for dollar” basis the dues that its

members had paid into their share accounts (Sundheim, 1922, 179; Yale Law Review, 1933, 932).


16
   In the early 1920s 30 states, including New Jersey, prohibited B&Ls from taking deposits, and only 3 (Ohio,
Missouri and Arizona) permitted them. The remaining states, some of which had not yet enacted specific B&L
regulation, remained silent on the issue (Clark and Chase 1925, 396).
17
   B&Ls generally borrowed only from a bank for the purpose of smoothing the seasonal demand for mortgage loans
with the steady payment of stock subscriptions. All states limited borrowing to one year and most limited it to 20-25
percent, although New Jersey’s limit was 30 percent See Clark and Chase (1925, 125-6 and 403-8).


                                                         15
The rationale for this standard was the presumption that an association in this condition could no

longer fulfill the function it had been created to perform for its owners (Braver, 1936, 1346).

         The inability to repay the equity contributions of B&L members was a sensible standard

for insolvency, but one that was difficult to implement since it required the court to assess the net

worth of an operating entity. This difficulty was not mitigated, moreover, when a series of court

decisions ruled that more obvious factors—such as an empty treasury, a suspension of

withdrawals, or the appointment of a receiver by the state due to the negligence or malfeasance

of an association’s directors—did not represent determinative evidence regarding insolvency

(Sundheim, 1922, 180; Braver, 1936, 1347). As a result, a member or group of members of a

B&L that alleged its insolvency bore the burden of proof that the value of the association’s assets

was not greater than the contributions of equity made by the members. It was difficult if not

impossible for them to do so, however, because the money value of an association’s assets could

only be determined by liquidating its loans and real estate holdings—but by liquidating these the

association became dissolved.             The courts, therefore, could not settle the issue of insolvency

without ordering the liquidation of an association that they were required to presume was

solvent. 18

         There was, therefore, no statutory basis or court remedy through which a B&L could be

forced into insolvency. The state or court could appoint receivers to manage the B&L, but only

if the association was “exceeding its powers, or violating the law, or that its conditions or

methods of business would render the continuation of its operation hazardous to the public or

those having funds in its custody” (Braver, 1936, 1380). Absent these circumstances, a member-

owned, equity-financed B&L was presumed to be performing its intended function until its

18
    “The difficulty with such a hard and fast definition is that the value of “available and collectible assets” cannot
be really be determined until the association attempts to convert its securities into cash which, in turn, can only be
effectively done upon liquidation.” (University of Pennsylvania Law Review, 1933).


                                                           16
owners chose to liquidate the firm and surrender its charter (Endlich, 1895, 486). To do so, the

members had to approve a resolution of voluntary liquidation.                          Although there was a

presumption that liquidation required a unanimous vote of the members, this requirement could

be overridden within the B&Ls charter. For the case we examine in this paper—New Jersey—

the B&L Law of 1904 permitted voluntary liquidation and dissolution with the approval of two-

thirds of the stockholders attending a meeting that was called specifically for the purpose of

considering that motion (Sundheim, 1922, 258; Prescott, 1931, 200). 19




D. Borrowing members had incentives to delay voluntary liquidation.

        During the housing crisis of the 1930s most B&Ls became distressed, just like all other

residential mortgage lenders. However, B&Ls were unlike other intermediaries in that they did

not have to close when they became illiquid and could not be declared insolvent by creditors. As

a result, thousands of “frozen” B&Ls continued to operate during the 1930s even though they

had suspended withdrawals, had stopped making new loans, and were focused primarily on

servicing loans that were still in good standing and foreclosing upon those that had fallen into

arrears. B&Ls in this condition could operate indefinitely unless and until its members approved

a voluntary liquidation.

        Upon an approval of liquidation, all contracts between the B&L and its members were

rescinded (Sundheim, 1922, 183-40; Braver, 1936, 1349-50). Non-borrowing members were no

longer required to pay dues on their share accumulation contracts and could no longer take or


19
  Prescott (1931, 200) cites Section 31 of the law to read “A resolution to dissolve is adopted by the board of
directors when in their judgment such course is deemed best. A notice of adoption is sent to each member stating
the time and place of the shareholders’ meeting for action thereon. At the meeting, an affirmative vote of two-thirds
in interest of the members present is required for the adoption. A copy of the resolution must them be filed with the
Commissioner of Banking and Insurance, whereupon a certificate to the trustees in liquidation may be issued by
him.”


                                                         17
request a withdrawal. A borrowing member also no longer had to pay dues on the share account

that secured her loan, but the loan itself became immediately due in full. The loan was not in

default, however, and the borrower was required to continue to make payments of interest on it,

and still owed the principal. With all these contracts laid aside, the trustees were free to dispose

of the association’s assets and distribute the proceeds to members in shares proportional to their

contributions of equity into the association.

        A substantial body of case law developed over the years concerning the priority of

different classes of non-borrowing stockholders during the distribution of the liquidated assets.

Some members owned shares that had matured, others had filed notifications of withdrawal

before the voluntary liquidation was approved, and still others had purchased full paid stock

rather than through a share accumulation contract (Yale Law Journal, 1933, 935-40). The courts

generally recognized priorities or preferences that had been granted before the liquidation had

been approved or even anticipated, but once in liquidation shareholders were generally awarded

claims proportional to the equity they had paid into the association regardless of differences in

the maturity or types of shares they had held.

        An issue of greater concern here regards the treatment of borrowing members during a

voluntary liquidation. To confront the issue, courts had to clarify the status of the claims of

borrowing members given that they were both owners of and debtors to their associations. The

view held in the great majority of states, including New Jersey, was known as “the Pennsylvania

Rule,” named after the state where the key court decision was made. 20 Under the Pennsylvania

20
  A handful of states dealt with SAC borrower/members by the “Maryland rule.” Under this interpretation the dual
role of stockholder-mortgagor was treated as a fiction imposed by the technical aspects of the B&L contractual
structure. As a result, the borrowing member was fundamentally a debtor with a liability equal to the difference
between her outstanding straight mortgage loan and the balance in her share account. Under insolvency, therefore,
the borrower became responsible for a loan balance equal to the difference between her share account and the
original loan balance. This NET debt was calculated based on the book value of her shares and became due
immediately.



                                                       18
Rule the SAC borrower was both a bona fide member/owner of the B&L and a debtor to the

B&L. The rationale for this position was that the share account attached to the SAC member’s

loan earned the same profits and absorbed the same losses as the share accounts of non-

borrowing members. Thus, when a resolution for voluntary liquidation had been passed, the

borrowing member’s loan became immediately due in full, while the shares built up in the

associated sinking fund was held back until all of the B&L’s assets had been disposed of and a

liquidating dividend payment declared.

       Under the Pennsylvania Rule borrowing members in a distressed association had

incentives to delay liquidation until they could pay off their share accumulation loan contract as

originally written. If a borrowing member could finish paying off the loan prior to liquidation,

his shares were assessed at their book value and he avoided absorbing further losses suffered by

the association. After liquidation, the borrowing member still owed the principal of the loan but

the ultimate value of all his shares fell to the liquidation value of the B&L shares. As we

estimate below, the liquidation value of the shares were typically two-thirds of the book value at

best. 21 Thus, the borrowing member who still was repaying the loan at liquidation was stuck

with a sizeable loss. This loss also raised the probability that the borrower would have to default

on the loan and thus also lose his home, in which he typically held 40 to 50 percent equity during

this period.

        Given the divergent incentives of borrowing and nonborrowing members, it is likely that

their relative numbers influenced the decision to voluntarily liquidate.          More specifically,

21
  Rose (2014) examines in detail the operation of the curb market for B&L shares in New Jersey during
the 1930s and shows that it provided withdrawals at deep discounts for B&L members and offered
purchasers control over the foreclosed real estate owned by the association. In his examination of the
Milwaukee situation, Kendall (1962, 146) examines secondary market prices for nearly one hundred
Milwaukee B&Ls in 1936 and finds that B&L members sold shares at prices that ranged from $15 to $86
for each $100 “par” share. The average discount was 20 to 30 percent relative to their book values.


                                                 19
borrowing members could effectively block dissolution if they accounted for more than one-third

of the members in the vote. As seen in Table I, the mean share of SAC borrowers in New Jersey

B&Ls fell from 26.3 percent in 1934 to 16 percent in 1939. When we consider the one-third

focal point, the share of B&Ls in which SAC borrowers accounted for over one-third of the

membership fell from 26.6 percent in 1934 to 10.6 percent in 1939. Although one-third is the

focal point, SAC borrowers might still have been able to block dissolution with less than two-

thirds of the vote because they had more at stake in the vote than the nonborrowering member

and thus were more likely to attend meetings where votes were held. They may also have been

able to lobby nonborrowing members to delay the vote as well. In the estimation we have tried

several cutoff points as well as estimating the impact of the percentage of SAC borrowers on the

dissolution hazard.




   III. Examining the Impact of the Dissolution Voting Rule with New Jersey B&L Data

       To examine the impact of the two-thirds majority rule for dissolution, we have collected

and digitized a panel dataset with time-varying information on the features of the balance sheets

of all of the B&Ls operating in New Jersey in the 1930s. We chose New Jersey for several

reasons. First, it is the only state in which the state regulator consistently reported the number of

borrowing and nonborrowing members and balance sheet information for each B&L for each

year in the 1930s. Second, New Jersey had a large number of B&Ls spread throughout the cities

of the state. Third, few of the B&Ls in New Jersey converted to the Savings and Loan structure;

therefore, we can look specifically at voluntarily liquidations without facing the complications in

incentives created by the conversion to S&Ls and the attempts to shift borrowers into S&L

contracts.



                                                 20
       The information on individual B&Ls was collected, compiled, and digitized from the

Annual Reports of the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance in New Jersey for the years 1930

through 1940. The sources provide the name, location, and date of establishment for each

association that operated between 1930 and 1940, as well as comprehensive balance sheet

information for each year. It also identifies B&Ls who have exited each year and the type of exit.

       A total of 1,581 associations operated at some time during the decade in New Jersey, but

with wide variation in age and size. In 1930 there were 283 associations operating that had been

established before 1900, another 585 that had been placed in operation between 1900 and 1920,

and 693 that had been organized during the rapid expansion of the 1920s. Together these

account for the 1,561 B&Ls that were operating in the state in 1930. The size of these B&L’s

varied considerably, however, with more than 400 small associations holding total assets of less

than $250,000 while another 92 held more than $2 million. Membership numbers correlate

closely with total association size and vary from 240 small associations with fewer than 250

owner-members to the 297 that claimed more than 1,000 members.               All told, the average

association in New Jersey held assets of $633,000 in 1930 and claimed 528 members of which

123 were borrowers.

       The detailed balance sheet data provided in the annual reports provide a rich set of

measures of each association’s financial structure and strength that we use here as controls for

the probability of exit. Table I shows the means and standard deviations for these variables for

several years during the 1930s. In our regressions we control for the size of the association’s

total assets, and use the shares of total assets represented by key assets and liabilities to measure

their financial condition. The principal earning assets for a healthy B&L was mortgage loans

and these represented an average of 90 percent for operating associations in 1930. As the housing




                                                 21
crisis unfolded the average share of mortgages fell to low of only 50 percent in 1937 and then

recovered to 58 percent by the end of the decade. Offsetting increase in the shares of two other

assets trace the dynamics of the difficulties B&Ls faced during the crisis. Nonpayment of dues

on stock subscriptions and interest on loans were classified as arrearages, and the average share

of assets in this category increased from less than 1 percent in 1930 to 5 percent in the mid-1930s

before falling back to 2 percent in 1940. Increases in arrearages on loans and shares securing

loans were signs of problems and often were followed by loan foreclosures. Increased numbers

of foreclosures caused the average share of assets represented by real estate owned to increase

from 3 percent in 1930 to nearly 40 percent as late as 1939. The annual shares of mortgage

loans, arrearages and real estate owned for the B&Ls in our sample together give a rich and

dynamic picture of their basic profitability and solvency and we supplement that here with a

measure of their short-run liquidity—the share of assets held in cash.

       The liabilities reported in the annual reports characterize the structure of claims on each

B&L’s assets that were held by its member-owners. In 1930 most of the capital invested in New

Jersey B&Ls (84 percent on average) came through the traditional channel—dues paid on

installment shares and the profits on these shares that had been apportioned by the B&L and

accumulated in the members share account. As distress mounted, B&Ls built loss reserves and

sought greater liquidity by holding back on payments of dividends and retaining profits to serve

as loss reserves and to fund greater liquidity. These unapportioned profits -which legally

belonged to members- became a major liability, rising from one percent in 1930 to more than 20

percent by the end of the decade, as shown in Table III. Also by the end of the decade the more

modern form of investment that would become the standard liability in the postwar S&L—paid-

up shares—increased in importance as a share of liabilities.




                                                22
        The annual reports provide information in each year on the number of borrowing and

non-borrowing members in each B&L. The voting bloc of most interest here is borrowing

members, but more specifically borrowing members with traditional B&L share accumulation,

sinking-fund loans. One of the important changes in the transition from B&L to S&L was the

replacement of the traditional share accumulation loan (henceforth SAC) with the modern direct

reduction loan contract (DRC) in which monthly principal payments were used to immediately

reduce the outstanding loan balance. The impact of a voluntary liquidation on DRC borrowers,

and their likely voting positions, were fundamentally different because under liquidation the dues

payments the SAC borrower’s had made under the original contract in order to repay the loan

were held back and subject to the member’s share of association losses. So although the loans of

both SAC and DRC borrowers became due immediately upon liquidation, under the traditional

contract the borrower owed the original loan amount while the DRC owed only the remaining

principal.

        The New Jersey B&L reports are unusual because they report for each year not only the

number of borrowing and non-borrowing members, but also the breakdown of mortgage loans

into the volume of SAC and DRC loans. As a result, we could estimate the number of SAC and

DRC borrowing members in each B&L by multiplying the total number of borrowers by the

shares of the two loan types in total mortgage lending volume. 22 As can be seen in Table III, the

share of members who borrowed under a direct reduction mortgage contract, was very small in

New Jersey over this decade, accounting for less than 2.5 percent of members through 1938 and

then rising to 5.6 percent in 1939 as the dissolution of traditional B&Ls accelerated. The share


22
  The maintained assumption is that the size of SAC and DRC loans were on average the same. The categories of
loans reported in the annual report are “Mortgage Loans-With Pledged Shares” and “Mortgage Loans-Without
Pledged Shares”. The latter could include both DRC and straight loans—we refer to them all as DRC which clearly
become more important over the decade.


                                                      23
of members who had borrowed using SAC contracts was a much larger voting bloc, on the other

hand, and represented 23 percent of members in 1930 and 26 percent in 1934 before falling off

rapidly in the last few years of the decade.

       The New Jersey data, therefore, allow us to divide B&L membership each year into three

groups—SAC borrowers, DRC borrowers and non-borrowers. We treat all non-borrowers as a

single voting bloc here because non-borrowers were treated equally when associations became

frozen or liquidated whether they held installment, matured, or paid-up stock. The focus here is

on the share of SAC borrowers, however, and the requirement in New Jersey law that a voluntary

liquidation had to be approved by at least two-thirds of all members. In our main specification

we estimate the impact of SAC membership shares by creating a dummy variable for B&Ls in

which the share of SAC borrowers in that year accounted for more than or equal to one-third of

the voting members and thus could block liquidation. To allow for measurement error and the

possibility that borrowers were still able to block liquidation with a lower share, we add a second

dummy for settings when the share was greater than or equal to 25 percent and less than one-

third. As shown in Table III, SAC borrower voting blocs were sufficiently large to determine

voting outcomes in nearly 20 percent of B&Ls over the entire 1930s decade and just under that

size in another 20 percent.    We also estimate the impact on the hazard of the share of SAC

borrowers to allow comparisons of the size of the effects on dissolution of changes in the SAC

share and changes in features of the balance sheet.

       Not all of the New Jersey B&L closures were voluntary liquidations. Of the 568 closures

between 1934 and 1940, 351 were voluntary liquidations, 93 involved mergers, 31 were

reorganizations, 6 were conversions to Federal S&Ls and 87 were driven by state action. Most

of the reorganizations involved “bulk transfers” of assets in which the membership of an




                                                24
association segregates non-performing loans from good loans and places the good loans in a new

B&L in which each member was given a proportional share. The members, in essence, accepted

a write-down in the value of the shares in their original association so that the new “healthy”

B&L can begin to operate while the “bad loan association,” was liquidated (Ewalt 1962, 116-8).

The state actions included 21 liquidations and conservatorships run by the state regulator, likely

for fraud. The remaining 58 occurred in only two years—1937 and 1940—and are described in

the state reports as “the state taking possession.” Most B&Ls in this category continued to

operate for a year or two before ending operations, but the annual report provides no clear

information about how they were resolved.

       The empirical sections of the paper identify the determinants of voluntary liquidations as

the key to understanding the timing of B&L resolutions. By narrowing the focus to the period

1934 to 1940 our empirical analysis examines 992 B&Ls that survived and operated until at least

1940, 351 B&Ls that were voluntarily liquidated by their members between 1934 and 1940, and

170 B&Ls who exited through mergers, federal conversions, reorganizations or state actions.

The strategy we employ is to first examine the timing of voluntary liquidations by using the first

two groups and then investigate the robustness of the results by considering the impacts of the

other types of exits in a multinomial logit analysis. In Appendix Table A.1 we also show that the

basic qualitative results are unchanged when we treat mergers and reorganizations as voluntary

liquidations and when we treat estimate the model treating all the closures the same.



                              IV. The Empirical Hazard Model

       The empirical analysis focuses specifically on the 1934 to 1940 period during which

voluntary liquidations accelerated and before state government and federal regulators began to




                                                25
sponsor large numbers of resolutions. For our baseline analysis we restrict our sample to B&Ls

that either exited through voluntary liquidation or survived until the end of our five-year sample

period. 23 Using these data we estimate a Cox survival model in which the hazard of closure

through voluntary liquidation is:

         h(t) = h0(t) exp( β SACitc + δ1 Fitc+ δ2 Citc + δ3 Fi30c)

in which h(t) is the hazard of closure in time t, SACitc is a vector of dummy variables to capture

the impact of different ranges of the share of SAC borrowing members among all members. The

subscript i refers to the firm, t to the year, and c to the county where the firm is located. Our

primary focus is on β, the coefficient(s) on the measure(s) of the proportion of SAC borrowers. 24

         The most complete specification of the model includes a rich set of correlates to control

for omitted variable bias and potential selection bias. Fitc is a vector of time-varying firm

characteristics, including size (measured as log of total assets), the share of DRC

borrower/member and a series of variables describing the assets and liabilities.                          The asset

variables include the shares of assets in arrears (non-payments), real estate owned, and cash on

hand; the left out category is loans and miscellaneous assets. On the liability side we can also

control for the shares of liabilities in installment shares, paid up shares, and unapportioned

profits with apportioned profits and miscellaneous as the left-out category. 25



23
   See Section VIII for the multinomial logit analysis for the sample period in which all types of exits—mergers,
conversion to federal charters and reorganizations as well as voluntary liquidations—are modeled.
24
   Because the SAC borrower shares may have some measurement error, we have tried alternative measures of the
reliance on SAC loans. In one we used the SAC share of the value of loans, which focuses on the differences
between DRC borrowers and SAC borrowers but ignores the non-borrowing members. In a second, we used the
proportion of borrowing members of the total membership, which focuses on differences in attitudes between
borrowers and non-borrowers but ignores differences between DRC and SAC borrowing members. The results in
all settings suggest that greater reliance on SAC loans was associated with a lower probability that the B&L would
close.
25
   Although the shares of assets and liabilities measure different elements of the financial structure and health of
B&Ls, there are strong connections between the structure of liabilities and the structure of assets. To see the
robustness of results to multi-collinearity, we also estimated, but do not report, models with the variables describing
the structure of assets and liabilities alone.


                                                          26
             represents a vector of time varying measures of economic activity in the county

where the B&L was located. Retail sales per capita offers a measure of average consumption

and federal tax returns filed per capita controls for the top end of the income distribution. These

variables were drawn from data sets compiled by Fishback, et. al. (2011). We also developed a

variable for the value of Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) loans purchased per
                                                26
household across New Jersey counties.                The HOLC purchased mortgages from all types of

New Jersey lenders and refinanced them for roughly 8 percent of households. Approximately 80

percent of the purchases were made in 1934 and 20 percent occurred in 1935 and the shares

varied across counties. We controlled for the value of the HOLC loans purchased per household

in those years because somewhere between 33 and 50 percent of the HOLC funds removed

problematic mortgages from the B&Ls balance sheets. 27

        Finally, the hazard model structure will not allow us to control for time-invariant features

of the B&Ls with fixed or random effects. To control for a significant degree of the unmeasured

time-invariant heterogeneity across firms, we therefore include time-invariant controls for the

asset structure and size of the firms in 1930 and/or the liability structure in 1930 just before the

mortgage crisis started to develop.




26
   The HOLC reported the total distribution of loans and number of households that they made across each county in
New Jersey; 80.7 percent of the New Jersey loans were distributed in 1934, and 19.26 were distributed in 1935. See
Federal Home Loan Bank Board (1934, 86; 1935, 63; 1936, 164, 192-193) . We used these percentages to apportion
the loans for each county for 1934 and 1935.
27
   The HOLC bought troubled mortgages from lenders and then refinanced them for borrowers in 1933 and 1934.
This would have helped delay insolvency by removing a number of troubled mortgages from the B&Ls’ books. A
rough estimate is that the HOLC purchased about $50 million in mortgages from New Jersey B&Ls in 1934 and
1935, which was about 20 percent of the decline in B&L assets during that period. Through 1935 About 8 percent
of New Jersey nonfarm homes were mortgaged by the HOLC compared with 9.5 percent for the nation as a whole.
New Jersey ranked 36th on that percentage. 5.3 percent of HOLC loans. (Federal Home Loan Bank Board, 1935, p.
63, 1937, p. 164). The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) had relatively small impacts in New Jersey because
it, insured a relatively small share of mortgages in NJ before the early 1940s.


                                                       27
                                      V. Estimation Results

       In column 1 of Table II we model the hazard of exiting through voluntary liquidation as a

function only of the voting bloc size of the borrowing members of B&L associations. Dummies

are included here to identify B&Ls in which SAC borrowers were more than one-third of

members, for associations with SAC borrowers between one-quarter and one-third of members,

and with the actual share of DRC members. The negative and statistically significant coefficients

imply that the probability of closure declined for B&Ls with higher shares of SAC borrowers.

B&Ls with SAC shares greater or equal to one-third of voters were 75.7 percent less likely to

close than B&Ls with SAC shares below 25 percent. B&Ls with SAC shares between one-fourth

and one-third were 63.6 percent less likely to close.

       The estimated relationships above are unconditioned by the asset or liability structures of

the B&Ls. This likely means that there is omitted variable bias that overstates the ability of the

SAC loan holders to stop voluntary liquidations. B&Ls with higher shares of assets in real estate

owned due to foreclosure were more likely to be in trouble and thus be closed down. The

increases in real estate owned almost mechanically led to a reduction in the SAC loan holders as

a share of voters. This combination of a positive and a negative relationship would lead to an

omitted variable bias that would bias the unconditional estimates toward being more negative.

       Once we control for changes in the asset and liability structure of the B&Ls in

Specification 2 of Table II, the coefficients on the SAC borrower share of borrowers become

substantially less negative. This is consistent with the anticipated negative omitted variable bias

in the unconditional estimates.




                                                 28
        To reduce potential problems with endogeneity, we add additional controls for the

structure of the assets and liabilities of B&Ls in 1930 before the crisis. These controls act

somewhat like fixed effects because they control for the asset and liability structures of each

B&L in good times just before the crisis hit. We also add measures of contemporary economic

activity in the county. When the additional factors are included in the analysis, the coefficients

in column 3 of Table II become less negative but remain statistically significant for B&Ls with a

SAC share of voters greater than or equal to the one-third needed to block liquidation. The

coefficients imply that B&Ls with SAC shares above one-third were 50.2 percent less likely to

go into voluntary liquidation than ones with SAC shares below 25 percent. B&Ls with SAC

shares of less than one-third and greater than or equal to one-fourth were 24 percent less likely to

close than those with less than a one-fourth share, but the relationship is statistically

insignificant.



                 VI. Magnitude and Robustness of the SAC Borrower Vote Effect

        One way to show the impact of the SAC share is to see how the baseline probability of

liquidation for the sample changes when all B&Ls had SAC mortgage shares of ownership

greater than one-third.    To obtain the mean predicted baseline probabilities, we started by

predicting for each observation the probability of liquidation in a year using the baseline

probability estimated in the model, the coefficients from specification 3 in Table II and the actual

values of each of the correlates. We then calculate the mean for those probabilities. The mean

baseline probability of failing in a particular year is 16.0 percent for the entire sample covering

1934 through 1940. When all firms are given a SAC share above one-third while leaving the rest

of the correlate values the same for each observation, the predicted probability falls by -7.6




                                                29
percentage points from 16.0 to 8.4 percent. Our measure of membership shares has measurement

error and voting blocks of SAC mortgage holders might have been able to capture swing voters,

so we also have tried giving all firms SAC shares between one-fourth and one-third, and the

probability of liquidation would have been 4.2 percentage points lower.

        Another way to measure the impact of the SAC Borrower’s Share of Assets is to compare

the change in the number of voluntary liquidations associated with different assumptions about

the shares. Table III shows that the actual number of voluntary liquidations in the 1930s was

351, with only 11 liquidations before 1936. The number of liquidations rose to a peak of 149 in

1939.   After calculating the predicted probability of liquidations using the coefficients in

specification 4 in Table II in conjunction with the values of the correlates and baseline

probabilities for each observation, we found that there would have been the same number of 351

liquidations if we assumed that each firm liquidated when its predicted probability reached 83

percent or more. The frequency distribution of the predicted probabilities using the 83 percent

figure was more backloaded than the actual distribution with no predicted liquidations before

1936, a higher peak at 184 in 1939 and most of the rest of the liquidations in 1940.

        If all firms had had SAC Borrower Shares greater than one-third, the number of predicted

liquidations would have been cut sharply and the peak delayed.          Table III shows that the

predicted number of liquidations would have been 98 rather than 351 and the peak was moved to

1940 rather than 1939. Had the SAC shares all been between one-third and one-fourth, the

predicted number of liquidations would have been 230, roughly two-thirds of the actual number

liquidations and also been more delayed. Had all firms had SAC shares been below one-fourth,

there would have been 23 more liquidations than actually occurred with a frequency distribution

that looked more like the predicted probabilities based on the actual shares. Thus, holding every




                                                30
other factor at its actual value, the SAC borrower share of owners would have had powerful

impact on the likelihood of closure.

       For the rest of the variables, which are all continuous, we show the average effect of a

one-standard deviation change in that correlate while not changing any of the other correlates for

each observation in Table II. We also show the effects of a change equivalent to the change in

the mean of the variable between 1934 and 1939. The standard deviations for the sample and the

mean values for 1934 and 1939 are shown in Table I. Because the SAC mortgage membership

share variables are dummy variables, the changes above when we assign all observations to have

SAC shares above one-third are not really comparable to one-standard deviation changes for

continuous variables.

       To allow comparisons of the magnitude of the impact of the SAC borrower share to the

impact of other factors, we have re-estimated the model with the share of members with SAC

mortgages, which is continuous, as the dependent variable. The coefficients of the SAC share

continuous variable in Table II are statistically significant and negative in specifications 4, 5, and

6 in Table II. The effect of a one-standard deviation increase of 0.129 in the SAC share leads to

the reduction in the predicted liquidation probability of 5.6 percentage points from 16 to 10.4

percent. Between 1934 and 1939 the mean SAC share fell by 10.3 percentage points from 26.3

to 16 percent. Such a decline would have been associated with a rise in the predicted liquidation

probability of 5.6 percentage points from 16 to 21.6 percent.

       There are only three other factors in Table II that have larger or comparable impact on

such a 5.6 percentage point rise in dissolution hazard and these are key features of the asset

structure that illustrate the dissolution process. Between 1934 and 1939 the average size of B&Ls

fell sharply by more than 38 percent (Table I), and the drop increased the probability of




                                                 31
liquidation by 4.2 percentage points in Table II. The first sign of trouble came as the share of

arrears increased, showing the impact of delinquencies in the payment on the loans. Between

1934 and 1939 the arrears share of assets actually fell from 5.1 to 2.6 percent in Table III, which

would have lowered the probability of liquidation by -2.2 percentage points (Table II) from 16.0

to 13.8 percent. Unfortunately, they were replaced by increases in real estate ownership as the

B&L foreclosed on the mortgages that were in arrears. Between 1934 and 1939 the share of

assets in real estate owned rose from 21.5 to 37.6 percent of assets (Table I), implying a 14.3

percentage point increase in the probability of liquidation in Table II. 28

         In the estimates in Table II the sample is confined to firms that either voluntary liquidated

or stayed open to focus on the decision where the SAC Mortgage share of members would have

the most impact. To evaluate the SAC borrower effect in a model that allowed for all types of

exits, we also estimate a multinomial logit model with results shown in Table IV that includes all

B&Ls and examines the probability of all categories of liquidations: voluntary liquidations,

acquisitions and mergers, state interventions, and other. The qualitative results are the same for

the voluntary liquidations for the SAC share variables. The SAC shares were also negatively

related to lower probabilities of the other types of closures, but the only coefficient that is

statistically significant for the other types of closures is for the SAC share greater than one-third

for acquisitions and mergers. As for other variables, the presence of more high-income federal


         28
            The nonlinear nature of the exponential function underlying the Cox hazard model leads to differences in
the magnitudes of changes in the probability of liquidation associated with changes in correlates at different points
in the distribution. In the text, the comparisons are based on the average of the marginal differences associated with
a change for each observation. An alternative method is to calculate the marginal effect when the predicted
probability is evaluated at a point associated with the means for all of the correlates. This method also tells the
same qualitative story as in the text. The predicted probability at of liquidation evaluated at the means is 5.1
percent. A one-standard deviation increase in the dummy for a SAC member share over one-third is associated
with a -1.2 drop in the liquidation probability. The only larger effects of a one-standard deviation rise are for the
real estate share of assets at 5.3, the size of the B&L at -2.1 and the arrears share of assets at 1.7. The OSD effect
for installment dues was the same size at -1.2.



                                                         32
taxpayers reduced the probability of voluntary liquidation in this estimation. The HOLC

purchase and refinance program had a strong negative relationship with other types of

liquidations.

VII. Gains from Borrowing Members and Losses to NonBorrowing Members from Delay

       The delay created by the voting rules offered gains to a significant set of borrowers but at

the expense of losses for the other members of the B&L. Thus, there was a redistributive feature

to the delay in voting rules. The next issue to address is the size of these actual gains and losses.

If the gains offset the losses, the liquidation voting rules were purely redistributive between

parties within the same B&L. If the losses were larger than the gains, it is useful to know the full

cost if a policy maker were to choose to design a similar structure to provide borrowers with

more say in the liquidation process. We use the data from the balance sheets of the last few years

in operation of the 351 New Jersey B&Ls that voluntarily liquidated between 1934 and 1940 to

develop estimates of these gains and losses. The distributions of actual and predicted liquidations

in columns 1 and 2 of Table III imply that the two-thirds voting rule delayed liquidation by an

average of about one year. Therefore, we focus on the gains and losses to the parties in the B&L

from delaying by one year.

       Two groups of borrowing members received gains from delaying liquidation by a year.

During the delay one group of borrowing members was able to use their shares at book value to

repay their loans and own their home free and clear before liquidation. Many of these borrowers

had taken out their loans in the mid-1920s and were nearing the end of their repayment process.

By avoiding the liquidation, they avoided losing the difference between the book value and the

liquidation value of their shares had they been stuck in liquidation. We estimate that the typical

loan principal was $6,485, which is 60 percent of the average New Jersey nonfarm house value




                                                 33
of $10,808 in 1930.       All dollar figures in this section are denominated in 1967 dollars. After

repaying the loan, the book value of the shares would have been $6485. Had these borrowers

been forced to go through the liquidation, their shares would have fallen in value by 34.5

percent, so they each avoided an average loss of $2,238 on their shares, as shown in Table V.

We estimate that the number of SAC borrowers who paid off their loan during the year delay

was 2,598, roughly 25 percent of the borrowers at the start of the year. 29 Thus, the total gain for

this group was 2,598*$2,223=$5.8 million in Table V.

        A second group who gained from the delay were the borrowing members who likely

would have been foreclosed upon had the liquidation occurred earlier. Early liquidation would

have caused the loan to come due. Even though the courts typically tried to set repayment

structures to minimize foreclosures, this second group would have been unable to repay the loan

once they knew that the values of their shares would drop to liquidation value. They typically

lost the full value of the home because the foreclosure process typically did not return enough to

fully pay off the original debt because home values in New Jersey had dropped by 40 to 50

percent in nominal terms.        As the estimate of the home value lost, we interpolated between

census years and obtained an average value of a New Jersey home of $7854 for the late 1930s.

Our best estimate is that the foreclosure rate rose by 10 percent for borrowers in liquidation

because of the drop in the value of their shares. By delaying liquidation for a year, the number

of SAC borrowers fell from 10,529 to 7,642. By delaying liquidation a year, the number of

foreclosures due to liquidation would have fallen from 1,053 to 764, a reduction of 289

foreclosures in Table V. Thus, the gain to the borrowers who were saved from foreclosure was

289*$7,854=$5.357 million.

29
 The estimate of the number of SAC borrowers who repaid their loan was based on 90 percent of the change in
SAC borrowers over the course of the year. We assumed that 10 percent of the mortgage borrowers would have
been foreclosed during the year.


                                                      34
       A third group of borrowers lost from the delay. This group is composed of borrowers

who actually would have gained from further delay because they got stuck in the liquidation but

still fully paid their loan. During the liquidation under the Pennsylvania rule, the courts typically

valued their shares at book value in the repayment. However, in the final liquidation settlement

they were among the owners of the repaid shares, which had dropped to the liquidation value,

which declined each year in these troubled B&Ls. We calculated the liquidation value of assets

by adding together the cash, investments held, 95 percent of the SAC mortgages, 99 percent of

the direct reduction mortgages, the share loans, 50 percent of the real estate owned and the value

of other assets. This assumes that the loss on foreclosures was 50 percent of the value of the real

estate obtained, 10 percent of the SAC mortgages were foreclosed and 2 percent of the direct

reduction mortgages were foreclosed (with a loss of 50 percent on each those loans). To get the

liquidation value per member, we divided the liquidation value by the sum of the number of

nonborrowing members and the number of SAC borrowers.            The average liquidation value per

member on average fell by $305 from $2,585 to $2,281 with the year’s delay. The members also

lost the opportunity to earn a real return of 1 percent on the $2585 liquidation value from the

earlier year, which comes to $26 in Table V.      For the 7,642 SAC borrowers who would have

paid off their loan after liquidation the losses in Table V were a -$2.3 million drop in liquidation

value and -$0.199 million in lost interest.

       Like this third group of borrowers who repaid after liquidation, the nonborrowing

members lost in two ways from the delay. The liquidation value of each share typically fell in

value as liquidation was delayed and they lost the return they would have received from

investing the liquidation value from the prior year in an alternative investment.       There were




                                                 35
66,182 nonborrowing members who would have been involved in liquidations and their losses

totaled -$20.2 million in lost value of shares and -$1.7 million in lost interest.

       The one-year delay led to a gain of $8.1 million for the borrowers who paid off their

mortgages during the delay and the borrowers who were able to avoid foreclosures because of

the delay. Their gain came at the expense of the SAC borrowers and nonborrowers in the lower

part of Table V who lost a total of -$24.4 million.

       The key question is how to put this net loss in context. The size of the net loss relative to

New Jersey’s aggregate income in 1938 was 0.27 percent of New Jersey’s aggregate income in

1938, but that is spreading the loss over the entire population. Say we focus instead only on the

members of the B&Ls that liquidated. The sense of trouble generally began about four years

before the actual liquidation. The borrowers who benefitted from the year delay received a gain

of about 2.2 percent of the book value of the B&L’s assets four year’s earlier, while the losing

members experience a loss equal to about 6.8 percent of that book value. The net loss from the

year’s delay was thus 4.6 percent of the earlier book value.

       There is a problem in focusing on just the building and loans that liquidated because it

focuses on the ex post outcome for the building and loans that were in the worst shape. The

B&Ls’ contracts and voting rules were established long before the signs of trouble developed

and we should expect that both borrowing and nonborrowing members anticipated that the

voting rules favored borrowers in times of trouble. In this ex ante sense the best comparison of

the gains and losses from the year delay is to the value of all New Jersey B&L assets before the

series of voluntary liquidations began around 1934. The book value of assets for all B&Ls was

$2.4 billion in 1934. Thus, the members of the troubled B&Ls who benefitted from the delay




                                                  36
gained about 0.33 percent of the ex ante B&L total assets. The losing members lost about 1

percent of the B&L total assets, for a net loss overall of -0.68 percent of the assets. 30                31



         If a policy maker were to design a similar mortgage contract and equity structure for the

lending institution that favored borrowers in times of trouble, would the size of these losses

prevent the other nonborrowing members from investing ex ante?                              Probably not if they

succeeded in demanding a risk premium in the dividends. In fact, over a long time period, the

dividend rates paid out on B&L shares were typically well above the returns for most similar size

investments; part of this difference likely served as a risk premium for the rules favoring the

borrowers. Also note that a risk premium incorporates the anticipated probability of negative

events. B&Ls had performed relatively well in prior recessions and the Great Depression and the

worst mortgage crisis in the 20th century had to be considered relatively low probability events in

any risk premium calculations.



                                                VIII. Conclusions

         During the heart of the mortgage crisis of the Great Depression, the institutional structure

of the B&L gave borrowers more power over the dissolution process and mitigated the

foreclosure crisis. The mutual structure of the B&L included SAC borrowers as owners of the


30
   The figures in Table V refer only to B&Ls that voluntarily liquidated because the focus is on the voting rule. It is
possible that the voting rule delayed the other forms of exit that occurred by up to a year, as well. If the analysis
expands to include all B&L who dissolved and assume that the voting rule delayed liquidation by a year for all of
the firms, then the SAC borrowing members who benefitted from the delay received a benefit of 0.89 percent of the
1934 book value of all New Jersey B&L assets the losing members lost -1.26 percent and the overall net loss was -
0.37 percent. The net loss is smaller because a large share the alternative forms of exit involved acquisitions and
mergers of B&Ls who were in better shape than the ones that voluntarily liquidated.
31
   The building and loans that voluntarily liquidated could already see problems three or four years before they
closed, as the share of assets in real estate had risen to 39 percent by that time and continued to rise to 55.5 percent
in the year before liquidation. If the overall structure of the B&Ls contributed to as much as a three-year delay in
dissolution, 55 percent of the SAC borrowers were able to pay off their mortgage before liquidation and another 6
percent likely avoided foreclosure. The gains to these groups from a three-year delay would have come to around
1.1 percent of the book value of New Jersey B&L assets and the loss to other members about 1.6 percent with an
overall net loss of -0.5 percent.


                                                          37
organization. B&Ls were not depository institutions and the history of legal rulings about

closure made it extremely difficult to close a troubled B&L without a voluntary decision by the

members. The one-owner-one-vote structure and the two-thirds majority required for dissolution

gave SAC borrowing members significant power to delay closure long enough for thousands of

borrowers to pay off their mortgage and avoid facing a sharp drop in the value of their shares as

well as an increased likelihood of defaulting during the liquidation.

       After developing a new panel data set of all of the B&Ls in New Jersey during the 1930s,

we estimate that the voting rules delayed the closure of troubled B&Ls through voluntarily

liquidation by an average of about a year. The actual gain to SAC borrowers who repaid before

the dissolution because of the delay came to about 0.33 percent of the book value of assets of

New Jersey B&Ls in 1934. This gain came at the expense of a loss of about 1 percent of the

book value for the remaining members who saw the liquidation value of their assets drop and lost

the returns they could have earned from shifting their assets to another investment. From the ex

ante perspective of an investor before the crisis the losses from delay would seem to have been

reasonable given that the dividend rates paid by B&Ls had long been higher than for other small

investments, partly as a risk premium, and that the mortgage crisis and the Great Depression of

the 1930s were the most severe crises in American history.

       The favorable status of borrowers in the B&Ls compared to their treatment in modern

borrowing institutions likely extended beyond the delay in liquidation that is the focus here.

B&Ls tended to be smaller institutions, where information on not easily measured aspects of the

borrowers’ character and likelihood of repayment was available to the managers and other

members of the B&L. The B&L that first made the loan also typically serviced the loan.




                                                38
Further, the borrowers’ ownership status likely gave them some influence to other members in

foreclosure decisions.

       Cooperative lending organizations that resemble the B&L still remain a feature of the

U.S. economy, but they tend to account for a much diminished share of the mortgage market.

There are several reasons, including competition from new types of longer-term amortized loans

and shifts in government policy. These changes are best illustrated by the shift to S&Ls, who

ultimately faced their own demise for similar reasons.

       Despite the forbearance for borrowers built into the B&L, the B&L model was largely

replaced within 20 years by the Savings and Loan model, which offered accounts that were more

like deposits and offered direct reduction loans in place of SAC loans. When the ownership

stakes and greater forbearance on SAC loans was leavened by lengthening repayment periods as

dividends fell, most new borrowers in the 1930s chose the direct reduction mortgage loans,

which were amortized over 10 to 15 years with fixed lengths and retired principal with each

payment. In fact, most surviving B&Ls started to offer direct reduction loans in the early 1930s

(Rose and Snowden 2014). Direct reduction mortgages gained even more popularity when the

Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation chose them as

their standard in the mid-1930s, and their position was solidified when Fannie Mae created a

secondary market for such “conventional” loans in the late 1930s. The FHA and later the VA

guarantees of the conventional direct reduction loans for lenders allowed them to offer more

competitive interest rates to borrowers than the B&Ls. B&Ls faced further disadvantages when

the loan-to-value (LTV) ratios required for conventional loans rose to 80 percent and more

recently above 90 percent. Such ratios were difficult for B&Ls to sustain because a key feature




                                               39
that kept B&L borrowers prior to World War II from defaulting was their own 40 percent equity

position in their home.

       Meanwhile, the nonborrowers providing the funds sought to avoid the limitations on

withdrawals imposed by the struggling B&Ls and chose S&L accounts where they had more

immediate access to withdrawals. The shift to the S&L model was stimulated by the creation of

federal charters for S&Ls in 1934 and the insurance of S&L accounts with the creation of the

FSLIC in 1935. The S&Ls later faced their own competitive demise as the deregulation of the

financial industry in the late 1970s eliminated their interest rate advantages on deposits and

commercial banks and specialized lenders expanded their lending. Over the past two to three

decades Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae joined private entities in packaging up mortgages into

mortgage backed securities, which were often combined into collateralized debt obligations. All

of these changes, involving both choices by market participants between competitive loan

products and shifts in government policy that gave advantages to some types of lending, broke

the connection between the original lender and the home borrower that helped mitigate the

foreclosure problems during the mortgage crisis of the 1930s.

Notes. The sample is confined to B&Ls that stayed open or voluntarily liquidated. There are 9,426 observations across time and B&L. The
predicted probability of voluntary liquidation was calculated by adding either the one-standard deviation to the factor in the row (7), or the change
in the factor between 1934 and 1939 (8), to every observation while hold all other factors at the actual value for the observation and then averaging
the predicted probabilities across all observations. The information on standard deviations and the change from 1934 to 1939 is in Table I. *p <

Notes. Probabilities of Voluntary Liquidations are based on coefficients from specification 3 in Table II
and the baseline hazards and values for each observation. When the predicted probability reached 83
percent or higher in the predictions, we assumed the firm liquidated. The number of liquidations differ
from the number in Table II in part due to missing values.
