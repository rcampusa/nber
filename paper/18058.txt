                                              ABSTRACT

Motivated by the recent experience of the U.S. and the Eurozone, we describe the quantitative properties
of a New Keynesian model with a zero lower bound (ZLB) on nominal interest rates, explicitly accounting
for the nonlinearities that the bound brings. Besides showing how such a model can be efficiently computed,
we find that the behavior of the economy is substantially affected by the presence of the ZLB. In particular,
we document 1) the unconditional and conditional probabilities of hitting the ZLB; 2) the unconditional
and conditional probabilty distributions of the duration of a spell at the ZLB; 3) the responses of output
to government expenditure shocks at the ZLB, 4) the distribution of shocks that send the economy
to the ZLB; and 5) the distribution of shocks that keep the economy at the ZLB.

1. Introduction

How does the economy behave when it faces the zero lower bound (ZLB) on the nominal
interest rate? To answer this basic question in macroeconomics, we build a New Keynesian
model with the ZLB and solve it nonlinearly using a projection method and rational expec-
tations. Besides showing how the model can be e¢ ciently computed, this paper documents
1) the unconditional and conditional probabilities of hitting the ZLB; 2) the unconditional
and conditional probability distributions of the duration of a spell at the ZLB; 3) the dis-
tributions of shocks that send the economy to the ZLB and the ones that keep it there; 4)
the responses of output to government expenditure shocks at the ZLB; and 5) the impulse
response functions of the economy at and away from the ZLB.
       Our investigation is motivated by the recent U.S. and Eurozone experience of (nearly)
zero short-term nominal interest rates after 2008. This experience has rekindled the interest
in understanding the theoretical and quantitative e¤ects of the ZLB in dynamic stochastic
general equilibrium (DSGE) models. These e¤ects are consequential for the conduct of policy
as illustrated, for instance, by Eggertsson and Woodford (2003)— for monetary policy— and
Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Rebelo (2011)— for …scal policy.
       However, the quantitative analysis of the ZLB is complicated by the essential nonlinearity
that it generates. Along the equilibrium path of the model, the nominal interest rate is a
function of the states of the economy and government policy. Since, in the typical model, the
nominal interest rate will be zero for some states of the economy and government policies but
not for others, the function that determines interest rates must be nonlinear. This nonlinearity
is an obstacle both for traditional linearizations techniques and for the increasingly popular
higher-order perturbations. These methods, by construction, cannot handle the ZLB in a
model with rational expectations.
       The literature has tried to get around this problem using di¤erent approaches. We high-
light three of the most in‡uential. Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) log-linearize the equi-
librium relations except for the ZLB constraint, which is retained in its exact form. They
then solve the corresponding system of linear expectational di¤erence equations with the lin-
ear inequality constraint. To obtain numerical results, Eggertsson and Woodford assume a
2-state Markov chain with an absorbing state for an exogenous disturbance that drives the
dynamics of the model.1 Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Rebelo (2011) linearize the two models
they use: a simple model without capital and a model with capital. In the …rst model, they
assume that there is a 2-state Markov chain with an absorbing state for the discount factor.

   1
    Eggertsson and Woodford also derive analytical results, such an optimal monetary policy, for more general
disturbance processes.


                                                     3
The economy starts with a high discount factor that sends the nominal interest rate to zero
and, in every period, there is a probability that the discount factor will move to its long run
value and never change again. In the model with capital, the path for the discount factor
(and hence, for the economy, conditional on some …scal policy) is deterministic. Braun and
Körber (2010) employ a variant of extended shooting, which solves the model forward for an
exogenously …xed number of periods (after which the economy reverts to the steady state)
given some initial conditions and assuming that in these periods, shocks are set to zero.
   Although a big step toward understanding the ZLB, the existing solutions have made sim-
plifying assumptions that may have unexpected implications. First, linearizing equilibrium
conditions such as the Euler equations may hide some nonlinear interactions between the
ZLB and the policy functions of the agents. Second, linear approximations provide a poor
description of the economy during deep recessions such as the 2007-2009 one. Hence, our
approach is a step forward to analyze the role of policy during contractions a- icted by the
ZLB. Third, dynamics driven by exogenous variables that follow 2-state Markov chains with
absorbing states or have deterministic paths imply the durations of spells at the ZLB have
very simple expectations and variances. When we solve the model nonlinearly, however, these
expectations and variances change substantially over time. This is key because the shape of
the distribution of future events and the uncertainty it implies have material consequences
for quantities important to policy analysis such as the size of the …scal multiplier.
   We address these nonlinear interactions and the time-varying distributions of future events
by computing a fully nonlinear New Keynesian model with a ZLB and rational expectations.
We incorporate monetary and …scal policy and a set of shocks that push the model into the
ZLB. In that way, the agents in the model have the right expectations about the probability
of hitting the ZLB. To solve the model, we approximate the equilibrium functions of con-
sumption, in‡ation, and one auxiliary variable that controls the pricing decision of …rms as
a nonlinear function of the states. More concretely, we employ Chebyshev polynomials as a
basis for the projection of these endogenous variables on the states of the model. Since we are
working in a high-dimensional space, the coe¢ cients are solved for with the Smolyak colloca-
tion method laid out in Krueger, Kubler, and Malin (2011). This method signi…cantly reduces
the burden of the curse of dimensionality. However, to maintain tractability and provide eas-
ier insight, we will specify a relatively simple model with only …ve state variables. Once we
have the nonlinear functions for consumption, in‡ation, and the one auxiliary variable, we
exploit the rest of the equilibrium conditions of the model to solve for all other variables
of interest. In particular, we …nd the nominal interest rate from the exact Taylor rule with
a ZLB with its kink at zero holding exactly. This feature of our solution method is crucial
because it allows us to circumvent the di¢ culty in directly approximating a non-di¤erentiable


                                               4
function. Next, we simulate the model to calculate its moments, asking questions such as
what is the e¤ect of …scal policy when the economy is at the ZLB. Our research …nds inspira-
tion in Wolman (1998), who solved a simpler sticky prices model using …nite elements. The
main di¤erence is that our model considers a larger set of shocks and it is closer to the ones
that have been taken successfully to the data and employed in applied policy analysis. Thus,
we can o¤er quantitative assessments of issues such as the size of …scal multipliers, which are
at the heart of the current policy discussion.2
       Our main …ndings are:

   1. The dynamics of the economy near or at the ZLB are poorly approximated by a linear
         solution.

   2. The economy spends 5.53 percent of the time at the ZLB (one of each 18 quarters),
         and the average duration of a spell at the ZLB is 2.06 quarters with a variance of 3.33.
         In our simulation, the duration of spells at the ZLB may last up to one decade.

   3. The expected duration and the variance of the number of additional periods at the ZLB
         is time-varying. Furthermore, the number of expected periods and its variance grows
         with the number of periods already spent at the ZLB. This has been a point overlooked
         in the past, but it is important for the assessment of …scal policy.

   4. Positive shocks to the discount factor or to productivity raise the probability of the
         economy hitting the ZLB. Shocks on monetary or …scal policy have little e¤ect on this
         probability. While most previous literature has focused on shocks to the discount factor,
         we highlight the importance of positive shocks to productivity as a force pushing the
         economy to the ZLB.

   5. The ZLB is associated with output, consumption, and in‡ation below their steady-state
         values; although, given the rich stochastic structure of the model, it is not always the
         case. In our simulation, we observe quarters with positive in‡ation, while the ZLB
         binds.

   6. When the economy is hit by a discount factor shock that sends it to the ZLB for an
         average of 4 quarters, the multiplier of government expenditure at impact is around 3
         times larger than when the economy is outside the bound.
   2
    After the …rst draft of this paper was completed, we became aware of two recent attempts at solving a New
Keynesian model with ZLB nonlinearly. Judd, Maliar, and Maliar (2011) use a cluster-grid algorithm that
shares some similarities with our solution method. However, the main thrust of the paper is computational,
and they solve only the New Keynesian model as a brief illustration of their method, without a complete
analysis of its numerical properties. Tanaka (2012) uses a variation of the time iteration algorithm proposed
by Coleman (1991), but he has only one state variable and focuses only on some aspects of the model.

                                                     5
  7. Since the model is nonlinear, we need to distinguish between the marginal multiplier (the
     response of the economy to an in…nitesimal innovation in government expenditure) and
     the average multiplier (the response of the economy to an innovation in government
     expenditure of size x; see, for the same distinction, Erceg and Lindé (2010)). The
     marginal multiplier is substantially larger than the average one.

  8. When the economy is hit by a shock that sends it to the ZLB for an average of 2
     quarters, the multiplier is only around twice as large as when the economy is outside
     the bound. Further, the multiplier is close to 1.

  9. Increases on the variance of the additional number of periods at the ZLB lower the
     …scal multiplier.

   The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we present a baseline New
Keynesian model and we calibrate it to the U.S. economy. In section 3, we show how we
compute the model nonlinearly. In section 4, we compare the solution that we obtain with
the resulting one from a linearization. Section 5 presents our quantitative …ndings and section
6 concludes. A technical appendix o¤ers some further details on the solution of the model.


2. The Model

Our investigation is built around a baseline New Keynesian model, which has often been
used to frame the discussion of the e¤ects of the ZLB. The structure of the economy is as
follows. A representative household consumes, saves, and supplies labor. The …nal output is
assembled by a …nal good producer who uses as inputs a continuum of intermediate goods
manufactured by monopolistic competitors. The intermediate good producers rent labor from
the household. Also, these intermediate good producers can only change prices following
Calvo’s rule. Finally, there is a government that …xes the one-period nominal interest rate,
sets taxes, and consumes. We have four shocks: one to the time discount factor, one to
technology, one to monetary policy, and one to …scal policy.

2.4. The government

The government sets the nominal interest rates according to Rt = max [Zt ; 1] where
                                                                   "                                       #1   r

                                   Zt = R         r   Rt   r
                                                               1                                                    mt :

                                                                             8
The variable          represents the steady-state target level of in‡ation and R is the steady-state
nominal gross return of bonds (equal to                                divided by ). The term mt is a random shock to
monetary policy that follows mt = exp (                            m "m;t )      with "m;t distributed according to N (0; 1).
       This policy rule is the maximum of two terms. The …rst term, Zt , follows a conventional
Taylor rule that depends on the lagged interest rate, the deviation of in‡ation with respect
to its target, and the output gap (R1                          r    appears on the right-hand side because we move
R from the left-hand side of the equation). The second term is the ZLB: the gross nominal
interest rate cannot be lower than 1.
       Beyond the open market operations, the lump-sum transfers also …nance a stream of
government expenditures gt with

                                                             gt = sg;t yt and
                                       1    g
                             sg;t =   sg        sg;tg   1   exp ( g "g;t ) where "g;t                       N (0; 1):                     (2)

Because of Ricardian irrelevance, the timing of these transfers is irrelevant, so we set bt = 0
period by period. The evolution of gt is expressed in terms of its share of output, sg;t .3

    While it could happen that sg;t > 1, our calibration of sg and g is such that this will happen with a
negligible probability, so we can ignore this possibility (which never occurs in our simulations).

appendix for details.

2.7. Calibration

We calibrate the model to standard choices in the literature. We start with the preferences
parameters. We set       = 0:994 to match a real interest rate at the steady state of roughly
2.5 percent on an annual basis, # = 1 to deliver a Frisch elasticity of 1 (in the range of the
numbers reported when we consider both the intensive and the extensive margin of labor
supply), and      = 1; a normalization of the hours worked that is nearly irrelevant for our
results. As it is common in the New Keynesian literature, we set the Calvo parameter
  = 0:75, which implies an average duration of the price of 4 quarters, and the elasticity
of substitution among good varieties to " = 6, which implies a steady-state markup of 20
percent (Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans, 2005, and Eichenbaum and Fisher, 2007).
   The parameters in the Taylor rule are conventional:                                        = 1:5,    y   = 0:25,     = 1:005,
and, to save on the dimensionality of the problem,                              r   = 0 (this is also the case in Christiano,
Eichenbaum, and Rebelo, 2011). Then:

                                                    R
                                Rt = max                                    t    yt y mt ; 1 :
                                                     y          y



For …scal policy, sg = 0:2 so that government expenditures in steady state account for 20
percent of output, which is close to the average of government consumption in the U.S.
   We set, for the discount factor,   b   = 0:8 and                 b       = 0:0025. Thus, the preference shock has a
half-life of roughly 3 quarters and an unconditional standard deviation of 0:42 percent. With
these values, our economy hits the ZLB with a frequency consistent with values previously
reported (see section 5 below for details). For the technology process, we set A = 1,                                    a   = 0:9;
and   a   = 0:0025. These numbers are lower than those used in Cooley and Prescott (1995)
to re‡ect the lower volatility of productivity in the last two decades. The volatility of the

monetary shock is set to       m   = 0:0025, which is in the range of values reported in Guerrón-
Quintana (2010). Finally, for the government expenditure shock, we have somewhat smaller
values than Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Rebelo (2011) by setting                          g   = 0:8 and   g   = 0:0025.
This last value is half of that estimated in Justiniano and Primiceri (2008). We pick those
numbers to avoid numerical problems associated with very persistent …scal shocks when we
hit the economy with a large …scal expansion. Since we will document that …scal shocks
are less important than preference shocks in sending the economy to the ZLB, this lower
persistence is not terribly important.


3. Solution of the Model

Given the previous calibration, our model has …ve state variables: price dispersion, vt 1 ;
the time-varying discount factor,           t;   productivity, At ; the monetary shock, mt ; and the
government expenditure share, sg;t . Then, we de…ne the vector of state variables:

                      St = (S1;t ; S2;t ; S3;t ; S4;t ; S5;t ) = (vt 1 ;   t ; At ; mt ; sg;t ) :


Note that we have one endogenous state variable and four exogenous ones. For convenience,
we also de…ne the vector evaluated at the steady state as Sss = (v; ; 1; 1; sg ) :
   Solving nonlinear models with …ve state variables that are not Pareto e¢ cient is challeng-
ing. For instance, it is computationally expensive to apply value function iteration techniques
or any projection method using the tensor product of one-dimensional polynomials. Instead,
we use a projection method— Smolyak’s algorithm— in which the number of grid points and
the associated number of terms of the approximating polynomial do not grow exponentially
in the dimensionality of the problem. This projection method judiciously chooses grid points
and polynomials so that their number coincide and so that the function to be approximated is
interpolated at the grid points. Although the algorithm is described in detail in the appendix,
its basic structure is as follows.
   Let the equilibrium functions for ct ,              t,   and x1;t be written as functions of the states by

                                                  ct = f 1 (St )
                                                   t        = f 2 (St )
                                                             ^t)
                                                 x1;t = f 3 (S

where f i : R5 ! R for i 2 f1; 2; 3g and let f = (f 1 ; f 2 ; f 3 ). If we had access to f , we could
…nd the values of the remaining endogenous variables using the equilibrium conditions. Since


                                                             12
f is unknown, we approximate ct ,     t,   and x1;t as

                                               ct = fb1 (St )
                                                     b2
                                                t = f (St )

                                           x1;t = fb3 (St )

where fb = fb1 ; fb2 ; fb3 are polynomials.
   To compute fb, we …rst de…ne a hypercube for the state variables (we extrapolate when
we need to move outside the hypercube in the simulations) and rely on Smolyak’s algorithm
to obtain collocation points (grid points) within the hypercube. We guess the values of fb at
those collocation points, which implicitly de…ne fb over the entire state space. Then, treating
fb as the true time t + 1 functions, we exploit the equilibrium conditions to back out the
current ct ,   t,
               and x1;t values at the collocation points and check that those values coincide
with the ones implied by fb. If not, we update our guess until convergence. In our application
of Smolyak’s algorithm, we use polynomials of up to degree 4.
    Once we have found fb, from the equilibrium conditions we get an expression for the second
auxiliary variable,

                                                    13
    Now we are ready to determine the interest rate:

                                                              R
                                           Rt = max                      t   yt y mt ; 1 :
                                                               y    y




Thus, with this procedure, we get a set of functions ht = h (St ) for the additional variables
in our model ht 2 fyt ; lt ; mct ; x2;t ; wt ;          t ; vt ; Rt g.
    An important advantage of our procedure is that we solve nonlinearly for ct ,                                        t,   and x1;t
and only later for the other variables exploiting the remaining equilibrium conditions. Hence,
conditional on ct ,       t,   and x1;t ; our method deals with the kink of Rt at 1 in the Taylor rule
without any approximation: Rt comes from a direct application of the Taylor rule. Also,
the functions for ct ,         t,   and x1;t are derived from equations that involve expectations, which
smooth out any possible kinks created by the ZLB.


4. Comparison between Log-linear and the Nonlinear Solution

Equipped with our nonlinear solution, we can address many important questions. In this
section, we start by comparing the decision rules that we just obtained with the ones resulting
from a log-linear approximation when we ignore the ZLB, only imposing it ex-post in the
simulation (that is, when the Taylor rule would like to set Rt < 1, we instead set Rt = 1 and
continue). We illustrate, in this way, the important di¤erences that the presence of the ZLB
generates in the dynamics of the model and motivate the need for a full nonlinear approach.
    Our …rst step is to compute the log-linearized decision rules for our model given our
calibration. For example, the log-linear decision rule for consumption is given by:

log ct log c =     1   (log vt      1    log v)+   2   (log   t     log )+       3   log At +     4   log mt +   5   (log sg;t    log sg ) :

To compare this decision rule with our nonlinear solution, we plot in …gure 4.1 both decision
rules along the log       t -axis,      while we keep the other state variables at their steady-state values.
The decision rule has an overall negative slope because a value of the discount factor above its
steady state induces the household to save more, which lowers the real interest rate. Hence,
if su¢ ciently large and positive innovations bu¤et the discount factor, the economy may be
pushed to the ZLB. We observe this urgency to save more and consume less in the nonlinear
policy. Consumption plunges for shocks that push the discount factor 0:7 percent or higher
than its steady-state value. This is not a surprise. We calibrated                                    to be 0:994. Then, when
the discount factor increases 0.6 percent (0.006 in our graph),                              t   becomes bigger than 1 and
future consumption yields more utility than current expenditure. Our projection method is


                                                                  14
perfectly capable to respond to that feature of the model and capture the change of optimal
consumption.4 In contrast, the log-linear approximation, since it is built around the value
of       t   in the steady state, predicts a stable decline in consumption. This di¤erence becomes
stronger as         t   moves into higher values. If we expanded the horizontal scale, we would observe
a bigger di¤erence between the two decision rules. At the same time, the two policies almost
coincide for values of the discount factor close to or below its steady state value, where the
log-linear approximation is valid.5

         The policy function for in‡ation (…gure 4.2) con…rms the same pattern as in the previous
plot. As the discount factor becomes bigger, there is less aggregate demand today, and this
pushes in‡ation down as those …rms that reset their prices do not raise them as much as
they would otherwise do. In the nonlinear solution, this phenomenon of contraction-de‡ation
becomes acuter as                       increases and the economy moves toward the ZLB.
         In conclusion, nonlinearities matter when we talk about the ZLB. This point will be even
clearer with the …ndings of the next section.

     A technical point: the projection method does not deliver a decision rule that is globally concave. Since
we have price rigidities, there is no theoretical result that implies that this should be the case.
   5
     There is also a small di¤erence in levels dues to precautionary behavior, which is not captured by the
log-linear approximation.

5. Results

We now present the quantitative results from the model. First, we report the probabilities
of being at the ZLB. Second, we analyze the distribution of the duration of a spell at the
ZLB. Third, we show the distribution of shocks that send and keep the economy at the ZLB.
Fourth, we analyze the behavior of the endogenous variables at the ZLB. Fifth, we analyze
in detail one spell at the ZLB. Sixth, we analyze the size of the …scal multipliers. We close
by talking about the impulse-response functions (IRFs) of the model.

5.1. Probability of being at the ZLB

Our …rst exercise is to derive the probability that the economy is at the ZLB in any particular
period. This step is important because, in our model, the entry and exit from the ZLB
is endogenous. The spells are caused by the interaction of the exogenous state variables
(which have a continuous distribution over many values) and the endogenous state. Thus,
we compute the integral

the state vector in period i of the simulation when the initial condition is Sss .6 Using this
sequence, we follow Santos and Peralta-Alva (2005) to approximate equation (3) by
                                                                                  PT

From equation (4) we learn that our economy is at the ZLB during 5.53 percent of quarters,
or approximately 1 out of each 18 quarters, a noticeable share. However, since this percentage
was a criterion for the calibration, we do not emphasize it.7
       The probability of being at the ZLB is not independent of the history of states. To show
this, we calculate the probability of being at least one extra period at the ZLB conditional
on having been at the ZLB for exactly s periods as

                            Pr (fRt = 1g j fRt         1    = 1; : : : ; Rt   s    = 1; Rt      s 1   > 1g) =

     We have only one endogenous state variable: price dispersion, vt 1 . The mean of its ergodic distribution
and its steady-state value are nearly identical. The means of the ergodic distribution and the steady-state
values of the four exogenous state variables are, by construction, the same. Hence, we do not need a burn-in
period at the start of our simulation.

     This percentage of quarters is close to the …ndings of Reifschneider and Williams (1999), who use the
FRB/US model to argue that the U.S. economy will spend 5 percent of the quarters at the ZLB (de…ned
somewhat more loosely by them as a FFR below 25 basis points at an annual basis) when the monetary
authority has the same in‡ation target as in our calibration. In more recent work, Chung et al. (2010) have
recomputed this number with the latest observations to be 6 percent.

      Table 5.1 reports the values of equation (6) for s from 1 to 10. The probability of being
at least one extra period at the ZLB increases from 44 percent conditional on having been at
the ZLB for 1 period to 67 percent for 8 periods and decreases thereafter.8 That is, during
the …rst two years of a spell at the ZLB, the longer we have been at the ZLB, the more likely
it is we stay there next period. The intuition is simple: if we have been at the ZLB for, say,
4 quarters, it is because the economy has su¤ered a string of bad shocks. Thus, the economy
will linger longer on average around the state values that led to the ZLB in the …rst place.
The fact that the probabilities in table 5.1 are not constant over time already points out a
feature of our model that will play a key role in the next subsections: the expectation and
variance of the time remaining at the ZLB are time-varying.

5.2. How long are the spells at the ZLB?

Another important question is to determine the length of the spells of the economy at the
ZLB. To answer that question, …rst, we compute the expected number of consecutive periods
that the economy will be at the ZLB right after entering it. In mathematical terms:

    We have few simulations with spells at the ZLB of durations 9 or longer, so the numbers at the end of
the table are subject to more numerical noise than those at the start.

    By applying the previous steps, we …nd that the variance is 3.33 quarters. Since the
number of consecutive periods at the ZLB is bounded below by 1 quarter (one period in our
model), a variance of 3.33 (standard deviation of 1.8 quarters) denotes a quite asymmetric
distribution of consecutive periods at the ZLB just after entering it, with a long right tail.
We revisit this issue below.
    Now, we would like to see how the conditional expectations and variance depend on the
number of periods already at the ZLB. First, we calculate the expected number of additional
periods at the ZLB conditional on having already been at the ZLB for s periods:

                                                                      X

                                                                       j=1

Recall that, given our simulation of T periods, we can be at the ZLB at most T             s   1
additional periods (we need s periods before entry and one period of exit of the ZLB).
   These two statistics are reported in table 5.2. The expected number of additional periods
increases with the number of periods already at the ZLB (at least until 8 quarters). This is
not surprising after having seen table 5.1. The variance grows monotonically, from 2.70 to
5.57. Hence, the agents have more uncertainty forecasting the periods remaining at the ZLB
as the time at the ZLB accumulates (at least for the …rst 10 quarters).

                       Table 5.2: Number of additional periods at the ZLB
     s                         1    2    3     4         5   6    7      8     9      10

   The results in table 5.2 re‡ect how the distribution of additional periods at the ZLB
is time-varying. This is an important di¤erence of our paper with respect to the literature.
Previous papers have considered two cases. In the …rst one, there is an exogenous variable that
switches in every period with some constant probability; the typical change is the discount
factor going from low to high. Once the variable has switched, there is a perfect foresight path
that exists from the ZLB (see, for instance, Eggertsson and Woodford, 2003). Although this
path may depend on how long the economy has been at the ZLB, there is no uncertainty left
once the variable has switched. In the second case, researchers have looked at models with
perfect foresight (see, for example, sections IV and V of Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Rebelo,
2011). Even if …scal policy in‡uences how long we are at the ZLB, there is no uncertainty
with respect to events, and the variance is degenerate.
   The number of additional periods at the ZLB and the beliefs that agents have about
them will play a key role later when we talk about the …scal multiplier. The multiplier will
depend on the uncertainty regarding how many more periods the economy will be at the ZLB.
Having more uncertainty will, in general, raise the multiplier. However, the result cannot be
ascertained in general because of the skewness of the distribution. By construction, we cannot
have less than 0 additional periods at the ZLB. Thus, if the expectation is, for instance, 1.79
quarters and the variance 4.22 (column s = 5 in table 5.2), we must have a large right tail
and a concentrated mass on the (truncated) left tail. A higher variance can be caused by
movements in di¤erent parts of this asymmetric distribution and, thus, has complex e¤ects
on the …scal multiplier (see section 5.7 for details).

5.3. What shocks do take us to the ZLB?

We would like to know whether a shock of a given size increases or decreases the probability
of hitting the ZLB in the next I periods. More concretely, we would like to compute:

                                   Pr [Ii=1 fRt+i = 1g j fSj;t = Aj g =
 Z
      max If1g [R (St+1 )] ; : : : ; If1g [R (St+I )]    (St+1 ; : : : ; St+I j fSj;t = Aj g) dSt+1 : : : dSt+I (9)


for Aj 2 R and where Sj;t is the j th element of St . We perform this analysis only for the
exogenous states variables, that is j 2 f2; : : : ; 5g.
     To approximate (9) given our solution, we simulate the model N = 10; 000 times for I
periods starting at Sss for all states, but for the j th element of St , which we start at Aj . For
                                                                                      n      oI
                                                                                         Aj
each simulation n 2 f1; : : : ; N g ; we call the I periods long sequence of states Sn;i;ss       :
                                                                                                              i=1
Then, we set I = 10 and approximate the probability by:
                                                         h          i               h          i
                                                             Aj                         Aj
                                               N max I                ; : : : ; If1g R Sn;I;ss
                                               X      f1g R Sn;1;ss
  c [Ii=1 fRt+i = 1g j fSj;t = Aj g =
  Pr                                                                                                           :
                                               n=1
                                                                                N

     Table 5.3 reports these probabilities when the initial exogenous states are set, one at
a time (corresponding to each column), to 0,                 1, and     2 standard deviation innovations
away from the steady state. In other words, Aj = Sj;ss                 f0; 1; 2g    j   for the discount factor,
technology, monetary, and government expenditure. The third row (labeled 0 std) shows a
baseline scenario in which all the exogenous states are set at their steady-state values. In this
baseline, the probability of getting to the ZLB in the next two and a half years is 15 percent
(all the entries in the row are equal, since we are describing the same event). When we have
a one-standard-deviation positive innovation to the discount factor, that probability goes up
to 20 percent, and when we have a two-standard-deviation innovation to 29 percent. When
 t   is higher than in the steady state, the household is more patient and the interest rate that
clears the good market is low. Hence, it is easy for the economy to be pushed into the ZLB.
The reverse results occur when the innovation is negative: the probability of entering into a
ZLB falls to 12 percent (one-standard-deviation) or 9 percent (two-standard deviation).
     Interestingly, we also …nd that positive productivity shocks raise the probability of being
at the ZLB. There are two mechanisms at work here. First, higher productivity means lower
in‡ation: …rms charge a mark-up over their marginal cost and, with higher productivity,
costs are going down. Since the monetary authority responds to lower in‡ation by lowering
the nominal interest rate even more (the coe¢ cient in the Taylor rule is                     = 1:5), this puts


                                                        22
the economy closer to the ZLB. Second, when productivity is high, the real interest rate is
low. In the absence of capital, the extra output must be consumed for markets to clear. The
real interest rate goes down to overcome the desire of the representative household to smooth
consumption. This lower real interest rate translates, through the working of the Taylor rule,
into a lower nominal interest rate. Often, the ZLB prevents the necessary reduction in the
nominal interest rate caused by these two mechanisms.9

       Understanding the economics behind this point is important. During the 2007-2009 reces-
sion in the U.S., many observers argued that the good behavior of productivity was compelling
proof that the problems of the economy came from an insu¢ cient aggregate demand. Our
previous …nding reinterprets the situation. Far from being just a problem of demand, high
productivity may have aggravated the problem of the ZLB (see, for a related point, Eggerts-
son, 2010). Finally, monetary and …scal policy shocks have a volatility that is too small to
make much of a di¤erence with respect to the probability of hitting the ZLB (and the Taylor
rule undoes much of their impact).10
       Understanding which shocks lead us to the ZLB is particularly relevant for policymakers
who need to assess the conditions of the economy in order to respond to them. Consequently,
we can also learn about the distribution of states conditional on being at the ZLB, that is:

                                                (St j fRt = 1g) :                                          (10)

   9
      The …rst mechanism still exists with endogenous capital. The second mechanism will switch signs because,
with capital, a higher productivity increases the desire to invest. With endogenous capital, the strength of
each mechanism depends on parameter values. In Smets and Wouters (2007), to use a well-known example,
the nominal interest rate goes down after a positive technological shock (see their …gure 7, p. 602). Therefore,
it is still the case that in their model good productivity shocks increase the risk of hitting the ZLB.
   10
      Fernández-Villaverde, Guerrón-Quintana, and Rubio-Ramírez (2011) argue that higher future productiv-
ity raises current output when the economy is at the ZLB. The mechanism, far from contradicting the one in
the main text, is actually quite close. A higher future productivity generates a wealth e¤ect that increases
the desire to consume today. In normal times, such desire is undone by a rise in the real interest rate to
ensure market clearing. When the economy is at the ZLB, instead, it translates into higher demand and
higher output. The key here is to note that current or future productivity increases have di¤erent e¤ects on
the nominal interest rate and on in‡ation.

(again, we drop the distribution for vt 1 , since it has a less straightforward interpretation).
To facilitate comparison, the states are expressed as deviations from their steady state values
and we plot, with the red continuous line, the unconditional distribution of the state.

   In …gure 5.3 we see a pattern similar to the one in table 5.3: high discount factors and high
productivity are associated with the ZLB (the mass of the distributions conditional on being
at the ZLB of these two shocks is to the right of the unconditional distribution) while the

…scal and monetary shocks are nearly uncorrelated. The same information appears in table
5.4, where we report the mean and the standard deviation of the four exogenous variables,
unconditionally (this is just our calibration of these processes) and conditional at being at
the ZLB. The ZLB is associated with high discount factors and high productivities, but it is
not correlated with either monetary or …scal policy.

   We just analyzed the conditional marginal distribution of every individual exogenous
state. We can also study the bivariate conditional distributions of the exogenous states:

                                          ((Si;t ; Sj;t ) j fRt = 1g)                                            (12)

where Sj;t is the j th element of St and i; j 2 f2; : : : ; 5g. We approximate (12) by:

   Figure 5.4 plots the four most interesting of these bivariate distributions. In the top
left panel we see how the high productivity shock and the high preference shock comove at
the ZLB. We are at the ZLB precisely because these two shocks are simultaneously high.
In the top right panel we see a smaller comovement between high discount factors and the
monetary policy shock. Not surprisingly, in the bottom left panel we observe again the lack of
comovement between the monetary policy shock and productivity. Finally, the bottom right
panel shows there is little comovement between government expenditure and productivity.

5.4. Endogenous variables at the ZLB

We now document how the endogenous variables behave while the economy is at the ZLB.
In order to analyze this issue, …gure 5.5 compares the distributions of consumption, output,
and in‡ation. The …rst row represents the unconditional distribution of the three variables.
In particular,   (variablet ) for variablet 2 fc; y; g to be approximated by:

for any set A      R. Here we do not condition on being at the ZLB because we use the
unconditional distributions as a reference. The second row shows the same distribution
conditional of being at the ZLB, that is   (variablet j fRt = 1g), approximating it by:

   Figure 5.5 tells us that the three distributions are negatively skewed: the ZLB is associated
with low consumption, output, and in‡ation. When at the ZLB, consumption is on average
0.23 percent below its steady-state value, output 0.25 percent below its steady-state value,
and in‡ation is -1.89 percent (in annualized terms), 4 percentage points less than its average
at the unconditional distribution (2.1 percent). As shown in the third row, the distributions
are even more skewed if we condition on being at the ZLB for four periods. The average
values also get more negative. Consumption is on average 0.34 percent below its steady-state
value, output is 0.32 percent below its steady state, and in‡ation -2.83 percent (in annualized
terms). We should not read the previous numbers as suggesting that the ZLB is a mild illness:
in some bad events, the ZLB makes output drop 8.6 percent, consumption falls 8.2 percent,
and in‡ation is -13.5 percent. Given our rich stochastic structure, a spell at the ZLB is not

always associated with de‡ation. Out of the 300,000 simulations, our economy is at the ZLB
in 16,588 periods, and in 562 of those, in‡ation is positive (around 3 percent of the time11 ),
with an annualized average value of 0.29 percent.

5.5. Autopsy of a spell at the ZLB

The longest spell in our simulation lasts 25 quarters. This spell is triggered by a sharp spike in
the discount rate combined with a positive productivity shock and a negative monetary policy
shock. Since we can think about our discount factor shock as a proxy for demand shocks (as
those caused by debt overhangs), this situation resembles the U.S. data from 2008-2009 when
poor behavior of output was combined with good performance of productivity. Therefore, it
is worthwhile to analyze this spell at the ZLB in great detail.

    Since the recent spell of the U.S. economy at the ZLB has been associated with mild in‡ation, one can
use this 3 percent as an account of that observation. In addition, we could include further mechanisms (such
as an exogenous or endogenous mark-up shock) to increase this 3 percent. All that we need for the ZLB to
induce negative outcomes is that in‡ation does not go up enough to bring the real interest rate down as much
as the economy would do with completely ‡exible prices.

and the bottom right panel in‡ation (the last three variables in deviations with respect to the
steady state). In each panel there are two lines, one for the nonlinear approximation and one
(to appreciate the di¤erences implied by solution methods) for the log-linear approximation.
       The spell starts at period 25 and lasts until period 50. We plot some periods before and
after to provide a frame for the reader for comparison. Several points are worth highlighting.
First, the ZLB is associated with low consumption, less hours, and with de‡ation. Second,
even if the economy is out of the ZLB by period 50, it is still quite close to it for many quarters
(up to period 68), which shows that a model such as ours can generate (although admittedly
with low probability) a “lost decade”of recession and de‡ation.12 Third, the linear dynamics
departs from the nonlinear one in a signi…cant way when we are at (or close to) the ZLB. In
particular, the recession is deeper and the de‡ation acuter. Also, consumption goes down,
while in the linearized world it goes up. Thus, a policy maker looking at the linearized world
would misread the situation. This divergence in the paths for consumption is not a surprise
because the nonlinear policy functions that we computed in the previous section curved down
with respect to the linear approximations when at (or close to) the ZLB.

    We could modify the model to incorporate mechanisms such as …nancial frictions, correlation among
shocks (such as the shocks to productivity and to preferences), or fat tails in the innovations to the exogenous
variables that increase the persistence of the spells at the ZLB.




                                                      29
       Figure 5.7 helps to understand the role of the ZLB. We plot the same path of the interest
rate (from the nonlinear approximation) as in …gure 5.6, but we add Zt 1, the unconstrained
net interest rate that the model would have computed in the absence of the bound.13 During
the spell, the economy would require a negative interest rate (as large as -22.5 percent) to
induce the households to consume enough in response to the (temporarily) high discount
factor and productivity shock. Since a negative interest rate is precluded, the economy must
contract to reduce the desired level of savings.

5.6. The size of the …scal multiplier

Our next set of results corresponds to the size of the …scal multiplier. The ZLB is a situation
in which conventional monetary policy has lost its power as further reductions of the nominal
interest rate are not possible. Even if other types of monetary policy (such as announcing a
price level target) are still feasible, the di¢ culties in applying them without full commitment
has led many macroeconomists to refocus their attention on …scal policy, particularly because,
at the ZLB, the …scal multiplier may be large; as forcefully argued by Woodford (2011) and
Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Rebelo (2011).
       We analyze …scal policy with the help of our model. In …gure 5.8, we plot (in blue lines)
the size of the government multiplier when the economy is outside the ZLB. Since the model
is nonlinear, the multiplier depends on the point where we make our computation. A natural
candidate is the unconditional mean of the states. Thus, the multiplier is computed as follows:

   1. We …nd the unconditional means of output, y1 , and government spending, G1 .

   2. Starting at those, we increase government consumption at impact by 1 percent, 10
         percent, 20 percent, and 30 percent (that is, if government consumption is 1, we raise
         it to either 1.01, 1.1, 1.2, or 1.3). As time goes by, government consumption follows its
         law of motion (2) back to its average level.

   3. For each increase in government spending, we simulate the economy. Let yg;t and Gg;t
         denote the new simulated paths where the subindex g indicates the economy has been
         bu¤eted by a government spending shock.

   4. We compute the multiplier:
                                                 yg;t    y1
                                                            :
                                                 Gg;1    G1

  13
    To facilitate the interpretation, in …gure 5.2 we compute Zt 1 period by period; that is, without
considering that, in the absence of the ZLB, the economy would have entered in the period with a di¤erent
set of state variable values (caused by the di¤erent past equilibrium dynamics triggered precisely by the
absence of the bound).

                                                   30
       We calculate the response of the economy to di¤erent increases of government consump-
tion because, when we solve the model nonlinearly, the marginal multiplier (the multiplier
when government consumption goes up by an in…nitesimal amount) is di¤erent from the aver-
age multiplier (the multiplier when government consumption goes up by a discrete number).
We approximate the marginal multiplier with the multiplier that increases government con-
sumption by 1 percent. The other three higher increases give us an idea of how the average
multiplier changes with the size of the increment in government consumption. When the
nominal interest rate is positive, though, …gure 5.8 tells us that the di¤erence between the
marginal and the average multiplier is small. This is just another manifestation of the near
linearity of the model in that situation.

   Figure 5.8: Government spending multiplier when the ZLB lasts 4 quarters on average

       Outside the ZLB, the value of the multiplier at impact is around 0.5 (going from 0.54 when
the increment is 1 percent to 0.47 when the increment is 30 percent), a relatively small number,
but not unusual in New Keynesian models with a low labor elasticity, without liquidity-
constrained households, and with a Taylor rule that responds to the output gap.14 This value
is also consistent with the analytic insights in Woodford (2011), who derives multipliers less
than 1 when the economy is outside the ZLB and has parameter values commonly found

  14
     In the log-linearized version of the model, the multiplier at impact is 0.53. Just to illustrate our argument
in the main text, if we eliminate the response of the Taylor rule to the output gap, the multiplier from the
log-linear approximation would be 0.68.

                                                              31
in empirically estimated medium-sized DSGE models. The observation that the multiplier
decreases with the size of the increase in government consumption suggests that we must be
careful when we read the empirical evidence of …scal multipliers, as their estimated value may
depend on the size of the observed changes in government consumption.
   Figure 5.8 also displays the multiplier when the economy is at the ZLB (red crossed lines).
The multiplier is computed as follows:

  1. We start at the unconditional mean of states except that, to force the economy into
     the ZLB, we set the discount factor 2 percent above its unconditional mean (at 1.014
     instead of the calibrated mean 0.994). This shock sends the economy to the ZLB, on
     average, for 4 consecutive quarters in the absence of any additional shock during those
     periods. We call these unconditional means, y1zlb , and government spending, Gzlb
                                                                                   1 .


  2. With these states, we simulate the economy and store the time paths for output, ytzlb ,
     and government spending, Gzlb
                               t .


  3. With the same states, except that we consider an increase in government consumption at
     impact of 1 percent, 10 percent, 20 percent, and 30 percent relative to its unconditional
     mean, we simulate the economy. As time goes by, government consumption follows its
                         zlb
     law of motion. Let yg;t and Gzlb
                                  g;t denote the new simulated paths.


  4. We compute the multiplier:
                                             zlb
                                            yg;t    ytzlb
                                                          :
                                            Gzlb
                                             g;1    Gzlb
                                                       1

   Now the multiplier of government consumption at impact is much larger: 1.76 for increases
of government consumption of 1 percent, 1.68 for increases of 10 percent, 1.59 for increases
of 20 percent, and 1.50 for increases of 30 percent. That is, the new multiplier is around 3
times larger than when outside the ZLB.
   We now discuss some details of our exercise. We raise      t   to 1.014. Given our calibration,
this raise corresponds to a roughly 8 standard deviations shock to the discount factor. This
is a rare event that pushes us deeply into the ZLB territory. We picked it to generate a
spell at the ZLB of average duration of 4 quarters (although, remember that this is just an
average duration and that the economy actually faces a whole distribution of durations with
shorter and longer durations possible). We select an average duration of 4 quarters to be
close to other papers in the literature. This choice is consequential because in our economy
the characteristics of the shock that bring you to the ZLB matter for the size of the multiplier
(this is not the case in Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Rebelo, 2011).


                                              32
       Several patterns are apparent from the red lines in …gure 5.8. First, the multiplier at
the ZLB is signi…cantly above one, albeit smaller than the values reported in the literature
(Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Rebelo, 2011). Second, as in the previous case, the multiplier
declines as the size of the government shock increases. This is because, as the government
shock increases, the expected number of periods at the ZLB decreases for a given discount
factor shock. In our experiment, a 30 percent government shock pushes the economy, on
average, out of the ZLB upon impact.
       The natural question is to ask why the multiplier is smaller than the one reported in the
literature, for instance by Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Rebelo (2011) in a related environ-
ment. Our exercise is somewhat di¤erent from previous ones. First, in our model there is
a rich stochastic structure: in any period the economy is hit by several shocks. Agents do
not have perfect foresight of future events and the distribution of the number of periods at
the ZLB is not degenerate. Second, the government expenditure follows its law of motion (2)
regardless of whether or not the economy is at the ZLB. So, for instance, if a large government
consumption shock pushes the economy out of the ZLB right away, government consumption
would still be high for many quarters, lowering the multiplier.15 Our experiment is a nice
complement to other exercises in the literature and provides answers that policy-makers are
interested in: neither governments nor agents know in real life for how many periods the
economy will be at the ZLB, and government expenditure is di¢ cult to change once stimulus
plans have been approved.

       Let us now analyze in detail how the nondegenerate distribution of the number of periods
at the ZLB that the agents face a¤ects our results. To do this, we solve three versions of the
model with three levels of volatility for the discount factor shock (column 1 of table 5.5). In
each of the three cases, we increase— at time zero— the discount factor so that, on average, the
economy stays at the ZLB for 4 periods.16 We report the standard deviation of the periods at
the ZLB (third column) and the impact …scal multiplier (fourth column). To compute these
numbers (and for each version of our model), we simulate the economy 5; 000 times. As we

  15
    Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Rebelo (2011) also show a similar result.

    The size of the innovation is di¤erent in each case because of b , which a¤ects both the impact of the
current and future innovation and the behavior of agents.

reduce      b,   the multiplier falls, while the standard deviation of the number of periods at the
ZLB grows. Because of the left censuring of the spell duration, even if the expected durations
of the ZLB spell are constant across the three experiments, a higher standard deviation of the
number of periods at the ZLB means a higher probability of ZLB spell durations shorter than
four periods. For instance, this probability increases four percentage points from                                      b   = 0:0027
to   b   = 0:00175. Since, in these events, government expenditure pushes interest rates up, the
total e¤ect of additional government expenditure on aggregate demand today is much lower.

     To evaluate how the expected number of periods at the ZLB a¤ects the …scal multiplier,
…gure 5.9 shows the results when the discount factor is initially set to be 1:2 percent above
its unconditional mean. This sends the economy to the ZLB, in the absence of additional
shocks, on average for 2 quarters. The multiplier outside the ZLB is the same as before. But
the multiplier at the ZLB is now smaller at only around 2 times larger than in normal times.
For an increment of 1 percent of government expenditure, the impact multiplier is 1.20, and
it goes down to 1.00 when the increment is 30 percent. Figure 5.9 illustrates, thus, how the
size of the …scal multiplier depends on the expected duration of the spell at the ZLB without
…scal shocks (Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Rebelo, 2011, document this point as well). The

                                                                 34
intuition comes directly from the Euler equation forwarded several periods. The longer we
are expected to stay at the ZLB, the lower is the current demand for consumption (a lower
consumption in the future imposes, by optimality, a lower consumption today).

5.7. Endogenous durations of spells at the ZLB

We complete our analysis by reporting the IRFs of the model (computed as we did for the
…scal multipliers). The IRFs highlight how the duration of the spell at the ZLB is endogenous.
Figure 5.10 shows the IRFs for an increase of government expenditure of 1 percent. The IRFs
are computed as percentage deviations from the unconditional mean when we are outside
the ZLB (blue line) and as percentage deviations from the trajectories without government
spending when the ZLB binds (red crossed line). At the ZLB, Figure 5.10 is again computed
under a demand shock that sends the economy to the ZLB, on average, for 4 consecutive
quarters.

   Under normal circumstances (blue line), government spending crowds out consumption.
This is a direct consequence of a multiplier less than 1. Additional government spending puts
upside pressure on prices forcing the nominal interest rate to go up. Real interest rates follow
suit, since the central bank follows the Taylor principle. Households take advantage of high

                                                           35
interest rates and defer consumption for the future. Ultimately, output (and labor) rise above
its unconditional mean, but by less than the increase in government spending. In contrast,
when the economy is at the ZLB (red crossed line), consumption and output simultaneously
go up in response to higher government spending. With the nominal interest rate locked
at zero and rising in‡ation, the real rate is below the value prevailing in the absence of the
government stimulus. Hence, households prefer to reduce savings and consume more. Note
that, when the government spending shock is small it does not a¤ect the expected duration
of the ZLB spell (4 periods).
   Figure 5.11 shows that a government shock of 10 percent pushes the economy out of the
ZLB, on average, after three quarters. This is one period less than the expected duration
without the government shocks. This shorter expected duration implies a smaller response
of consumption today and, therefore, a smaller e¤ect of government spending at impact.
Yet the multiplier is still above one because the shock does not preclude the economy from
immediately escaping the ZLB.

   Finally, for a su¢ ciently large government shock, the economy is expected to escape the
ZLB (…gure 5.12) at impact. The rise in interest rates compresses consumption although not
to the levels when the economy is unconstrained (blue line). The multiplier for this case is
close to one but larger than when computed without the ZLB.

6. Conclusion

Our paper is a step toward a more complete understanding of economies in which the ZLB
is a relevant constraint in the implementation of policy. We have demonstrated that a full
nonlinear solution delivers important insights, for instance with respect to the role of …scal
policy at the ZLB and the conditional expectations of agents.
   Several lines of future research lay ahead of us. First, we can have richer models that are
closer to the ones that are used by central banks for practical policy advising (for instance,
Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans, 2005). These models will have both forces that make the
ZLB less important (endogenous capital) and forces that make it stronger (habit persistence,
…nancial frictions, etc.). It is an open question to assess which of these will dominate. Second,
we could extend our model to include a richer set of …scal policy instruments and ask, for
instance, about the di¤erences in responses of reductions in distortionary taxes when we
are at the ZLB and when we are not. Since the ZLB is a situation in which households
are already saving too much, reductions in taxes …nanced through debt (with its associated
quasi-Ricardian e¤ect of higher savings) may have little bite. Third, we can mix our solution
with a particle …lter to build the likelihood function for estimation as in Fernández-Villaverde
and Rubio-Ramírez (2007). Estimating this class of models with a full-likelihood approach is

                                                        37
promising. We can use the information in the data about parameters describing preferences
and technology to evaluate the behavior of the model at the ZLB, something that more
reduced-form models, such as Structural Vector Autoregressions, would have a harder time
doing because the U.S. has only been at the ZLB once since World War II. If the U.S. and other
European economies stay at the ZLB in the close future or the prospects of coming back to it
are su¢ ciently high, these next steps seem to be a high priority for applied macroeconomists.

7. Appendix: Solving the Model

We explain now in further detail how we compute the model using a projection method.
First, however, we need to …nd the steady state as this centers the projection and serves as
the point around which we log-linearize the model in the comparison exercise of section 4.

7.1. Steady state

The steady state is de…ned by the following equations (where now                 is not a variable but a
parameter, the in‡ation target):

7.2. The projection method

Recall that the state variables of the model are price dispersion, v; the discount factor,   t;
productivity, At ; the monetary shock, mt ; and the government expenditure share, sg;t . Recall
that we have de…ned a vector,

                                  St = (vt 1 ;     t ; At ; mt ; sg;t ) ;




                                                   42
where the …rst state, price dispersion, is endogenous, while the other four are exogenous.
De…ne a new vector,
                                  ^ t = (vt 1 ; log
                                  S                    t ; log At ; log mt ; log sg;t ) ;

so that the exogenous states are in logs. Then, we can write the equilibrium functions that
characterize the dynamics of the model as:

                                                               ^t)
                                                 log ct = f 1 (S
                                                 log    t
                                                                   ^t)
                                                            = f 2 (S
                                                               ^t)
                                               log x1;t = f 3 (S

where f = (f 1 ; f 2 ; f 3 ). Since f is unknown, to solve the model, we approximate log ct , log                  t,

and log x1;t as

                                                  log ct = fb1 (S
                                                                ^t)

                                                 log t = fb2 (S ^t)

                                               log x1;t = fb3 (S
                                                               ^t)


using the Smolyak collocation method laid out in Krueger, Kubler, and Malin (2011). De…ne
fb = fb1 ; fb2 ; fb3 .
       To construct fb, three steps are required.17 First, one must specify both a level of ap-
proximation   and bounds on a hypercube. Given these two, the method speci…es a …nite
                                ^ i gn within the hypercube. Second, one must provide the
number n of collocation points fS    i=1
values of f at each of these n points. Given these values, the method constructs polynomial
coe¢ cients that implicitly de…ne f^. Third, given the coe¢ cients, the method provides a way
to evaluate f^ at any point (inside or outside of the hypercube).
    The approximation f^ satis…es several important properties:

   1. f^ agrees with f at each S
                               ^i.

   2. If f is composed of polynomials that have degree or belong to a certain subset of the
      complete set of polynomials of degree 2 , then f^ agrees with f everywhere. For our level
         of approximation,        = 2, when f is composed of linear combinations of the polynomials
         x4j ,x3j , x2j , xj , 1, x2j x2k , x2j xk , xj xk for j; k = 1; : : : ; d, where d is the dimension of S, it
         will be reproduced exactly. See Barthelmann, Novak, and Ritter (2000) for details.

   3. If f is continuous, the approximation f^ is nearly optimal in a certain sense.

  17
       The exposition of the method here closely follows Gordon (2011).

                                                            43
       To de…ne the hypercube, we must choose bounds for the 5 state variables. For the endoge-
nous state variable       t 1,   we choose [1.000,1.005]. For each exogenous one, we choose bounds
equal to the steady-state value plus or minus three unconditional standard deviations. In
this way, we cover 99:7 percent of the mass of each process. For domain values outside of the
hypercube (which sometimes occur in the simulation and when computing expectations), we
extrapolate.
       To compute expectations, we use a degree 11 monomial formula from Stroud (1971, p.
323).18 The formula provides k innovations f("j;b ; "j;a ; "j;m ; "j;g )gkj=1 and weights fwj gkj=1 such
that, for any function of interest h,

                                                         X
                                                         k
                                              ^ t+1 )
                                         Et h(S                     ^ j;t+1 )
                                                               wj h(S
                                                         j=1


      ^ j;t+1 is found using the j th innovations and the time t information S
where S                                                                      ^ t and vt .19 It is
called a degree 11 rule because if h is a polynomial with degree less than or equal to 11, then
the approximation is exact. We also check the solution using a Monte Carlo with 100,000
draws, which generates a slightly di¤erent solution. Speci…cally, the values at the collocation
points di¤er by at most 0:0006 for log c, 0:0004 for log , and 0:0018 for log x1 .
   To solve for f^, we use a time-iteration procedure as follows:

   1. Guess on the values of log c, log , and log x1 at each collocation point Si . This implicitly
      gives an approximating function fb that is de…ned over the entire state space.

   2. Treating the approximations as the true time t + 1 functions, compute the value of the
                                                         ^ i ; i = 1; : : : ; n; in the following way:
      optimal time t functions at each collocation point S

           a. Fix an i. This gives the state today, (vt 1 ;           t ; At ; mt ; sg;t ).

           b. Guess on      t.

           c. Calculate     t    from   t.

           d. Calculate vt from the law of motion for price dispersion using                   t   and   t.

     See Judd (1998) for a discussion of monomial rules and formulas for degree 3 and degree 5 rules. Krueger,
Kubler, and Malin (2011) use a degree 5 rule. We use a degree 11 formula because it has been recently
documented that accurately evaluating expectations in dynamic equilibrium models is very important for
overall accuracy (see, in a slightly di¤erent context, Judd, Maliar, and Maliar, 2011). To apply the formula,
some slight adjustments must be made, as the weighting function is not exactly the Gaussian density.

            e. Using vt , the state today, the innovations and weights from the monomial rule,
               and the time t + 1 functions, compute the expectations

               Here,     t+1   and x2;t+1 are calculated from                           t+1   and x1;t+1 .
            f. Using these expectations and the guess on                                t,   calculate all remaining time t values:

                 1. ct =yt from the government expenditure shock.
                 2. x2;t from its intertemporal equation.
                 3. x1;t from x2;t .
                 4. mct from the intertemporal equation for x1 .
                 5. The unique (ct ; Rt ) pair using a guess-and-verify approach.20 This is done in
                      the following way:
                      1. First, assume Rt > 1 and compute ct using the Euler equation, the Taylor
                         rule, and the consumption-output ratio.
                      2. Second, check whether Zt as a function of ct is greater than 1. If it is, ct
                         is optimal, and Rt is equal to Zt . If it is not, then Rt equals 1, and ct is
                         given by the Euler equation.
                 6. yt from ct and sg;t .
                 7. lt from aggregate supply as lt = yt vt =At .
                 8. wt from the labor-leisure choice condition.

            g. To check whether the initial guess on                               t   was correct, compute mc
                                                                                                            ^ t = wt =At . If
               jmc
                ^t      mct j is close, then stop. Otherwise, make a new guess on                                     t   and go to step
                 21
               c.

  20
       To see that this is unique, consider the following. First, de…ning the value of the expectation

                                                                  t+1        1
                                                       Et
                                                             ct+1            t+1

as , from the Euler equation one has Rt = 1=(ct ). Second, the Taylor rule with the zero lower bound can
be manipulated to say Rt = maxf ct y ; 1g where

                                           = R(   t=    )    y      y   (1       sg;t sg )     y   mt :

From these two equations, it is easy to see there exists a unique (ct ; Rt ) pair.
  21
     Actually, we use a slightly di¤erent stopping criteria. In particular, we use the Matlab routine fzero to
…nd a zero of the residual function r( t ) = mc^ t ( t ) mct ( t ). The routine brackets the equilibrium value
of t in an interval [a; b] and progressively shrinks the bracket until b a < 2 10 16 apart.


                                                                  45
  3. Having found time t equilibrium values for log c; log ; and log x1 at each of the col-
     location points, check how di¤erent they are from the t + 1 values. If the new values
     di¤er by less than 10 6 , stop. If they di¤er by more, use the time t values to update
     the guesses and go to step 2.

   We tried several alternative procedures but found this one to be the most reliable. We
encountered convergence problems for highly persistent shocks or large shocks. Making appro-
priate initial guesses for the functions is important when the ZLB binds often. To construct
good guesses, we …rst solved the model for i.i.d. discount factor shocks— in which case the
lower bound does not bind— and then progressively increased the persistence to its benchmark
value.
