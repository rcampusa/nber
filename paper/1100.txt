Intertemporal Price Speculation and the Optimal Current—Account Deficit




                              Abstract


      The paper studies the effects of terms—of—trade fluctuations in

an infinite—horizon optimizing model of a small open economy. While

the current—account response to a transitory terms—of—trade shock is

in part explicable by intertemporal smoothing, an important additional

factor is the effect of anticipated future terms—of—trade shifts on

the real value of the external debt in terms of the home consumption

basket. When foreign borrowing is indexed to the import good, a

temporary worsening of the terms of trade creates the expectation of

a decline in the real value of external debt. This fall in the rele-

vant real interest rate leads households to increase consumption while

export prices are low and to decrease consumption sharply once the

terms of trade recover. If an adverse price shock is of sufficiently

brief duration, instantaneous utility will rise initially.

      This paper employs a simple intertemporal optimizing model to

 study the effects of transitory fluctuations in a small country's external

 terms of trade. The paper focuses on the current—account and utility

 paths induced by temporary terms—of—trade movements, and it compares

 them with those induced by temporary shocks to output. The economy

 modeled is one whose foreign borrowing is indexed to the goods it

 imports. This assumption reflects the situation of industrializing

 economies that have dollar—denominated foreign debts and face world im-

 port prices given in dollar terms.

      In the model developed beiow, a transitory terms—of—trade setback

 creites the expectation of a future fall in the value of external debt

 relacive to the domestic consumption basket. Temporarily, the real cost

 of borrowing abroad is lowered.1' Any transitory real income reduction

causes a current—account deficit: but while the deficit an output shock

induces is explicable in full by households' desire to smooth consumption

through intertemporal foreign trade, the deficit induced by a terms—of—

trade shock is motivated also by a desire to speculate, through borrowing,

on the anticipated future fall in the relative price of imports. Because

the relevant real interest rate is low while the terms of trade are poor,

there is an incentive to shift consumption toward that period. The incen-

tive disappears when the expected terms—of—trade improvement occurs, and

so instantaneous utility falls discontinuously at that moment.

     The analysis yields a number of interesting conclusions. The utility

time profile following a transitory output reduction is flat, but as

noted above, that induced by a temporary terms—of—trade shock is dis—
                                    —2—




continuous. Again in contrast to the case of an output disturbance, the

cumulative current deficit run during an interlude of terms—of—trade

weakness depends on the degree of individual risk aversion, which

measures the extent of intertemporal substitutability in consumption.

Finally, it can be shown that if an unfavorable terms—of—trade movement

is of sufficiently brief duration, instantaneous utility will   rise
initially, falling below its pre—shock level once the terms of trade have

recovered.

      In a closely related paper, Dornbusch (1983) examines the influence

of non—traded goods on the behavior of an economy similar to the one

studied below. The central point of his analysis——identical to the one

made in this paper——is that the interest rate relevant for consumption

decisions is the cost of external borrowing expressed in terms of the home

consumption basket.-" Dornbusch does not study the impact of terms—of—

trade disturbances, however. In addition, the analytical techniques

employed here differ considerably from his, and are of independent inter-

est in that they allow one to express the economy's equilibrium posi-

tion in closed form   as   a function of the expected future paths of the

televant exogenous variables.

      The results of transitory and anticipated relative—price shocks

have been analyzed in two—period models by a number of authors.-" As il-

lustrated below, however, extension of the analysis to an infinite—horizon

setting can lead to a richer description of the induced current—account

paths. Obstfeld (1980, 1982) and Svensson and Razin (1983) have analyzed

the effects of permanent, unanticipated relative—price shocks using infinite—

horizon models that emphasize the role of subjective time preference in
                                   —3—




individual saving decisions. In contrast, the model explored below

makes the simplifying assumption that the representative consumer's

subjective time—preference rate is constant.

      The paper is organized as follows. Section I describes the

preferences and interteinporal transformation possibilities that form

the building blocks of the model. Section II sets out the effects of

a temporary fall in output, while section III studies the consequences

of a transitory terms—of—trade deterioration and contrasts them with

those of an output shock. Section IV offers concluding remarks. A

technical appendix substantiates some assertions made in the text.

I. The Model

       The analysis concerns a small open economy consisting of identical,

immortal households. Each of these planning units maximizes a welfare

functional of the form



(1)         V =
                  J u(x,m)exp(_ót)dt.



The concave instantaneous utility function u(,) appearing in (1) is defined

over the household's consumption of an exportable good (x) and an import-

able good (in).      The parameter 5 is the household's constant (positive)

rate of time preference.

       Each household is endowed with an exogenous flow of y units of the

export good. That good is perishable; the only available asset is an

internationally—traded bond which carries a fixed face value equal to one

unit of the importable good and entitles its owner to receive r units
                                       4/
of the importable per unit time.—            If the planning period begins at time

t   = 0 and b0 denotes the number of bonds owned by the family on that

date, the desired consumption path must satisfy the intertemporal

budget constraint:



(2)        J [(xt/pt) + m]exp(_rt)dt         b0 + (y/p)exp(_rt)dt.


In (2), Pt S       the   price of imports in terms of exports, the terms of

trade. The path of the terms of trade is exogenous from the standpoint

of the small country. The world interest rate r is likewise exogenous,
                                             5
and   is
       held constant throughout the analysis.—
                                        —5—




       Necessary conditions for maximization of (1) subject to (2) can be

 derived by differentiating the Lagrangian expression



 (3)   L =                         —
             J u(xt,m)exp(_6t)dt       xf f[(xt/Pt)
                                                        + mJexp(_rt)dt


                                            -
                                                b0     fYt/PtexP_rtdt

 with respect to x and        (for all t). Those conditions are



 (4)
        u(xt,m)exp(_5t)


 (5)    um(xt,mt)exp(_ót) =    )exp(—rt).


Together with the intertemporal budget constraint (2), equations (4) and

 (5) can be used to derive a closed—form solution for the economy's optimal

consumption path x t,mt   t—     as well as X, the optimal initial shadow

value of wealth. For this purpose, ,          the    subjective time preference race,

is assumed to equal r, the bond rate given by the world capital

market. In addition, the utility function is assumed to reside within

the constant relative risk aversion family


                   cl—al—R
(6)    u(x,m)
                  (xm  )




where R > 0 and 1 > 0. > 0.    The coefficient of risk aversion R measures the

curvature of the utility function, and thus the extent to which a smooth con-

sumption time path is desirable. When R = 1, u(x,m) = cQn(x) + (1 — c)Qn(m).
                                        —6—




      The optimal shadow value X and the optimal consumption path are

calculated as follows. Because                =   r   (by assumption), equations (4)—(6)

imply that



                =
                    apt/(l
                             —   a).


It follows from (5) and (7) that



(8)       rn=
                 la        hR          Pt
                    A              1—a

Now (x/p) + m = mt/Cl — a), by (7). The intertemporal budget con-

straint (2) and equation (8) therefore yield the optimal shadow value

                                              a(l—R)
                     —                                 exp(—rt)dt)1

(9)


                             [b0 + J(yt/pt)expt)dt]R



Equations (7) and (8) may be combined with formula (9) to yield expressions

for the   optimal   consumption trajectories.Z1

      The shadow price A is, by (9), a function of the expected future

paths of output and the terms of trade: by implication, the same is

true of consumption. Any         previously       unanticipated change in these paths

will cause A to jump to a new level. An unanticipated shift in lifetime

consumption possibilities [as described by (2)] thus induces households

to revise both thedesiredlével of current consumption and the entire

planned path of future consumption.

        The optimal path of net external bond holdings, {b}o, may be

derived from (9) and Bellman's principle. In the absence of disturbances

that were not anticipated at time t = 0, an optimal consumption program

computed on that date must coincide with an optimal program as re—

computed at time t = s >           0.   In other words, the optimal plan is time

consistent. Because x and m are monotonically decreasing functions of

X, the optimal shadow value of wealth as of time s > 0 must therefore

equal the value computed at time 0 .             It   follows that

for any s > 0,

                          l—R t ct(l—R)

                                    I(yt/pt)exp(_r(t_s))dt]R



where     again represents the optimal shadow price computed at time 0

on the basis of the expected price and output paths appearing in (9).

The multiplier A can change only as a result of events that were unantici-

pated at time t =        O.-
        By equating the right—hand sides of (9) and (10), we can express

the optimal level of net external assets b8 as a funétion of the time

paths of output and the terms of trade. (Of course, b0 =
                                                         b0 is pre-
determined and not subject to choice.) The current account is the time

derivative of bt,V that is,



              =            + rb —               —

Equations (9) and (10) will be used in the following sections to trace

out the optimal current—account responses to a number of different

real income disturbances.

      Before going on to these exercises, it is useful to examine the

effect on the current account of an output or terms—of—trade shock that

is both unanticipated and permanent. It is assumed here——and throughout

the analysis below-—that, prior to the shock, output and the terms of trade

are expected to remain constant at y =               =   p,   for all t, so that the economy
                                                Pt
is in a stationary state. The level of the pre—shock shadow value A is then
                                 cy   (l—R)
                  l—R   _____
      -   (1—a)         1   —a
(12) x=
              [rb0 +    (/)1R

where b0 is the stock of bonds inherited from the past [see (9)]. An unantici-

pated, permanent fall in output from y to y' causes a once—and—for—all

rise in A (to A', say) provided no further unexpected events occur. But

the optimal shadow value can remain at A' through time with no change in

the stock of foreign claims because the expected paths of output and the

terms of trade are flat. It follows that if the economy is initially in

a stationary position, an unanticipated, permanent shock to the terms of

trade has no impact on the current account: external adjustment is im-

mediate. The same is true of relative price shocks.IPI



II. Transitory Output Shocks

      As a prelude to studying the optimal current—account response to a

temporary terms—of—trade shock, we study the external asset path induced by a

transitory decline in output. Before the transitory disturbance is
                                              —9—




 revealed, the economy is in the stationary position described at the end

 of section I. After the shock is revealed (at time t =                              0),   the terms of

 trade are expected to remain at the level Pt = p for all t, but output

 is expected to follow the path:              =
                                                      y'   <   y   for 0 <   t   <   T,        =   y for
 t > T.    It follows that at the initial instant, the shadow value of wealth

 jumps permanently from the level A given by (12) to a new level



                                   1—Ri

                                                                                           >
                         + (y'/p)(l — exp(—rT)) + (y/p)exp(_rT)]R
                  [rb0

 Equations (7) and (8) imply that the consumption levels of both commodities

 fall the moment the news of the transitory output shock arrives, but remain

constant thereafter. Instantaneous utility must therefore also follow a

 lower, constant path.

          For this to be possible, the current account must be in deficit

while output is temporarily low. By equating the right—hand sides of

(9) and (10), we find that for any expected output path and constant terms of

trade p, the stock of external claims must
                                                               satisfy



(14)          + J(y/p)exp[_r(t_s)]dt =
                                          b0 + f(Yt/P)exp(_rt)dt


for all s, so that household net worth (measured in imports) remains con-

stant over time. The constant post—shock level of
                                                                         expenditure equals the
annuity value of (14), that is,permanent income. The economy smooths its

consumption and utility by choosing the highest fixed expenditure level

consistent with its new intertemporal budget constraint and borrowing

from abroad while current income is below permanent income. Observe that
                                                  —10—




 when real income disturbances arise entirely from fluctuations in output,

 the induced external asset path is not dependent on the risk aversion

 parameter R characterizing the curvature of the utility function.

         Under the present assumptions concerning the output path expected

 in the wake of the shock, equation (14) becomes



 (15)   b =         +   [(y'/rp)     —   (y/rp)][exp(—r(T—s))      —   exp(—rT)]
               b0


for 0 < s < T,      b =           for s >   T.     Differentiation of (15) shows that
                             bT
between times s = 0 and s = T the current account balance is given by



(16)       =   [(yl     —   y)/p}exp(—r(T—s)) < 0.


According to (16), the current account deficit grows up until time T, at

which moment its level is bT =              (y'   —   y)/p.   When the anticipated increase

in output occurs, the current account jumps to zero with no change in

spending or instantaneous utility. The time path of the current account

is illustrated in figure 1.



III. Transitory Terms—of—Trade Shocks

        The preceding analysis serves as background for the discussion of

transitory real income fluctuations caused by relative price movements.

This section studies the current—account effects of a transitory terms—of—

trade deterioration, assuming that the economy is initially ata stationary

position and that the expected path of the terms of trade remains fixed at

y = y   for all t.          Once the shock occurs, the anticipated time path of the

terms of trade is given by: Pt =                           p'   for 0 <   t   <   T, Pt = p   <   p'    for t > T.

          Before the occurrence of the shock, when the terms of trade are

expected to follow the constant path Pt = p for all t, the optimal shadow

value X is, once again, described by equation (12). The temporary and un-

anticipated rise in the price of imports causes A to jump to the new, per-

manent level

To determine the effect of the price shock on the current account, it is

necessary to know whether A' is greater or less than A. The appendix demon-

strates that the sign of the derivative of (17) with respect to p', evaluated

at p' =    p,    is the same as that of the expression (1—R)(rb0 —
                                                                                                  m0)

where m0 is the consumption level of the imported good in the pre—shock

stationary state. When R < 1, the foregoing quantity is positive because

    cannot exceed the initial level of permanent income, rb0 + (yip). A

sufficient condition for the quantity to be positive when R >                                       1   is that

                so that the economy is indeed a net importer of the "import"

          It follows that for small price changes,

provided       the terms—of—trade change does in fact hurt the home country.

 by (10). Equations (12), (18), and (19) imply that bT <
                                                          b0. The inequality
 shows that the home country runs a cumulative current account deficit between

 times 0 and T.

       In the case of the temporary fall in output studied in section II, the

 post—shock time profile of instantaneous utility was flat: the economy

 smoothed its utility stream perfectly by holding consumption constant in

 the face of the anticipated increase in output. This pure smoothing be-

havior no longer obtains when real income falls because of a transitory

adverse terms—of—trade change. Because bonds have a face value fixed in

terms of the import good, terms—of—trade changes alter the real value of

the external debt when this is measured in terms of a basket including

both importables and exportables. An anticipated improvement in

the terms of trade lowers the real cost of borrowing abroad in the period

before the terms of trade improve. Individual optimality therefore in-

volves an element of intertemporal price speculation which causes a dis-

continuity in the time profile of utility and may even cause instantaneous

utility to rise temporarily.

      A detailed analysis of the time path of instantaneous utility throws

light on the equilibrium response to a transitory terms—of—trade change.

The intertemporal constancy of A', together with (7) and (8), implies that

consumption of both commodities--and hence, utility——must be constant be-

tween times 0 and T, and again after time T.      Only at time T, when the terms
                                                 —13—




of trade revert to p from p', can consumption and utility change discretely.

The level of utility while the terms of trade are relatively unfavorable is

calculated [with the help of (6)—(8)J to be

         1 —   c (1—R)/R '           ct(1—R)/R

p20'/                         1—tx                        —
                                                      u(A',p').
                         1 -R
The jump in instantaneous utility at time T is obtained by differentiating (20)

with respect to the terms of trade, holding A' constant:




(21) -- = -a(1            -   R)u(T,pT)/pR       <   0.


Equation (21) shows that instantaneous utility falls abruptly when the terms

of trade improve at time T. There is thus a discontinuity in the utility

path at that point.

        To complete the description of the utility time profile we must ask

how instantaneous utility changes at time 0 when the transitory price

shock is first revealed. The answer depends on the duration T of the adverse

terms—of—trade movement. The initial jump in utility is given by



        du =
(22)           ux(AP)dA + u(),p)dp,


which is of ambiguous sign because the first summand is negative while the

second is, by (21), positive. In equation (22) it is the variation dA

(and that only) that is a function of T; and as the appendix demonstrates,



(23)    liin dA =   0.
        T÷O
                                        —14—




 It follows from (23) that there are time periods T sufficiently short that

 the derivative (22) is positive. This implies the surprising result that

 for a sufficiently brief terms—of—trade deterioration, instantaneous utility

can rise initially, even though the value of the intertemporal welfare

functional V [given by (1)] must fall. Figure 2 depicts two possible

utility time profiles, the second of which entails such an initial rise in

utility.


        These time profiles can be explained by our earlier observation that

 an anticipated terms—of—trade improvement effectively lowers the real interest

 rate relevant for external borrowing decisions. As in the case of a temporary

 output shock, the economy's reaction to a temporary adverse price shift

 arises in part from a desire to smooth the feasible utility stream: this

 explains the emergence of an external deficit. But in addition, households

know that the real value of any debt incurred between times 0 and T will

decline abruptly when p' falls to p. Thus, while the reduction in per—.

manent income induces them to cut consumption, the expected price change

leads them to increase their consumption while the terms of trade are un-

favorable and reduce consumption sharply once the anticipated capital gains

have been realized. The fall in consumption at time T corresponds to the

discontinuous drop in instantaneous utility pictured in figure 2. The

possibility of an initial increase in instantaneous utility arises be-

cause the speculative (or real interest rate) effect of a transitory price

shock may outweigh the income effect when the shock is of

brief duration.


       The parameter R plays a key role in determining the optimal current—

account deficit, again in contrast to the case of a temporary fall in output.

 so that dbT/dR > 0.              As the measure of risk aversion R increases, the smooth-

ing motive becomes more important relative to the speculative motive and the

cumulative current—account deficit run while the terms of trade are poor

declines. Increased concavity of the utility function makes it more costly

 (in welfare terms) to shift consumption from the post—T period to the period

in which the terms of trade are temporarily unfavorable and the cost of bor-

rowing is, correspondingly, low. ---"

         The assumption that all international lending is indexed to

the imnorted good is clearly central to the results derived above. If bonds

were indexed instead to exports, an expected future terms—of—trade im-

provement would raise rather than lower the perceived cost of borrowing

abroad during a spell of low export prices; and this rise in the relevant

real interest rate would reinforce rather than oppose the income effect on

spending of the temporary terms—of—trade shock. The assumption of

import—indexed lending seems, however, to be the more realistic one for

the industializing economies which have experienced such marked terms—
                                   —16—




of—trade volatility over the last decade. These countries' external

debts are primarily dollar denominated, while a substantial fraction of

their imports is priced in dollars on world markets.

       In a setting of perfectly integrated capital markets it would he natural

to introduce alongside import—indexed bonds a bond linked in value to exports

and paying an own—interest rate p. A consequence of the perfect—foresight

assumption, however, is the arbitrage relation



(24)     p =   r   + (i;/p),




which, given p and r, severely restricts the possible terms—of—trade paths

that can be analyzed. In particular, (24) precludes anticipated, discrete

shifts in the price of imports of the type analyzed in this paper. A two—

country model would allow the endogenous determination of p and r and yield

predictions concerning the current—account and (smooth) terms—of—trade paths

induced by various shocks to the world economy. Those predictions would

in general depend on the countries' initial portfolio compositions, which,

again because of the perfect—foresight assumption, are indeterminate. A

satisfactory resolution of the difficulty requires an explicitly stochastic

model of the type explored by Lucas (1982).



IV. Conclusion

       This paper has studied the effects of transitory terms—of—trade

fluctuations on a small open economy. Using a simple intertemporal opti-

mizing model of individual behavior, the paper showed that a temporary

worsening in the terms of trade occasions a current—account deficit which

persists until the terms of trade return to their initial level.
                                  —17r'




     This current—account path is explicable in part by households'

desire to smooth their consumption streams; but a complete explanation must

recognize also that the expected future improvement in the terms of trade

gives households an opportunity to speculate intertemporally by incurring

an import—indexed foreign debt whose real value is certain to decrease.

The result is that the economy's utility time profile is discontinuous,

with instantaneous utility rising initially if the duration of the terms—

of—trade shock is sufficiently brief.

Appendix

       The        appendix calculates the effect of a transitory rise in the

terms of trade p on the optimal shadow value of wealth, A. That effect

Is simply the derivative of the right—hand side of (17) with respect to

pT, evaluated at pt =          p:


          dA                                   1—R           ct(1—R)

                           p[rb0 + (yIp)]            1 —                                    p




Clearly, the limit of (25) as T - 0 is 0, as equation (23) asserts. To

sign (25), we must analyze the term in braces, a(1—R)[rb0 + (yip)]                    + (Ry/p).
It   follows from (8) and (12) that the pre—shock level of consumption of the

imported good,             is given by (1 —
                                               cz)[rb0 + (y/p)]. Thus

as   asserted in the paragraph following equation (17).

1. Dornbusch (1982) argues that the consumer price index is the appropri-

ate deflator for an external foreign—currency debt.



2. This point is also made by Obstfeld (1981) in a variant of this paper's

model and by Mussa (1983) in a descriptive model of current—account

determination.   As in Dornbusch (1983), the model used below assumes

preferences of the constant relative risk aversion variety. Given these

preferences, the representative individual's instantaneous utility is an

increasing function of the consumption index studied by Dornbusch. The

results below, which are expressed in terms of the instantaneous utility

level, are therefore easily translated into statements about the time

path of the consumption index.



3. See, among others, Bruno (1982), Marion (1982), Sachs (1981), and

Svensson and Razin (1983). Dornbusch and Kruginan (1976) emphasize the

distinction between permanent and transitory changes in an informal

discussion of the current—account effects of relative—price shocks.



4. The assumption that borrowing is indexed to imports introduces a

certain asymmetry into the model. The implications of the assumption

are discussed at the end of section III, below.



5. Because perfect foresight is assumed, no notational distinction

between expected and realized variables is made. Note that the inter—

temporal budget constraint (2) implies the transversality condition

limtbexp(_rt) = 0, which rules Out excessive foreign borrowing [see
Obstfeld (1982)). Constraint (2) alone is therefore sufficient to
                                     —21—




  preclude an unbounded consumption and borrowing program in which all inter-

  est payments are met through further borrowing.



 6. Without this assumption the economy would not possess a stationary

 state.



 7.   By (2), the denominator of (9)——household net worth——must always be

 positive. Thus A > 0.   It is assumed throughout that all real—income

 shocks are sufficiently small that they would not result in non—positive

 household net worth even if they were permanent.



 8. The multiplier A can be interpreted as an asset price; see Obstfeld

 (1981). The assertion that it cannot jump discretely in response to

 events that were previously anticipated is analogous to the corresponding

 statement concerning asset prices established in efficient markets.



9. While b is a continuous function of time, it need not be differenti-

able: the current—account balance bt can change sharply. At points

where b is not differentiable, equation (11) below is interpreted as

describing the   ght—hand derivative of bt.



10. If the economy is not initially in a stationary position, however, permanent

shifts in the expected future paths of output or the terms of trade will

influence the current account.



11. If the economy's endowment of the foreign good, rb0, exceeds desired

consumption, that good will be exported, not imported.
                                     —22—




12. Recall that the condition rn0 >
                                       rb0 is sufficient (but not necessary)
to ensure that a teniporary rise in p leads to a current deficit. Even

a small country that benefits from a transitory rise in p may run a deficit

because it can gain from raising consumption temporarily and incurring a

debt whose real value is sure to decrease. As R -     , however,   the con-

dition in0 >
               rb0 becomes necessary as well as sufficient for a deficit.
