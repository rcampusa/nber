                                         ABSTRACT

Nonmedical exemptions are widely shown to be associated with outbreaks of vaccine-preventable
disease. In response to a recent measles outbreak in 2015, California acted to increase
immunization coverage by removing all nonmedical exemptions effective in 2016. Employing a
unique dataset of county-level vaccination and exemption rates at Kindergarten entry, we exploit
the recent policy change in California to estimate the impact of the repeal of nonmedical
exemptions on immunization coverage for school-mandated vaccines. Relative to a diverse group
of control states, our findings indicate that vaccination coverage increased for all required
vaccines following the repeal, ranging from 2.5% for MMR to 5% for Polio. We also find a
significant 3.4 percentage-point decline in nonmedical exemptions, accompanied by a 2.1
percentage-point increase in medical exemptions in counties that previously had high rates of
nonmedical waivers. Our findings indicate that the repeal of nonmedical exemptions in
California was only partially effective in improving vaccination coverage, and may have led
parents to substitute between medical and nonmedical exemptions, leading to a net decline in
total exemptions of just 1 percentage-point.

1. Introduction

          Childhood vaccination plays a prominent role in minimizing the incidence of vaccine-

   preventable disease (VPD) (CDC, 2015). Beyond protecting individual children from VPDs,

   vaccination confers a positive externality because it contains the spread of infection in the

   general population and contributes to herd immunity. The Centers for Disease Control and

   Prevention (CDC) recommends that most childhood vaccines be administered by the time a child

   reaches the age of twenty-four months (CDC, 2018a). To ensure widespread immunization

   coverage, states have enacted school immunization mandates whereby proof of vaccination is

   required to enroll children in school and preschool programs.

          School immunization mandates have been highly effective in achieving target vaccination

   rates in the U.S. (Abrevaya & Mulligan, 2011; Carpenter and Lawler, 2017; Lawler, 2017).

   However, all states allow some form of exemption from vaccination. Medical exemptions are

   granted when a specific vaccine, or vaccination in general, can be detrimental to an individual’s

   health. All states allow for medical exemption, subject to written certification by a licensed

   physician. Nonmedical exemptions allow individuals to refuse vaccination based on deeply held

   religious or personal beliefs that preclude vaccination. Both medical and nonmedical exemptions

   contain further gradations, which stipulate any additional educational or documentary

   requirements associated with obtaining a nonmedical exemption.

          While offering nonmedical exemptions preserves parents’ autonomy to make medical

   decisions for their children, misplaced fear over vaccine safety and side effects in recent years

   has given rise to “anti-vaccination” sentiment and increased utilization of nonmedical

   exemptions (Omer et al., 2006, 2009; Salmon et al., 2005). Vaccine skepticism is largely linked

   to a retracted study originally published by the Lancet in 1998 which indicated a causal


                                                    2
connection between the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism (Wakefield, 1998).

Despite the withdrawal and debunking of Wakefield’s study 1, public discourse concerning harm

associated with childhood vaccination has continued to influence beliefs about the risks of

immunization, possibly leading more families to claim exemptions. Nearly two decades later, a

third of U.S. parents still believe that a connection between MMR and autism exists (Graves,

2015).

           In recent years, rising exemption rates have led researchers to evaluate whether the

availability of nonmedical exemptions lessens the impact of mandated childhood vaccines by

exerting a negative influence on coverage. A concerning number of outbreaks in counties with

high rates of nonmedical exemptions has garnered the attention of policymakers and the public at

large. In 2015, California experienced the most severe measles outbreak in over a decade

attributable to vaccine hesitancy and availability of nonmedical exemptions. The outbreak started

at Disneyland in Orange County, “a hotbed of the anti-immunization movement”, and ultimately

infected over 110 Californians and at least 15 others in neighboring states (Barbash, 2015;

Zipprich et al., 2015). Amid the recent vaccine controversy, negative public perceptions

surrounding vaccination led California to tighten their requirements to prevent VPD outbreaks

and ensure that immunization coverage remains high. The state responded quickly to the 2015

measles outbreak by passing Senate Bill 277 (SB 277), which repealed all nonmedical

exemptions effective in July 2016, before the start of the next school year.

           In this study we exploit the repeal of nonmedical exemptions in California, relative to a

group of control states, using a difference-in-differences framework to explore the impact of the

policy change on immunization rates for four school-mandated vaccines required for

Kindergarten entry. These include measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis

(DTaP), Polio (IPV), and Hepatitis B (HepB). Our dataset combines information on changes in

states’ exemption provisions with county-level exemption rates and vaccine-specific

immunization rates for students entering Kindergarten 2. Controlling for an extensive set of

covariates, incidence of vaccine preventable disease, as well as county and year fixed effects, we

find that the repeal of nonmedical exemptions in California caused an increase in vaccination

rates for all 4 major childhood vaccines. As expected, nonmedical exemption rates fall

significantly following the repeal. However, California experiences a surprising spike in medical

exemptions after the policy change, relative to control states.

        Following the policy change enacted under SB 277, a small body of literature has

identified notable changes in vaccination and exemption rates in response to the repeal

(Buttenheim et al., 2018). However, studies to date have relied on descriptive statistics and time

series data from California to approximate this response. Our paper contributes to the literature

on childhood immunization policy by providing causal evidence of the impact of the repeal of

nonmedical exemptions on subsequent immunization coverage and exemption rates in California

by employing a control group of states that were unexposed to the policy change.

        The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides background on state immunization

and exemption policies and the repeal of nonmedical exemptions in California. Section 3

describes our data collection efforts and inclusion criteria for selection into the control group.

Section 4 outlines our estimation strategy for the difference-in-differences model and event

study. Section 5 presents the results from the main specification of our model and additional

  considerations. Additional results are included in the Appendix.



2. Background

  2.1 Immunization Policy and School Mandates

         Unlike most healthcare decisions, immunization is subject to strict regulation because the

  decision to vaccinate has clear implications for protecting individual and population health.

  Vaccination and exemption requirements, while controversial, are vital to sustaining herd

  immunity (Sadaf et al., 2013) and preventing outbreaks of vaccine preventable disease (Yang

  and Silverman, 2015). School vaccination laws have long been used to prevent the incidence

  and spread of VPDs. School immunization mandates were first enacted in Massachusetts in the

  1850s, and became increasingly commonplace throughout the 20th century due to their success.

  By the early 1970s there were evident disparities in incident rates of VPDs between states that

  had enacted mandates and those that had not (Malone and Hinman, 2003).

         Given the demonstrated effectiveness of compulsory vaccination in improving

  vaccination rates (Abrevaya and Mulligan, 2011; Lawler, 2017), school-entry immunizations are

  now required by law in every U.S. state. School vaccination laws, in particular, are crucial to

  improving coverage and reducing the incidence of disease. The timing of day care and

  Kindergarten entry is ideal for enforcing immunization mandates because the laws target age

  groups predominantly affected by common VPDs, including infants less than 1 year of age and

  children between the ages of 1 to 4 years old (Caron-Poulin et al., 2017). School-based laws also

  protect children from contracting VPDs in the school environment, a common site of

  transmission. Moreover, school-entry laws “represent a safety net” by ensuring widespread



                                                   5
coverage at the time of enrollment—regardless of socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, or place

of residence (Orenstein and Hinman, 1999).

        School entry laws help prevent the incidence of disease, rather than relying solely on

reactionary measures. They also serve to reduce disparities in coverage. Lastly, school laws are

effective because they can take advantage of immunization resources from the school system

(e.g. clinics or educational materials) to ensure widespread access and awareness of vaccination

benefits (Orenstein and Hinman, 1999). As of 2018, all 50 states plus the District of Columbia

require immunization against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, measles, mumps 3, rubella, polio, and

varicella for entrance into public school kindergarten 4. All but two states (Montana and South

Dakota) require immunization against Hepatitis B.



2.2 Exemptions from Immunization Mandates

        While school immunization mandates are widespread and have been highly effective in

achieving high rates of coverage, state laws necessarily include certain forms of exemption from

vaccination. All state laws offer medical exemptions for children with genuine contraindications

to immunization. Most states also offer nonmedical, religious or philosophical exemptions for

parents with profound religious or personal beliefs that oppose vaccination. While medical

exemptions tend to be similar across the board, there is substantial variation in the allowance of

philosophical and religious exemptions among states. As of 2018, 47 states and the District of

Columbia allow for some form of nonmedical exemption. All 48 states permit religious




3 According to Iowa Code, Chapter 139a. 8(6) and Iowa Administrative Code, 641-7.7(139), Kindergarten entrants
are only required to be immunized against measles and rubella. However, the mumps vaccine is frequently included
in the measles/rubella containing vaccine.

exemption, and 17 states allow for both religious and philosophical exemption. While the

majority of states allowing for nonmedical waivers have done so continuously from 2007 to the

present, 3 states made significant changes to their exemption regulations in recent years. Oregon

added philosophical exemptions effective in the 2013-2014 school year, while Vermont removed

philosophical exemptions effective in the 2016-2017 school year. California, on the other hand,

was the only state to eliminate all nonmedical exemptions (both religious and philosophical). The

repeal of nonmedical exemptions in California was passed in 2015, becoming effective in August

2016 (2016-2017 school year). Only two states, Mississippi and West Virginia, have never

allowed for nonmedical exemption.

           The language used to describe eligibility and availability of allowances clearly

differentiates between medical and nonmedical exemptions. In nearly every state, physician

certification is required to obtain a medical exemption. Few states accept medical exemptions

signed by other types of health care workers 5. However, state laws are less clear in establishing

and differentiating between different types of nonmedical exemptions. For instance, religious

exemptions sometimes contain language that enable parents to obtain a waiver based on personal

beliefs or philosophical objections to vaccination. Only five states 6 effectively prohibit the use of

religious waivers for the purpose of obtaining a philosophical exemption, by requiring

membership in a religious organization or denomination (Blank et al., 2013). In states without

restrictive vaccine exemption laws, religious exemptions are relatively easy to feign. The vast

majority of nonmedical exemption requirements do not distinguish between religious and

philosophical waivers in a meaningful way. In Blank et al.’s thorough examination of the

restrictiveness of nonmedical exemptions, the authors ultimately conclude the “disconnect

between religious objections to immunization in the law and in practice renders legal language

irrelevant in determining who can and cannot successfully exempt their children from

vaccination 7” (Blank et al. 2013). Given both the difficulty and irrelevancy of distinguishing

between exemption types for religious versus philosophical purposes, our analysis examines

nonmedical exemptions of both types collectively. Although some states have implemented

additional educational and certification requirements to obtain a nonmedical exemption (Yang &

Debold, 2014), these restrictions tend to be relatively lenient or non-binding. 8



2.4 Nonmedical Exemptions and Vaccination Coverage

         School immunization laws are put in place to mitigate the spread of infectious disease in

a close group setting. However, recent studies have identified the emergence of “hotspots” or

clusters of nonmedical exemptions in certain schools and counties (Olive et al., 2018). Salmon

et al. (1999) and Omer et al. (2008) find evidence of geographic clustering of exemptions, and

cases of measles and pertussis, respectively. Omer’s analysis of geographic clustering in

Michigan identified 23 statistically significant clusters of exemption rates and 6 statistically

significant clusters of pertussis cases over a 10-year period. The substantial overlap between



7 States’ exemption policies often use inclusive language that enables parents to claim exemptions for either
religious or philosophical purposes. For instance, Minnesota allows for non-medical exemption on the basis of
“conscientiously held beliefs”, which does not expressly include region, but certainly does not exclude it. (Source:
https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/121A.15). In effect, Minnesota allows for both religious and personal
belief exemptions. Pennsylvania, on the other hand, only defines religious exemption in their statute, yet allows for
vaccine refusal on the “basis of a strong moral or ethical conviction similar to a religious belief” (Source:
https://www.pacode.com/secure/data/028/chapter23/s23.84.html). Similarly, we can interpret Pennsylvania’s law to
permit both religious and philosophical exemption from immunization.
8
  Beyond establishing types of allowable exemptions for school immunization requirements, state law also stipulates
the rules and requirements for obtaining a medical or nonmedical waiver. Some states have passed legislation
requiring parents to receive immunization education prior to obtaining an exemption for their child, and several
others passed notarization or affidavit requirements. Some states’ regulations indicate that nonmedical exemptions
will not be recognized (or exempt students may be excluded) in the event of an outbreak. A few states have even
placed restrictions on medical exemptions by distinguishing between ‘temporary’ versus ‘permanent’ medical
exemptions, or requiring recertification by a healthcare provider (CDC, 2017a).

                                                         8
these groups suggests that clusters of exemptions put communities at increased risk of

contracting a vaccine preventable disease. Other scholars have indicated that the restrictiveness

of nonmedical exemption laws for school entry vaccination requirements can also have an effect

on incident rates of vaccine preventable disease. Omer et al. (2006) and Yang and Debold

(2014) both find evidence that easier-to-obtain exemptions are associated with increased

incidence of disease. Given the widespread belief that outbreaks of disease are linked to the

clustering of exemptions, it may be unsurprising that California responded to the 2015 measles

outbreak by repealing their nonmedical exemptions.

       In recent years, several studies have sought to uncover the impact of California’s policy

change on subsequent exemption rates and immunization coverage for required vaccines.

Performing a spatiotemporal analysis of non-medical exemptions, Delamater et al. (2017) find a

significant decline in non-medical exemptions following the repeal. Moreover, they identify a

significant positive relationship between current county-level rates of medical exemptions and

prior use of nonmedical exemptions in California. While preliminary findings indicate that rates

of non-medical exemptions will continue to decline over time, Delamater et al. predict that the

grandfather clause included in SB277 may perpetuate certain pockets of unvaccinated children

for over a decade following the policy change.

       Examining data from the California Department of Health, Buttenheim et al. (2018) find

an overall change in the composition of immunized and exempt children in California before and

after the repeal. The overall exemption rate decreased, but the decline in nonmedical exemptions

was met with an increase in medical exemptions. The percentage of Kindergarten-aged students

up-to-date for all required vaccines increased slightly following the policy change.




                                                 9
            In response to the startling rise in medical exemptions following the repeal, Mohanty et

   al. (2019) interviewed health officials and staff from local health jurisdictions in California to

   understand the reasons and circumstances surrounding the change. Ultimately they find that the

   lack of monitoring or review process for medical exemptions has created an opportunity for

   physicians and vaccine-hesitant parents to work around the recent repeal. However, none of

   these studies recruited a control group, and their findings draw primarily from time series data

   from California.



3. Data

3.1. Vaccination and Exemption Rate Data

       Data for our primary outcomes were collected first-hand from state health departments as

   well as their immunization branch websites. In order to examine the effect of nonmedical

   exemptions on childhood immunization coverage, we requested school and county level

   immunization and exemption rates from all 50 states plus the District of Columbia (henceforth,

   51 states). In particular, we asked for historical vaccine-specific immunization rates, as well as

   exemption rates by type (i.e. medical, religious, philosophical) through the 2017-2018 school

   year. Our search was confined to states that collect their own immunization data or maintain

   immunization registries at the school or county level. States were excluded if they relied solely

   on the CDC’s National Immunization Survey (NIS) for immunization coverage reporting. 9

            For our analysis, we focus on four major vaccine combinations containing these

   commonly required vaccines, including: measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), diphtheria-tetanus-




   9
    NIS reports vaccination rates for children up to the age of 23 months, which is prior to the window surrounding
   kindergarten entry. Moreover, it is possible for unvaccinated children in NIS to obtain vaccination in later years.

                                                            10
pertussis (DTaP), Polio (IPV), and Hepatitis B (HepB) 10. In order to compare vaccination

coverage across states, we cross-referenced information on school-entry immunization mandates

to account for variation in dosage requirements. All vaccine-specific rates are therefore

reflective of each state’s unique dosage requirements. 11

         After requesting immunization and exemption rates from all 51 states, we received

county level data from 30 states and school level data from 21 states. 12 From the information we

did receive, our sample was further restricted to states that met the criteria necessary to carry out

our analysis. States were retained only if they provided (1) vaccine-specific rates (e.g. % up-to-

date for DTaP), (2) immunization rates at Kindergarten entry (rather than age-reported rates) 13,

and (3) immunization data pre- and post- 2016 (our treatment year). After applying these

elimination criteria, our sample consists of 12 states with school-level data and 16 states with

county-level data. Given the somewhat larger sample size and ease of comparison, we employ

county-level data for our analyses.

         The main specification of our model uses a balanced-panel of seven states that reported

the outcome variables 14 consistently from the 2012 to 2017 school year (Arizona, California,


10 We also collected data on varicella immunization rates, however they were ultimately excluded from our analysis
because states were inconsistent in their method of recording varicella vaccination rates. While some states solely
recorded vaccinations, others accounted for immunization through both vaccination as well as physician-verified
history of varicella (chickenpox).
11 While MMR and Hepatitis B dosage requirements tend to be standard (2 and 3 doses required by Kindergarten

entry, respectively) there is greater variation in the timing and quantity of dosage requirements for Polio and
DTaP/DT. For instance, some states require 5 doses of the DTaP/DTP vaccine, whereas others will accept 3 or 4
doses as “up-to-date” depending on the age of the recipient at the time of vaccination.
12
   These states are not mutually exclusive. Some states report both school and county level data, whereas others
report only at a single level of aggregation. We use school level data to construct county level data if the state only
reports at the school-level.
13
   Some states provide coverage data for pre-school children aged 19 through 35 months old, the time period during
which most childhood vaccines are recommended. While vaccination rates for children and infants provide a good
estimate of coverage at the time of school entry, this leaves at least 2 years between the recommendation window
and school entry for parents to meet all vaccination requirements. Therefore, collecting information at school entry,
opposed to during the recommendation window, allows us to more accurately differentiate between delayed
vaccination and vaccination refusal.
14
   With one exception, Kansas does not provide exemption data for the time period. Therefore, we have complete
immunization data for all 7 states, and exemption data for 6 states.

                                                          11
Connecticut, Kansas, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island). As a robustness check, we

include all states that meet the aforementioned three criteria, which constitute an unbalanced

panel of states from the 2009 to 2017 school year. The list of states included in our study and

years of available data are provided in Table 1.

       Our dataset also contains county-level exemption rates for medical, religious, and

philosophical (personal belief) exemptions. While we initially attempted to differentiate

between rates of religious and philosophical exemption in our data collection (and did so

successfully for some states), many states do not separate types of nonmedical

exemptions in their records. In several cases, exemptions were reported simply as

“medical” or “nonmedical”. Therefore, it was often impossible to disentangle the use of

nonmedical exemptions for “religious” versus “philosophical” purposes.

       For our analysis, we collapse religious and philosophical exemption rates into

“nonmedical” exemptions. It is also important to note that for each type of exemption, rates

reflect the percentage of Kindergarteners with an exemption for at least one vaccine. Therefore,

exemption rates do not necessarily correspond with individual vaccination rates. While some

children are exempt from all vaccines, others have an exemption for one type of vaccine and are

up-to-date for the remaining requirements.



3.2. Policy Variables

       In addition to county-level coverage rates, we coded state-level dummy variables to

account for the policy environment in each region. We surveyed each state’s immunization

regulations and identified certain provisions that may limit or enhance a parent’s ability to obtain

a nonmedical exemption for their child. Namely, we record whether each state allows for



                                                   12
nonmedical exemptions. We primarily rely on Blank et al. (2013) to identify vaccine

exemption provisions in each state. We complemented this database with information

from Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Conference of State Legislators,

and individual state legislature databases. In a few cases, we reached out to immunization

program officials in state health departments for clarification on the language used to

describe exemption provisions. Similar to our difficulties in separating types of

exemption rates, it is also difficult to distinguish between types of exemption regulations.

Consistent with our categorization of exemption rates, we also combine religious and

philosophical exemption regulations into a category for nonmedical exemptions. As a

robustness check, we exclude states that disallow the use of religious exemption for

philosophical purposes by restricting eligibility for nonmedical exemptions to members

of religious groups. Table 1 provides details of state exemption provisions.



3.3. Outbreak Data

       Beyond immunization rates, our data set includes incidence of vaccine

preventable disease (VPD) outbreaks by state over time. We use three different measures

of outbreaks. The first measure uses annual state-level incident rates for 7 different

VPDs, which rely on reports from the CDC’s National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance

System. We account for the sum of all incident rates for available VPDs that are

preventable by the required childhood vaccines included in our sample. Specifically,

state level incident rates were available for measles, mumps, rubella (preventable by

MMR vaccination); diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus (preventable by DTaP/DTP




                                                13
vaccination); and hepatitis B 15. VPD outbreak variables are particularly important for our

difference-in-differences identification strategy because outbreaks may induce parents to

vaccinate their children. Additionally, outbreaks might lead states to adopt stricter

exemption policies, or even disallow nonmedical exemptions altogether. Consequently,

exclusion of this variable would likely lead to omitted variable bias.

        Our annual VPD incident rates are recorded in the calendar year, while the school year

typically begins in the month of August. Thus, VPD incidents occurring between January of each

year and the school year start date might influence parental decisions to vaccinate their children.

In the second measure, we use weekly VPD rates from the CDC, which enable us to track the

incidence of VPDs up to the point of school entry each year. Weekly rates comprise the annual

rates used in the main specification. However, they are limited to high prevalence VPDs (such

as pertussis), and omit outbreaks of low frequency VPDs such as a measles, polio, and

diphtheria. In an alternative specification using weekly VPD rates, incidents are recorded from

August 1st of each year through July 1st of the subsequent year. We lag incident rates by one year

to account for vaccination response to a previous year’s outbreak.

        Finally, following Oster (2018), we also employ data from Google Trends as a robustness

check, to measure the frequency of searches related to vaccine preventable disease. We examine

the effect of the repeal on vaccination coverage while controlling for disease-specific Google

search rates of VPDs that can be prevented with the four vaccines explored in our paper

(DTaP/DTP, Polio, MMR, and Hepatitis B). We account for the frequency of searches for the

following phrases: “polio”; “measles” + “mumps” + “rubella”, “diphtheria” + “tetanus” +



15
  There is no outbreak data for Polio because it has been officially eliminated in the U.S. for almost 40 years. No
cases have originated domestically since 1979; the last documented case was brought in from foreign travel in 1993.

   “pertussis” + “whooping cough”; “hepatitis”. All data are recorded annually from August 1st of

   each year through July 1st of the subsequent year (the year before school enrollment).



   3.4. Control Variables

              To account for the possibility that non-policy related factors may influence parents’

   willingness to vaccinate, we include demographic information (i.e. the percentage of the

   population by age group, gender, race and ethnicity), median household income, and the

   percentage of women older than 18 years old with a bachelor’s degree or higher, from the

   American Community Survey. We also include unemployment rates from the Bureau of Labor

   Statistics.



4. Estimation Strategy

              To estimate the effect of nonmedical exemptions on state vaccination rates, we exploit

   the change in California’s exemption policy in 2016 using a difference-in-differences (DiD)

   approach. We estimate:



   𝑌𝑌𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 = 𝛼𝛼𝑐𝑐 + 𝜆𝜆𝑡𝑡 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝑥𝑥𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 + 𝛽𝛽2 (𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠−1 ) + 𝛽𝛽3 (𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 ) + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 (1)



   The outcome variable, Ycst, is either the percentage of kindergarten-aged children who are up-to-

   date for a specific vaccine in county c in state s in year t, or the percentage of kindergarten-aged

   children who used medical or nonmedical exemptions to opt out of at least one vaccination. For

   our analysis, our outcome is defined by the school year. Thus, vaccination and exemption rates

   are defined as the rates at the time of school entry in August 1st of each year. The remaining



                                                                         15
variables are measured by calendar year. Our independent variable of interest, repeal of

nonmedical exemptions, is a binary variable indicating exposure to the policy event. California

moved to repeal nonmedical exemptions in 2015, yet the law became effective in July 2016. The

treatment variable, repeal nonmedexst, equals 1 for California in the years 2016 and 2017 and 0

otherwise. Since California’s policy change became effective at the start of the 2016 school

year, outcome variables recorded in 2016 are part of the post-treatment period. We therefore

identify the causal effect of treatment, the coefficient on 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 , by taking the

difference in treatment and control states, before and after the intervention period marked by the

start of the 2016 school year.

         In addition to county-level immunization and exemption rates, our model controls for

annual incidents rates of vaccine preventable disease in the previous year, as well as a vector of

time-varying county and state covariates, including demographic and socio-economic

characteristics. County and year fixed effects are denoted by 𝛼𝛼𝑐𝑐 and 𝜆𝜆𝑡𝑡 , respectively. Standard

errors are clustered at the county level.

         While attributes of exemption policies vary across states, the inclusion of county fixed

effects should account for most of the policy variation, with the exception of changes in

educational requirements for three states in our sample: California, Oregon, and Washington.

However, due to the timing and limited scope of the requirements, we do not expect these

changes to influence our outcomes of interest. 16


16
  In Washington State, an educational requirement was enacted in 2011 but the data for that state were only
available as of 2014. California required parents to receive information on VPD risks prior to obtaining a
nonmedical exemption (Silverman, 2003). However, the requirement went into effect in 2014 and soon became
immaterial with the repeal of nonmedical exemptions in 2016. Moreover, the governor added a signing statement to
the bill that excluded religious exemptions, which likely diminished the bill’s overall impact. Oregon also passed an
educational requirement in 2014. The law only requires exempting parents to complete an online educational
module consisting of a short video, which allows the user to skip through segments. Given the lack of interaction
with a real healthcare provider, and the ease of opportunity for any parent to avoid absorbing the information, we
consider this requirement to be effectively non-binding.

                                                         16
           The main specification of our model uses a difference-in-differences design to estimate

   the effect of the repeal of nonmedical exemptions on subsequent immunization and exemption

   rates. The difference-in-differences framework relies on the parallel trends assumption that

   treatment and control group outcomes would have evolved in parallel, absent the policy

   intervention. Although the parallel trends assumption is not directly testable, we examine trends

   in adjusted vaccination and exemption rates in the pretreatment period (prior to the repeal of

   nonmedical exemptions in California) using a leads and lags model.



          𝑌𝑌𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 = 𝛼𝛼𝑐𝑐 + 𝜆𝜆𝑡𝑡 + 𝛽𝛽1 𝑥𝑥𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 + 𝛽𝛽2 (𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠−1 ) + ∑4𝜏𝜏=1 𝛽𝛽−𝜏𝜏 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡−𝜏𝜏 +

                                      ∑1𝜏𝜏=0 𝛽𝛽+𝜏𝜏 𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡+𝜏𝜏 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖   (2)



   In this specification, 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡−𝜏𝜏 takes the value of one 𝜏𝜏 years before the repeal in

   California and zero otherwise. Similarly, 𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡+𝜏𝜏 takes the value of one 𝜏𝜏 years

   after the repeal in California, and zero otherwise.



5. Results

   5.1. Summary Statistics

       Table 2 presents mean outcomes and covariates separately for California and control states

   for both balanced (N=6 control states) and unbalanced panels (N=15 control states) in the year

   2015, one year before the repeal of nonmedical exemptions in California. Compared to both sets

   of control states, California recorded lower vaccination rates and higher nonmedical exemption

   rates. This suggests that prior to the repeal of nonmedical exemptions, Californians were




                                                                       17
relatively more hesitant to vaccinate their children. Compared to the 6 control states in our

balanced sample, California recorded more incidents of VPDs.

   The comparison is slightly different when we include control states from the unbalanced

panel. While pertussis incidents are still more prevalent in California relative to control states,

the incident rates of all other VPDs are higher in control states than in California. It is worth

mentioning that California had the highest rate of pertussis, the most common VPD among all

states. There were other differences, for example California was more populated, and more

educated, and had higher median household income.



5.2. Vaccination and Exemption Trends in California and Control States

   Figure 1 presents the vaccination rates and exemption rates for Kindergarten-aged children in

California from 2000 to 2017. Vaccination rates were steadily decreasing in California between

the years 2000 and 2013, yet increased substantially in 2014 for all major vaccines, followed by

a modest increase in 2015. However, following the repeal of nonmedical exemptions, California

experienced a marked increase in coverage for all required vaccines. Nonmedical exemption

rates were increasing in California before the repeal and dropped sharply thereafter. Medical

exemptions, on the other hand, were effectively constant during the pre-treatment period and

increased substantially after the policy change.

   While the increase in vaccination rates in 2014 was similar in magnitude to the increase in

vaccination rates observed after the repeal of nonmedical exemptions, the 2014 spike was not

accompanied by a decline in nonmedical exemption rates. Whereas, following the policy change

there was a substantial drop in the nonmedical exemption rate in California. This response

indicates that the increase in vaccination rates in 2014 was likely independent of the exemption



                                                   18
provisions in California, and reinforces the argument that the increase in vaccination rates after

2015 was caused by the repeal of nonmedical exemptions.

   Figure 2 presents vaccination and exemption rates separately for California and control states

in our balanced panel between the years 2012 and 2017 without controlling for any fixed effects

or covariates. Evaluating trends in vaccination rates over time, we find the increasing trend in

California during the pre-policy period is not detected for control states. The vaccination rates in

the control group were effectively constant throughout the sample period.

   Examining trends in exemption rates in the same 6-year period, Panel B of Figure 2 exhibits

a sudden drop in nonmedical exemptions in California while rates remained stable in control

states. Nonmedical exemption rates were consistently higher in California compared to control

states during the pre-policy period, and fall below the rates in control states after the repeal.

Medical exemptions, on the other hand, were persistent in both treatment and control states prior

to 2015, and the rates were similar in California and control states. Following the repeal,

California experienced a sharp increase in medical exemptions while control states’ exemption

rates remained unchanged.



5.3. Event Study

       We further investigate the parallel trends assumption with an event study that examines

the effect of the repeal of nonmedical exemptions in California on childhood vaccination rates

and exemptions. Figure 3 presents the results of our leads and lags regression of vaccination

rates and exemptions in California versus control states in our balanced panel between the years

2012 and 2017. Each point represents the vaccination rate in California relative to control states,




                                                  19
adjusted for covariates and fixed effects. Vertical bars show the 95% confidence interval. The

year -1 coefficient is set to zero.

        Panels A through D present the leads and lags regression results for each required

vaccine. From the balanced panel, we find that the adjusted MMR, DTP, and Polio vaccination

rates increased between years -4 to -3 in California relative to control states, and this increase

was offset by a relative decline between years -3 to -2, followed by a sharp increase after the

policy change in 2016. The estimated lead coefficients were flat, and near zero for Hep B

vaccination, and increased substantially after the repeal.

        Changes in medical, nonmedical, and total exemptions in California relative to other

states are depicted in Panel E. Prior to the repeal, nonmedical exemptions were increasing

between years -4 to -3 in California relative to control states, and declining between years -3 and

-2, while medical exemptions were evolving in parallel in California and the control states. Total

exemptions exhibited a similar trend as nonmedical exemptions. Following the policy change in

2016, California faced a stark increase in medical exemptions, and a large decrease in

nonmedical exemptions relative to control states. The balance between the decline in nonmedical

exemptions and rise in medical exemptions is negative. Thus, the overall exemption rate fell after

the repeal of nonmedical exemptions.

        Taken together, the results from our event study and examination of state trends suggest

that changes in vaccination and exemption rates post-repeal are not caused by differences in pre-

treatment trends. Our analysis provides moderate support for the parallel trends assumption, and

reveals that changes in trends experienced by California are likely attributable to the repeal of

nonmedical exemptions. California’s vaccination rates and medical exemptions increased at an

increasing rate (and nonmedical exemptions decreased at an increasing rate) following the



                                                 20
repeal. Our results illustrate that control states did not experience a change in the rate of

exemptions or vaccination coverage as a result of the repeal.



5.4. Effect of Repeal of Nonmedical Exemptions on Vaccination and Exemption Rates

       Table 3 illustrates the results from our simple differences-in-differences estimation.

Panel A presents results for the simple DiD. With the evidence of non-parallel trends between

the treatment and control states, we added linear state-specific time trends in alternative

specifications. The results from this specification are presented in Panel B of Table 3. In both

specifications, Columns 1-4 demonstrate the impact of repealing nonmedical exemptions in

California on county-level immunization rates for MMR, DTP, Polio, and Hep B, respectively.

Columns 5-7 illustrate the effect of repealing nonmedical exemptions on medical and

nonmedical exemption rates, as well as the overall exemption rate.

       The first four columns of the simple DiD indicate the repeal had a positive impact on

immunization rates for all four required vaccines. However, the policy change also had a

significant positive impact on medical exemptions, namely a 2.1 percentage-point increase in

response to the repeal of nonmedical exemptions. Note that exemption variables are defined as

the percentage of children with a medical or nonmedical exemption for at least one vaccine, thus,

a 2.1 percentage-point increase in the nonmedical exemption rate does not necessarily indicate a

similar decline in vaccination rates for all vaccines. As expected, repealing nonmedical

exemptions significantly reduced the rate of nonmedical exemptions in California (by 3.4




                                                 21
percentage-points). The balance between these two effects implies a 1.3 percentage-point

reduction in the overall exemption rate.

       Panel B presents the DiD results with a state-specific time trend, which allows treatment

and control states to follow different trends. This specification provides a check on our simple

DiD identification strategy. The effect of the repeal of nonmedical exemptions on MMR

vaccination rates increased substantially after the inclusion of state-specific time trends, and the

effect of the repeal on Polio vaccination dropped considerably. The addition of state time trends

changes the magnitude of other vaccination rate coefficients slightly, yet all estimates remain

positive and statistically significant. The effect of the repeal on medical and nonmedical

exemptions was largely unchanged. Our findings continue to demonstrate a simultaneous

increase in medical exemptions, replacing nearly two-thirds of the reduction in nonmedical

exemptions.

       The second row of Panels A and B present the effect of vaccine preventable disease

(VPD) outbreaks on immunization coverage and exemption rates. Our results are consistent with

the findings of Oster (2018) and Schaller et al. (2017). In both specifications, outbreaks of VPDs

significantly increased vaccination rates for required childhood vaccines. VPD incidents

significantly increased all vaccination rates, and did not change medical or nonmedical

exemption rates in specifications without state-specific time trends. After the inclusion of state-

specific time trends, the coefficients for vaccination rates dropped for each vaccine and remained

positive and statistically significant for all vaccines except MMR. Our results suggest that parent

decisions to vaccinate are influenced by outbreaks of vaccine preventable disease. An increase in




                                                 22
   VPD incidents consistently leads to an increase in vaccination coverage. However, these effects

   pale in comparison with the effect of the repeal of nonmedical exemptions.

          The change in medical and nonmedical exemption rates experienced in California

   counties is illustrated graphically in Figure 4. Panel A depicts the distribution of rates in 2015,

   before the policy change. Post-policy exemption rates in 2017 are shown in Panel B. In these

   figures we can see a clear decline in nonmedical exemptions accompanied by a notable increase

   in medical exemptions in the post-treatment period (2017). Moreover, the largest increase in

   medical exemptions occur in counties that used to have high rates of nonmedical exemptions.

   This is particularly worrisome since unvaccinated children are concentrated in certain counties

   where vaccination rates may drop below the level needed for herd immunity.



6. Additional Estimates and Robustness Checks

          In this section we re-examine the impact of the repeal of nonmedical exemptions on

   vaccination coverage by modifying certain aspects of our base model assumptions. First, we

   account for variation in population size by employing our simple difference-in-differences model

   with population weights. Ultimately we are interested in whether differences in population affect

   the relationship between our variables of interest. Population weighting gives greater weight to

   rates in counties with large populations than those with small populations. The second row of

   Table 4 presents the results.

          All estimates of the effect of the repeal of nonmedical exemptions on vaccination

   coverage are positive and statistically significant. Estimates are similar in magnitude to our

   findings from the main specification, with the exception of estimates for Polio vaccination. The

   estimated coefficient for Polio dropped considerably in the weighted regression. The coefficient



                                                    23
on nonmedical exemption is notably smaller than estimates produced in other specifications.

This is perhaps reflective of the fact that some of the smaller counties in Northern California

experienced the largest decline in nonmedical exemption rates. In weighted regressions, the

decrease in nonmedical exemptions is similar in magnitude to estimates of the increase in

medical exemption, leaving the overall exemption rate unchanged.

       As a second robustness check, we re-examine the impact of the repeal on vaccination and

exemption rates by employing weekly incident rates for a select set of VPDs. Unlike annual

rates, the weekly rates account for low frequency diseases, such as measles. Findings are

presented in the third row of Table 4. Our results are robust to the inclusion of weekly VPD

information and the omission of low frequency VPDs. These findings suggest that vaccination

and exemption response is largely driven by high-frequency VPDs, rather than less common

infectious diseases. Interestingly, the coefficient on MMR vaccination is virtually unchanged by

the omission of measles incidents from the model.

       While our baseline model includes CDC outbreak data, our third robustness check uses

Google Trends data as an alternative measure capturing public awareness of infectious disease.

CDC data is a more precise measure of verified cases of VPD outbreaks in each state, whereas

Google Trends data may provide a better approximation for public concern for different VPDs

over time. Similar to incident rates, Google searches for VPDs capture the frequency of

outbreaks, but also reflect general concern for different VPDs and changes in search interest over

time that might affect decisions to vaccinate (Oster, 2018). Theoretically, we expect a higher

number of Google searches for disease in the periods following an outbreak. Therefore, we

employ search rates from the previous year to account for delayed vaccination response to search




                                                24
interest in VPDs. To assess the linear relationship between the CDC incident rates and Google

trends search rate measures, Pearson’s correlation coefficients are provided in the Appendix.

       The fourth row of Table 4 presents the results of our difference-in-differences estimation

controlling for lagged Google search rates of VPDs. The estimated coefficients for MMR and

DTP vaccination drop considerably and are no longer statistically significant. Coefficients for

Polio and Hep B vaccination, on the other hand, remain statistically significant at the 1% level

and only slightly lower than the point estimates from our main specification. The effect of the

repeal on medical and nonmedical exemptions is also similar to the effects we found while

controlling for CDC outbreak data in our primary model. Controlling for Google trends data, the

repeal reduces nonmedical exemptions by almost 3.7 percentage-points and increases medical

exemptions by 2 percentage-points. All coefficients are statistically significant at the 1% level.

       For our fourth robustness check, we examine the effect of the repeal on vaccine coverage

using all states that satisfy our inclusion criteria. Since some states did not have data for all

counties in every year, this results in an unbalanced panel of 16 states from 2009 to 2017.

Estimating the impact of the repeal with a larger unbalanced panel has the advantage of yielding

more precise estimates of the effect of the policy change. However, since fewer states have

available data in earlier years, the definition of the control group changes during the pre-

treatment period as we get further away from the policy change. These results are presented in

the fifth and the sixth rows of Table 4. Point estimates are generally larger than the results from

the balanced sample, and they are robust to the inclusion of state-specific time trends. Event

analysis graphs for the unbalanced panel demonstrate clear evidence of a post-treatment increase

in vaccination rates in California relative to control states. Nonmedical exemption rates drop,




                                                  25
while medical exemption rates increase, consistent with our findings from the balanced sample

(results are provided in the Appendix).

       As a final robustness check, we exclude states from our sample that clearly prohibit the

use of religious waivers for the purpose of obtaining a philosophical exemption (i.e. Kansas,

South Dakota, and Oregon). Following the analysis of Blank et al. (2013), our balanced panel

omits states that limit religious exemptions to individuals who adhere to a “religion/religious

doctrine/denomination” or claim membership within a “church or denomination” that is

“opposed to vaccination”. Thus, we exclude Kansas from our balanced panel; in addition, we

exclude South Dakota, and Oregon from our unbalanced panel. Rows 7 and 8 of Table 4 present

the results of our difference-in-differences estimation for our balanced and unbalanced of states,

respectively. In the balanced panel (without Kansas), the estimated coefficients are notably

smaller relative to the main specification, yet remain positive and statistically significant for each

required vaccine. However, the resulting coefficients in the unbalanced sample (without Kansas,

South Dakota, and Oregon) are mixed. The coefficients for Polio and DTP are slightly smaller

than those obtained from the full balanced panel in row 5; whereas the coefficients on MMR and

Hep B are slightly larger. Overall, results indicate that the repeal of non-medical exemptions

increased vaccination coverage for all vaccines, with and without the inclusion of states with

strict exemption regulations.



6. Discussion

       Our results have important public health and policy implications. Our analysis of the

impact of the repeal indicates that California’s policy change reduced the rate of nonmedical

exemptions by more than 3 percentage-points and significantly improved vaccination coverage



                                                 26
by roughly 2.5% to 5%. Outbreaks of vaccine preventable disease also led to increases in vaccine

coverage. However, those effects were small compared to the impact of the repeal of nonmedical

exemptions, suggesting opportunities for direct policy intervention. Our findings also suggest

that the policy change may have had the unintended effect of inducing parents to substitute

nonmedical exemptions with medical exemptions. We find a significant 2 percentage-point

increase in medical exemptions in several of our analyses, which limits the overall decline in

total exemptions to just 1 percentage-point.

         Given that medical exemptions are reserved for children with genuine contraindications

to vaccines, the mechanism through which parents obtain medical waivers is unclear. One

possibility is that medical exemptions were underutilized prior to the repeal due to the ease of

obtaining nonmedical exemptions. This may have led to an increase in genuine medical

exemptions as parents sought medical waivers in place of easier-to-obtain nonmedical

exemptions. Another potential mechanism for the increase in medical exemptions is the new

language used to guide medical exemption allowances under the law. ACIP changed their best

practices guidelines for medical exemptions to reflect both contraindications as well as

precautions to vaccination. The new definition expands precaution to include “any condition

that might confuse diagnostic accuracy” as well as relevant family medical history (CDC,

2018b). California’s repeal adopted this language in their legislation 17, which may have had the

effect of granting physicians broader discretion in providing medical waivers.

         A more concerning possibility for the rise in medical exemptions could be related to

parents seeking out physicians who are willing to exercise their discretion to grant medical

exemptions to children who are generally ineligible for medical waivers. Consistent with this



17   SB 277, 2015-2016 Leg, Reg Sess (Ca 2015)
                                                 27
account, our analysis reveals that the largest increases in medical exemptions occurred in

counties that had high rates of nonmedical exemptions prior to the repeal (see Figure 4).

Moreover, exemption rates before and after the policy change remain geographically clustered in

certain counties. Therefore, even if part of the increase in medical exemptions is explained by

movement among those with genuine contraindications, the concentration of medical exemptions

in certain areas suggests that parents may be finding illegitimate ways of obtaining medical

waivers for their children.



Policy Implications

       The potential to substitute between exemption types limits both the short-term and long-

run benefits of the repeal. Our findings reveal that immediately following the policy change, the

magnitude of the increase in medical exemptions accounted for nearly two-thirds of the decline

in nonmedical exemptions. The evidence suggesting that parents can successfully obtain medical

exemptions in place of nonmedical exemptions has major policy implications for the state of

California and other states looking to tighten their immunization policies.

       Policymakers and public health professionals may need to consider strategies to enhance

monitoring of physician allowances of medical exemption waivers. Similar action, such as the

monitoring of physician prescribing practices, has been undertaken in recent years in response to

the opioid epidemic (CDC, 2017b). Immunization departments could consider a similar review

process to help ensure that medical exemptions are being approved for genuine

contraindications. Overall, our research findings underscore important policy considerations for

the design and implementation of state vaccination laws in the future.




                                                28
Public Health Implications

       Beyond fostering compliance, tightening the requirements around medical waivers will

also aid in promoting public policies that protect public health. Our results indicate an inverse

relationship between the availability of nonmedical exemptions and rates of immunization

coverage. Moreover, “hotspots” with a large concentration of exemptions may be prone to future

outbreaks of vaccine-preventable disease. Recent outbreaks from California and Washington

State have demonstrated the risks of maintaining low levels of immunization coverage in

counties and schools. The observed clustering of both medical and non-medical exemptions in

certain California counties following the repeal suggest that certain areas remain

disproportionately susceptible to future outbreaks of disease.



Conclusion

       In summary, our findings suggest that the removal of nonmedical exemptions in

California was initially effective in increasing vaccination rates, but the substitution between

exemption types may render the repeal partially ineffective in improving immunization coverage

and preventing VPDs over time. As a result, the availability and concentration of exemptions

from vaccination increases the vulnerability of certain regions to outbreaks of disease. A better

understanding of the response to California’s repeal of nonmedical exemptions serves to inform

future vaccination policies aimed at enhancing immunization coverage. Follow-up research

should be directed towards identifying the mechanisms facilitating the rise in medical

exemptions in California, and towards confirming the relationship between exemptions from

vaccination (both medical and nonmedical) and outbreaks of vaccine preventable disease.

Notes: Difference-in-differences estimates of the effect of repeal of nonmedical exemptions on childhood vaccination rates
and vaccination exemptions. Regressions include county and year fixed effects, county socio-economics time varying
characteristics, and rates of vaccine preventable disease cases in the previous year. Standard errors are clustered at the
county level. *, **, *** indicates statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% level.

  1- Additional Graphs and Tables for Results Presented in the Paper
  Table A1 presents the coefficients on covariates from DiD regressions presented in Panel A
  of Table 3, and Table A2 presents the covariate coefficients from Panel B of Table 3. Figure
  A1 presents the event analysis from the unbalanced panel. There is some fluctuation in
  vaccination rates during the pre-treatment period, which is likely noise, followed by a
  substantial increase in vaccination rates after the repeal of nonmedical exemptions.
  Nonmedical exemptions were rising from year -7 to -3, followed by a modest decline in year
  -2. There was a substantial decline after the repeal of nonmedical exemptions. Medical
  exemptions were constant during the pre-treatment period, and increased significantly after
  the repeal.


  2- Correlation Coefficients between CDC VPD Incidence and Google Search
  Table A3 presents the Pearson’s correlation coefficients between CDC incidence rates and
  Google search rates. The correlation between the two measures is generally low when we
  restrict the measure to any specific disease. However, when all the VPDs are lumped
  together, the correlation coefficients are sizable.

Figure A1- Event Study: Effect of the Repeal of Nonmedical Exemption on Childhood
Vaccination Rates and Exemptions- Unbalanced Panel
Leads and Lags regression of vaccination rates and exemption rates in California, versus all other states in the study
(see Table 1) over 2008-2017. Regressions include county and year fixed effects, and socio-economic variables at
the county or state level. y-axis shows coefficients on lead and lag dummies; vertical bars show 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) around coefficients, using standard errors clustered on county. Coefficient for year -1 is set to zero.

Panel A- MMR Vaccination




Panel B- DTP Vaccination
Panel C- Polio Vaccination




Panel D- Hepatitis B Vaccination
Panel E- Exemptions
